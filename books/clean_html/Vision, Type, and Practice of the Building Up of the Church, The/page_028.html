<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">NEEDING TO CARE FOR THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S HOUSE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 2:17; 2 Cor. 11:28; 1 Cor. 3:16-17; Hag. 1:2-11</h1>
<p>We will begin this chapter by considering two portions in the Scriptures. The first portion, John 2:17, says that the Lord was devoured by the zeal of God&rsquo;s house. The second portion, 2 Corinthians 11:28, says that the crowd of cares that daily pressed on the apostle Paul was his anxious concern for all the churches. When the Lord was on the earth, the center of His work was to build a house for God. Hence, He was devoured by the zeal of God&rsquo;s house. Likewise, when the apostles were working for the Lord on the earth, the center of their work was to build up the house of God. The apostles labored for the building up of the house of God, and their hearts were anxious for all the churches; they daily bore the burden of all the churches. In 2 Corinthians the apostle Paul was not referring to the cares of individual saints but to the cares of all the churches. He had an anxious concern for all the churches. Although caring for the churches includes caring for the saints, there is a great difference between caring for the churches and caring for the saints individually.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARING FOR GOD&rsquo;S NEED</h2>
<p>According to my observation, most of God&rsquo;s children listen to His words in the same way that unbelievers listen to the gospel. Most believers take care of their personal needs and consider themselves to be the center and the starting point. They happily receive messages concerning God&rsquo;s comforting, visitation, deliverance, peace, and prosperity. They also respond to messages concerning how to overcome, be spiritual, be sanctified, be well pleasing to God, or grow in life. However, not many respond to or are interested in a message concerning God&rsquo;s need for a house or for men to be built up as His resting place. This is because human beings always care for their personal needs. Concerning both the material realm and the spiritual realm, human beings are selfish and always want to gain something for themselves instead of considering what God desires.</p>
<p>Hence, rarely in Christian meetings is a message spoken concerning the need of God. Rarely is there a message that says God needs man, requires something of man, and wants to gain something from man. Nearly every sermon and Christian book takes care of man&rsquo;s need of God&rsquo;s salvation, deliverance, blessing, grace, and visitation. We agree that these needs are real. From the negative point of view, God&rsquo;s work and His speaking are concerning man&rsquo;s need, but from the positive point of view, they are concerning His need. God needs man, and He needs to gain something constituted of man. God&rsquo;s need is greater than man&rsquo;s need and has existed in the universe since eternity past. Our need simply reflects God&rsquo;s need. Our dissatisfaction reflects His dissatisfaction, and our need for rest and joy reflects His need for rest and joy.</p>
<p>Both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament there is a picture that portrays the principle of man&rsquo;s need reflecting God&rsquo;s need. The picture in the Old Testament is in Genesis 28, where a wandering man met a God who had no resting place. The picture in the New Testament is in John 4, where a thirsty Savior met a thirsty sinner. These two pictures show that man&rsquo;s condition reflects God&rsquo;s condition.</p>
<p>As God&rsquo;s redeemed people, we need to realize that our suffering pain within indicates that God is also suffering and that our being satisfied and joyful mean that God also feels satisfied and joyful. Therefore, our spiritual condition is a measure and reflection of how much of God we have gained. By looking at our condition, we can know God&rsquo;s feeling. It is regrettable that we often take care of only our needs, not God&rsquo;s need. If we want to be Christians who match God&rsquo;s desire and meet His need in this age, we cannot be trapped in ourselves. We must come out of ourselves to care for God&rsquo;s need; otherwise, we will never be built by God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARING FOR THE BUILDING UP OF GOD&rsquo;S HOUSE<br />
TO RECEIVE THE BLESSING</h2>
<p>God desires that we come out of ourselves and our selfishness in order to care for the building up of His house. Those who are spiritually experienced know that God will care for us if we are willing to take care of others for His building. But if we do everything for ourselves and take care only of ourselves, we will not be built up in God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Strong instead of Weak</h2>
<p>A brother who prays continually to the Lord for victory and strength but does not care for others will get weaker and have more failures. If, by the mercy of God, he learns to set aside his weaknesses and failures in order to care for the needs of others, he will gradually find that he will be supplied and strengthened regardless of whether others receive help from his visitation. By caring for others, he takes care of the building up of God&rsquo;s house; therefore, God will care for him. This is a spiritual principle.</p>
