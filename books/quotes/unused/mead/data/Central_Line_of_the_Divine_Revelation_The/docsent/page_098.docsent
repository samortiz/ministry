   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Gospel of John speaks of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 1:14 says that Christ came as the incarnated One, full of grace and reality, and verse 16 says that we have all received of His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This shows us that Christ came in incarnation for one thing: that we may receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is abstract and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The mystery of God is Christ Col 2:2 , and this Christ became incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Colossians 2:9 says, "For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ as the mystery of God in a bodily way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ's coming as the embodiment of God may be compared to serving water in a glass.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the water is in the water pipes, it is not possible to drink it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But when it is served in a glass, it is easy to take it in. Christ came in the way of incarnation in order that we may receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Word was God, and the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality, and of His fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Gospel of John concerns the Triune God, God in His trinity, becoming the riches as the fullness that He may give, impart, and dispense Himself to us on His side, and that we may receive the Triune God on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is dispensing and we are receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Each of the four Gospels presents a particular aspect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Matthew presents Christ as the King; Mark presents Christ as a Servant; Luke presents Christ as a man; and John presents Christ as God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Gospel of John tells us that Christ is the way, the reality, and the life 14:6 ; the light 8:12 ; the resurrection 11:25 ; and the great I Am 8:58 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>None of the other Gospels speaks in such a particular way concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the Gospel of John is very mysterious, it does contain two definite and solid points: one concerns the Triune God's giving, imparting, and dispensing of Himself into us, and the other concerns our receiving of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Among the four Gospels, only John says that God gave Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God gives Himself to us in His trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He gives Himself to us as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God is triune for the purpose of giving Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit 2 Cor 13:14 are for God's dispensing, for His giving of Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If God were not the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, He would have no way to give Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The New Testament tells us that we believe into the Son to receive the Son John 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We receive the Son because through His death and resurrection the Son has become the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the New Testament also tells us to receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John 20:22 says, "And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Galatians 3:2 Paul said, "Did you receive the Spirit out of the works of law or out of the hearing of faith?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The receiving of the Son and the receiving of the Spirit are not two receivings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To receive the Son is to receive the Spirit because the Son today is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Likewise, to receive the Spirit is to receive the Son because the Spirit today is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we receive the Son, we also receive the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First John 2:23 says, "Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jesus said, "I and the Father are one" John 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since the Son and the Father are one, when we receive the Son, we also receive the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jesus also said, "Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me" 14:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Father and the Son coinhere; They cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, when we receive one, we receive the other.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The way to receive the Triune God is not to receive the Father directly, but to receive the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The receiving of the Son is actually the receiving of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we have the Son and the Spirit, we have the Father.</S>
