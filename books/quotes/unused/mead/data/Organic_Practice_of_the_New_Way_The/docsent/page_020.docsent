   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I know that you have all heard messages recently concerning the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, tonight I want to fellowship a little concerning the secret of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We know that to do anything, there is the need to have the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Otherwise, one will labor in vain and not succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, I will do my best to show you point by point the crucial items of this new way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>GOD VISITING MAN AND</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO HIM In the Old Testament</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although the term "the new way" has been with us since October 1984, for the last four years or longer, most of the brothers and sisters still have a natural understanding concerning the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Their understanding is not deep.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They think that the new way is to change the method of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Formerly we invited people to come to listen to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now we preach by visiting people instead.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, we have to realize that this way has not been invented by us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather it has been discovered by us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the Bible the first one to preach the gospel by visiting people was God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When Adam, the man created by God, was tempted to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, his eyes became opened; he began to know his own shame, and he made an apron out of fig leaves and hid among the trees in the garden to avoid the face of Jehovah God Gen 3:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that time, God did not give him up.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He came to seek after him and preached the gospel to him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God was not inviting people to come to Him in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, He came personally from heaven to earth and came to Eden where Adam was, and He called, "Where art thou?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Gen 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This was God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It was God knocking at the door of Adam's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although the words, "Where art thou?" sound simple, the meaning is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not a question of where you are geographically, but a question of where you are before God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God wants to show you that today you are in the place of condemnation by God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You are in a place of being lost, the place right at the portal of the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>That is why God came to visit you and to preach the gospel to you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In God's first visit, His gospel was only a promise; there was no fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He said to the deceiving snake, "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel" Gen 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the promise contained in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The main focus is the seed of the woman, who is Jesus, the One begotten of the virgin Mary in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, God did not fulfill the promise at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After two thousand years, at the time of Abraham, God promised to give to Abraham the good land and through him to bless all the families of the earth Gen 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What God promised to Abraham was the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He was confirming His original promise.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After another two thousand years, which was four thousand years after man's creation, a messenger of the Lord appeared one day to a righteous man, Joseph, in a dream and said, "And she Mary will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus....and they shall call His name Emmanuel" Matt 1:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It was by then that God's promise to Adam was fulfilled.</S>
