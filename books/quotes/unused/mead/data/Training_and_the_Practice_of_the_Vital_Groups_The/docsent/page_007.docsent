   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first crucial point of the major items of the Lord's recovery is the participation in the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to participate in, to partake of, to enjoy, the very Triune God who has gone through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These are the processes of the Triune God, and today we enjoy Him according to what Paul said in 2 Corinthians 13:14: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not just the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, but the love, the grace, and the fellowship are with us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is love, He became grace, and He is grace to us through the fellowship of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These are His processes.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Full Experience of the Consummated Compound Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today Christians know the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, but very few know that the Spirit of God today is the consummated compound Spirit. d.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Absolute Living by the Eternal Life</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The overcomers are also here for the recovery of the absolute living by the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We Christians possess the human life and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The problem is the life by which we live.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should live by the divine life, but instead we live by our human life much of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the sisters go shopping, is that by the divine life?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Is the way that we comb our hair by the divine life?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do the elders practice their eldership by the human life or by God's divine life?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the elders practiced their eldership even fifty percent by the divine life, this would be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am always checking in my home, in dealing with my wife, in contacting my grandchildren, and in contacting the saints is this by the divine life or just by my life?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to learn to do something higher than ethical conduct, such as not losing our temper by the exercise of our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some old people have learned how to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not so easy for them to lose their temper, but this is not by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, we should exercise our spirit to restrain our temper by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should live by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With the divine life, there is no loss of temper.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may behave ourselves when we are in the meeting, but this may be merely according to our carefulness and not by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I say this because after the meeting many people become careless in the way that they talk and act.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible, the New Testament, shows us clearly that every city should have only one church, just like a husband should have only one wife Rev 1:11; Acts 8:1; 13:1 .</S>
