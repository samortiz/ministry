<P>To be attracted and captivated is to be charmed. People often asked us, "Who has captivated you? Wake up!" Once we are charmed by the Lord, we are charmed forever, so it is difficult for us to be awakened. This may be illustrated by a male and a female falling in love at first sight; the male is charmed by the female, and the female is attracted and captivated by the male. Likewise, the Lord must have had an indescribable sweetness and aroma emanating from Him in His humanity. If we had been with the Lord at that time, we also would have been "foolishly" charmed by Him.</P><P>Peter was charmed by the Lord to such an extent that although he was rebuked by the Lord frequently, he still determined to follow Him. The Lord's frequent rebuking could not make him go away. Today I dare not speak strong words to the co-workers and elders. If my rebuke is strong, I am afraid that they will not be able to take it and will quit. However, Peter was thick-skinned. He had been rebuked by the Lord many times, but he still followed Him. On the night of His betrayal, the Lord said to the disciples, "You will all be stumbled because of Me this night." Then Peter answered and said to Him, "If all will be stumbled because of You, I will never be stumbled" (Matt. 26:31-33). And the Lord said to him, "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to have you all to sift you as wheat. But I have made petition concerning you that your faith would not fail." Peter said, "Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death." But the Lord said, "I tell you, Peter, a rooster will not crow today until you deny three times that you know Me" (Luke 22:31-34). Not only did Peter disbelieve this word, but he even said, "Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You" (Matt. 26:35). Later, while Peter was sitting in the courtyard of the high priest, a little servant girl came to question him. Because of her questioning, Peter denied the Lord. At that time the Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter, remembering the Lord's word to him, went outside and wept bitterly (Luke 22:54-62).</P><P>After Peter denied the Lord, the Lord could have forgotten about him. However, the Lord did not forget him. On the morning of the Lord's resurrection, an angel said to several women, "Go, tell His disciples and Peter..." (Mark 16:7). Also, the Lord personally told Mary the Magdalene, "Go to My brothers..." (John 20:17). The Lord called His disciples "brothers" and particularly mentioned Peter's name. In this way He captivated Peter.</P><P>The Lord Jesus must have possessed some aromatic virtues in His humanity that could attract and captivate people. Otherwise, there could not have been so many people who would follow Him. Among them, there were even a number of noble women who cared only for the Lord and who simply followed Him continually for three and a half years (Luke 8:1-3). Sometimes when the Lord spoke certain words that were in another realm, the divine and mystical realm, His disciples could not understand or apprehend them because they had not yet entered into that realm. It was not until after the Lord's resurrection, when they had been regenerated, that they understood what the Lord had told them before (John 16:13; cf. 2:22).</P><P>Christ expressed His aromatic virtues by which He attracted and captivated people, not by living His human life in the flesh but by living His divine life in resurrection. He was in the flesh, but He did not live by His human life in His flesh; rather, He lived by His divine life in His resurrection. Today, as God-men, by which life do we live? No doubt, we are all in the flesh. Nevertheless, we can get out of the realm of the flesh and enter into resurrection to live by the divine life in resurrection, that is, in the divine and mystical realm.</P><P>Today the kind of living we have depends upon the kind of life by which we live in our physical body. We must not live by the human life but by the divine life. Galatians 2:20 says, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." This means that we should not live the life of the old "I" but the life of the new "I." Dear brothers, we cannot listen to these detailed points and simply let them go. May the Lord cover me. It is after I have studied these things for several decades that I can be led by the Lord to put them into writing. You need to actually experience these things.</P>
