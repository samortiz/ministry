   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Holy Spirit in Making Man Holy</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the time of the conception and birth of Christ, the term Holy Spirit was used Luke 1:35; Matt 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This title of the Spirit is related to holiness, sanctification, and separation unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through the Holy Spirit something in man is sanctified, made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>D. The Spirit of Jesus in Suffering</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Greek, Acts 16:7 speaks of the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord s life on earth was a life of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, the title the Spirit of Jesus refers in particular to the Spirit in relation to the Lord s suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>E. The Spirit of Christ in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Romans 8:9-11 Paul speaks of the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the context of these verses, the Spirit of Christ is related mainly to Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>F. The Spirit of Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>in His Suffering and in His Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have seen that in 1:19 Paul speaks of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since the Spirit of Jesus has particular reference to the Lord s suffering, and the Spirit of Christ, to His resurrection, the Spirit of Jesus Christ is related both to suffering and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In his imprisonment Paul was enjoying the Spirit both as the Spirit of Jesus in suffering and as the Spirit of Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As he was suffering, Paul was enjoying Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since he was experiencing both suffering and resurrection, to him the Spirit was the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>G. The Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>the All-inclusive Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 7:39 says, But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This verse speaks of the Spirit, telling us that before the Lord Jesus was crucified and resurrected, the Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit of God was there from the beginning Gen 1:1-2 , but the Spirit as the Spirit of Jesus Christ was not yet at the time of John 7:39, because the Lord had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After His resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even though, before the Lord s death and resurrection, the Spirit of God was the Spirit of Jehovah and the Holy Spirit, the Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This term the Spirit is used often by Paul in his Epistles and by John in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead of saying the Spirit of God or the Holy Spirit, Paul often said the Spirit the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>H. The Compound Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Typified by the Compound Ointment</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The term compound Spirit cannot be found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the reality of this aspect of the Spirit is found in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The same is true of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although this term cannot be found in the Bible, it cannot be reasonably denied that the Bible reveals that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Matthew 28:19 speaks of baptizing people into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, a clear indication that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Another indication is 2 Corinthians 13:14, which speaks of the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>. Based upon the fact that, according to the Bible, God is triune, the term Trinity is used.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the same principle, based upon the facts in Scripture, we may properly speak of the Spirit as the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to Exodus 30:23-24, a hin of olive oil was compounded with four spices to produce the holy anointing oil, the holy ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In typology, oil signifies the Spirit of God, and the compound ointment, the oil blended with four spices, signifies the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through a compounding process, the oil became an ointment and was used to anoint the tabernacle and everything related to it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even the priests were anointed with this holy ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before Exodus 30, this compound ointment was not yet, but after Exodus 30, such an ointment was definitely in existence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In like manner, before Christ was crucified, resurrected, and glorified, the Spirit as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But through the process of Christ s crucifixion and resurrection, the Spirit of God, typified by the oil, became the compound Spirit, typified by the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The four spices used to make the ointment in Exodus 30 typify the effectiveness of Christ s death, the sweetness of His death, the power of His resurrection, and the fragrance of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before Christ s crucifixion and resurrection, the Spirit of God did not have these four elements.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But after Christ s resurrection, these elements were compounded into the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God became the Spirit, the compound Spirit.</S>
