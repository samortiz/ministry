   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PROVING AND DISCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regarding the Lord s supper, Paul uses two crucial words: prove and discern.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 28 says, But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To prove ourselves is to check whether we are eating the bread and drinking the cup in a way that is worthy or in a way that is unworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Paul wrote this Epistle, some of the believers at Corinth ate the Lord s supper in an unworthy way, not realizing that the cup and the bread were uncommon and different from ordinary food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must realize that the cup signifies the blood the Lord shed on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, we should not drink it in a common, ordinary way, but drink it in a way which shows that we realize that it is different from ordinary drink.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should take the bread in the same manner.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, we reject the superstitious Catholic teaching of transubstantiation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to this heretical teaching, the bread and the wine in the cup actually become the body and blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although we reject transubstantiation, we must realize as we drink the cup and eat the bread that these are solemn, holy, and divine signs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The cup signifies the precious blood our dear Lord shed on the cross for our sins, and the bread signifies the body He gave for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we should not treat these signs in a careless manner.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we eat and drink carelessly, then we partake of the Lord s supper in an unworthy way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to prove ourselves to be sure that we are not unworthy to partake of the Lord s supper.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This proving ourselves is that we may be worthy to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second crucial word used by Paul is discern.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 29 says, For he who is eating and drinking, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have pointed out that this is the discerning both of the Lord s physical body and also of the mystical Body for the carrying out of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Proving ourselves is for the remembrance of the Lord; discerning the Body is mainly for the carrying out of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever we come to the Lord s table, we should not just enjoy the Lord; we should also remember Him by proving ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must ask if we are living in a way that is worthy for us to eat the Lord s supper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should never take the Lord s blood and body in a careless manner.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, we should realize that the signs on the table signify the precious blood and body of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we must ask ourselves if we live and behave in a way that is worthy of our eating this supper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the same time we must discern whether the bread on the table signifies the unique mystical Body of Christ or if it signifies a division.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the bread signifies a certain divisive group or denomination, we should not take it, for we discern the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To discern the Body in this way is to recognize that it is utterly distinct from anything divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We discern the Body in such a way for the carrying out of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although we are still small in number, the angels and demons know that our standing is different from that of divisive Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, deep within we have the assurance that we are discerning the Body for the carrying out of God s administration on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are also the heavenly television reflecting on earth what Christ is doing in the heavens for the divine administration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Others may oppose us, argue with us, and vindicate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But deep within their conscience they do not have the assurance that they are discerning the unique mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Praise the Lord, we have this assurance!</S>
