   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Tongues Not Necessary Evidence</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some Christians always insist that speaking in tongues is a necessary manifestation evidence of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But with two of the five cases in Acts the Samaritans and Saul of Tarsus nothing is mentioned about speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Students of the Scripture admit that many times what God does not mention is more meaningful than what He does mention.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With two of these five cases, no specific manifestation is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is an indication that a tongue is not the only or the necessary manifestation of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even with the other cases, there is no proof that all the believers spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The "tongues" spoken in Acts 2:4 were dialects vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>6, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The disciples were Galileans v. 7 , yet they spoke the different foreign dialects of the attendants who came from various parts of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is strong proof that tongue-speaking must be an understandable language, not merely a voice or sound uttered by the tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Based on this we must say that nearly all of today's so called tongue-speaking is not according to the truth of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. Experiencing the Accomplished Fact 1.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Accomplished Once for All</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have given many lessons in the effort to point out what the Triune God has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Triune God in the Son became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That was the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The incarnation has been accomplished once for all, and there is no need for it to be repeated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Likewise, Christ was crucified and died once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, He was resurrected, He breathed Himself as the life-giving Spirit into His disciples, He ascended, and He poured out Himself as the all-inclusive Spirit once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ has accomplished all these things, and He has accomplished them once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now all these matters are included in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No Need to Analyze</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no need for us to analyze what we receive through calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not ask ourselves, "Have I received the essential Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Has the economical Spirit fallen upon me?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps I have the essential Spirit within me, but I wonder if I have the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Maybe the economical Spirit will leave me, although the essential Spirit will not leave.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the economical Spirit leaves, when will He come back?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not a healthy practice to analyze these matters in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is also no need for us to seek feelings, manifestations of signs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should never trust in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we seek them, we have an evil heart of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are trying to prove or tempt the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Relation to the Body</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Word of God tells us that the baptism in the Holy Spirit is an accomplished fact for us to apply.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We simply need to believe this and enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are, however, some conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must be right with the Body of Christ and stand in it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since the baptism in the Holy Spirit has been accomplished upon the Body of Christ and still exists upon it, we must be properly related to the Body and maintain this proper relationship with the Body in order to be one with it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Of course, we ourselves must get right with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Any sin, anything wrong between us and God, must be thoroughly dealt with through the cleansing of the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Nothing between the Lord and us should be allowed to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But we must also get right with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Anything that frustrates, distracts, or separates us from the Body must be fully dealt with and real oneness and harmony maintained with the Body and its members.</S>
