<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Revelation 13:12</H2><P>"And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his sight, and he causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose death stroke was healed."</P><P>The second beast works by utilizing the first beast's authority. The verb "causes" is in the active voice. That the second beast causes is mentioned a total of eight times in this book. The Holy Spirit is the power of the Godhead; He is the Executor. In a corresponding way, the false prophet is the same. The "worship" here is a system of coercion. This is different from the worshipping referred to in 13:4, which is voluntary.</P><P>There is much evidence to show that the first beast is Nero, raised from the dead, and the second beast is the traitor Judas, raised from the dead.</P><P>Concerning the first beast's being the resurrected Caesar Nero, more proofs will be listed later in this book. Let us first consider the second beast. Acts 1:20, Psalm 69:25, and Psalm 109:8 refer to Judas. Acts 1:20 quotes from Psalms 69 and 109. In Psalm 109:6, Satan stands at Judas's right hand; this has not yet been fulfilled. Previously, Satan only entered Judas's heart (John 13:27). It must be at the time of Revelation 13:12 that Satan begins to stand at his right hand. Acts 1:25 says, "To go to his own place." In the whole Bible, only Judas is described as going to his own place. All the others are said either to have been gathered to their people or to have gone to Hades. Judas seems to have a special place, a place reserved for his use alone. The entire New Testament only speaks of "the son of perdition" twice: once in John 17:12, which indicates Judas explicitly, and once in 2 Thessalonians 2:3, which indicates Antichrist. If the first beast, who is called the son of perdition, is Antichrist, who else can the second beast, who is also called the son of perdition, be, except Judas? In John 6:70 the Lord says that Judas is a devil. So then, who else besides Judas can be the one in this triune counterfeit?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Revelation 13:13</H2><P>"And he does great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth before men." </P><P>The greatest miracle is to cause fire to come down from heaven to the earth. Probably because of the fact that the two witnesses can cause fire to come down, this one causes fire to come down and performs even more miracles.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Revelation 13:14-15</H2><P>"And he deceives those who dwell on the earth on account of the signs which he was given power to do before the beast, commanding those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast, who had the stroke of the sword and revived. And power was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast that the image of the beast might even speak and cause whoever would not worship the image of the beast to be killed."</P><P>Here is the totality of all future idols. This image seems to somewhat resemble that other man. After the Lord resurrected, His wounds remained, and He showed them to Thomas (John 20:27). The beast's sword wound also remains, causing people to believe that he is resurrected from the dead.</P><P>"Breath" here ("life" in the KJV) can also be translated "spirit." Once the spirit is given, there is, of course, life right away. This beast has three characteristics: (1) he has life; (2) he can speak; and (3) he can cause those who will not worship the image of the beast to be killed. This is different from what is written in Psalm 135:15-17 and Jeremiah 10:4-5. In ancient times the idols had mouths that could not speak, eyes that could not see, ears that could not hear, and were dead. But in the future it will not be the same. How does the image of the beast kill people? Of course, we do not know. It may be that the image of the beast passes death sentences upon people so that they will be killed, or it may be that the image of the beast itself has some kind of mechanism with which to kill people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Revelation 13:16</H2><P>"And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the freemen and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead." </P><P>The "mark" here must be obvious. Since the mark is sealed on the body and the body is physical, the mark must also be physical. When people buy things, it will be easily recognized. Therefore, it must be obvious. Satan seals people. This is to say that their spirit, soul, and body belong to him. These must be those who openly follow him, and this must be something that cannot be hidden. Perhaps women receive the mark on their right hands and men receive it on their foreheads. There will definitely not be any Christians among these people.</P>
