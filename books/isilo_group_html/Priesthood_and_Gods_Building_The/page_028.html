<p>When God created man, He put man in a position to function as a priest. God created man in His image and according to His likeness and granted him to have dominion (Gen. 1:26). Then God put man in the garden of Eden, which contained the tree of life and a flowing river (2:9-10). These actions revealed His desire. It is as if God were saying, &ldquo;Come and eat! Come and drink! I am before you in the form of food. I do not want you to merely worship and exalt Me. I want you to eat and drink Me. You need to contact Me, receive Me, and absorb Me, just as you eat food and drink water. I want to enter into you to be your life and nature. I want to be absorbed by you, to saturate you, and to flow out from you so that My life and nature are expressed outwardly with My image and glory. If you contact me in this way, you will represent Me and reign for Me.&rdquo; This picture is a portrayal of the function of a priest. As soon as God created man, God revealed the matter of being a priest to him.</p>
<p>We often speak of drawing near to God and fellowshipping with God, but what does this mean intrinsically? Hebrews 10:19-20 speaks of drawing near to God and fellowshipping with God in relation to entering into the Holy of Holies. According to the type in the Old Testament, only priests could enter into the Holy of Holies (Exo. 28:1, 35; Num. 18:1, 7). A person who was not a priest could not enter into the Holy of Holies. This shows that those who draw near to God are those who enter into the Holy of Holies as priests.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN FAILING TO FUNCTION AS A PRIEST</h2>
<p>When a person draws near to God, contacts God, absorbs God, and allows God to fill, saturate, and flow through him, he is a priest. From the day of Adam&rsquo;s creation, God intended for him to be a priest, but Adam failed. When he fell, the whole adamic race fell with him. The failure of Adam was the failure of the adamic race. When the descendants of Adam failed in Adam and with Adam, the whole adamic race lost its position to be priests of God.</p>
<p>Because of this failure and out of this fallen race, God chose Abraham. God wanted him to rise up and be a person living before Him. To Abraham, God said, &ldquo;Walk before Me&rdquo; (Gen. 17:1). Walking before God means to live before God, to contact God, to fellowship with God, and to allow God to flow through. According to Genesis, on several occasions Abraham built an altar and offered sacrifices (12:7-8; 13:4, 18; 22:9). As a sacrifice-offering person, Abraham was a priest who lived before God, fellowshipped with God, and allowed God to flow through him. The history of Abraham shows that God gained a priest out of the adamic race that had rejected God, a man who desired God, fellowshipped with God, and allowed God to flow through him. Abraham was a priest.</p>
<p>Jacob also was a priest. In his youth Jacob was crafty and well able to supplant, but in his latter years he was truly a priest; he was transformed into Israel, the prince of God (32:28; 35:10; 47:7). He bore the image of God, and he represented the authority of God. When Jacob&rsquo;s descendants were coming out of Egypt, God said, &ldquo;You shall be to Me a kingdom of priests&rdquo; (Exo. 19:6). The word <em>priests</em> denotes drawing near to God and allowing God to fill and saturate; <em>kingdom</em> refers to reigning for Him and allowing God to reign. God desired that the children of Israel would be a kingdom of priests, bearing His image to express Him and exercising His authority to represent Him. However, the children of Israel failed in this matter. Consequently, God chose the house of Aaron from the tribe of Levi to be priests (32:22-29). Regrettably, even the priests of the house of Aaron failed to the extent that they bore only the name of priests but not the reality of the priesthood.</p>
<p>This history tells us that generation after generation of people failed to attain to God&rsquo;s goal. The created adamic race failed, the chosen descendants of Abraham failed, and the tribe of Levi and the house of Aaron also failed. Among all these generations, God&rsquo;s will did not have a free way, and His purpose remained unfulfilled.</p>
<p>In the New Testament age, however, the Spirit is leading the chosen descendants of Adam to believe in the Son, who has redeemed us through His blood and regenerated us with His life. Now, as redeemed and regenerated believers, we are in the new creation so that we can draw near to God and contact Him as a corporate priesthood, the church. Regrettably, even the church experienced failure and desolation. The desolation of the church ultimately reflects the fact that our fellowship with God can be cut off and that the flow of God&rsquo;s life can be cut off, causing us to lose His presence.</p>
<p>God is merciful, however, and we have seen some light and have received some measure of grace. Nevertheless, we need to confess that we are still short in our living before God and in our fellowship with God. We need to allow God to saturate and flow through us more so that He can be expressed and His authority can be exercised. We have yet to fully live the life of the priest and fulfill the ministry of the priest. Even though more grace is available to us, at the end of this age our priestly service of drawing near to God, fellowshipping with God, and allowing God to flow through us are not adequate.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
