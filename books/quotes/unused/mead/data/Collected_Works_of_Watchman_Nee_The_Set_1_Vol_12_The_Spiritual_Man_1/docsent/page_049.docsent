   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Soulish believers often live a kind of emotional life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before the believers become spiritual, the Lord often enables them to feel His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Soulish believers delight in this kind of feeling the most.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When they have such a feeling, they think that they have reached the supreme state and have made great strides on the way to spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although there are times that the Lord does not give them such a feeling, because they have not reached a complete life of faith, very often the Lord gives them the feeling of His presence in order to gradually train them not to rely on feelings but to depend on faith alone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, they do not understand the intention of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They think that when they have such a feeling, their spiritual condition is at the highest point; otherwise, they think it is at the lowest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A very common mark of soulish believers is talkativeness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not that they do not know that they should be taciturn, but when they are emotionally excited, they have a great urge to get into endless speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once they talk, they lack the power of self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Their mind seems to lose control when their mouth opens, pouring out endless words like an avalanche.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not that they have not considered what to speak but rather that once they speak they cannot restrain themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whatever they speak proceeds out from the thoughts which they have been thinking all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They know that they should not be garrulous, but once they indulge in speaking, they cannot withdraw.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, when other people talk too much, they realize that it is inappropriate, and they criticize secretly in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since their words are many, offense is unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They lose either harmony with others because of arguments or love because of criticism, or they even lose control of their heart because of talkativeness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since soulish believers are talkative, sudden thoughts surely come to them in their conversation, causing them to change topics or expand the thought in their conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although soulish believers know that saints should be godly and should not speak words of jesting, they always like to speak and to hear jokes when conversing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They like to hear any kind of lively or youthful talk, or whatever talk can cheer their mood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jesting is indispensable to soulish believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet this is not absolutely true, because sometimes they abhor ungodly talk, except that they cannot do so consistently.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever their emotion is stirred, inevitably they follow the way of merriment to pursue pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Soulish believers are fond of "pleasant looks" and have a concept of aesthetics.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They like to follow the artistic view of the worldly people and change their own taste accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They do not have the attitude of being dead toward the human concept of beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, it is unavoidable that they are often proud of having the view of an artist.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Soulish believers often act in extreme ways.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They go either to one extreme or the other.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They may either admire art extremely or not care for beauty at all.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even their shabby clothes may not bother them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead, they consider this as their suffering with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Little do they know that believers should pursue cleanliness not beauty .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Soulish believers who are intellectual express their being soulish by assuming themselves to be "Bohemians."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When there is a breezy morning or a moonlit night, they will invariably chant in a heroic or mournful tone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Oftentimes they grumble about their lives and even shed tears of anguish uncontrollably.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They love literature and admire its beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They also like to hum and intone as if by reciting some poems they have the marvelous feeling of transcending the worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They also enjoy traveling and the sights of mountains and rivers to thus be closer to nature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Very often they have the thought of escaping from the world and living in seclusion because they see the worsening condition of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While they are pondering such thoughts, they think how transcendent and how noble they are!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It seems that all the other believers are defiled and unbearably vulgar.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such believers often consider themselves very spiritual, not realizing how utterly soulish they are!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, it is very difficult for such soulish ones to enter into a wholly spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They are completely controlled by their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Their danger is that they are complacent and do not realize their peril.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After soulish believers have learned the doctrine concerning the differentiation between the spirit and the soul, they can easily understand such a teaching with their natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Spontaneously they can find many soulish activities in other people's lives and easily understand other's soulish acts and thoughts, but they do not realize that they are as soulish as the ones whom they accuse of being soulish and that they are actually no less soulish than others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Most soulish believers have a great deal of spiritual knowledge, but their experiences can never match what they know.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because they know much, they also condemn much in their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, criticizing others becomes a common characteristic of soulish believers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They receive grace to have knowledge, but unlike spiritual believers, they do not receive grace to have humility.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, there is a certain hardness in their dealings with people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To those who are closely associated with them, they give the impression of having a certain "stiffness," a hard shell.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They are not like spiritual believers whose outer shell has been broken so that they are approachable and kind to others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Regardless how much soulish believers give credit to the grace of God and give glory to God outwardly, all their thoughts are always centered on "self."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whether they consider themselves good or bad, their thoughts can never depart from themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They have not yet lost themselves in God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Soulish believers are very proud.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since their thoughts are always centered on themselves, they cannot help but be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What hurts them the most is being set aside either in work or in the evaluation of others.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is very unbearable to them when other people misunderstand them and talk about their shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They are not yet like their more spiritual brothers who gladly accept what God has arranged for them, whether exaltation or rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They are not willing to be despised by others, to appear inferior.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even when they have received more grace of God to know the actual condition of their natural life so that they realize how corrupt they are and humble themselves before God, even regarding themselves as the worst in the world, they think that they are more humble than others and boast in their humility!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Pride is often in the deepest part of their heart, unknown to others or even to themselves.</S>
