   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In God s salvation we are not only born of God to be His sons but also made heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ Rom 8:17: We are not heirs simply because we are children of God; rather, there is a condition for us to be heirs: After being born as children, we need to grow in life to become mature sons John 1:12-13; Rom 8:16, 14.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The so great a salvation mentioned in Hebrews 2:3 is able to save us to such an extent that it brings us into partnership with the Son in His appointment; thus, we share in whatever He inherits: Salvation is nothing less than the wonderful person of Christ Himself Luke 2:30; 3:6; 19:9: Christ Himself, as the most profound, marvelous, unlimited, immeasurable One, is our salvation.</S>
