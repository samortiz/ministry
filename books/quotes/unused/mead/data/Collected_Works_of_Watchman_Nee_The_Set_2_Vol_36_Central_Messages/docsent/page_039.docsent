   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Rock Being Peter's Confession</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church is built upon this rock, and this rock is Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The rock is also the revelation which God has given to man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, the rock is the confession which issues from those who have received the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to see.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But confession is also very important.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When our Lord was on earth, He said, "I am" John 8:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is pleased to hear us confess, "You are."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is always pleased to hear and accept our salutation when we say, "You are."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We say to the Lord, "You are Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a very important word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We declare, "Jesus is Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a very powerful declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes everything around us seems to be in confusion; Satan mocks us and tells us that we are through.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At such times, prayer may not work, and the best thing to do is to declare loudly, "Jesus is Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You will find that the difficulties are nothing and Satan's mockery is nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you are put into any trial, you should rise up to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may speak in your own room or in the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But wherever you are, you should say, "Jesus is Lord!" and tell Him, "You are!"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord likes to hear such a declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This will give us strength from within.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus likes to hear the words "You are!"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Otherwise, why would He have asked His disciples?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the disciples did not know the answer, what was the use of asking them?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If they knew the answer, what need was there for the Lord to ask them such a question?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus asked this question because He wanted Peter to speak out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to remember that the foundation of the church is not only built upon the revelation from God, but upon Peter's declaration of the revelation he received.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has revealed His Son to us and unveiled His masterpiece to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we speak out and confess this revelation from God, and when we confess that Jesus is the Son of God and the Christ, we have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is Christ's voice on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God allows the church to remain on earth as a declarer and a confessor of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was not enough for Peter to say in his heart, "I believe that the Lord is powerful, that He reigns, and that He is glorious."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was not enough for Peter to say to the Lord, "Lord, I believe You in my heart."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord asked, "Who do you say that I am?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"You" refers to the Lord's disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Who do you say...?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The disciples had to do one thing, which was to say, to speak with their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What should they say?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They should say who the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They should speak out the Lord Himself; they should say who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to pay attention to the phrase, "Who do you say that I am?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to remember that the church is built upon our confession of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord said, "Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we have not seen the relationship between the church and the gates of Hades, we will not realize the importance of speaking; we will think that believing in the heart or praying is all that is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if we see that the church is here to close the gates of Hades, we will realize that a declaration of who Jesus of Nazareth is is a declaration with life, with power, and with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some can testify that they have often encountered difficulties before the Lord, and they could not get through no matter how hard they tried to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seemed as if neither faith, prayer, nor supplications would work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But one day they stood up and said, "Lord, You are the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are the King!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You have trodden the devil under.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You are the One who has destroyed the work of the devil!"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When they declared this, the power came.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, the best prayer is not a supplication.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The best prayer is to say, "You are!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You are!"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This should be the church's declaration of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let me repeat this again: the church is not only built upon God's revelation, but also upon man's declaration of this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A declaration that comes as a result of a revelation has spiritual value to it; there is power to it, and it shakes Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We know that Peter was a talkative person.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord interrupted his speaking more than once.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But this time, He allowed Peter to go on and even called him blessed after he finished.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Peter's word represented the voice of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is a voice that heaven loves to hear and a voice that is hard to find on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is also a voice that Hades dreads to hear and a voice that God desires to find!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In our prayer meetings, in the bread-breaking meetings, and in our personal prayers, we should learn to say more and more, "You are!"</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord Himself declared on earth, "I am!"</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should gladly respond, "You are!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You are!"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There are no better words than these.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>"You are" is the foundation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The foundation of the church is built upon the Lord Himself; it is built upon God's revelation of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The foundation of the church is also built upon our declaration before men and the devil, a declaration of the Lord which comes as a result of our knowledge through revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After Peter declared, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God," the Lord Jesus said, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Simon is Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The prefix Bar means a son.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Barjona means the son of Jona.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord pointed out Peter's name and said, "Blessed are you," and He even mentioned Peter's father's name.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Simon who was so blessed was not any Simon, but Simon the son of Jona.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Following this, the Lord said, "You are Peter."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This shows us that this revelation is a personal one; it is absolutely personal.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This declaration and confession are also personal, absolutely personal.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Those who do not have such a revelation before the Lord and who do not have such a confession have no part in this blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In short, this rock signifies three things: 1 This rock is Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>2 This rock is the revelation of Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>3 This rock is also Peter's confession of Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When we combine these three aspects together, we have "this rock" that the Lord spoke of.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>THE CHURCH IS BUILT UPON THIS ROCK</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord Jesus said, "You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The name "Peter" means a little rock in the original language John 1:42 , while the word "rock" means a big rock.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Lord's choice of words here is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He was saying, "You are a little rock, and I will build My church upon this big rock."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The foundation of the church is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Christ is like a big rock.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The church is built upon Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>"You are Peter."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This means that "you are a little rock.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>You Peter are a part of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Lord showed us that He needs many little rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He will build His church with these many little rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>"This rock" is the big rock, which is the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>There is only one foundation, but there are many small rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We need to join with Peter to know who this Jesus of Nazareth is, and we need to join with Peter to confess who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The foundation of the church is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The church is built upon Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This building is still going on, even today.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>He is building the little rocks upon this foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If a man wants to be a useful vessel to the Lord, he must know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God and as the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We must not only see Him as the Savior, but as Christ and as the One appointed by God to accomplish His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The church must have this revelation, this testimony, and this declaration before the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>All the temptations of the devil and everything that death can do will fall before such a church.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The church overcomes all the power of Satan through its inward revelation and through the testimony of its mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Hallelujah, the gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Death is swallowed up by life because the Lord has built His church upon "this rock"!</S>
