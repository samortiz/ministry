A person who wants to be saved must first know the conditions and the basis of salvation. If you do not understand the basis of salvation you cannot know whether you are saved. Once I was in Amoy discussing the matter of salvation with a great merchant there. We discussed it from nine o'clock in the evening to half past eleven o'clock, but the matter was still not settled. All the time he dared not say that he had eternal life. He said, "Three months ago, someone came here to preach the gospel and said that those who believe have eternal life. At that time I believed, and I put aside my sins; I thought that I was saved. But a month later my faith was gone, and I fell into great sins again. Does this not mean that I became unsaved? Now you are here. When I heard your preaching, I was revived again. But I am afraid that after you leave, in one or two months, I will become cold and backslidden again and become unsaved like before. Therefore, I cannot say that I am saved." I showed him many verses from the Scriptures and told him that the Word of God cannot be wrong and that one only has to believe. He was still not clear. In the end, I stood up to say goodbye to him, "Sir, I have to leave now because tomorrow I have meetings and some guests are waiting to see me. Therefore, we cannot continue. But let me say a final word. Are you saved by yourself or by the Lord Jesus?" Having said that, I began to walk away. After taking two steps, he called me back. I asked him why. He said, "We have talked for three to four hours, and I was not clear. But now I am clear. Being saved does not depend on good deeds in the past, nor on the good deeds in the future, but rather on whether or not one believes that Jesus bore his sins and died for him. No matter how many sins one has, these sins have all been put upon Him. As long as a man will believe, he will be saved. We are not saved by ourselves. We cannot save ourselves. It is the Lord Jesus who has saved us. Why then should I still say that I am not saved?" Finally, this man knew that he was saved. How happy we both were! The few hours spent in discussions and reading of the Scriptures were all useless. But the one word at the end gave him the understanding.</P><P>Many believers do not say that they are saved because they do not understand the basis of salvation. They think that all the misconduct in the past is put on Jesus, but that if one misbehaves after he has believed, he will perish. This is to revert back to the Old Testament position. In the New Testament, one is first given the standing; by faith one is first filled with the new life and then one comes before God with a true heart in full assurance of faith. One does not come to God by doing good. Rather, one comes to God based on the position he has received. This position will never be lost. Today many do not have the joy of salvation because they are trying to preserve their ongoing salvation with good works. Salvation does not come through a lifetime of labor; that will not save a person. If you ask a genuinely saved person how he is saved, he will definitely answer, "It is Jesus who saves me. I do not have any ability to save myself. It is all from the Lord." Only this kind of person will always rejoice.</P><P>The thief who was crucified at the same time as Christ was being crucified was saved right there on the cross immediately after he accepted the Lord. His salvation was based fully on the substitutionary death of Jesus. Suppose he did not die right after he was saved; suppose he lived fifty more years and did the best work like Paul, stood firm like Peter, or had the greatest love like John. Suppose he had all the virtues of Paul, Peter, and John added together. Could any of these virtues render help to his salvation to paradise at all? Would they make him more worthy of his salvation? No, they would not. Even if the thief stopped being a thief, even if he lived to do good and save others, and even if he became as good as the apostles, that still would not form the basis for his salvation. The only basis is the Lord Jesus; salvation does not depend on the behavior of the believers. This is why a believer can say that he is saved. It is after a man is saved that he conducts himself like the Lord did, being good and holy.</P><P>Suppose a person falls into water and others on the banks  save him and bring him up with great difficulty. They give him artificial respiration, a change of clothes, a burning fire to warm him, and something to eat so that he can live. Suppose you were to ask him, "Where are you now? Are you on the ground?" If he answers, "Though I am not in the water, I still feel that I am in the water. If I say I am now on the ground, it is too proud. I can only hope that I am on the ground!" Would you say that such a person is humble? This is not humility. Christ has saved the believers, yet if we still say, "I dare not say that I am saved; I still feel that I am in hell," we are too unreasonable!</P><P>When a person genuinely believes in Jesus as his Savior and in God's putting all his sins upon Him, but still says that he is not saved, this person is not humble; he is rather ungrateful for the exceeding grace of the Lord! He does not acknowledge the great work of the Lord's redemption and is saying that the Lord cannot fully save him! A Christian with this kind of thought will never praise God! I have never seen such a one utter thanks and songs of praises from his mouth! He does not know where he is going. No wonder he cannot praise or give glory to God. A person going to hell or a person who does not know that he has eternal life surely cannot praise God. It is pitiful that the praises that are due do not exist in the mouths of many Christians! Only those who know that they are saved can praise and thank the Lord! Who will praise God in Hades? Hell is filled with curses! It never has a word of praise. If you do not praise God now, when will you praise Him?</P><P>Some people say, "There is a danger in saying that once a person believes, he has eternal life and is saved and will never perish, because if a person knows that he is saved anyway, he may do whatever he wants, not be careful about anything, or not have a fearful heart." Those who say this do not know God's way of salvation and grace. Please note that the salvation as recorded in the Scriptures includes objective and subjective aspects. The Lord was crucified on the cross. God said that those who believe in Him will not go to hell but are justified and fully saved because all their sins have been put on the cross, and their sins are fully forgiven. This is the objective aspect. At the same time, within the Lord's salvation, there is also the subjective work. He has crucified on the cross the life which once loved sin, filthiness, and uncleanness. At the same time, He has given us His life-the new life. This is subjective salvation. The Lord not only saves us objectively, but He Himself also regenerates us. We are not only forgiven but also regenerated. God has put a new life and a new spirit inside us. Every believer has the Holy Spirit living within him, so that he knows what is good, what should be done, and what is right. His life is a good and joyful one. There is no one whose sins have been forgiven and who has the life of God who will feel that a holy life is a suffering and is not good. Formerly he dared not commit evil openly because he was afraid of having a bad name or reputation. Now he does not commit evil because he knows that these are sins, and that the sins themselves and their nature are stinky and filthy. Now he sees sins as something repulsive. In addition, he has the Holy Spirit dwelling within him, and he dares not do evil.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 17: Notes on Scriptural Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
