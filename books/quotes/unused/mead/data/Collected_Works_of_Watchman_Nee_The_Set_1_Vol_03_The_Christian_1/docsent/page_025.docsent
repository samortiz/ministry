   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His heart was satisfied with the work he had patiently and carefully done.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because He was satisfied, He rested.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is God's rest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This brings us to the new heaven and new earth, the age of eternal rest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At that time, we will enter into God's rest Heb 4:3 .</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The second we receive when we learn of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our souls are full of passion, excitement, covetousness, sadness, irritation, and grief.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But when we consider the meekness and lowliness of the Lord, how He endured such contradiction of sinners against Himself, how He took the yoke upon Himself, and how he showed Himself as an example of a lamb, then we will no longer be weary and faint.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we learn of Him, we will find rest for our souls, a peaceful life, a life that does not strive, and a life that appreciates the will of God!</S>
