If you could rule your spirit, that means you are so strong. To rule your spirit is better than taking a city.<p>Proverbs 25:28 says, &#8220;He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.&#8221; If you cannot manage your spirit, that means you have been defeated like a city that has been broken down with all the walls torn down. Your protection is with your spirit and in your spirit.<h2 class=head1>A HAUGHTY SPIRIT</h2><p>Proverbs 16:18 says, &#8220;Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.&#8221; To be haughty in spirit, to be proud in spirit is awful. &#8220;Better it is to be of a humble spirit with the lowly&#8221; (Prov. 16:19).<h2 class=head1>A COLD SPIRIT</h2><p>We need a fervent spirit for the Lord, but sometimes for the understanding, we need a cold spirit (Prov. 17:27, lit.). It is easy for the sisters to be hot, to be fervent, but it is rather hard for them to be cold. For God&#8217;s interest we need to be fervent, on fire, but for understanding we need to be cold in the spirit. We need a cold spirit to understand the spiritual things.<h2 class=head1>OUR SPIRIT SUSTAINS US</h2><p>Proverbs 18:14 says, &#8220;The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity.&#8221; Infirmity here means illness. The spirit of a man will sustain his illness. When we are sick physically, if our spirit is weak, that is terrible. That is really serious. If we are strong in spirit, regardless of how ill we are in the body, our spirit can sustain the physical illness. &#8220;But a wounded spirit who can bear?&#8221; (Prov. 18:14). When your spirit is wounded, that is really serious.<h2 class=head1>TO ERR IN SPIRIT</h2><p>Isaiah 29:24 says, &#8220;They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding.&#8221; To err in another part of our being is not so serious, but if we err in the spirit, that is really serious.<h2 class=head1>PATIENT IN SPIRIT</h2><p>Ecclesiastes 7:8-9 says, &#8220;Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry.&#8221; If you could be patient and not hasty, you would be all right. Many times we are patient, but just patient in our emotions, not in the spirit. The people who are patient in their emotions eventually will be very impatient in their spirit. The real patience, the everlasting patience is in the spirit. We need to be patient in our spirit, not hasty in our spirit.<h2 class=head1>AN EXCELLENT SPIRIT</h2><p>Daniel 5:12 and 6:3 tell us that Daniel was a man with an excellent spirit. &#8220;Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him&#8221; (6:3).<h2 class=head1>TAKE HEED TO YOUR SPIRIT</h2><p>Finally, Malachi 2:15-16 tells us to take heed to our spirit. Brothers and sisters, take heed to your spirit. Don&#8217;t argue. Don&#8217;t excuse yourself. You have to take heed to your spirit. Your spirit is the source of your behavior. God cares for your spirit, and you have to take heed to it.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Our Human Spirit &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
