   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE SHINING THE GLORY OF THE NEW COVENANT 1 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:7-11, 18; John 17:1; Luke 24:26; Acts 3:15; Rom 6:4 TOUCHING THE INWARD REALITY OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In foregoing messages I have pointed out that if we would touch the meat in the Bible, we must go beyond the feathers and the skin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Along with many other things, the Bible has both an outward appearance and an inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, a human being has an outward appearance and also an inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you know a person merely according to his outward appearance, you actually do not know him at all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to know a person thoroughly, you need to know him according to his inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This requires that you spend much time with that person to know what he is like inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 5:16 Paul says, So that we, from now on, know no one according to flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To know others according to the flesh means to know them merely according to the outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul s desire was to know others according to the spirit, that is, according to the inner reality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was also the way Paul knew Christ: Even if we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that Paul knew Christ no longer according to the outward appearance, but according to the inward spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This principle applies also in our study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we would know the Bible, we must know not only the outward form of the Word, but also the inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was born into Christianity and as a little child learned the song, Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a good song; however, the truth contained in it is only a feather truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not even part of the skin in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many of the sermons given in today s Christian circles are either in the category of feathers or in the category of skin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Few messages given among Christians take the listeners deeper than the skin and help them touch the genuine meat of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Prior to World War II, books were still being published that contained some weighty messages dealing with the meat of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in recent years it has been extremely difficult to find newly published books of this kind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Throughout the years, I have been observing the situation among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have been especially interested to see what kind of books and articles have been published concerning spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to my observation, since 1945 few books touching the meat of the Bible have been published.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If others know of more books, I would appreciate knowing the titles and the authors.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul speaks of the shining of the glory of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is part of the meat of the Word; it is not feathers or skin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>GLORY AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is the glory of the new covenant?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In answer to this question, some may say that the shining of the glory of the new covenant is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Others may reply that it is resurrection, or Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is surely true to say that the glory of the new covenant is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this verse the preposition from is used twice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first time is in the phrase from glory to glory ; the second, in the phrase from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is a connection between from glory to glory and from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This connection is made apparent by Paul s use of the words even as.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that the matter of being from glory to glory is a matter that is from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This gives us the basis to say that glory is intimately related to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In fact, in this verse the glory is equal to the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 3:18 Paul says that we are being transformed into the same image.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we with unveiled face behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a result, we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence, transfigured, mainly by the renewing of our mind Rom 12:2 , into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Being transformed indicates that we are in the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The phrase from glory to glory means from one degree of glory to another degree.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This points to a continuing process in life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, the phrase from the Lord Spirit indicates that the process is proceeding from the Spirit.</S>
