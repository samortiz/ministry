   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the Likeness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Flesh of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do not mean He became a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible is very careful about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the Bible contained only John 1:14, we might think that He became a sinful person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the Bible also contains Romans 8:3, which says that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ became flesh, but He was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There was no sin in His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He had only the likeness, not the sinful nature, of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul composed this phrase of three words: likeness, flesh, and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To say only flesh of sin would indicate sinful flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Praise the Lord the Scripture adds in the likeness, indicating that in Christ s human nature there was no sin, even though that nature did bear the likeness, the appearance, of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moreover, Paul does not say that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh and stop there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He adds of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likeness denotes strongly that Christ s humanity does not have sin, but still that His humanity was in some way related to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In another verse, 2 Corinthians 5:21, Paul says that Christ did not know sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that He had no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet 2 Corinthians 5:21 also says that this One who had no sin was made sin by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our mentality cannot understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the Scriptures were not written this way, it would seem heretical to say that Christ was made sin; but Christ was made sin for us as our full substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If this had not happened, we could not have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The One whom God made sin knew no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This matter is portrayed in the Old Testament in the type of the brass serpent, described in Numbers 21.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the children of Israel sinned against God, they were bitten by serpents and were dying.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moses looked to God for them, and God told him to make a brass serpent and lift it up on a pole.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whoever looked upon that brass serpent would live, and many did vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then in John 3 the Lord Jesus talked to Nicodemus about regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nicodemus was a Bible teacher v. 10 and taught the Old Testament, especially the Pentateuch.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He cannot enter the second time into his mother s womb and be born, can he? v. 4 . The Lord implied that if he could go back to his mother s womb and be born again, he would still be flesh: That which is born of the flesh is flesh v. 6 . To be reborn is not to be born a second time of the flesh, but to be born ofthe Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That which is born of the Spirit is spirit v. 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nicodemus wondered how these things could be.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then the Lord Jesus said to him in a rebuking tone, You are the teacher of Israel, and you do not know these things? v. 10 . He then referred Nicodemus to the record in Numbers 21: And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This portrait clearly indicates that the brass serpent bears only the appearance, the likeness, of the serpent, but not its poisonous nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This corresponds with Paul s word in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Christ died on the cross, He was not only a Lamb in the eyes of God but also a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both these aspects of Christ are in John.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John 1:29 refers to the Lamb of God, and John 3:14 refers to the Son of Man, Christ, lifted up like the brass serpent in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Christ, our Redeemer, was on the cross, on the one hand, He was the Lamb of God to take away our sin; on the other hand, He was also a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The holy Word does tell us that when Christ died on the cross, in the eyes of God He was like a brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I stress this because we need to know what kind of redemption the Lord Jesus accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to accomplish a full redemption, He as the Son of God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Word became incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>John, though, did not say that the Word became a man; he said, The Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By the time of the incarnation, flesh was a negative term.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But we must be careful in saying this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A serpent surely is negative, but this serpent is a brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It bears only the appearance of a serpent; it does not have its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do you think that when Christ was made sin He had a sinful nature?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is why Paul qualifies his word by saying, who did not know sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even though He was made sin by God, He had no sin in Him and He knew no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our Lord is a wonderful Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Bible tells us God became a man in the likeness of fallen and sinful flesh.</S>
