   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE CHRIST AS LIFE FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE BRIDE Scripture Reading: Gen 2:18-23; John 3:6b, 29-30; 12:24; 19:34; Matt 13:3, 24; 1 Cor 3:6, 9b; Rev 19:7; 21:2, 9b</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Genesis 2:21-23 Eve was presented to Adam as a bride; in John 3:29 the believers are a bride to Christ as the Bridegroom; and in the book of Revelation, at the conclusion of the Bible, the bride is mentioned again 21:2, 9; 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will see how the bride is prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE BRIDE IN GENESIS AND REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible is very consistent in how it begins and how it ends.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It begins and ends with the tree of life Gen 2:9; Rev 2:7; 22:2, 14, 19 , and it begins and ends with a flowing river Gen 2:10; Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It begins with three kinds of precious materials gold, bdellium, precious stones and it ends with gold, pearl, and precious stones Gen 2:11-12; Rev 21:18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It begins with a garden Gen 2:8 , and it ends with a city Rev 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this way, the two ends of the Bible mirror one another.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the beginning and end of the Bible there is also a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The difference between the two is that the bride in the beginning is only a type, a prefigure, a foreshadowing, of the coming bride.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This may be compared to a person who sends her photograph before she comes to visit you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Her picture gives you a general idea of who she is, but when the person herself comes, you know her more definitely.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the beginning of the Bible there is a picture of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the end of the Bible comes the bride herself, who is now ready.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE CHURCH BEING THE BRIDE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the New Testament the bride is the church, the counterpart of Christ who is the Man in the universe Eph 5:25-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Genesis 2:18 God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This refers to Christ Rom 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not good for Christ to be alone without the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ needs the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a young Christian I was told that there are many mansions in the heavens, waiting to be filled with saved sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, in the Bible there is something much more meaningful than mansions in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is that the glorious Christ, the universal Man, needs a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God said it is not good for Christ to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ needs a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE PREPARATION OF THE BRIDE TYPIFIED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In what way does God prepare the bride for Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must look at the type.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The types are pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Little children in kindergarten like books with pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you tell children about a dog, they may still wonder what a dog is, but if you show them a picture of a dog, immediately they get the idea.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Genesis 2 gives us a picture of how the bride comes into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After Adam was created, God looked at him and said, "It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper as his counterpart" v. 18 . God then brought all the cattle, beasts, and birds before Adam to see what he would name them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Adam saw the dog, he may have said, "No. This is not my counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a dog."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When God brought the cat to Adam, he might have looked at himself and said, "I have two legs, but this creature has four legs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is not my counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a cat."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way he named each of the living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, Adam did not find anything that matched him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This must have been a disappointment to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After this, God caused Adam to sleep, opened his side, took a rib, and with the rib built a woman vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God then brought the woman to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Adam saw the woman, he seemed to say, "This is my counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am a man and she is a woman."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Adam and Eve were a couple.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eve, the bride, was produced from something coming out of Adam to be his increase.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When a young man is single, he has no increase, but when he is married, he has an increase.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the same way, Eve was the increase of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The bride is the increase of the man, the increase of the bridegroom.</S>
