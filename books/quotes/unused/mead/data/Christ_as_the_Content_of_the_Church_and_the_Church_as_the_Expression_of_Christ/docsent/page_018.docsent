   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST TYPIFIED BY THE TABERNACLE'S FOUR LAYERS OF COVERING Fine Twined Linen</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we want to consider the tabernacle's four layers of covering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first layer was of fine linen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This was the layer of the most fine material.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was embroidered with beautiful colors: blue, purple, and scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the type, blue is heavenly, purple is kingly, royal, and scarlet is redemptive.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fine linen signifies the fine human nature of Christ with His fine character and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It typifies the bountiful, fine humanity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The four Gospels portray a Man whose nature and conduct were exactly like the fine linen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This linen was very strong because it was twined, doubled, strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus was fine yet strong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nothing with Him was rough.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fine linen was also embroidered with cherubim, which typify God's glory magnified in His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that God's glory was wrought into Christ's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With Christ's fine human nature and character, there was God's divine glory wrought into His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hebrews 1:3 says that He is the effulgence of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the brightness of God's shining.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The embroidered cherubim were upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is not only human but also divine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His human nature bears the divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Goats' Hair</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second layer was goats' hair.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Matthew 25 the Lord divides the sheep from the goats vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>32-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The goats signify sinful persons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second Corinthians 5:21 says that God made Christ, the One who knew no sin, sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The layer of goats' hair typifies that Christ was made sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was like fine linen, but He was made like goats' hair.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With Him there was no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He did not know sin, but He was made sin for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rams' Skins Dyed Red</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The third layer was rams' skins dyed red.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A ram is a male and the dyeing of red signifies the shedding of blood for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This signifies that Christ was slain on the cross, shedding His blood to redeem us from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, the first layer typifies that He was sinless; the second layer typifies that He was made sin for us; and the third layer typifies that He bore our sins and shed His blood to redeem us from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was the sinless One, but He was made sin for us to bear our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Porpoise Skins</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The outer covering was porpoise skins, the protection and safeguard for the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This layer could withstand any kind of storm or attack.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was very coarse and looked worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From the inside the tabernacle looked beautiful and glorious, but from the outside it appeared very coarse.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Likewise, Christ did not have a beautiful outward appearance Isa 53:2 , but within He was divinely beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is the same with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When viewed from the outside by the worldly people, the church seems worthless and coarse like the porpoise skins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when people come into the church, they will see the beauty and glory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is different from the testimony in today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They have great and beautiful buildings, but when you get inside there is no spiritual content.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Most of the time they are inwardly empty or may even be inwardly defiling and ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the situation of worldly Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The proper church, the proper spiritual building of God, is divinely beautiful inwardly and coarse outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no outward comeliness or beauty with the church, just as it was with Christ when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This shows that we should try to hide ourselves, not advertise ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today many in fallen Christianity put pictures of certain persons who minister the Word in the newspapers to advertise them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That is not a glory but a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That is something of worldly religion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not have our names advertised in the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once when someone put up a sign advertising that I would speak in a certain place, I charged him to take that sign down or I would not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord Jesus never advertised Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Instead, He always tried to keep Himself hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The beauty, the comeliness, must be within.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The experience of Christ within our spirit is the real beauty before God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should even be careful not to build our meeting halls with a very beautiful appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Christianity they build beautiful buildings to attract people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If people are attracted to your beautiful meeting hall, they will end up being a problem to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We cannot attract people to the Lord by a beautiful building.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many people are attracted to St. Peter's Cathedral in the Vatican, but not many of them are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is no use in trying to draw people to the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is not a pleasure to the Lord but an offense.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Inwardly, Christ was full of beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Outwardly, He was simple and humble.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Such a Christ must be the covering as the roof of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is not my opinion or concept but the real picture shown by the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should not express anything but Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The only thing we lift up and exalt as the covering, the roof, of God's building is the wonderful Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Within He is full of the divine beauty and comeliness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Without in others' eyes He is simple and humble.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Such a church can endure any kind of attack or temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The ones who endure to the end are those who do not have an outward beautiful appearance but who have an inward heavenly beauty and divine comeliness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Christ is both their content and covering, so nothing can damage or overcome them.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the real building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must learn to seek Christ in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must learn to discern our spirit to experience Christ as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then we will enjoy the riches of Christ to arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Eph 3:8; 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We will be the material which can be built up with others to be the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We will be covered by Christ by exalting Christ as the roof of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We will have a proper, strong church life which can withstand any attack and endure any trial or temptation to the end for the glory of God.</S>
