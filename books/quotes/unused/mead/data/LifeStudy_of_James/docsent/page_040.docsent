   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Saving a Soul from Death</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 5:20 James also says that the one who turns such a sinner, such a backslidden brother, will save his soul from death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to pay attention to the fact that James does not say save him, but says, save his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to differentiate saving him from saving his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What we have in verse 20 is a matter of the salvation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this Epistle James has already spoken concerning the salvation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1:21 James says, Wherefore, putting away all filthiness and abundance of malice, receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Saving the soul is not a matter of initial salvation; it is a matter of the progressing stage of salvation, the stage of transformation see note 55 in 1 Peter 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who have been saved initially need to receive more of the word that can save their souls.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, according to 1:21, after our initial salvation we still need a further salvation, the salvation of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The saving of the soul in 5:20 is not related to saving the person from eternal perdition; it is to save his soul from a certain kind of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to 1 John 5, sin may cause one s physical death because of God s discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A believer may sin and then be warned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If he ignores this warning and continues in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God may discipline him and allow him to become sick.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This sickness is a discipline and also a warning to repent, forsake that sin, and give up a life of sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If this believer does not repent, God may discipline him further to the extent that He cuts short his physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result, this believer dies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fact that a believer may die as the result of sin does not mean that he will perish eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once we have been saved, we are saved eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the day we believed in the Lord Jesus we were saved once for all, and we shall never be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, if a believer remains in a life of sin, he may be warned and disciplined by God through sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First, God may discipline him with sickness as a warning to come back to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the church may have someone try to bring this person back.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if this one remains in sin, this may force God to exercise further discipline and allow him to die.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose you are burdened to turn a misled believer back to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To turn him back is to save his soul from physical death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the proper interpretation of 5:19-20.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What James says in these verses has nothing to do with eternal perdition or eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The question of eternal salvation was fully resolved at the time we believed and were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, if we are led astray and go back to sin, we may suffer sickness as God s discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do not repent, we may suffer an early death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When someone dies, it is the soul, and not the body, that especially suffers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Physical death is a very real suffering to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be saved in our soul from such suffering is to be brought back to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is what it means to bring back a backsliding believer and thereby save his soul from physical death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What James describes in these verses is part of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, it is a negative aspect of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this Epistle we cannot find positive things covered by James with respect to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although what James says concerning the church life is on the negative side, we can still receive much positive help from what he has written in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In particular, we can receive help concerning practical Christian perfection.</S>
