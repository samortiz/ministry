Peter tells us to give heed to the prophetic word until the day dawns and the morning star rises in our hearts
The Bible is a very accurate book; not even one word is wrong, and not a single word should be misread or replaced
Thinking that Jesus, who was called a Nazarene, came from Galilee, they rejected Him and missed the coming of the Messiah in their time
Today we also may have only a general understanding of the prophecies and not know them so accurately or finely
If we are a curious person, even spiritual things of value will become non-spiritual and dead when they fall into our hands
When we study the prophecies, we must not be curious; rather, we should touch life, touch the spirit, and touch the Lord
The phrase one's own interpretation in 2 Peter 1:20 can also be translated 'interpreted according to the meaning of it'
Only the Holy Spirit is the Author of all the prophecies; hence, all the prophecies can be linked together as one
The Old Testament prophecies were made firm by Jesus Christ the Lord and by some of the apostles in the prophecies of the New Testament
In other words, the New Testament prophecies confirm the Old Testament prophecies to make the Old Testament prophecies more firm
To keep the prophecies is to obey and follow the prophecies and even to be governed in our daily walk by the prophecies
These examples prove that 'the intimate counsel of Jehovah is to those who fear Him, / And His covenant will He make known to them'
The Bible is a very accurate book, so as readers of the prophecies, we must be careful and accurate; otherwise, we will suffer loss
To keep the prophecies is to obey and follow the prophecies and to be governed by the prophecies in our daily walk
While the New Testament clearly reveals Christ's divinity, the Old Testament clearly prophesies that Christ is God
Psalm 102:25-27 says, 'Of old You laid the foundation of the earth, / And the heavens are the work of Your hands
They will perish but You endure Indeed all of them will wear out like a garment Like clothing You will change them And they will be changed
Christ existed in eternity, before the creation of all things, and that He was preparing to come forth out of eternity into time
Hebrews 1:8 says, 'Of the Son, 'Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom'
Because of what He is and all the riches in His divinity, Christ has become 'so great a salvation' to the believers
The Old Testament contains prophecies not only concerning the divinity of Christ but also concerning the humanity of Christ
The birth of Jesus Christ of the virgin Mary fulfilled the prophecy of Christ being the seed of the woman in His humanity
As the seed of the woman in His humanity, Christ is Emmanuel-God with us, and He has bruised the head of the ancient serpent, Satan
Christ in His humanity was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin; hence, man called His name Emmanuel-God with us
The last half of the prophecythe serpent bruising the heel of the seed of the womanwas fulfilled when Christs feet were nailed to the cross
Eventually, the overcoming believers will execute God's judgment on the ancient serpent, Satan, and cast him down to the earth
The devil, who deceived them, will be cast into the lake of fire, where he will be tormented day and night forever and ever
He does not say, And to the seeds, as concerning many, but as concerning one: 'And to your seed,' who is Christ'
According to Galatians 3:16, in the eyes of God the 'seed' who would receive the inheritance and bless the nations is Christ
Christ is not only the unique seed who inherits the promise as typified by Isaac; He is also the promise of blessing to be received by man
When Jehovah God appeared to Abraham, He promised to give him two things-the good land and the seed, both of which typify Christ
The physical aspect of this blessing that God promised to Abraham is the good land , which is a type of the all-inclusive Christ
The fulfillment of this is referred to in Revelation 11:15, which says that Christ 'will reign forever and ever'
Just as Solomon built and completed the temple of God Christ in resurrection also builds His church to be the dwelling place of God on earth
When He was still in the flesh, even though His humanity was sinless and perfect, it was not yet the Son of God
The prophetic word of Nathan, which says, 'I will be his Father, and he will be My son,' was not merely fulfilled in Christ
It further unveils a more important matter, which is that a seed of man-a son of man-can become the Son of God
Other prophets in the Old Testament, such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Zechariah, also prophesied concerning the humanity of Christ
Isaiah 11:1-2 says, 'Then a sprout will come forth from the stump of Jesse, / And a branch from his roots will bear fruit
In his prophecy the prophet Jeremiah said that Christ, the Shoot of David, is called 'Jehovah our righteousness'
Jeremiah prophesied that Christ would come as a Shoot who is Jehovah Himself to be the righteousness of God's chosen people
The Psalms prophesy that Christ is God Himself that in His divinity He has the eternal throne and that the scepter of His kingdom is upright
The Christ who was born as a baby is the Son given to us by God, and this Christ the Son is the eternal Father
Christ in His humanity is also the seed of Abraham as typified by Isaac, who came out of Abraham and received the inheritance
The Spirit of Jehovah rested upon Him and He was full of the Spirit of wisdom understanding counsel might knowledge and the fear of Jehovah
The people of God do not have righteousness, but Christ is Jehovah our righteousness that we may be justified before God
We have seen that before Christ was incarnated, the Old Testament prophets prophesied that the incarnated Christ is God and also man
In this lesson and in the next we will see what the Old Testament prophets prophesied concerning Christ's first coming
By His cross the enmity between the Jews and Gentiles was slain so that the two were reconciled to God in one Body
Christ in His first coming as Shiloh not only created peace between men but also rectified the condition between God and man
In verse 15 Moses said to the children of Israel, 'A Prophet will Jehovah your God raise up for you from your midst'
In Acts 3:22-23 Peter quotes Moses' words to indicate that Christ is the Prophet promised by God through Moses to His people
He spoke the word of God and prophesied many things concerning God's economy, especially concerning the accomplishment of God's economy
To bore the ears was for Christ's obedience to die on the cross, and to prepare a body was also for His dying on the cross
He knew that God's delight was no longer in the sacrifices and offerings of the old covenant and that He would be their replacement
As the One who does God's will, Christ fulfills and replaces all the sacrifices and offerings of the Old Testament
The people who walked in the darkness Have seen a great light Upon those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death Light has shined
He said, 'I have come as a light into the world, that everyone who believes into Me would not remain in darkness'
Gloom, anguish, and contempt were in the land of Zebulun and of Naphtali-Galilee of the nations-because darkness was there
When the people who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death and walked in darkness met Christ, they saw the great light
Verse 4 says, 'For You break the yoke of their burden / And the staff on their shoulder, / The rod of their oppressor'
He is the divine, marvelous light to deliver the believers out of the darkness of death, the death-realm, into God's life-realm of light
The Old Testament prophet Moses prophesied that Christ would come as a Prophet raised up by God from among the Israelites
As the One who does God's will, Christ fulfills and replaces all the sacrifices and offerings of the Old Testament
Christ as a great light also breaks the yoke of the burden of God's people so that they are released and their joy is increased
In this lesson we will continue from the previous lesson to see Christ in His first coming as prophesied by the Old Testament prophets
We will also see that at the birth of Jesus the aged Simeon prophesied that Christ would be the glory and consolation of Israel
The divine essence of the Holy Spirit was generated in Mary's womb before the child Jesus was delivered out of her womb
The One who was of the Holy Spirit in Mary was delivered out of her womb as a God-man with both divinity and humanity
The child born of the virgin is Jesus, whom man called Emmanuel, and this child is also the Son, as the gift to us from God
Isaiah 32:1-2 says, 'Indeed a King will reign according to righteousness, / And the rulers will rule according to justice
Isaiah prophesies that Christ in His first coming would be a King as well as a man for supplying, caring, and covering His people
The Gospel of Matthew reveals that Christ is the King, as prophesied in the Old Testament, who brings the kingdom of God to earth
These items are various aspects of the care and supply rendered to us, the kingdom people, by Christ as the King in His kingship
Christ's incarnation, that is, His becoming the One who comes forth from Bethlehem, started from ancient times, from the days of eternity
As our Ruler He keeps us as our Shepherd He nourishes and cherishes us and as our peace He controls our environment so that we may enjoy Him
At that time Christ will save the Israelites from the invasion of the nations so that Israel, His elect, will receive comfort and enjoyment
In Haggai 2:6-7 the prophet Haggai was charged by Jehovah to speak to the people: 'Thus says Jehovah of hosts,
As the Messenger of God, Christ not only brings a word or a message from God to God's people; He Himself is the living message
For Him to be the Angel of the covenant means that He is a serving One, to serve God in forming the new testament
By the new covenant that He enacted and by His being the surety we have forgiveness of sins and we also gain Him as our life and life supply
When Christ comes back, He will come as the Angel of the covenant to execute His covenant over the repentant and believing Jews
The child born of the virgin is Jesus, whom man called Emmanuel, and this child is also the Son, as the gift to us from God
We enjoy this One as grace, which is God Himself becoming our portion for our enjoyment, and the issue is that He becomes our reality
He is like streams of water in a dry place to supply, comfort, and satisfy us so that we can be watered in a dry place
As the Messenger of God, Christ not only brings a word or a message from God to God's people; He Himself is the living message
In the new covenant God is obligated to dispense Himself into our being to be our life, to be the law of life, and to be everything to us
The incarnated Christ in His first coming is the glory of Israel to uplift them, and He is also their consolation that comforts them
In His first coming, Christ was God becoming man to enter into mankind with all His riches and to bring God into man in His ministry
Under God's sovereignty all these matters were recorded in the books of prophecy in the Old Testament long before Christ was born
In this lesson we will consider the prophecies concerning Christ's birth, His youth, and the recommender of His ministry
Jeremiah 23:5 is a prophecy concerning Christ as a righteous Shoot raised up by God out of David who would reign as King
In order to fulfill the prophecies in Micah 5 and Jeremiah 23, Christ had to be born of the royal house and in Bethlehem
According to the genealogy of Christ in Matthew, Mary's husband, Joseph, was a descendant of Zerubbabel who returned from captivity
Mary, the wife of Joseph, was also a descendant of the returned captives, but she was the descendant of Nathan, another son of David
Both Joseph and Mary were descendants of David: Joseph was of the line of Solomon, and Mary was of the line of Nathan
According to the record of Jeremiah, no descendant of Solomon's son Jeconiah was qualified to inherit the throne of David
Even though He was a descendant of David, He was not of the line of Jeconiah, who was cursed according to Jeremiah
Although Israel became exceedingly evil, Christ still became organically one with them through incarnation to be a real Israelite
After the death of King Herod, who sought the life of Jesus, Joseph and Mary took Jesus and returned to Galilee, settling in Nazareth
The word prophets, in plural, indicates that this is not a particular prophecy but a summary of the significance of several prophecies
Jesus was not born in a recognized and honored royal home, nor did He grow up in a renowned city such as Jerusalem
All this made Him a Nazarene, a branch-not a lofty branch of a stately tree, but a seemingly insignificant sprout from the stump of Jesse
As the prophet Isaiah prophesied, 'Then a sprout will come forth from the stump of Jesse, / And a branch from his roots will bear fruit
Isaiah 53:2 prophesies of Christ, saying, 'He grew up like a tender plant before Him, / And like a root out of dry ground
He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him, / Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him'
In His divinity Christ has always been perfect and complete, and thus there was no need for Him to grow in His divinity
The Jews thought the Messiah would be admired by people, like Moses and David, who were attractive in appearance
The Jews also thought that when the Messiah came, there would be the royal scepter, an open ceremony, and the support of the people
His visage and form were marred, having no attractiveness or majesty, such that He was reckoned as nearly fifty years old when He was thirty
Before Christ began His earthly ministry, the Scriptures prophesied of a recommender who would be a forerunner of His ministry
John is from the Hebrew Johanan , meaning 'Jehovah is gracious,' 'Jehovah gives grace,' or 'Jehovah the gracious Giver'
The Lord Jesus also said I say to you that Elijah has already come and they did not recognize him but did with him the things they wished
In the aspect of complete fulfillment of the prophecies, the complete coming of Elijah will occur during the great tribulation in the future
To prepare the way of Jehovah is to prepare the way of the Lord Jesus, which is also to make straight in the desert a highway for our God
The ministry of John the Baptist was to deal with man's heart so that it would be ready to receive the coming Christ
When John came, he commanded the people to repent , which was the real preparing of the Lord's way and making straight His paths
Before a man is saved, there are valleys in his heart that need to be filled up, and there are mountains and hills that need to be made low
Both Joseph and Mary were descendants of David: Joseph was of the line of Solomon, and Mary was of the line of Nathan
The angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, telling him to take the child and His mother and flee into Egypt
The title Nazarene may refer to the branch in Isaiah 11:1, signifying that Christ is a sprout out of the stump of Jesse, the father of David
Isaiah 53 prophesied that Christ would grow before Jehovah like a tender plant and like a root out of dry ground
He would go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the heart of the fathers to the children
The ministry of John the Baptist was mainly to deal with man's heart so that it would be prepared to receive the coming Christ
At the beginning of His ministry He was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted, tested, by the devil
During His ministry He had the Spirit of God with Him; thus, when He spoke God's words, He could give the Spirit without measure
The fulfillment of this was referred to in Matthew 1220 which says A bruised reed He will not break and smoking flax He will not quench
When the oil ran out, the torch could not produce shining light but instead would smoke; hence, they quenched it
No matter how much opposition persecution and attack He encountered the Servant of Jehovah Christ was always merciful and full of sympathy
After the Lord cleansed the temple, 'His disciples remembered that it was written, 'The zeal of Your house shall devour Me''
The prophets prophesied both in Psalm 69 and Isaiah 53 concerning the suffering of Christ in His earthly ministry
Christ, as the Servant of Jehovah, was full of sorrow in His human living, which fully qualified Him to be the Savior of the world
A bruised reed He will not break; / And a dimly burning flax He will not extinguish; / He will bring forth justice in truth
He will not faint nor will He be discouraged Until He has established justice in the earth And the coastlands will wait for His instruction
Isaiah 611 prophesied concerning Christs being anointed to bring good news Jehovah has anointed Me To bring good news to the afflicted
When the Lord came to Nazareth, which was the place where He grew up, He entered into the synagogue and stood up to read the Scriptures
While on earth Christ not only healed the physically blind , but He also opened the spiritual eyes so that people could know Him
The anointed ministry of the Lord also released those who were exiles and prisoners under Satan's bondage by casting out demons
The Gentiles will receive the all-inclusive Christ as the judgment and answer to everything, issuing in peace and satisfaction
The Lord said, 'I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand
For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed'
His disciples were blessed because they saw and heard the mysteries of the kingdom revealed by the Lord through the parables that He spoke
He is righteous and bears salvation, / Lowly and riding upon a donkey, / Even upon a colt, the foal of a donkey'
The warm welcome the Lord received when entering Jerusalem, as recorded in Matthew 21:9, fulfilled the prophecy in Psalm 118
As a meek King, He was qualified to receive such praise, because He did not come in His own name but in the name of God
After entering Jerusalem, the Lord went into the temple, and many children cried out, saying, 'Hosanna to the Son of David'
The Lord Jesus asked them, 'Have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings You have perfected praise''?
Babes and sucklings are the youngest, smallest, and weakest ones, which typify the children of the kingdom of the heavens
The Septuagint version translates the Hebrew word strength into praise which the Lord also agreed with and used quoting it in Matthew 2116
God is working in man so that the weakest ones and the smallest ones can offer, out of their mouths, praises full of strength
When He ministered on the earth, He was despised, forsaken, acquainted with grief, hated, and reproached by man
He also healed the blind; He not only healed the physically blind, but He also opened the spiritual eyes of the people
In revealing the mysteries of the kingdom, He used parables so that His disciples might see and hear the mysteries of the kingdom
In this lesson we will continue to see the prophecies in the Old Testament concerning Christ's living and ministry on earth
At the end of His earthly ministry, Christ entered into Jerusalem in a humble and meek way, riding on a donkey's colt
Artaxerxes the king, in the twentieth year of his reign, allowed Nehemiah to return for the rebuilding of Jerusalem
As our Savior, He makes us living stones , and in the process of transformation we are being built into a dwelling place of God in spirit
Since the Jews did not believe Christ and rejected Him He became a stone to strike against and a rock of stumbling to the children of Israel
The Christ whom God engraved accomplished redemption for the sin of the people in one day-the day of His crucifixion
When Christ came as a man to be the Shepherd, not only was He rejected by men; He was even struck, smitten, by God
The Lord quoted Zechariah 137 to warn His disciples that He as the Shepherd would be crucified and that God would strike Him with the sword
All His disciples, especially Peter, had the assurance and confidence that they could follow the Lord to the end
Even though Judas ate with the Lord at the Passover feast, he did not have part in the new testament feast instituted by the Lord Himself
Christ was priced as a slave, and Judas betrayed Him for this price, selling the Lord for thirty pieces of silver
Psalm 118 prophesies that Christ is the stone rejected by the Jewish builders who became the cornerstone in resurrection
As our Savior, He makes us living stones, and in the process of transformation, we are being built into the dwelling place of God
Christ, the stone engraved by God, was the Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world on the day of His crucifixion
The disciples were stumbled because of the Lord, as He had prophesied, and they left Him and fled, becoming scattered sheep
Even though Judas ate with the Lord at the Passover feast, he did not have part in the new testament feast instituted by the Lord
In this lesson we will continue to see the prophecies in the Old Testament concerning Christ's death and burial
What he spoke became prophecies concerning Christ's crucifixion and the condition of Christ's suffering in His crucifixion
When people were mocking Him and deriding Him He was trusting in God because He had trusted in God even while He was at His mothers breasts
When Christ was being crucified, those who were passing by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, 'Save Yourself!
While Christ was being crucified on the cross, many fierce men, like the mighty bulls of Bashan, encompassed Him
John indicates in verse 37 that this fulfilled Zechariah's prophecy: 'They will look upon Me, whom they have pierced'
His heart was like wax melted within Him , His strength was dried up like a shard, and His tongue was stuck to His jaws
According to Matthew and Mark, wine mingled with gall was offered to the Lord before crucifixion, but when He tasted it, He would not drink
There was lying there a vessel full of vinegar; therefore, they put a sponge full of vinegar on hyssop and brought it to His mouth'
While He was on the earth, the Father was with Him all the time , but at the end of His crucifixion, God left Him economically
Economically, God caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him , making Christ the righteous One, the Substitute for the unrighteous
God economically left Him temporarily so that man's sin and sins and all negative things could be dealt with on the cross
The fact that Christ's legs were not broken indicates that in Him is an unbreakable and indestructible eternal life
Verse 5 says, 'Coming into the world, He says, 'Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me'
He could have shut the mouths of the false accusers , but He did not argue, vindicate Himself, or justify Himself
Before the Sanhedrin, as a sheep being sheared before the shearers, He did not say one word for self-vindication
After God caused our iniquities to fall on the crucified Christ, God considered Him the unique sinner, even sin itself
People think that it was either men or Satan who killed the Lord; actually, it was God who was pleased to crush Him, to put Him on the cross
He makes Himself an offering for sin in Hebrew has the sense of 'when His soul would make an offering for sin'
Christ died for our wrongdoings mistakes trespasses transgressions evildoings and iniquities thus His death is altogether a vicarious death
Despite the evil events and His considerable suffering, Christ endured them all and passed through them victoriously
Joseph, an honorable member of the Council and a rich man of Arimathea, went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus
According to God's sovereignty, He rested in the highest standard of human honor, waiting for the time to resurrect from among the dead
Even though Christ suffered, He still trusted in God, because He had trust in God even while He was at His mother's breasts
Blood and water came out of His pierced side to take away sins on the negative side and to dispense life on the positive side
Christ bore our sicknesses and carried our sorrows, was wounded because of our transgressions, and was crushed because of our iniquities
Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, He did not open His mouth
Those who were with Jesus did not realize His vicarious death; they esteemed Him stricken, smitten of God and afflicted
Christ had done no violence nor was there any deceit in His mouth, but He was crucified and was assigned by man a grave with the wicked
After Christ died on the cross, His soul exulted in Hades, and His flesh, His body, was in a tomb, resting in hope because He trusted in God
God raised Christ up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Christ to be held by death
Christ is both God and resurrection , possessing the indestructible life ; hence, death is not able to hold Him
By incarnation, He was born of a human virgin and put on humanity, an element which had nothing to do with divinity
Isaiah 55:3 prophesied concerning the resurrected Christ being the sure mercies shown to David, the faithful things
God promised to give the resurrected Christ to His people as a gift; this One is the holy and faithful things of David
Isaiah 53:10b-11a says, 'He will see a seed, He will extend His days, / And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand
As His seed, His believers are His extension, just as one of our hymns says, 'We are Thy continuation, / Thy life-increase and Thy spread'
The fruit of His travail is the fruit of the travail of His death, which is also corporate, including all believers, that is His church
The death of Christ fully satisfied God's righteous requirements; hence, we are justified by God through His death
Both the firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God are born of the same Father in resurrection and have the same divine life and nature
Sing hymns of praise refers to the firstborn Son, Christ, praising the Father from within the Father's many sons in the church meetings
When we, the many sons of God, the church, meet together to praise the Father, the firstborn Son praises the Father in our praising
It is not that He praises the Father apart from us; rather, He praises within us and with us through our praising
Psalm 2:7 prophesied that in resurrection Christ, the only begotten Son of God, would be born as God's firstborn Son
Verse 11 prophesied concerning Christ being the resurrected, righteous Servant of Jehovah through whom many are justified
After His resurrection Christ began to call His disciples brothers, because like Him, they had the Father's divine life and nature
In the meetings of the church, Christ, the firstborn Son, sings hymns of praise to the Father from within the Father's many sons
Thereafter, in the presence of His disciples He ascended into heaven from Mount Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, being taken up by a cloud
He also poured out the Spirit upon His sons and daughters that they may become the corporate and enlarged Christ
Acts 2:34 also speaks of the Lord Jesus sitting at God's right hand, which is the position of glory, honor, and power
Psalm 8 then alludes in the way of prophecy to another man who will replace the first man to fulfill God's purpose
Hebrews 29 says We see Jesus who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor
Adam lost the authority that God had given him, but according to the prophecy in Psalm 8, Christ recovered what Adam lost
Gods right hand where Christ was seated by the surpassingly great power of God is the most honorable place the place with supreme authority
The great power that God caused to operate in Christ seated Him at God's right hand in the heavenlies, far above all
Christ in His ascension is far above not only the angelic, heavenly authorities, whether good or evil, but also the human, earthly ones
The ascended Christ was seated by the great power of God far above all rule, authority, power, and lordship in the universe
On the one hand, the ascended Christ is far above all; on the other hand, all things have been subjected under His feet
Isaiah 53:12a prophesied, 'I will divide to Him a portion with the Great, / And He will divide the spoil with the Strong'
According to Isaiah 53:12a, God divides to the ascended Christ a portion with the Great, and Christ divides the spoil with the Strong
In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan's captivity and took them to Himself
After Christ received the captives from the Father as gifts, He transformed the captives in His resurrected life and made them gifts
Psalm 6818 prophesied that the ascended Christ would receive gifts but Ephesians 48 says that in fulfilment the ascended Christ gave gifts
These gifts are the persons listed in Ephesians 4:11-the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
By this outpouring of the consummated Spirit all the disciples and saved ones on the day of Pentecost became members of the corporate Christ
Psalm 110:4 says, 'Jehovah has sworn, / And He will not change: / You are a Priest forever / According to the order of Melchizedek'
Aaron was made the high priest in honor only for his lifetime, because death prevented him from continuing his service
As the Son of God Christ is a Priest forever in glory according to the order of Melchizedek because with Him there is no preventing of death
As such a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, He can minister to us whatever we need and save us to the uttermost
Isaiah 2222 says I will set the key of the house of David upon his shoulder When he opens no one will shut When he shuts no one will open
He has accomplished everything for God and us and is resting there, waiting for God to set His enemies as His footstool
Psalm 110:4 is a prophecy concerning Christ in His heavenly ministry as a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedek
Isaiah 22:22 is a prophecy concerning Christ as the One who holds the key of David, who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one opens
At His coming back Christ will be the bright morning star to the overcomers , appearing before the darkest hour, prior to the dawn
The Lord promises that if we are watchful and wait for His coming, His appearing as the morning star will be a reward to us
Revelation 12:5 says, 'She brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod'
Verse 11 says that the overcomers who constitute the man-child are faithful unto death; they love not their soul-life even unto death
At His coming back Christ will also reap the firstfruits, the one hundred and forty-four thousand who stand on Mount Zion with the Lamb
Besides catching up the man-child and reaping the firstfruits, Christ in His coming back will also take up the other living overcomers
These verses say that two men will be in the field and two women will be grinding at the mill: 'one is taken and one is left
In Luke 173436 the Lord Jesus said I tell you In that night there will be two on one bed the one will be taken and the other will be left
The saints who have kept the word of the Lord's endurance will also be raptured by Christ before the great tribulation
We who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air'
Christ's judgment of the believers at His coming back will not be concerning their eternal salvation but their dispensational reward
Those who are saved but fail to pass the judgment will be placed in outer darkness in the millennial kingdom for punishment
After the judgment at the judgment seat in the air, Christ as the Bridegroom will marry the overcoming saints as His bride
God's New Testament economy is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and the divine life
By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age
To be invited to the marriage dinner of Christ, which will usher the overcomers into the enjoyment of the millennium, is to be blessed
Christ's parousia will be completed in His being manifested in public, that is, His coming to the earth openly
Christ's parousia will be completed when He comes openly from the air to the earth at the end of the great tribulation
Acts 111 prophesies This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven will come in the same way as you beheld Him going into heaven
Paul says, 'All Israel will be saved, as it is written, 'The Deliverer will come out of Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob''
In Matthew 21:44 the Lord referred to this prophecy, saying, 'On whomever it falls, it shall crush him to powder and scatter him like chaff'
Christ will be the crushing stone to crush the nations so that they become like chaff being carried away by the wind
Those regarded as goats will go with their leader, Antichrist, 'into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels'
In His coming back Christ will first appear secretly as a thief and as a bright morning star to the overcomers
He will catch up the man-child, the martyred overcoming saints throughout the generations, taking them up to God and to His throne
He will also take up the other living overcoming believers, keeping them out of the three and a half years of the great tribulation
Finally at the end of the great tribulation Christs parousia will be completed in His being manifested openly to the Jews and the Gentiles
He will come on the clouds of heaven just as the lightning coming forth from the east and shining to the west so that every eye will see Him
He will strike the Gentiles, the nations, like a stone, crushing them into pieces, like chaff being carried away by the wind
Finally sitting on the throne of His glory Christ will judge all the living peoples the nations on the earth at the time of His coming back
Those regarded as sheep will be transferred into the millennium to be the people and those regarded as goats will go into the eternal fire
In the millennium Christ as the Bridegroom will enjoy the marriage dinner with the overcoming believers as the bride
Those who will be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb are the overcoming believers; they will also be the bride of the Lamb
Christ, the Bridegroom, will usher the bride, the overcoming believers, into the enjoyment of the marriage dinner with Him in the millennium
The devil, who deceives the nations, will be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet will also be
After this final purification the peoples remaining after the millennium will be transferred to the new earth to be the nations for eternity
After the millennium Christ will judge all the dead at the great white throne, for He is the Judge of both the living and the dead
God is light ; Christ the Lamb as the lamp will shine with the Triune God as the light to dispense Himself into His redeemed people
Through the Lamb, the Redeemer, God's killing light becomes an enjoyable shining for the dispensing of God into all His redeemed people
In the New Jerusalem the Lamb as the lamp will shine with God as the light, and the nations will walk by this light, that is, by its leading
In the millennium the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be intensified sevenfold
God and the Lamb being on one throne proves that God and the Lamb are not separated; God in the Lamb is sitting on the throne
In eternity Christ will still be the Lamb, indicating that the redemption He accomplished in time will be brought into eternity
The word for tree in Revelation 2:7, as in 1 Peter 2:24, means 'wood'; it is not the word usually used for tree
They will take the deeds of Christ as their outward guide and regulation that they may live the human life forever
In eternity Christ is the spring of the water of life, just as the Spirit is the river, and the Father is the source
Revelation 7:17 prophesies that 'the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and guide them to springs of waters of life'
In the millennium Christ as the Bridegroom will enjoy the marriage dinner of the Lamb with the overcoming believers as the bride
God will use fire from heaven to devour them, thereby purifying for the last time all the peoples on the earth
In addition, He is the lamp of the holy city to shine with the Triune God as the light and to dispense Himself into the redeemed people
The throne of God and of the Lamb is in the center of the New Jerusalem, indicating that the Ruler in eternity is the redeeming God
Christ is also the supply of the holy city as the tree of life nourishing the sons of God and healing the people on the new earth
There are many prophecies in the Bible, but strictly speaking, the building up of the church is the greatest prophecy
The believers have Christ, the mystery of God, dwelling in them , but worldly people do not realize that He is in the believers
Zechariah 12:1 says that Jehovah stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundations of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
Moses received the revelation to build the tabernacle, but, not knowing the mystery of the church, he did not know how to build the church
Paul in Ephesians 3:5 says that this mystery 'has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit'
Colossians 1:26 says, 'The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints'
God promised Abraham that his descendants would be like the stars of the heavens and like the sand which is on the seashore
Abraham's natural descendants belong to the earthly Jerusalem, to the covenant of law under the slavery of the law
His spiritual descendants belong to the heavenly Jerusalem, to the covenant of promise under the freedom of grace
Christ as the life of the believers has saved them into a position that is far above all God's enemies, to become God's heavenly people
As God's heavenly people, the believers' commonwealth exists in the heavens, far above all earthly things and their usurpation
Paul's thought here is that Christ has brought together the Jews and the Gentiles so that the Gentiles can rejoice with the Jews
In Isaiah 56:6 and 8 the prophet prophesied, 'The children of the foreigner who join themselves to Jehovah, / To minister to Him
He gathered the Jews, and then He began to gather more people to Him from such places as Asia Minor and Macedonia
We, the New Testament believers, are truly blessed to be able to receive the revelation of the church as the mystery of Christ
There are many prophecies in the Bible, but strictly speaking, the building up of the church is the greatest prophecy
All the saints today have the position and privilege to receive that which was not revealed to God's people in the Old Testament age
We, the New Testament believers, are truly blessed to be able to receive this revelation-the church as the mystery of Christ
The kingdom of the heavens, as a specific section within the kingdom of God, is also called the kingdom of God
Matthew 4:17 says, 'From that time Jesus began to proclaim and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
In Matthew 13:11 the Lord Jesus said, 'To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens'
With the patriarchs and the children of Israel, the kingdom of God was present in a general way, not in a particular way
At the beginning of the New Testament, John the Baptist called on people to repent, proclaiming, 'The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
Through regeneration man can enter into God's kingdom, that is, the kingdom of the heavens, in the sense of life and in the way of life
As a particular section of the kingdom of God in the sense of life, the kingdom of the heavens must comprise the church age
In verses 24 and 25 the Lord said, 'The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field
That both the tares and the wheat grow in the field means that both the false believers and the genuine believers live in the world
The sons of the kingdom constitute the kingdom, whereas the sons of the evil one form the outward appearance of the kingdom
The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard, sojourning on the earth
The church as the practical kingdom of the heavens with Christ the unleavened fine flour as its content must be a loaf of unleavened bread
The outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens exists along with the church in the church age, but it does not exist within the church
The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be the manifestation of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
During the present age, the reality of the kingdom and the outward appearance of the kingdom develop simultaneously
The manifestation of the kingdom will be the kingdom of the Father, that is, the heavenly part of the millennium
The earthly part will be the kingdom of the Messiah , the tabernacle of David , and the kingdom of the Son of Man
In Matthew 13 the Lord spoke concerning the revelation of the church with respect to the kingdom of the heavens
He also prophesied concerning the main points of Christian history between His first coming and His second coming
At the beginning of the New Testament the kingdom of God was present, but it needed a new start in the way of life
The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the inward content of the kingdom of the heavens in its heavenly and spiritual nature
The outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward condition of the kingdom of the heavens in name
The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the practical coming of the kingdom of the heavens in power
The kingdom of the heavens began on the day of Pentecost, beginning at the same time and going on in parallel with the church
The development of the outward appearance is like a mustard seed, the smallest among seeds, growing into a tree
The Lord used the parable of the leaven to prophesy concerning the corruption of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens
The reality of the kingdom of the heavens will be transferred into the next age to become the manifestation of the kingdom
In this lesson we will see the prophecies concerning the building up of the church and the stages of the church
The Lord's word here is a prophecy that concerns practice; it is a prophecy concerning the building up of the church
Twenty centuries have passed since the Lord spoke this word, but the building up of the church has not been completed
Before that time there were only the Jews and the Gentiles, but through the Triune God pouring Himself out, the church was produced
These verses are Paul's prophecy concerning the building up of the church and are a continuation of the Lord's prophecy in Matthew 16:18
Without the fulfillment of this prophecy and without the church being built up, the Lord does not have a way to come back
The seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are prophecies concerning the stages of the church
It provides a picture of the church at the end of the initial stage, during the last part of the first century
The church in Ephesus had works, labor, endurance, and much discernment, being able to try the false apostles and to reject them
The trying of the false apostles, together with their works, labor, and endurance were all approved by the Lord
In the epistle to the church in Ephesus in the book of Revelation, the Lord rebuked them for having left their first love
A sentence in the book says, 'If you have wealth, give with your own hands, that your soul may have its ransom'
Nicolaos is composed of two words, one meaning 'conquer or be victorious over' and another meaning 'common people, secular people, or laity'
Two titles refer to the same person-elder, denoting a person of maturity, and overseer, denoting the function of an elder
During the period prefigured by the church in Smyrna, there were Jews outside the church who were persecuting the church
At that time there were also Judaizers within the church such as the Nazaraeans and Ebionites, who were Judaic Christians
Under Satan's manipulating, maneuvering hand, the Jewish synagogues opposed the Lord Jesus , the apostles , and the churches
Although the believers suffered afflictions, they were faithful unto death and were more than victorious by the resurrection life
His motive was a political one, because his goal was to prevent his country from falling into confusion because of religious issues
Because the church entered into union with the world and became worldly, she began to dwell where Satan dwells-in the world
The genuine church life as revealed in the New Testament, however, always holds and enjoys Christ as the unique person
If she would not repent, He would come to her quickly and would make war with them with the sword of His mouth
The seven epistles written to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are a prophecy of the stages of the church
In this lesson we will continue to see the prophecies in Revelation chapters 2 and 3 concerning the stages of the church
They were the rest in Thyatira who rejected heresies to the uttermost faithfully loved the Lord and were willing to suffer for the Lord
She helps God's people to worship God, but she does not do it in God's way; rather, she does it in a heathen, pagan way
Her adherents are drugged by her heretical, religious teachings and thus do not care for Christ as their life and life supply
Tribulation here is the particular portion of affliction that the Lord will cause the Roman Catholic Church to suffer when He judges her
The Lord said to the messenger of the church in Sardis, 'I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead'
The Reformation was the direct work of the Holy Spirit, but the Protestant church after the Reformation is a human organization
She needs the living seven Spirits and the shining seven stars to recover from the condition of having lost her power and life
In Revelation 3:2 the Lord asked the church in Sardis to 'establish the things which remain, which were about to die'
Even though they recovered the open Bible and gained many precious truths, they still hold on to their creeds and rituals
Even though many servants among them have been greatly used by the Lord, their works are not complete in God's eyes
The church in Philadelphia prophetically depicts the church of brotherly love, that is, the recovery of the proper church life
One outstanding feature of the church in Philadelphia is that she has a little power and has kept the Lord's word
The brothers raised up by the Lord in England in the early part of the nineteenth century did not take any name other than the Lord's name
They not only returned in a full way to the Lord's word but also abandoned all names other than that of the Lord Jesus Christ
There is no way for organized Christianity to shut this door because the key is in the hands of Christ, the Head of the church
She needs to repent of her lukewarmness and be zealous, boiling, burning, that she may regain her enjoyment of the reality of Christ
Besides, even though the church in Laodicea has some amount of knowledge about spiritual things, she does not have true spiritual insight
The apostate church has works, love, faith, service, and endurance, and her last works are more than the first
Many things were recovered in the Reformation, such as justification by faith, the gospel of grace, and the open Bible
The church in Laodicea prophetically signifies the degraded recovered church life from the nineteenth century until the Lord's coming
She has works, but she is neither cold nor hot; hence, she is in danger of being spewed out of the Lord's mouth
In this lesson we shall see the prophecies concerning the consummation of the church as God's ultimate purpose
In the Old Testament God told His redeemed people, Israel, that He was their Husband and that they were His wife
All those who believe into Him must follow Him, and all those who follow Him should become His bride to be His increase
As Eve was the increase of Adam, so the church as the bride, the wife, is the increase of Christ the Bridegroom, the Husband
Fine linen speaks of the overcoming living that is lived out by the believers' overcoming life, which actually is Christ lived out of them
According to the revelation of the Scriptures, the believers need two garments-one for salvation and one for preparation to be the bride
The Gospel of John reveals that Christ came as the Lamb to take away sin and as the Bridegroom that He might have the bride
Revelation 19:7-8 speaks of Christ and His counterpart, His bride, getting married at His coming; this is the marriage of the Lamb
The future position of the overcoming believers is the bride, and the future position of Christ is the Bridegroom
When He comes back, Christ and His overcoming believers will meet, and that will be the wedding of Christ's marriage
Revelation 21:2 says, 'I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband'
She comes out of Christ and is prepared to be Christ's counterpart by participating in the riches of the life and nature of Christ
The processed Triune God as the Spirit and the transformed tripartite man as the bride will become one and will speak as one person
The final marriage is the marriage of the processed, consummated, and dispensing Triune God as the Husband with the church as His bride
For eternity this universal couple will be the full manifestation of the Triune God expressed in all His glory
The consummation of the church will match the processed Triune God to be His complete expression and satisfaction for eternity
Only the church, which has the same life and nature that Christ has, can become Christ's counterpart for His satisfaction and rest in love
As Eve was the increase of Adam, so the church as the bride, the wife, is the increase of Christ as the Bridegroom, the Husband
Ephesians 5 reveals that today Christ is sanctifying the church that He might present the church to Himself as His counterpart
The believers' life is full of hope, not only for the Lord's coming but also to be resurrected and to be raptured
When the Lord comes back, there will be resurrection and rapture, and He will set up His judgment seat in the air to judge His believers
Concerning the believers' resurrection, rapture, and judgment in the future, the revelation in the New Testament is both clear and strong
In this lesson we shall see prophecies in the Bible concerning the believers' resurrection, rapture, and judgment
A believer experiences being raised up together with Christ at the time of his salvation; this is the resurrection of the spirit
Those who remain will be resurrected at the end of the great tribulation and will be raptured with the believers who are living at that time
All believers who are dead in Christ will participate in the resurrection from the dead at the Lord's coming back
The believers should aspire to obtain the best resurrection, the out-resurrection, as the goal and destination of their Christian life
Objectively speaking, to be raptured is to be taken, such as Enoch and Elijah, who were taken by God in the Old Testament
At that time God will transfigure the believer's body of humiliation to be conformed to the body of Christ's glory
The words unto death in verse 11 show that the strong man-child is composed of the dead and resurrected overcoming saints
Abel, who was the first martyr, the apostles, and all the martyrs and deceased overcomers are waiting for the time of resurrection
They will execute the Lord's judgment on the devil, God's enemy, casting him out of heaven , and shepherd all the nations with an iron rod
The second half of verse 4 goes on to explain, 'These were purchased from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb'
Luke 17:34 says, 'In that night there will be two on one bed; the one will be taken and the other will be left'
They will be raptured to the heavens to stand before the Son of Man, that is, to stand before the Savior on the heavenly Mount Zion
The believers should be watchful so that they may overcome to escape the coming great tribulation and to stand before the Son of Man
One is the rapture of the two witnesses who will be sent by God to prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth
On the last day of the great tribulation the two witnesses will be resurrected and raptured, going up into heaven in the cloud
These are the late overcomers who will pass through the great tribulation and overcome Antichrist and the worship of Antichrist
They will be martyred under the persecution of Antichrist and then resurrected to reign with Christ in the millennium
The purpose of the judgment seat of Christ is to determine who among the saved is worthy of a reward and who still needs discipline
The Lord repeats His warning so that the believers will seriously consider the reward or punishment to be rendered at His coming back
Before the judgment seat of Christ, the believers will give an account of themselves to God for the Lord to settle the accounts with them
They will give account of how they have lived before the Lord and the kind of work they have done for the Lord after they were saved
If the believers' heart is right, good, pure, and for God, then at the judgment seat of Christ they will be rewarded with praise from God
At the Lord's coming, this reward will be rendered to each one of the believers at the judgment seat of Christ after their rapture
In verse 14 Paul continues, 'If anyone's work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward'
Gold, silver, and precious stones signify the various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God
All these precious materials are the products of our participation in and enjoyment of Christ in our spirit through the Holy Spirit
Such a building work will be approved by the Lord, and the believers will be rewarded by the coming and the judging Lord
He will repay 'each man according to his doings,' that is, according to whether or not they lose their soul-life's enjoyment in this age
The manifestation of the kingdom in the millennium will be a reward to the followers who remain under the killing of the cross
It will be given to the believers at the Lord's coming, according to their works , and will be enjoyed in the coming kingdom
If they did not cast away their boldness, they would receive the promise of a great reward at the Lord's coming back
The great reward is the coming Sabbath rest , the enjoyment of Christ and the reign with Christ in the coming kingdom
Give them food refers to ministering the word of God and Christ as the life supply to the believers in the church
In the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens the Lord will set the faithful slave over all His possessions
Verses 22 and 23 reveal that the same reward will be given to the two-talented one as to the five-talented one
All these worthless materials are the product of the believers' natural man together with what they have collected from their background
These believers will not only lose their reward because of being disapproved, but their being saved will also be as through fire
The evil slave does not expect his master; hence, he does not like to live the kind of life that is for his master's coming
In Matthew 25:24-30 the one-talented slave, who was not faithful in using his gift, is rebuked by the Lord and punished
In studying these prophecies we should be concerned about our future, in particular how we shall meet the Lord and give an account to Him
The believers' life is full of hope, not only for the Lord's coming but also to be resurrected and to be raptured
The New Testament reveals that among saved believers there is still a difference between being defeated and overcoming
History has proven that whether in the age of the patriarchs, the age of law, or the age of grace, only a few among God's people were strong
These strong ones are considered a collective unit fighting the battle for God's interest and bringing God's kingdom to earth
God called the overcomers so that they may stand in place of the church for the accomplishment of God's economy
The believers' defeat and overcoming before the Lord will not be manifested until they are before the judgment seat of Christ
The believers who are not perfected and not matured in the church age will be perfected in the age of the millennium
They will not enter into the kingdom of the heavens but will depart from the Lord and will not participate in the glory of the kingdom
They will be excluded from the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age and will not receive the kingdom reward
In the same principle, in the parable of the virgins in Matthew 25 the Lord did not approve the foolish virgins
In the coming kingdom age the gift that the defeated believers received from the Lord in the church age will be taken away
The overcomers will be called to enter into glory to enjoy the Lord, but the defeated ones will be cast outside of this glory
In 1 Corinthians 3:15 Paul says, 'If anyone's work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire'
The believers whose Christian works are not approved by the judging Lord are still saved yet so as through fire
Those who overcome in the age of grace will receive the Lords reward in the coming age be in His presence in glory and even reign with Him
They will be excluded from the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age and will not receive the kingdom reward
They will also be cut off from the glory of the kingdom and from their enjoyment of the organic union with the Lord
If the believers are faithful in the age of grace today, they will become overcomers to enter into the joy of the Lord
In this lesson we will see the prophecies in the Bible concerning the overcoming believers receiving their reward
The entire universe is against people believing in the Lord; hence, to believe in the Lord is a real overcoming
According to the prophecies in the New Testament, the overcomers will be rewarded by the Lord in the kingdom age
It also denotes that the overcomers have attained to the out-resurrection from the dead , that is, the outstanding resurrection
The incorruptible crown, which the Lord will award to His overcoming saints who win the race, is a reward in addition to salvation
Believers need to run until the last moment of the race to have the assurance that they will be rewarded by the Lord at His appearing
In the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the overcomers will receive authority to rule over and shepherd the nations
These verses also indicate that the overcoming believers' reigning in the coming kingdom as a reward will differ in extent
In addition, according to the prophecy in Revelation 12:5 the man-child 'is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod'
In Matthew 10:39 the Lord Jesus said, 'He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it'
When the Lord comes back, Satan will be bound, and the earth will be recovered by Christ and will be under His reign
The 'salvation ready to be revealed at the last time,' in 1 Peter 1:5, is the end of the believers' faith, the salvation of their soul
The overcomers will inherit the kingdom of Christ and of God so that they can enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
Believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God , and in the church life they are living in the kingdom of God today
The millennium will be the kingdom in a way that is more practical than what we are experiencing in the church today
The kingdom here is the kingdom of God; it is also the kingdom of Christ, which will be inherited by the lovers of God as their reward
Christ, the hope of glory , was sown as the seed of glory into the believers at the time of their regeneration and is now growing
The momentary lightness of our affliction today works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory
Some believers have received eternal life and enjoy eternal life to a certain extent; however, they have not enjoyed it to the proper level
As a result when the Lord Jesus comes back and the kingdom is manifested they will lose the fuller enjoyment of the eternal life in that age
The overcomers will participate in the coming kingdom, inheriting eternal life and having a fuller enjoyment of the divine life
The book of life is a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings that God has prepared for them
The names of all the saints chosen by God and predestinated to partake of these blessings are written in this book
All God's chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life have a share in these initial portions to begin their spiritual life
If they mature in life in the church age, this earlier maturity in life will constitute a prize to be rewarded to them
Those who do not mature in life in the church age will not be able to enter into the millennial kingdom at the Lord's coming back
In the coming kingdom age only the names of those believers who live an overcoming life in the church age will remain in the book of life
Since the overcomers will inherit eternal life in the millennial kingdom, they will not be hurt by the second death
As a result of this judgment, they will be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death as the final settlement
They will be resurrected before the millennium to be rewarded with the crown of life and will no longer be touched by death
Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you'
The reward spoken of here is the kingdom reward to be given to the overcomers for their enjoyment in the coming kingdom, not in this age
Through their faith in the Son of God and the overcoming life in them, the believers can live an overcoming life
According to the prophecies in the New Testament, the overcomers will be rewarded by the Lord in the kingdom age
They will participate in the kingdom feast with the overcoming saints in the Old Testament, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
They will also inherit the kingdom of Christ and of God, be glorified with Christ, and inherit the eternal life
