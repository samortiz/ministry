   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In verse 7 Paul says, "For I had much joy and encouragement over your love, because the inward parts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The word "for" introduces the reason the apostle prays for Philemon's faith to operate in the saints v. 6 . It is because his love has refreshed the inward parts of the saints and has hence rendered the apostle much joy and encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Greek word rendered refreshed also means soothed, cheered.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 8 and 9 continue, "Wherefore, having much boldness in Christ to charge you what is fitting, because of love I rather entreat, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word for aged here may also be translated an ambassador Eph 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Prisoner here and in verse 23, and bonds in verse 13, indicate that this Epistle was written during imprisonment, the apostle's first imprisonment in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verses 10 and 11 Paul says, "I entreat you concerning my child whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus, who formerly was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During his imprisonment, Paul begot Onesimus through the Spirit with the eternal life of God John 3:3; 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Greek the name Onesimus means profitable, useful, helpful; it was a common name for slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was Philemon's purchased bondslave, who, according to Roman law, had no human rights.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He ran away from his master, committing a crime which could bring the death penalty.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While he was in prison at Rome with the apostle, he was saved through him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now the apostle sends him back with this Epistle to his master.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word useless in verse 11 also means not of service, profitless.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This refers to Onesimus's running away from Philemon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word useful also means of service, profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Onesimus became of service because he had been converted and was willing to return to Philemon.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 12 continues, "Whom I have sent back to you him, that is, my very heart."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Literally, the Greek word for heart means bowels, as in verses 7 and 20; Philippians 1:8; 2:1; and Colossians 3:12.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It signifies inward affection, tenderheartedness, compassions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul's inward affection and compassions went with Onesimus to Philemon.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verses 13 and 14 say, "Whom I resolved to keep with myself, that on your behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the gospel, but without your mind I did not want to do anything, that your goodness should not be as of necessity, but voluntary."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just as the Lord would not do anything without our consent, Paul would not keep Onesimus with him without Philemon's consent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verses 15 and 16 Paul says, "For perhaps therefore he was separated from you for an hour that you might fully have him forever, no longer as a slave, but above a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, and how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word "for" in verse 15 introduces the reason for the sending in verse 12.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word perhaps here is not only an expression of humility, but also one which shows no prejudice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This short Epistle serves the special purpose of showing us the equality in eternal life and divine love of all the members in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the age of Paul the life of Christ had annulled, among the believers, the strong institution of slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since the sentiment of the love of the Christian fellowship was so powerful and prevailing that the evil social order among fallen mankind was spontaneously ignored, any need for institutional emancipation was obviated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because of the divine birth and living by the divine life, all the believers in Christ had equal status in the church, which was the new man in Christ, with no discrimination between free and bond Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is based on three facts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, Christ's death on the cross has abolished the ordinances of the different ways of life for the creation of the one new man Eph 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second, we all have been baptized into Christ and made one in Him without any difference Gal 3:27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Third, in the new man Christ is all and in all Col 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a life with such a love in equal fellowship is well able to maintain good order in the church in Titus , carry out God's economy concerning the church in 1 Timothy , and stand against the tide of the church's decline in 2 Timothy .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is of the Lord's sovereignty that this Epistle was positioned after the three preceding books in the arrangement of the New Testament.</S>
