[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE FIRST STEP OF GOD'S SALVATION IN LIFE REGENERATION Scripture Reading: Gen 2:8-9; John 1:1, 4; Rom 5:10, 18b OUTLINE God's original desire and purpose: To be life to man Gen 2:8-9.
[3]  With the tree of life as a symbol v. 9; Rev 2:7b; 22:2, 14, 19.
[4]  God's salvation, with the life of Christ the life of God as the focus, meeting the need for authority power Rom 5:10.
[5]  In this Chinese New Year's conference we will specifically consider the subject of God's salvation in life.
[6]  Salvation in life means that God comes into us as life to save us.
[7]  This salvation in life is not outward but inward because it is God Himself coming into us to be our life.
[8]  It is no wonder that when the Lord Jesus came, He told us in John chapter six that He was the bread of life v. 35 ; then He said that those who eat Him shall live because of Him v. 57b . Not only so, John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God," and then verse 4 says, "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men." Moreover, John 10:10 says, "I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly." From these verses we can see clearly that the tree of life is God Himself.
[9]  After God created man, He wanted man to take in the tree of life; that is, He wanted man to receive God Himself into him to be his life supply.
[10]  B. God's Salvation, with the Life of Christ the Life of God as the Focus, Meeting the Need for Authority Power
[11]  Although man would want to be God's vessel, it is such a pity that in this universe there is an evil power, symbolized by the other tree in the garden.
[12]  In our surrounding environment, whether in our school, our office, or our society, there is an evil power enticing us not to do good but to do evil.
[13]  C. God's Redemption Dealing with Man's Fall; God's Salvation Carrying Out God's Intention, Which Is to Give Himself as the Spirit to Be Life to Man
[14]  Therefore, firstly we need redemption, and secondly we need salvation.
[15]  THE DEFINITION OF REGENERATION TO BE BEGOTTEN OF GOD AND TO HAVE GOD'S ETERNAL LIFE IN ADDITION TO MAN'S NATURAL LIFE
[16]  THE WAY TO EXPERIENCE REGENERATION A. To Be Born of Water to Be Convicted concerning Sin and to Repent and Confess Our Sins
[17]  Our being regenerated and having God living in us issue in the following eleven items.
[18]  The first issue of regeneration is that we become the children of God with the divine life and the divine nature John 1:12; 2 Pet 1:4; cf.
[19]  We have seen clearly that the unique heart's desire of God in the universe is to work Himself into us to be our life.
[20]  I. THE DEFINITION OF TRANSFORMATION A. Not Merely a Perceptible Change Outwardly in Behavior
[21]  Our transformation in the life of God is not merely a perceptible change outwardly in behavior.
[22]  The second step of transformation is sanctification, the sanctification of the Holy Spirit Rom 6:19, 22; 15:16 .
[23]  After our old man was buried through baptism, God set us apart and sanctified our regenerated new man.
[24]  Through Our Spirit, Which Is Mingled with the Spirit, Reaching All the Inward Parts of Our Being
[25]  God, who is Spirit, cannot dwell firstly in our body or in our soul; He has to take our spirit as His dwelling place.
[26]  The fourth step of transformation is a metabolic process Rom 12:2a .
[27]  Third, the way of transformation is to be transformed by the Spirit of the Lord into the same image as the Lord v. 18c . Today the Spirit of the Lord is no longer only the Spirit of God as in Genesis 1:2.
[28]  At that time the Spirit of God was purely the Spirit of God.
[29]  At that time He had only one element in Him, the divine element, the element of God.
[30]  THE ISSUE OF TRANSFORMATION A. Growth and Maturity in the Divine Life
[31]  When we are transformed, we obtain Christ as the element of the divine life and grow and mature in the divine life.
[32]  CHAPTER THREE THE THIRD STEP OF GOD'S SALVATION IN LIFE CONFORMATION Scripture Reading: Rom 8:29; Phil 3:10; 1 John 3:2 OUTLINE The definition of conformation: Conformation being the effect of transformation in life 2 Cor 3:18.
[33]  With the firstborn Son of God, the God-man who joins God to man, as the mold Rom 8:29.
[34]  The purpose of God's salvation in life: To conform the believers to the image of the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29.
[35]  To be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God being to be conformed to the image of the God-man, who is the union of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man: To be conformed to the glorious image of God as the Word who became flesh.
[36]  In order to be our life God was incarnated to accomplish redemption for us.
[37]  He died and resurrected, and in resurrection He was transfigured to become a life-giving Spirit that He might enter into us.
[38]  In this way He regenerated us, and we received Him as our life within.
[39]  When I was young, I observed that in July the northern Chinese would make a kind of dessert called "ch'iao-kuo."
[40]  To Live a Life of Denying Our Natural Life under the Crucifixion of Christ by Being Conformed to His Death
[41]  THE CONSUMMATION OF GOD'S SALVATION IN LIFE A. The Believers Being Absolutely Like God in God's Righteousness and Holiness in the Consummation of Their Maturity in Life
[42]  The consummation of God's salvation in life is the believers' absolute resemblance to God in His righteousness and holiness in the consummation of their maturity in life 1 John 3:2; Eph 4:24 .
[43]  CHAPTER FOUR THE FOURTH STEP OF GOD'S SALVATION IN LIFE GLORIFICATION Scripture Reading: Heb 2:10a; 1 Pet 5:10a; 2 Cor 3:18b; Rom 8:30 OUTLINE The definition of glorification: Objectively, glorification is that the redeemed believers will be brought into the glory of God to participate in the glory of God Heb 2:10a; 1 Pet 5:10a.
[44]  Subjectively, glorification is that the matured believers will manifest from within them, by their maturity in life, the glory of God as the element of their maturity in life Rom 8:17-18, 21; 2 Cor 4:17.
[45]  Regeneration is accomplished in our spirit, transformation is through our soul, and glorification is consummated in our body John 3:6b, Rom 12:2b; 8:23, 30.
[46]  The believers' entering into the glory of God to participate in the glory of God is their entering into God Himself to enjoy God Himself.
[47]  Hymns, #948, #949, and #972 are all on Christ as our hope of glory.
[48]  Stanza 1 of Hymns, #948 says, "Myst'ry hid from ages now revealed to me, / 'Tis the Christ of God's reality.
[49]  / He embodies God, and He is life to me, / And the glory of my hope He'll be."
[50]  It seems that today the glory of God is far away in the heavens, and we, the redeemed ones, are here on the earth; there is a great distance separating the two.
[51]  Today the Lord has given us gifts, and He wants us to apply the gifts and minister them to others.
[52]  Nevertheless, many of us live carelessly on the earth and do not use our gifts.
[53]  THE REALITY OF THE BELIEVERS' GLORIFICATION A. The Believers' Glorification Is Their Gaining of God Himself
