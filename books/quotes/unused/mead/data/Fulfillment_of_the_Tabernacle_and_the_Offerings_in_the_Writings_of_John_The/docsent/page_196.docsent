   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN 19 Scripture Reading: John 17:1, 11, 21-23 THE DIVINE GLORIFICATION AND THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In previous messages we have pointed out that the glorification in chapter seventeen is the building up of the Father's house in chapter fourteen, the spreading of the vine in chapter fifteen, and the growth of the new man in chapter sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that the glorification, the house, the vine, and the new man are one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Apparently the glorification for which the Lord Jesus prayed in John 17 has nothing to do with the Father's house, the vine, and the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This prayer, however, is the conclusion of the Lord's message given in the three foregoing chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a rule, a concluding prayer should strengthen the points of a message.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In keeping with this principle, we may say definitely that the subject of the Lord's prayer in chapter seventeen should refer to the main points given in His message.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, when the Lord prayed for His glorification, He also prayed for the building of the Father's house, the spreading of the vine, and the growing of the newborn child.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is important for us to see that the glorification of the Son for the glorification of the Father is the building of the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, this glorification is the spreading of the vine and the growth of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, "Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this single utterance concerning His glorification the Lord was praying concerning the building of the Father's house, the spreading of the vine, and the growth of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In chapters twelve through seventeen of the Gospel of John we see that the divine glorification is actually a matter of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to 12:24, the Lord Jesus fell into the ground as a grain of wheat, died, and then was raised up to produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These many grains are the glorification, the multiplication in resurrection, of the unique grain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The many grains produced out of the one grain are the glorification of this grain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We, the believers, are the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moreover, as the many grains, we are the members of the Body, the abodes of the Father's house, the branches of the vine, and the parts of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be sure, all this is a matter of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The glorification of the Son is for the glorification of the Father, and this glorification is the building of the Father's house, the spreading of the vine, and the growth of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This glorification is actually the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Recently some brothers testified that when they came to the church life, they saw the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They saw the building up of the Father's house on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may also say that they saw the many grains, the many abodes of the Father's house, the many branches of the vine, and the many parts of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not only glory this is glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Praise the Lord that we in the church life are in this marvelous divine glorification!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For many years I tried my best to understand the Lord's prayer in John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I wondered why the Lord began this prayer by asking the Father to glorify the Son so that the Son may glorify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How happy I am that we have been enlightened to see that the glorification in chapter seventeen is the building up of the Father's house, the spreading of the vine, and the growth of the new man!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After giving a message on the house, the vine, and the new man, the Lord went on to pray concerning the points He had covered in His message.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we are in this glory and glorification today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this message we shall go on to consider the last of the signs in John 14 through 17, the sign of the believers' oneness in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In His prayer the Lord prayed first for glorification, and then He prayed for oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Both glorification and oneness in chapter seventeen are signs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many Christians talk about oneness without knowing what oneness really is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their oneness may be merely a social union.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the oneness in John 17 does not signify that.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because the oneness here is divine, it signifies something divine.</S>
