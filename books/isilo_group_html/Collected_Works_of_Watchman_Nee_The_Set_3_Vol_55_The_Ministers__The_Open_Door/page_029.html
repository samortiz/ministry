We lack the experience of reality in our living, and we do not have enough light. Furthermore, because we lack fellowship with your locality, you are not able to feed us, and there is a general spreading of spiritual famine. I trust you are willing to supply us because of our immature spiritual condition. (We have not had any special conference recently, apart from the prayer and fellowship meetings, visitations, and baptisms.) We are writing this letter as a Macedonian call: "Come over...and help us!" In the future, if you have conferences, please notify us that we might attend. We pray we would be able to receive the truth.</p><p>This letter was written that you might know the condition of the churches in Dongsha. We are sending you a table listing the condition of the churches. Please grant our request and give us an answer. (There were too many signatures for this letter, so we have not published them here. Please see pages 72 and 73 for the table of the condition of the Christian assemblies in Dongsha.)</p><p>July 8, 1948</p><h2 class="head1">INWARD TENDENCY</h2><p>I am a recently saved sinner! God in His mercy has placed me among the members to learn to serve Him. Thanks and praise be to Him.</p><p>After Brother Lan Tsi-yi returned from Shanghai (where he attended the conference), he told us that the brothers and sisters in Shanghai (and its surrounding areas) had received great grace and are avidly consecrating themselves. Brother Lan hoped I would have the opportunity to go there and participate, and I also felt a tremendous inward desire to go. In addition, I have read Brother Yu Dao-sheng's letter from Zhanjiang to a brother here, written after the Young People's Edifying Meetings in the fall, telling him about the saints' hunger and thirst in pursuing the Lord. I felt as if oil had been added to my inward fire. My inward condition has become very desperate. (I intend to apply to the post office to transfer me to Shanghai for training.) I have sought God's will concerning this matter continually with the brothers and am still in the process of seeking His desire. I am afraid of falling into my personal likes due to my own zeal. I do not want to frustrate God's plan. I am also afraid of hesitation ahead because of too much analysis and thus neglecting God's arrangement. I am writing to tell you leading brothers my inward condition. I hope you will not ignore me, but will instead give me an answer. I will do what you counsel. May God bless you with abundant grace!</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Chang Guang-zhao<br />August 4, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: Gospel Court, Xiao-Dong Jia Alley, Hankow</p><ol class="bullet"><li><a class="text" target="_blank" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/cw-55/table3.pdf">Table of the Condition of the Churches in Shaoshing</a></li><li><a class="text" target="_blank" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/cw-55/map1.pdf">Map of the Churches in Shaoshing</a></li><li><a class="text" target="_blank" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/cw-55/table4.pdf">Table of the Condition of the Christian Assemblies in Dongsha</a></li><li><a class="text" target="_blank" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/cw-55/map2.pdf">Map of the Churches in Nansha, Chekiang</a></li></ol><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministers & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 29</div><br></body></html>
