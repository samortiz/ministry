Redemption,  forgiveness,  justification, and reconciliation are all included in His salvation. We were sinners and enemies toward God. We were sinners not merely by committing sins; we were sinners by constitution (Rom. 5:19; 2 Cor. 5:21). We became a constitution of sin and were the totality of sin. Thus, we needed not only to be forgiven but also to be terminated. Christ's death on the cross did a wonderful job of terminating our sinful constitution and taking away all our sinfulness. Based on such a death we have redemption and forgiveness, and as God's enemies we were reconciled to God. Now there is no contradiction between us and God; the situation between us and God has been altogether appeased. God is satisfied with the all-inclusive death of Christ, and this death also has satisfied us. Now we can thank Him for His all-inclusive death that has terminated our sinful constitution and has redeemed us from our sinfulness. Through such a redemption we have been forgiven, and God has justified us and even reconciled us, His enemies, to Himself. In such a situation the problem between us and God has been fully cleared up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Unto the Dynamic Salvation of God</H2><P>However, this is not all. Rather, at this juncture this dear One as the all-inclusive Spirit, who is the pneumatic Christ and the consummation of the Triune God, entered into us. Now we, the poor sinners and the enemies of God, have become such persons. The entire Triune God with all His processes has entered into us. This One is our Savior, our Lord, our Master, our God, our Father, and our all in all. Now He remains in us, abides in us (1 John 3:24b), lives in us (Gal. 2:20a), is being formed in us (4:19), and is making His home in our hearts (Eph. 3:17). Furthermore, He is transforming us and conforming us to His image (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29), making us the same as He is. Ultimately, He will glorify us with Himself as the glory (Col. 1:27).</P><P>In such a salvation, He is our everything and we are His expression. He and we, we and He, are one. We abide in Him and He abides in us (John 15:4a). We coinhere with Him: He lives in us and we live in Him. We and He are one person. Are we men or are we God? Actually, we are both. Are we divine or merely human? We are both; we are humanly divine and divinely human. We are human beings, and we are also divine beings. We are God-men. We are in the pneumatic Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God and the consummation of the Triune God. Not only so, the Triune God, Christ, and the consummated, compound Spirit are all in us. This is God's salvation.</P><P>We do not need to go to heaven. Heaven is within us. Heaven has come down to the earth. We do not love heaven, but we love the very Christ. Christ is much better than heaven. I assure you that where Christ is, heaven is there. We do not need to worry about heaven. We simply need to enjoy Christ. We are in heaven because we are in Christ. Christ is our heaven. Because of such a salvation, we are buoyant; we would never be down but would always be up.</P><P>Six thousand years ago God created man. He waited four thousand years, and then He became a man. Then, in the next two thousand years He made man one with Him practically. Today we are here as God-men. Hell is under our feet, and the lake of fire is far away. Because we are in Him, wherever He is, is heaven to us. He is buoyant, and we are buoyant in Him. Our sinful constitution has been terminated, and we have been redeemed from our sinfulness. Therefore, there is no problem between us and God. We have been justified by God and reconciled to God, and we are in an absolutely peaceful condition and situation with God. Based on this, we can enjoy Him, and He can flood into us to be our everything.</P><P>This is God's salvation, and this is the dynamic salvation. At times we may feel weak, dying, or even dead, but He is the resurrecting life (John 11:25). This resurrecting life counters our weakness and our deadness (2 Cor. 10:10). In ourselves we may become fatigued, weak, and dead; but He is in us as the resurrecting life. He resurrects us. This is God's salvation. God's salvation is nothing but God Himself making Himself our contents and making us a part of Him in the divine organic union. God's salvation is the saving God Himself plus His redemption. The redeeming and saving God Himself is our dynamic salvation. This is the heavenly view that we all need to see. With such a view, when we come to the Bible, it will become a new book to us.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
