   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A FEW POINTS OF FELLOWSHIP FOR THE ELDERS AND DEACONS WHO ARE NEW IN THE COORDINATION Being Responsible and Accurate in Speech</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Finally, I have a few points to fellowship with the elders and deacons who are new in the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, you must learn to speak accurately among the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No elder can be irresponsible in his speaking, and no deacon can be inaccurate in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We truly need to be rescued in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Elders and deacons need to learn to speak responsibly as well as accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Neither inaccurate words nor irresponsible words should be spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All inaccurate and irresponsible words are death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those of you who are elders must not make a judgment based on rumors.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You must remember that it is not easy to believe the truth, but it is easy to believe a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today in the church there are too many irresponsible words.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every word we speak must be accurate, and we need to be accountable for our words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Otherwise, there will surely be many problems in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not Disclosing Any Matter That Has Not Yet Been Formally Decided and Announced</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before any matter that has been discussed in the service meeting is formally announced in public, neither the elders nor the deacons should go out and talk about it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This does not mean that we have any dark secrets.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is simply for the benefit of others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is best not to talk to others about matters in the administration of the church before the matters are decided.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You should not disclose these matters even to someone as close to you as your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Otherwise, you will offend the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, suppose we have decided to have a conference but have not announced it yet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have made only an internal decision, we should not carelessly spread the news.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, we should wait until it is fully decided and formally announced before we have open fellowship about it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not take this matter lightly, but we must pay serious attention to this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regardless of what you hear and see, especially concerning the matters discussed in the meetings of the elders and co-workers, you should not spread them to others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not because we have anything dark to hide but is for the benefit of others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Any matter related to the administration of the church should remain only in the fellowship and should not be carelessly spread outside before it is decided.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we carelessly spread information, this shows that our learning is short.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we all would understand this limitation and hold on to it, then there would be no gossiping, no scandals, and no problems in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Learning to Ask More and Not Making Any Decisions on Our Own</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, all the saints in coordination must learn not to lightly make decisions on their own concerning matters about which they are not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The principle here is that no one should make any decision alone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even if we are already clear, we still should ask and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who should we ask?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should ask the elderly saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For important matters we surely need to seek fellowship from others and find a way to solve the problem together before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more we ask, the less likely we will be to make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In any case, it is better not to reach a decision by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the church there are so many people and so many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, it is not proper to make decisions on our own.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Never think that it is a shame to ask others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, humble yourself to be taught, and learn to ask often.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not Having Our Own Opinion and Our Own Way</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Another point is that we should not have our own opinion and our own way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must learn to put aside our own opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All our opinions must be put forth in fellowship in the service meeting or in the elders' meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we know that our way is not good, we should not try to get others to accommodate us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are all people of limitation, and what we know is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, we should learn while doing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The extent of our awareness of church affairs also shows the extent of our learning and of our being restricted before God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to learn to speak accurately, to not spread abroad the matters discussed in the meetings, to ask more questions, and to make less decisions on our own.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moreover, we should not hold on to our own opinions and our own ways.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to pay attention to and learn all these things.</S>
