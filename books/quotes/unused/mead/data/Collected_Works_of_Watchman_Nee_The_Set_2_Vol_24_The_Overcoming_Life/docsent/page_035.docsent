   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ephesians 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is no doubt that God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But where are these blessings?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brothers and sisters, the main question hinges on faith; we have to believe that God's Word is true.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is so simple, and there is nothing more to say about it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let us consider this matter from the Lord's view.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A great failure among Christians is that they cannot believe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Believing is substantiating the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once we see something, we substantiate it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once we believe, we substantiate the facts, and we have it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There was an Englishman called Mr. Webpeblo whose daughter died one day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When he returned from his daughter's funeral, he considered what the subject of his sermon should be the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He thought, "My daughter is dead, and the congregation knows that I am heartbroken.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I must give a sermon to comfort them."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He chose the text of 2 Corinthians 12:9 as his subject: "My grace is sufficient for you."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He divided his sermon into sections and subsections according to the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then he knelt down and prayed for God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But while he was praying, he asked himself, "Is God's grace sufficient for me?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If His grace is not sufficient for me, how can I say that it is?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I say that God's grace is sufficient, but if I sorrow and grieve over my daughter's death, God's grace is not sufficient for me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I cannot lie."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He thought of changing the subject, but there was no time to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He decided that he would just pray for God to make His grace sufficient for him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He prayed, "God, make Your grace sufficient for me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>O Lord, make Your grace sufficient for me."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He prayed for a long time, but nothing availed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He did not know what he should do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that moment, he lifted up his eyes and saw the same verse on the mantel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was a verse that his mother had placed there while he was away for the funeral.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The verse was printed in three colors.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The words My and you were printed in blue; the word sufficient was printed in red.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the other letters were printed in black.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suddenly, God's light dawned on him, and he confessed before the Lord, saying, "God, You said that Your grace is sufficient for me, but I said that Your grace is not sufficient for me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You have said that Your grace is sufficient for me, but I am still asking for Your grace to be sufficient for me."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He confessed his sin and thanked and praised the Lord, saying, "Your grace is sufficient for me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no need for me to pray for anything any longer."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was filled with joy and thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There was no need for him to pray any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The next day on the platform, he delivered the best sermon of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When someone asked him about the source of his power, he answered that it came after his daughter's funeral.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From that day on he was different, because he had learned to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The problem today is that we have heard that the Lord Jesus is the Head, yet we still pray for Him to be our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why would we not rather thank and praise Him, saying, "Lord, You are the Head"?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we would do this, the fact would be substantiated immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A brother once said, "Mr. Nee, you have spoken so much, but I have not received anything." I answered that it was because he was merely listening to my speaking; he should instead go to the Lord and ask Him to speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That evening he prayed to God, saying, "God, make me overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Lord, make me victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lord, I have a bad temper; help me to overcome."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While he was praying, he recalled the prayer of the leper who prayed to the Lord, saying, "If You are willing, You can cleanse me."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He prayed accordingly, "Lord, if You are willing, my temper will go away."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At that point, he realized that if the Lord was willing, there was nothing more to pray about.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord has accomplished everything, and He is willing; everything is done.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brothers and sisters, all that we have to do is believe 2 Corinthians 12:9 or Luke 18:27.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As long as we believe the words "I am willing," everything will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once we have the "I am willing," problems are behind us and tempers are no more.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even if our wives are dying from sickness, as long as the Lord has said, "I am willing," everything will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the meaning of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Believing is not asking for something; it is not asking for God to do something that He has already promised to do.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once a brother was speaking on the subject of overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After his message, he invited the brothers and sisters to ask any questions that they might have.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He noticed that a young sister was weeping in her seat but would not stand up to ask anything.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Another older lady stood up and asked, "For the past few years, I have been praying for victory but have never experienced it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What is wrong?"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The brother answered, "Nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You have prayed too much.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you change your prayer into praise, everything will be well."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After this, another man stood up and said, "I have been seeking victory for eleven years but have not overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>That lady's question and your answer enlightened me, and now I have it."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The brother then walked over to the side of the young sister and asked how she was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The girl answered that she also became clear after hearing the question and the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the meaning of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Brothers and sisters, please remember that letting go is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you do not have faith, you will not substantiate the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The color of a painting can be substantiated only by the eyes, the sound of an organ can be substantiated only by the ears, and the texture of an object can be substantiated only by the hands.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the same way, God's Word and His promises can be substantiated only by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We do not have to hesitantly pray to God, saying, "Lord, be my victory, be my life, and be my sanctification."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Rather, we should say to Him, "God, You are my victory.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I thank and praise You because You are my life and You are my sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I thank and praise You!"</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Brothers and sisters, we encounter temptations all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Many difficulties confront us and harsh words fall on our ears.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Should we pray for God to give us the strength to overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>No, we should say, "Lord, I thank and praise You because You are my victory!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Lord, You are overcoming for me.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I thank and praise You that You are withstanding everything for me.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Thank You that You are my Head and I am Your member.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You are the vine and I am a branch.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You are supplying me everything."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He is already supplying us everything according to His word!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When we were saved, we received one word out of the thousands that the Lord spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Some people were saved through John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Others were saved through John 5:24.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Still others were saved through Romans 10:10.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>As long as we have one word from the Lord, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The same is true with victory; all we need is just one out of His many words.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The brother mentioned earlier overcame through just three words: "I am willing."</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Some overcome through 2 Corinthians 12:9, while others overcome through Romans 6:14.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Still others overcome through 1 Corinthians 1:30.</S>
