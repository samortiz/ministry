   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JAMES MESSAGE NINE PRACTICAL VIRTUES OF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION 9 Scripture Reading: James 4:1-10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider what James says in 4:1-10 concerning dealing with pleasures, the world, and the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, before we consider these matters, I would like to give a further brief word on the contrast between wisdom as it is revealed in the writings of James and wisdom as revealed in the writings of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>TWO LEVELS OF WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1:5 James says, If anyone of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and does not reproach, and it will be given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then in 3:13 James says, Who is wise and understanding among you?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let him show by his good manner of life his works in meekness of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then in 3:17 James tells us, The wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, forbearing, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, unfeigned.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All these are characteristics of practical Christian perfection according to James view, which may have been somewhat under the influence of Old Testament precepts concerning man s behavior, morality, and ethics Prov 4:5-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What James says concerning wisdom is on the level of human character.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This wisdom does not attain to the height of the wisdom concerning the hidden mystery of God s New Testament economy regarding Christ and the church 1 Cor 2:6-8; Eph 3:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In his writing regarding wisdom, James does not say a word concerning Christ as life or concerning the church being built up through the experience of the riches of Christ for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, in the entire book of James the Spirit of God is mentioned only once 4:5 , and that in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The human spirit is not mentioned at all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By this we see that three crucial matters are not touched by James in his Epistle: Christ as life, the building up of the church through the riches of Christ, and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>James only mention of the Holy Spirit of God is in relation to striving against lust 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because of the shortage in these matters, there is no possibility for James to attain the height of wisdom that we see in the Epistles of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In his Epistle James seems to present wisdom as something given to us by God once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul s understanding of wisdom is much higher.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to Paul, wisdom is actually Christ Himself, the embodiment of God, who has been installed in us and who is now being continually transmitted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The installation was made once for all, but the transmission is not once for all; it is continuous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may use electricity as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Electricity is installed in a building once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But once electricity has been installed, there should be a continuous transmission of electricity from the power plant to the building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The wisdom taught by James is something given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the wisdom taught by Paul is Christ continually transmitting Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This divine transmission is the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For electricity to be transmitted into a building means that it is dispensed into the building to be used in different ways by those in the building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The principle is the same with Christ as wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As the embodiment of the Triune God, Christ has been installed in our tripartite being to be transmitted, dispensed, into us all the time so that we may live a life to express Christ and so that the church, the Body of Christ, may be built up as His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What heights Paul reaches in his writing concerning Christ as our wisdom from God!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is of the Lord s sovereignty that the Epistle of James comes after the fourteen Epistles of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Paul s Epistles we see a wisdom that is on the highest level.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In James Epistle we see a wisdom that is on another level, a level of human living.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we consider the picture of these two levels of wisdom, we shall know where we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should be in God s economy and in practical Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, we must be for God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s economy is to dispense Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God into us for the building up of the church as the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Practical Christian perfection is related to being complete and entire in our conduct, character, and behavior so that we may have a positive testimony before others and even in the sight of angels and demons.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have such practical Christian perfection, no one will be able to blame us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For God s economy, we need to be those with the practical Christian perfection portrayed by James in his Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now we can see why these two levels of wisdom one in the Epistles of Paul and the other in the Epistle of James are unveiled in the New Testament.</S>
