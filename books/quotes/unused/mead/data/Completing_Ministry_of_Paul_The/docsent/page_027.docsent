   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING GOD AS OUR CONTENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To do good things for others apart from the Lord is to be in the circles of our natural concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is yet another circle, separate and distinct from these, which we shall call God in you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not a concept; it is having God in us as our contents.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was the subject of our previous message.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this message we shall consider Christ as the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then the final message of this series will be on the church as the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As I have been preparing these messages, my heart has been aching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How much do the saints in the recovery have of God as their contents, of Christ as the mystery of God, and of the church as the mystery of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not very much.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Christianity these points have been much neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the fourteen Epistles of Paul were removed from the Bible, there would be a great lack.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even if we leave them in, yet remove from them these three points God as our contents, Christ as God s mystery, and the church as Christ s mystery Paul s writings would be simply an empty shell.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nonetheless, dear saints, these are the very points we have missed or neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In our daily life, how much attention do we pay to God as our contents?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not a matter of whether we are defeated or victorious; whether we are common or holy; whether we celebrate birthdays or insist on being scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The question is, Is God our contents?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not celebrate my grandchildren s birthdays; that saves us work, money, and effort, besides being in accordance with the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But these are not the issue; the question is, Where is God?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Is He our contents?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes the thought has come to me to buy a present for one of my grandchildren.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I would like to reward him for being such a good student and getting top honors.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have not done this, however; not because I wanted to be scriptural, but because God was not there.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God is in me, but when I was considering buying my grandson a present, He became absent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I had a sense of His moving in me, but in a way of absenting Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There was no still small voice telling me not to do that; only God s moving indicated that He was unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever we do, God must be our contents.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>NOT IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the whole Old Testament there is no mention that God would be in His chosen people as their contents.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The highest charge was that given to Abraham, when God said, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect Gen 17:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The highest possibility was for Abraham to walk before God, to be in God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Abraham even had God pay him a visit in Genesis 18.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God stayed with him for part of a day and even ate what Abraham prepared for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Have you realized, however, that God did not dwell in Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He did not even dwell in Abraham s tent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The best Abraham could enjoy was a temporary visit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then God departed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Enoch walked with God Gen 5:24 , but God did not make His home in him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we come to the New Testament, however, there is no such term as walking with God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It says instead, Walk... according to spirit Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The spirit in Romans 8 is a mingled person, God mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God as the Spirit is mingled with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is according to this spirit that we must walk.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Romans 8 tells us clearly that to walk according to spirit means to walk in God, in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How is this possible?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is because the Triune God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>John 14:23 says, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Father and the Son come, it is not to visit; it is to make an abode.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once this dear One comes, He never goes away; He stays forever.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this same chapter the Lord says that the Spirit of reality abides with you and shall be in you v. 17 ; He will be with you forever v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here is something extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How could God as the divine Person holy, righteous, glorious come into a sinful human being who is fallen, corrupted, ruined?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How could He enter into us and make us His home?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Such a thing could not have happened in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The procedure which made this possible had not yet been carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>THE WAY MADE POSSIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The New Testament opens with the birth of God into mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The first thing recorded is the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That God came to be born as a man is unbelievable!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But it happened.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From Isaiah 9:6 we know that the little child born in a manger in Bethlehem was the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What a wonder!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The very God grew up in a poor carpenter s home.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Here He passed through His childhood.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have an account of an episode when He was a child of twelve Luke 2:41-52 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For thirty years He lived there in that humble home.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then He came forth to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He thus sowed Himself into His followers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After three and a half years He went to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He was crucified to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As our substitute He died for us, shedding His blood for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>By that death He bruised the head of the serpent; He crushed the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>His death released His inner, divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After accomplishing this work, He went into the tomb and into Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After three days He emerged from death and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In resurrection He took another form.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>No longer is He in the flesh; though He still has a physical body, it is a body in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Now in resurrection He has become a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>No doubt this is the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But before this process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection the Spirit of God had no way to impart life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Now He is able and ready to impart the divine life into God s chosen people; thus He is indeed the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Though this story has become familiar to us, it is not a simple one.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God became incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He was born as an infant, grew up as a child, then lived as a man, experiencing all kinds of sufferings and trials.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>At the cross He settled our problem with sin, with Satan, and with death.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A flow of life came out of His crucified being.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then in resurrection He became this life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>John 7:39 says, The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>At that time crucifixion and resurrection had not yet been accomplished; once they were, the Spirit of God was able to impart life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Who is this life-giving Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The traditional teaching on the Trinity cannot account for all these items.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Christ cannot be separated from God, nor can He be separated from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The way has been paved, the procedure fully carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Now He is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>All that remains is for us to open and receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He comes in at once.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We then have within us as our contents the very God who is the Creator and is now the dispensing Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We are vessels containing the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Christ is the wrapping up of all the divine mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>While human language is inadequate to express the things we have seen, I believe enough has been said to help you if you have a heart to see.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Do not be held back by the shallow teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>You must go on to see these deeper truths concerning God s heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Who is this indwelling God?</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>He is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The attempts of the theologians to systematize these truths are a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The reputable scholars admit that in our Christian experience Christ is identical to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Yes, They are one; nonetheless, They are also two!</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Because this is a mystery, we cannot fully explain it; it corresponds, however, with our experience.</S>
