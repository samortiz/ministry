IN THE SPIRITUAL, PRACTICAL,<br>AND EXPERIENTIAL UNION</H2><P>We reign in life in the spiritual, practical, and experiential union. Romans 8:16a says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit." The Spirit of God today, the all-inclusive Spirit of the Triune God, dwells in our regenerated human spirit and works in our spirit. These two spirits are one; they live together, work together, and exist together as one mingled spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. BY THE MINGLED SPIRIT</H2><P>We reign in life by the mingled spirit. Romans 8:11b says, "He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THROUGH THE ABUNDANCE OF GRACE<br>AND THE ABUNDANCE OF THE GIFT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</H2><P>We reign in life in the spiritual, practical, and experiential union by the mingled spirit through the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness, with which God has gifted us (5:17b). Grace is for us to experience God's organic salvation, whereas the gift of righteousness is for God's judicial redemption.</P><P>The outline which begins in this message presents cases from Romans 6 through 16 to show that if we reign in life, we are in all the matters presented in chapters six through sixteen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In Being Sanctified</H2><P>We reign in life in being sanctified in the Spirit (6:19, 22; 15:16). To be in sanctification requires us to reign in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In Being Renewed</H2><P>We reign in life in being renewed by the mingled spirit in our mind (12:2b; Eph. 4:23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In Being Transformed</H2><P>We reign in life in being transformed to the image of Christ from glory to glory by the Lord Spirit (Rom. 12:2b; 2 Cor. 3:18).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
