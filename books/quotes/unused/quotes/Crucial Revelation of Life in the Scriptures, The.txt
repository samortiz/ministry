The Hebrew word for 'became' is the same word used in Genesis 19:26, which says that Lot's wife became a pillar of salt
Due to Satan's rebellion, the whole universe was judged by God, and through that judgment the earth became waste and void
In Genesis 1:2 there are four words describing the desolation of the earth under God's judgment: waste, void, darkness, and deep
With this background of death, the Scripture continues, 'And the Spirit of God brooded over the face of the waters'
The Spirit of God was brooding, stretching out His wings, over the death situation for the purpose of producing life
Today we reckon our days from the morning until the evening, but the Bible reckons a day from the evening until the morning
God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so
An expanse is a space full of air separating the waters beneath from the waters above for the producing of life
Formerly the waters under and the waters above were one but the air came in to separate these waters not for creation but for producing life
The grass, the herbs, and the trees are different kinds of plant or vegetable life, the life without consciousness
On the fifth day, there was the higher life with consciousness-the animal life in the death waters and the life that could fly in the air
The life that is able to move in the air is a transcendent life and is higher than the life in the death waters
In God's restoration and further creation in the universe, everything that God called into being was declared to be 'good'
God not only said that this was good, but He also blessed the animals that they might be fruitful and multiply
Eventually in the last verse of Genesis 1, 'God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good'
The starting light was for the unconscious life, the bigger light was for the conscious life, and the biggest light was for the divine life
The plant life, the animal life, the human life, and the divine life are the four levels of life in Genesis 1 and 2
The different types of plant life and animal life are also mentioned according to degree, from the lowest to the highest
After such a study, we can realize that God's intention in Genesis 1 was to show us that His heart's desire is in the matter of life
The record of God's creation is so simple because God did not mainly pay attention to all the items and aspects of His creation
James tells us that man uses his tongue not only to bless the Lord but also to curse men who have been made according to the likeness of God
We have to realize that all men have been made according to the likeness of God, so we should not despise any man
Man is the real commander-in-chief of the land, of the sea, and of the air, and he was made to represent God by life
God's eternal purpose is to have Himself expressed through the created human life, but Satan came in to frustrate this
The earth has to be subdued and conquered because of the rebellion against God on this earth instigated by Satan
In His creation of man, God desires to accomplish two things: He wants to express Himself, and He wants to get rid of His enemy, Satan
On the one hand, the Bible tells us clearly that God is invisible, yet on the other hand, the Bible tells us also that God has an image
Verse 26 uses the plural pronoun our and verse 27 uses the singular pronoun His showing that man was made in the image of the Triune God
Corinthians 3:18 tells us that we have to be transformed into the Lord's image from one degree of glory to another degree of glory
After the resurrection, the Lord Jesus told the disciples that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth
Because all the authority had been given to Him, Christ as the heavenly King sent His disciples to go and disciple all the nations
Revelation 20:4-5 tells us that the overcomers are sitting upon thrones, and authority to judge has been given to them
The resurrection of kingship is a reward to the overcomers that they may reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom
God's desire for man to express Him and for man to have dominion over His enemy can be realized only by God's life
We see in Genesis 2 that God placed man in front of the tree of life with the intention that man would take God as life into himself
In the Bible, the buildings built up by Satan were built with bricks, such as Babel and the treasure cities of Egypt
The husband many times is not a pleasure to the wife but a pressure, and the wife is a real pressure to the husband
The church can come into being only by the flowing of the divine life that transforms us into gold, pearls, and precious stones
We have to eat the tree of life and drink the river of water of life day after day so that we can be transformed into precious material
Their legs were broken, but when the soldier came to the Lord Jesus, He was already dead and there was no need to break His bones
As we are being transformed, we are also being built into the church to be the bride to satisfy Christ as His counterpart
God's purpose is fully fulfilled by the New Jerusalem, which is the result, the issue, the ultimate consummation of life
What we believers need is life, and this life is nothing less than the Triune God Himself, the Father in the Son and the Son as the Spirit
We have seen in the first two chapters of Genesis that from the very beginning Gods intention was that man would partake of the tree of life
The first verse of Genesis says, 'In the beginning God created ', and the last verse says that man was now 'in a coffin in Egypt'
We all need to say, 'Hallelujah for the Lamb,' because the Lamb fulfills the purpose of redemption and the purpose of life
Originally, this month was the seventh month, but the Lord made it to be the first month of the year, the beginning of all the months
Exodus 12 tells us that the Lord told the children of Israel to prepare the lamb according to every man's eating
Our intention is not to lower down the value of the Lord's redemption, but many Christians stress redemption and forget the matter of life
Without the covering of the blood, the children of Israel would be smitten by God in the same way that the Egyptians would
Their houses were sprinkled with the redeeming blood, and they were eating the meat of the lamb within their houses
When the Egyptians were being smitten by God, the children of Israel were enjoying the meat of the lamb under the covering of the blood
To be raw indicates no passing through of sufferings, and to be boiled means to suffer something merely under the human hand
Christ suffered not just under the hand of man as a kind of persecution, but under the hand of God as divine punishment, divine judgment
God did not tell the children of Israel to slay one lamb for the blood and then to have another lamb that they needed to learn to follow
God told them to slay one lamb, put the blood on the house, and under the covering of this blood eat this slain, roasted lamb
In this way the lamb would be one with the children of Israel, would be in them, and would be their constituent
The bread and the herbs signify that the Passover is composed not only of the animal life but also of the vegetable life, the plant life
The lamb is first for redemption, but after redemption is accomplished and experienced, the lamb becomes the tree of life to give us life
On the one hand, Christ is the redeeming life, the animal life, but on the other hand, Christ is the generating life, the plant life
Exodus 12 also tells us that they ate the lamb with their loins girded, with their shoes on their feet, and with their staff in their hand
After the children of Israel came out of Egypt, the matter of eating was of central importance in the wilderness
On the morning when the children of Israel first saw this small, round, white thing on the ground, they did not know what it was
The professors may know physics, mathematics, history, and geography but when it comes to Christ they would ask, 'What is this'?
As our manna, Christ has this element of the mingling of the animal life, the redeeming life, with the vegetable life, the generating life
The more we enjoy Christ as our heavenly food, the more we will become transparent and transformed into material for God's building
The Passover lamb was the beginning of the children of Israel's eating, and manna became the continuation of that eating for forty years
Every morning for forty years, wherever they went and wherever they were, manna was there for the children of Israel to eat
Day by day, week after week, month after month, and year after year we eat only one thing-Christ Himself as our heavenly manna
Some people buy groceries once a week and store these groceries in their refrigerator, but it is not possible to store manna in this way
They did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day
From Genesis 2 onward with the history of God's chosen people there were always the two matters of eating and drinking
Soon after they had eaten the Passover and crossed the Red Sea to come out of Egypt, they became short of water
Their being three days in the wilderness in thirst means that they were buried for three days, that they were in death
Because the children of Israel were short of water and came to a place of bitter waters, they began to murmur and complain
If a local church is short of spiritual water, be sure that there will be fighting, chiding, murmuring, and complaining there
If chiding, complaining, and murmuring are present in a local church, that is a proof of dryness, a proof of thirst
If we had no water to drink for three days, no doubt, many of us would be chiding, fighting, and murmuring because of the shortage of water
The statute and ordinance are not of the law of letters but are the living statute and ordinance of the drinking of the living water
The Corinthians were against one another because they were short of the sweet water with the resurrected Christ
If we are enjoying the resurrected Christ in our situation and the sweetness of the living water, we will not have any kind of disease
We should not have diseases or illness among us because the Lord is the healer to us, and His healing is in the sweet waters
Following their experience at Marah, the children of Israel came to Elim where there were twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees
It flows out of God into us, and through this flowing it grows upward to express the riches and victory of the divine life
In Exodus 15 the children of Israel enjoyed the sweet waters and in chapter sixteen they ate the heavenly manna
Because the children of Israel were short of water, again they began to chide with Moses and murmur against him
Christ as the living rock had to be smitten by the power of the law in order for the living water to flow out from Him
Christ was dealt with by the power of the law, and today as members of Christ we all have to be dealt with by God's authority
Numbers 20:1-13 tells us that after a certain time, the children of Israel came back again to Massah or Meribah
If they had not wandered but had gone on, they would never have had a repetition of their experience at Massah
Because they were wandering and would not go on, they came back again to the place of tempting the Lord and striving with the Lord
If a local church would not go on but would wander, sooner or later that church will have a repetition of this poor experience
Regardless of how poor or how bad their children are, do not go to their parents to say something bad about them
Balak thought it was the right time for him to hire Balaam to curse them because of the poor situation among them
Although Moses did something wrong by striking the rock, the Lord was merciful and the water still came out of the rock
We do not need to smite Him, but we need to call on Him, to speak to Him, to bid Him to give us the living water
The Lord Jesus tells us in John 4:14 that if we drink of Him, we will have a spring or a well of water within us
Numbers 21:18 says, 'The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves'
The American Standard Version tells us that the nobles of the people dug the well 'with the scepter, and with their staves'
The fifth occasion concerning the matter of drinking in the Old Testament is the occasion of Samson in Judges 15
The Spirit of the Lord had come upon Samson, enabling him to slay a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of an ass
Numbers 20 shows us that now that the rock has been cleft, we need to speak to the rock to enjoy its living water
In Numbers 21 is the well within us, requiring that we dig away all the dirt in our being so that the well has a free way to flow out
In Judges 15 Samson called on the Lord because he was dying of thirst, so God provided him with water to drink and he was revived
These instances constitute the first part of the children of Israel's drinking before the building up of the house of God and the city
The verses cited in the Scripture reading show us that the water for drinking is always related to either God's house or God's city
Psalm 368 says They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures
The river that makes the city glad has streams like the river in the garden of Eden that was one river parted into four heads or streams
The river flows, on the one hand, toward the Dead Sea to the east and on the other hand, toward the Mediterranean to the west
Finally, Isaiah 55 shows us that there is a call in the preaching of the gospel for everyone that thirsts to come to the waters
Genesis 2 shows us that the materials for the building up of the bride come out of the flow of the water of life
The living water flowed into them, and by the flow of this living water, they were transformed into precious materials for God's building
Once we get into the local church, the house, we have the deep sense that the flow within us, which had been lost, is now recovered
Those of us who are in the practical church life can testify that we have the sense of a deeper, wider, and richer flow
If the flow within us is occasional and not constant, this means that we are not in the house but in the wilderness
After the house was built, the water not only quenches the thirst but also waters the dry land, produces life, and heals the death
In the city within the house is the flowing river, not only to quench but also to water the dry land, produce life, and heal the death
In Ezekiel 47 the Lord gives us an exceedingly clear picture of the flowing of the living water out of the house of God
He was girded at the loins in Daniel because He was still working, but by the time of Revelation 1, the work is accomplished
His being a gold Man indicates that He is full of divinity, while His being a brass Man indicates that He is the judging One
In the book of Ezekiel the Lord Jesus is the judging One, the testing One, so He has the measuring line, the measuring reed
The entrance of the temple is toward the east, toward the rising of the sun, which means it is toward the glory
The American Standard Version tells us in the margin that 'ran out' can also be translated into 'trickled forth'
The more you are measured, tested, judged, and examined, the more you are possessed by the Lord and the deeper the flow becomes
The third time of measuring by the man of brass in Ezekiel 47 brings the level of water to the loins , a much deeper flow
If He would measure us in a complete way at one time, measuring four thousand cubits, we would not be able to take it
In the same way that a mother feeds her little child a little at a time, the Lord measures us little by little
The Lord Jesus would not measure you four thousand cubits immediately, but He has to measure you for a complete unit
Absolute means four thousand cubits of being measured by the Lord so that our entire being is taken over by Him
It is very convenient to walk on dry land, but to walk in a place where water is trickling forth is inconvenient
After you have been completely measured by the Lord, there is no need of your strength, your effort, or your struggle
The recovery of the building of the house starts from chapter forty, and by the end of chapter forty-six the building is complete
By the picture in Ezekiel 47, we can realize that the flow of the divine waters always comes out of the building of God
In most of the religious worship services in Christianity, the ones who attend have the sense or feeling of dryness, not of watering
When one enters into a local church which is in a proper situation, he will have the feeling and the sense of watering
The flow of the living water is out of the house because the source, the fountain, the spring, of the living water is within the house
In order for the flow of life to increase within us, within the house, the Lord as the man of brass has to measure us
We need to thank the Lord that Arabah, the desert, the dry land, the parched wilderness, has become the fountain of kids and of calves
We also need to praise the Lord that the Dead Sea, the Salt Sea, has become the living and fresh sea to produce a multitude of fish
The picture in Ezekiel 47 shows us that along with the river are the trees, the fish, the kids, the calves, the fishers, and their nets
When the water is risen to the loins, part of our being is possessed by the Lord, but another part is still free
If we are willing to be built up as the house of the Lord, we will have the Lord within us as the source of the living water
The flowing river waters the dry land, heals the dead sea, produces the trees, brings in the fish, and brings in the kids and the calves
If we are willing to be built up and measured again and again, we will have the trees, the fish, and the cattle
We have the food which includes the produce of the trees, the produce of the ranch, and the produce of the seas
When the Lord fed the five thousand, He fed them with something of the land, five loaves, and with something of the sea, two fish
The flow of the river issues in the riches of the land and of the sea the riches of the animal life and the plant life the riches of Christ
Isaiah 55:1 says, 'Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat'
Ezekiel 47 tells us that there were many trees on the banks of the river , showing us that when we come to the waters, we come to the food
At the end of the Bible is the river of water of life with the tree of life growing, spreading, and proceeding along its two sides
In Revelation 3 the Lord counseled the church in Laodicea to buy from Him although they were wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked
The last part of Isaiah 55:3 says, 'I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David'
We can realize by our fellowship thus far that the divine life is always involved with the matters of drinking and eating
In the previous chapters, we have seen the matter of life in the Old Testament with the tree as the food and the river as the drink
In order to make coats of the skins of the lambs, God probably killed the lambs in the presence of Adam and Eve
John 336 says He who believes in the Son has eternal life but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life but the wrath of God abides on him
John 5:21 says, 'For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wills'
In the New Testament we can see not only the reality of the tree of life but also the reality of the tree of knowledge
In Acts 5:20 the angel charged Peter and the apostles, 'Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life'
The constant word could be the tree of knowledge, but the instant words that the Lord speaks are spirit and life
Peter 1:23 says, 'Having been regenerated, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God'
The outward, objective knowledge that puffs up comes from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the source of death
When Paul talked about the letter, he was not referring to the letter of a newspaper, but to the letter of the Bible
He causes people to focus on items such as law, work, word, guides, knowledge, teaching, and the letter of the Bible
Some may ask, 'What is wrong with the law, the divine logos, guides, knowledge, teaching, and the letter of the Bible'?
When we contact the Bible, we need to contact Him not merely by exercising our mind but by exercising our spirit
In God's economy God does not present Himself to us as a kind of religion, but He presents Himself to us as food and drink
In Matthew 22 the Lord Jesus likened the gospel of God to a marriage or wedding feast, a great supper, prepared by a king for his son
In Luke 15 when the prodigal son returned the father told his slaves to put the best robe on him a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet
His father first adorned him to make him worthy, thus qualifying him to enter the father's house and feast with the father
After the outward adornment, the father told his slaves, 'Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry'
Before the prodigal son came back, he prepared himself to be treated as a slave, laboring day by day for his father
The Lord's table is a weekly proclamation, a declaration to the whole universe, that we daily enjoy Christ as our food and drink
During those one thousand years, the church is the bride, and after the one thousand years, the church is the wife
On the wedding day, there is the bridegroom and the bride; on the following day there is the husband and the wife
At this wedding feast the wine ran out, so the Lord Jesus asked the servants to fill up six stone waterpots with water
The Lord Jesus indicated to Nicodemus that to be born anew was not to go back to his mother's womb and come out again
Even if Nicodemus could go back to his mother's womb and come out again, he would still be the same Nicodemus, the same flesh
While chapter three is about a highly cultured very religious Godseeking Godfearing moral person chapter four is about an immoral woman
Although she was quite evil having had five husbands and living with a sixth who was not her husband she still tried to speak about religion
Because the Lord's word about her husband touched her conscience, she changed the conversation to the matter of worship
Eventually, the Lord revealed to her that this Spirit, who is God Himself, and who is the One we must worship, is the very living water
In chapter three of the Gospel of John we are told that we have to be born anew, that is, to have a second birth
In chapter four the Lord Jesus speaks about drinking , in chapter six about eating , and in chapter seven about drinking again
John 635 says I am the bread of life he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger and he who believes in Me shall by no means ever thirst
We need to be those who not only know how to eat and drink, but who are daily and even hourly eating and drinking
The day we received the Lord Jesus, we were born again, and we began to drink Christ as the wine and enjoy His life as a feast
In 1 Corinthians 10, Paul also spoke about drinking and eating, applying the type of the children of Israel to us
Finally in Revelation the promises to those who overcome are to eat the tree of life to enjoy the hidden manna and to dine with the Lord
In the previous chapters we have seen that the Lord is our life supply as water for us to drink and as food for us to eat
Isaiah 55:1 tells us that when we come to the waters we eat, and we 'buy wine and milk without money and without price'
The air sends water to the earth in the form of rain, and the water on the earth vaporizes and goes back to the air
When we stay in a room where a vaporizer is being used, we breathe in the air and get the water because the water is in the air
The food is in the water, the water is in the air, the air is the breath, the breath is the Spirit, and the Spirit is God
In Ezekiel 47 is the house of God the building of God but in chapter thirtyseven the Lords children are pictured as disjointed dry bones
The Lord comes as the wind, we receive Him as the breath, He gets into us as the Spirit, and the Spirit is life
After Ezekiel's prophesying, 'There was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone'
There should be a proper noise where everyone speaks, everyone prays, everyone praises, and everyone gives thanks
After the bones came together the sinews and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them
Whether we were unsaved sinners or backslidden believers, our situation was that we were dead and buried in a grave
Ezekiel prophesied again, 'And the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army'
The bones become the army fighting the battle, and eventually they become the habitation for God's dwelling to express God
The army is for the dominion to deal with God's enemy, and the dwelling place is for the expression, the image, of God
The Lord charged Ezekiel to prophesy a second time and say Come from the four winds O breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live
In the New Testament, the Gospel of John tells us that the Lord Jesus came back on the evening of His resurrection to the disciples
The breath of life will come into the two witnesses and resurrect them during the time of the great tribulation
Thessalonians 2:8 tells us that when the Lord Jesus comes back, He will slay the Antichrist by the breath of His mouth, the Spirit
Spiritually speaking, we can eat and drink everywhere because our spiritual eating is in our drinking, and the drinking is in the breathing
Many so-called Bible teachers cannot give any practical help in the matter of life because they themselves are not clear about what life is
The tree is food to eat, the river is water to drink, the breath is air to breathe, and the seed is a container of life
The word seed has an all-inclusive meaning since it is the embodiment of life and includes all things related to life
Genesis 1:11-12 tells us that the earth brought forth 'herb yielding seed,' and verse 29 refers to 'tree yielding seed'
According to God's original arrangement, He gave only the herb yielding seed and the tree yielding seed to man for food
Whatever man touches whatever man takes in whatever man eats must be something of life and something producing lifesomething yielding seed
Whatever man contacts, whatever man takes into himself, whatever man eats for his maintenance, must be something yielding seed
We may also say that the life in the seed is for resurrection, for spreading, for transforming, and for growth
In John 12:24, the Lord Jesus indicated that He was the unique grain, or seed, who fell into the earth and died
Human words are not adequate to explain the marvelous and deep mystery of the rich, all-inclusive seed of life
We should not have the ambition to be merely Bible teachers, but we have to be seeds for the reproduction of life
In 1 Corinthians the Apostle Paul used three phrases to describe his relationship with them I fed you I planted and I have begotten you
After being sown into us, the seed of life needs to grow, and its growth needs our cooperation, our coordination
If we are going to coordinate with the growth of the seed within us we have to deal with our conscience our mind our emotion and our will
The Lord Jesus gave four illustrations of the kind of heart we might have: the wayside, the rocky places, the thorns, and the good earth
The seed can only fall on the surface where the birds, signifying the evil one, Satan, can come and snatch it away
Satan the evil one in the air realizes that the seed cannot get into the heart that is like the wayside so he comes to snatch away the seed
If the earth is deep, the surface may dry up, but there will still be some moisture or water underneath that maintains the growth in life
The thorns signify the anxiety of the age, the deceitfulness of riches, and the pleasures of life that choke the seed
The wayside, the rocky places, and the thorns have to be dealt with thoroughly in order for us to have a good heart
Such a heart gives every inch of its ground to receive the word that the word may grow, bear fruit, and produce even a hundredfold
The treasure hidden in the field must consist of gold or precious stones, the materials for the building of the church and the New Jerusalem
He proceeded to reveal that the church is Gods farm Gods building and that we need to build the church with gold silver and precious stones
The church, the house of God, must be built with gold, silver, and precious stones, precious materials produced from Christ growing in us
Both in Matthew 13 and 1 Corinthians 3 there are the concepts of the seed of life, the growth in life, and the transformation in life
He regenerated us to be the firstfruit of His new creation by imparting His divine life into our being through the implanted word of life
In between Genesis and Revelation is the sowing of the seed, the growth of the seed, and the transformation in life from this growth
The term the Spirit of life is mentioned only once in the New Testament Romans 82 refers to the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus
Revelation 11:11 tells us that the pneuma of life, the breath of life, comes into the two witnesses, who had been killed by Antichrist
It is very difficult to define what life is, but thank the Lord that in the Bible we can trace something of the divine life
The Spirit of God today is the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, and this Spirit of life is the breath of life
The Bible tells us a mystery which we can never understand adequately, that is, that our God is the Triune God
Matthew 28:19 tells us to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
The three persons of the Godhead are not three separate beings just as man's spirit, soul, and body are not three separate parts
With God there are three persons, but we should not think that these three persons are three separate, divine beings
While the three of the Godhead are distinct, it is wrong, according to the truth of the Scriptures, to say that they are separate
The Bible tells us clearly that God is uniquely one, but that He is triune with three persons-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
In Isaiah 9:6 the Son is called the everlasting Father, and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit
His being sent by the Father indicates that the Father is the source, out of which the Son flowed to be among mankind
He indicated that He had to pass through death and enter into resurrection so that He could come into us as the Spirit, as the breath
In the evening on the day of resurrection He came to the disciples, breathed into them, and said, 'Receive the Holy Breath'
The essence of a certain medicine needs to be put in the form of a pill so it can be dispensed into a sick patient
The Spirit as the third person of the Godhead is for God's application of His essence to dispense Himself into us
The first aspect is that God is Spirit in essence, and the second aspect is that God in His Trinity is the Spirit for application
The Redeemer the Savior who passed through incarnation human living crucifixion resurrection and ascension became a lifegiving Spirit
God is Spirit, the third person of the Godhead is Spirit, Christ was made a life-giving Spirit, and the divine word is Spirit
The first aspect is the essence, the second is the application, the third is the life-giving, and the fourth is the word for feeding
The Spirit is living and real but rather abstract, mysterious, intangible, and difficult for people to apprehend
The four aspects of the divine Spirit that we have seen are for one purpose-to dispense God into us as our life and as our life supply
There is no need for a person to regulate the peach tree and tell it, 'Peach tree, you should not bring forth apples
Within the life law there is the spontaneous power, the strength, and the energy to produce something according to the regulating law
Scientists investigate the laws that operate in nature, such as the law of gravity and the law of aerodynamics
Dogs bark according to the law of the dog life, and chickens lay eggs according to the law of the chicken life
As believers in Christ, we have this higher, positive law, the law of life, which is versus the negative law, the law of sin and of death
We may say that the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ are synonyms, but there is still some difference between these terms
You may say that you have the life of the Son of God, but this life has not been developed in you to its fullness
You may have the potential to be rich in Christ, but you may still be poor in the experience and riches of Christ
Paul said that we who have the firstfruit of the Spirit are 'eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body'
Conybeare tells us that the word for bountiful supply in Greek literally means the supplying of all the needs of the chorus by the choragus
Seemingly they are more free than the saints who are more mature in the divine life, but actually they are more bound
Many of us are bound by religion and religious practices, so we need to experience more of the liberating Spirit
You may want to say something to a brother who has the habit of talking, but you may not get the chance because of his habit
He may be bound by his natural habit and not experience the boldness in the Lord and the release of the spirit
If four or five brothers come together to pray-read the word in someone's apartment, there is no need for them to shout
We should shout, not according to our habit but according to the situation, the condition, the environment, and the atmosphere
When he comes to a meeting of three or four hundred people, he needs the boldness to release his spirit in a living way
In a larger meeting, it will be easier for this brother to remain in his habit and to pray-read with the release of his habit of being quiet
If we are enjoying the liberating Spirit, we will speak when there is a need to speak and be quiet when we need to be quiet
The transformation mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3:18 is not something of teaching but something of the changing life
Verse 17 of 2 Corinthians 3 tells us that the Lord is the Spirit, and then it refers to the Spirit of the Lord
In 2 Corinthians 3:17-18 the Spirit is mentioned in three aspects: 1) the Lord is the Spirit; 2) the Spirit of the Lord; 3) the Lord Spirit
As we are experiencing the divine life in our daily life, we will spontaneously have the sense that the Lord is the Spirit
If we do not have the knowledge or experience of a certain piece of machinery, we will not be able to understand it
We need to enjoy the liberating Spirit and the transforming Spirit, who transforms us from one degree of glory to another degree
We have pointed out that transformation is not merely an outward change but an inward change of life, a metabolic change
Ephesians 4 tells us we need to put off the old man, be renewed in the spirit of our mind, and put on the new man
Sanctification by the blood is merely a change in position and condition outwardly, not a change in disposition inwardly
When we confessed our sins and accepted Christ as our Savior, the blood of Christ sprinkled us and sanctified us, changing our position
We are no longer under God's condemnation, but we have been justified in the eyes of God by the blood of Christ
We do not only need the outward sanctification by the blood but we also need the inward sanctification by the Spirit
The Holy Spirit sanctifies us inwardly in our disposition with the substance of Christ, with what Christ is, with the essence of God
The Spirit puts more and more of Christ into us so that we become mingled with Christ just as the tea is mingled with the water
We need to allow Christ to dispense Himself into us in a full way so that we are sanctified, or Christified, in an intensified way
When something of God's divine being is dispensed into us, we are sanctified, that is, we are made holy with God's very essence
The sanctification of the Spirit is not an outward change, but an inward addition of God's very essence into our being
The anointing of the Holy Spirit is not merely a cleansing but a painting of the divine elements of Christ into our being
While the Holy Spirit is anointing us, He kills the negative things in our being, and He purifies and cleanses us with all that Christ is
The holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-25 is a full type of the compound Spirit of God with which we are anointed
The more the Holy Spirit anoints us with Christ, the more we become the same as Christ and the more we become Christ
We become Christ because the essence and the element of Christ has been anointed into us, has been added into us
The husky and tall American men have grown in their human life because they have enjoyed the riches of America
By taking in all the rich food of America, an American child will grow and be changed metabolically over a period of time
We need to cooperate with the Spirit of life, who is dispensing more and more of Christ into us little by little in many ways
As Christ is added into our being through the transforming sanctifying and anointing Spirit the fruit of the Spirit will come forth from us
The more we are renewed, transformed, sanctified, and anointed by the Holy Spirit, the more fruit we will bear of the Spirit
The fruit of the Spirit is singular, but the expression of the fruit is listed in Galatians 5:22-23 with nine items as illustrations
He was dressed with a little cap on his head and a jacket, and he was trained to walk on two feet instead of four
Just like the monkey who behaved like a man, we may behave like a 'man' in the meetings and like a 'monkey' outside the meetings
The things of the Father are Christ's, and the Spirit receives all the things of the Father from Christ to show us
Corinthians 13:11 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
The love of God is God Himself; the grace of Christ is Christ Himself; and the fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself
The love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit are not three separate matters, but three aspects of one thing
The Spirit of life communicates and transmits all that God is in Christ into us for our enjoyment that we may gain God in a full way
We have seen the tree of life, the water of life, the breath of life, the seed of life, and the Spirit of life
There are four categories of life in Genesis 1 and 2: the vegetable life, the animal life, the human life, and the divine life
The plant life is for the animal life, the animal life is for the human life, and the human life is for the divine life
Only the human life is qualified to contain the divine life because the human life is in the likeness of the divine life
All the positive attributes features and aspects of the vegetable life animal life and human life are shadows or pictures of the divine life
In addition to the death and the life of the Son of God, there are the two matters of reconciliation and salvation
We can say that we have been saved from the lake of fire and from God's condemnation through the redeeming blood of Christ
After we have been saved from God's condemnation and from the lake of fire, we need to be saved first from the law of sin
From 1920 through 1925, the Lord did something miraculous in China by saving a number of college and high school students
A teenager did not have the freedom to say anything in the presence of his elders, and he could not sit down until they left his presence
If we are sloppy careless or loose this proves that we cannot fulfill Gods requirements according to His divine standard so death is with us
To be living does not mean that we are merely active or lively but that we are able to fulfill God's requirements
A shortage of ability to fulfill the Lord's requirements according to His divine standard means that we are short of life
We need to be saved from the shortage of ability to glorify Him, to please Him, and to fulfill His requirements
Also, the book of Exodus tells us that God's ultimate judgment on Egypt was for all the firstborn ones to be killed
His death solves the problem of our sin, and His resurrection imparts to us His life in order to vanquish and to swallow up death
When the Lord did not want to go, they were puzzled, and when the Lord was ready to go, they thought that it was not necessary to go
What the Lord would not do, the disciples would do, and what the Lord would do, the disciples would not agree with
If we easily misunderstand others and are easily offended and unhappy with others, this proves that we are weak and dead
After her conversation with the Lord Jesus, Martha went away and told her sister Mary that the Lord was there and that He was calling her
We have to realize that if we partake of Christ and enjoy Him as our life our whole being our whole human living will be absolutely changed
When every part of our being is under the control and inner regulation of Christ as the divine inner life, this is the real freedom
Our being able to do household duties at the proper times with joy is a proof that we have the life power within us
We need to enjoy the life power, the power of the Lord's resurrection, to have a proper human living in our daily life
In Ezekiel 37 the bones were dried up thoroughly, so every bone was individual and separate from the other bones
We are still so weak, loose, sloppy, careless, independent, individualistic, and unwilling to be coordinated with others
We should not think that it is necessary to pray and fast for a period of time to undergo the process of transformation
Bit by bit the transformation of the inner life works in a very normal and ordinary way, even with the small things in our daily life
We cannot see much growth in life in a young child from day to day, but after a year we are able to see some growth in life
After a certain period of time, we are able to see the blossoms and the fruit, the evidence of the growth of life
If we mean business with the Lord to enjoy Christ as the life within us, there should be a change with us after a certain period of time
We will be saved from all the weakness and inability to meet God's requirements according to His divine standard
Verses 12 and 13 tell us that the Lord is rich to all who call upon Him and that whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved
In the previous chapters we have seen something concerning the matter of life in the writings of John and Paul
Whether we are strong or weak, whether we stand or fall, from the day we received the Lord Jesus, faith remains with us always
God as the divine power passed through creation, redemption, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit
The one man Jesus could die on behalf of all men to accomplish an eternal redemption because of the divine power
They include the law of life humility wisdom rejoicing love joy hope submission goodness meekness kindness longsuffering and peace
Within the power of the divine life as the seed in us are all the things necessary for the growth of the divine life
The divine power, the power of life, includes all things needed not only for life inwardly, but also for godliness outwardly
Other precious and exceedingly great promises are in Matthew 28:20; John 6:57; 7:38-39; 10:28-29; 14:19-20, 23; 15:5; and 16:13-15
God has called us not merely by His gospel, His grace, or His mercy, but He has called us to His own glory and virtue
In 2 Peter 1:5, Peter says, 'And for this very reason also, adding all diligence, supply bountifully in your faith '
The manna was sent by God, but the children of Israel had to exercise themselves diligently to rise up early to go out and gather the manna
God could send the manna to the earth, but He would not put the manna directly into the mouths of the children of Israel
God is gracious, yet regardless of how gracious He is and how sufficient His grace is, we still need to exercise ourselves
The second secret is that, realizing that God has given us everything, we must cooperate with God to do our part
The third secret of life is that, as we cooperate with God, we should not do anything outside of what He has given
By pray-reading the promises we partake of and enjoy the divine nature, and by partaking of the divine nature we develop in life
We need virtue to be developed first, then for further development of virtue, we need knowledge, the proper knowledge
Knowledge in 2 Peter 1:6 refers to the knowledge of Christ, that is, the knowing of Christ in a full and excellent way
The last verse of this book confirms this by saying, 'But grow in grace and the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ'
The fifth secret revealed in 2 Peter 1 is that by enjoying the divine nature, we enter into the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ
We should not think that if we are idle with no development after we are saved that we will enter into the kingdom of Christ
We have seen three main items in 2 Peter 1: the seed of faith, the divine power, which is the growing power, and the precious promises
God has given the seed, the growing power, and the promises that He will send the rain, the growth, and the harvest if we cooperate with Him
With God's giving, we must be diligent to develop the seed of faith by taking the promises, by picking up His word
We have the seed, the growing power, and the promises that God will send the rain, give the growth, and give the harvest
Now we need to develop the seed by taking His promises, by pray-reading the word of His promises, that we may enjoy His divine nature
