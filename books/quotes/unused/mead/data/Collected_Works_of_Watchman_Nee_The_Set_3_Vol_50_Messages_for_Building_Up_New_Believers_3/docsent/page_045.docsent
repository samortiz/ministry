   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FORGIVENESS IN FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is a third kind of forgiveness in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We call this forgiveness in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First John 1:7-9 says, "If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First John 2:1-2 continues, "My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The forgiveness spoken of in this portion of the Word is neither the forgiveness at the time of our salvation nor the forgiveness pronounced by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This forgiveness is different from the above two kinds of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After one believes in the Lord and has become a child of God, often he still needs God's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the forgiveness spoken of in an earlier chapter Volume 49, Chapter 21 , in which the ashes of the red heifer are applied.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After we believe in the Lord, confess our Christian faith, and receive eternal forgiveness, we may still sin at times.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may become weak and encounter setbacks before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This kind of sin produces a barrier in our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A. The Characteristic of Life</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Delighting in Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All biologists know that life has two basic characteristics: First, it strives to live, to preserve itself, to continue its existence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Life abhors death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second, it does not want to be cut off from fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Life abhors isolation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a chicken is left by itself, it will be sullen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you put it with many other chickens, it will become lively.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you keep a prisoner in isolation, he will suffer because he cannot have fellowship with other men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man is a living creature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Like other living creatures, he strives to preserve his own life, and he also delights in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. Frustrations to the Fellowship of Life</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We believe that the blood of the Lord Jesus has saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is absolutely no question as far as our life is concerned; we are saved and are eternally forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This part does not pose any problem to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But another matter may pose a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After we have believed in the Lord and are saved, our fellowship with God and with other children of God can be interrupted if we offend Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What does it mean for our fellowship to be interrupted?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose a little girl goes to the kitchen secretly and steals the food her mother has prepared, or some fruit from the cabinet, or other things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose she eats all the food while her mother is away.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She may close the door of the kitchen properly, clean her face, and wipe the table, but a transgression has been committed!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before this she was very intimate with her mother every night.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But on this night, she may not be as intimate as before because she has stolen something.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When her mother calls her from upstairs, her heart may start bounding downstairs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She may think that her mother is going to spank her.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Her mother may even offer her some food, but she will not have any taste for it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She will be in constant fear that her mother knows what she has done.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She may try to hide herself from her mother.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this we see that the child's fellowship with her mother has been interrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After she steals the food, she does not cease to be her mother's daughter; she is still a daughter, but her fellowship with her mother has been interrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After you have sinned, you do not cease to be a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You are still God's child, but your fellowship with Him has been interrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sin cuts off fellow- ship immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You no longer have a conscience that is void of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You must have a pure conscience before you can enjoy a continuous fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If your conscience is offended, you have no way to fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>C. How to Restore Our Fellowship with God</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A child of God does not lose his status as a child after he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, he may lose his fellowship with God through his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is a forgiveness, however, which we call forgiveness in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We call it forgiveness in fellow- ship because only when one turns back to God and confesses his sins can his fellowship with God be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Otherwise, he has no way to fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He may not even be able to pray to God or say amen when others pray.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He will suffer very much within himself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What should one do?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Take the earlier example of the little girl who stole from her mother.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She must go to her mother and say, "I have stolen the biscuits you have prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I have eaten the fruit you placed on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I should not have done this."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>She has to stand on the ground of her mother and acknowledge her sin as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>She must give sin the proper name.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>She must say, "Please forgive my sins!"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the same way, we must come to God and say, "I have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I have sinned against You in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Please forgive me!"</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Such a forgiveness has nothing to do with eternal forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It has to do with our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is why we call it forgiveness in fellowship.</S>
