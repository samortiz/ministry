   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Supplying the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>with the Element of the All-inclusive Christ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through transformation we are being constituted with the all-inclusive Christ as the life element.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are also being supplied with the element of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen that the all-inclusive Christ, the Triune God embodied in humanity as the source of life, is signified by the tree of life Gen 2:9; Rev 2:7; 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After God created the heavens, the earth, and man, God put man before a tree called the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man was created by God in God's image and after God's likeness Gen 1:26 , but this man did not have God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, we see a tree signifying God as life and a man who did not have God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God said that every tree in the garden was pleasant to the sight and good for food, including the tree of life 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's desire is to mingle Himself with man, and the way for man to be mingled with Him is by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In God's wisdom, He made Himself eatable John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many Christians have never heard that God is eatable.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How could Adam be mingled with that life tree?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How could that life tree get into Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The only way was by Adam's eating.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is interesting to note that God created man with a stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we did not have a stomach, we would never feel hungry; we would never sense that we need to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In certain senses, our stomach can be troublesome to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many sicknesses and diseases come from the wrong kind of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the tree of life is something that is altogether and purely good.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we eat this tree, we will get life and be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By eating the tree of life Rev 2:7b , we can be mingled with God, and this mingling is the constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our physical body is being constituted with the life supply every day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When food is added into our stomach, the constituting work is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we are growing up in life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this constituting process, there is a kind of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the morning we eat breakfast, and during the day what we have eaten is being digested and assimilated into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The life element is constituting our being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The food we eat does a constituting work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a picture of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to eat Christ as the living bread from heaven embodied in His words of eternal life John 6:57b-58a, 51, 68 , as the tree of life Rev 2:7b , and as the hidden manna v. 17b . By eating Christ we can be constituted and supplied with Him as our life element so that we can grow in life and be transformed in life.</S>
