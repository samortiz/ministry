   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On this basis, I would say that we all need to preach the gold bar gospel and teach the gold bar truths.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to teach the truths of the processed and consummated Triune God and of the enjoyment of the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by living in the organism of the divine Trinity and participating in the dispensing of the divine Trinity.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Scatter all the Life-studies throughout your house so that every room has some Life-studies in it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should only spend about five minutes to read the front page of the newspaper to get the proper knowledge of the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Besides eating, sleeping, exercising for our health, and working, we should use all our time to dive into the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you open to any page of the Recovery Version and read one of the notes, you will receive the profit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have the Recovery Version of the New Testament, the Life-studies, The Conclusion of the New Testament, and the Truth Lessons, systematizing the entire Bible into one hundred ninety-two lessons.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our preaching and teaching should have no limit of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We preach and teach by diving into the truths.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not think that it is only the job of the full-time workers to go out to preach and to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all are priests of God, branches of Christ, and slaves of the Lord, so every day at any time and any place we preach and teach what the Lord has revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to somewhat forget about our own enjoyment and think about the Lord s propagation and the Lord s increase.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Think about the thousands of dear Christian brothers in your vicinity who need the truth which you have.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They need the truth in the Recovery Version and in the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They need us to go to them to read one page or one paragraph of our publications with them.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even the smallest ones among us should do this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Berkeley, California, many young teenagers who passed through the summer school to study the truths concerning God s economy went to the campus to talk to the professors and students about the Triune God, about God s creation of man being for the purpose of expressing Him, and about man being a vessel, a container, to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That surprised many people on the campus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This should not only be done once in a while, but once a week on the weekends.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hundreds of young boys and girls can go to the campus to tell others who the Triune God is and why He created them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If they cannot explain that much, they can open the Recovery Version to let the ones they contact read something for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the saints in the recovery, old and young alike, need to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Go to visit your neighbor with your Recovery Version and take with you many of the rainbow booklets we have published, which contain a slightly edited version of the Life-study Messages, for the purpose of distribution.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have thousands of copies of these booklets in storage and are continuing to print more, but many of the churches have not picked up the burden to carry out the distribution.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not a requirement for you to read all the booklets before you go to distribute them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Put some booklets into your pocket and go to your neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The booklets you choose will sovereignly be the right ones for your neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The titles of these booklets are capturing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By reading some of the titles of the booklets to a new one, they will be attracted to the truths contained in them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have booklets with titles such as: A Proper Living in the Relationship between Wife and Husband, The Surpassing Greatness of God s Power, The Hope of God s Calling, A Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation, The Spirit the Pledge of Our Inheritance, The Sealing of the Holy Spirit, and Chosen to Be Holy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you would spend five minutes with your neighbor to give him these booklets and read the titles to him, you have done a marvelous job.</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The ministry offices in Taiwan and Irving are the arsenals creating all the weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many of these weapons are stored in Anaheim and Irving.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are printing every day in Irving and Taiwan to create more and more weapons, but we need some soldiers to use them.</S>
