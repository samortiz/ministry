[3]  CHAPTER TWO THE RECOVERY OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY 1
[4]  Prayer: Lord, You are the One whom we seek; we know that You are concealed in Your holy Word.
[5]  We have said that all believers should preach the gospel and that all are priests; but in practice we still have the clerical class in that only a few are functioning in this way.
[6]  Therefore, we need to realize that to preach the gospel is to tell out God's love, grace, forgiveness, redemption, and so forth, that we may bring sinners to the Lord and offer them, the members of Christ, as sacrifices to God.
[7]  Since we are priests of the gospel, we need to preach the gospel to save sinners.
[8]  In the past we practiced "preaching the gospel by the church," meaning that everyone took part in preaching the gospel, and the effect was not bad.
[9]  Since every believer is a New Testament priest of the gospel, everyone needs to preach the gospel to offer saved sinners as sacrifices to God.
[10]  Concerning the way to bear fruit, first you should set aside three hours every week to contact your acquaintances for the preaching of the gospel.
[11]  The lesson does not need to be too long; the important thing is to tell him that the Lord is the processed Triune God, that He died on the cross for our redemption and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit, and that now He is in the spirit of those who call on His name, to be their life and reality.
[12]  CHAPTER THREE THE RECOVERY OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:10; 3:9-10 THE WORSHIP THAT GOD DESIRES TO HAVE
[13]  In the Old Testament, in the age prior to Moses, the worship and service to God were all rendered individually, as can be seen in men such as Adam, Abel, and Enosh.
[14]  God delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt through Moses that they might become a kingdom of priests Exo 19:6 .
[15]  I must point out to you that today both Christianity and Catholicism have become greatly deformed.
[16]  The reason is that some use the name of Christ, but they put Christ aside.
[17]  In brief, the economy of God is that God desires to have a group of people, who were created according to His image, that He may be their life and everything and that He may build them up as a corporate vessel, the church, which is the Body of Christ, the bride of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God, for the fulfillment of God's goal.
[18]  Based on this, God desires that every saved person, every believer as a member of Christ, who has the life of Christ and the Spirit of Christ, should be living, organic, and full of function.
[19]  Furthermore, the Bible requires us to perfect the saints that they may do the work of the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ Eph 4:12 .
[20]  This should not be done by just a few; it requires every part of the Body to perfect one another, and the best place to do this is in the group meetings.
[21]  In the group meetings the saints can understand one another, and if there is any problem or need they can pray for one another.
[22]  CHAPTER FOUR THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTLY SERVICE 1 Scripture Reading: Rev 1:5-6; Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; Eph 3:2; 1 Cor 9:16-17; Eph 3:8; John 15:16; Psa 119:147-148; Rom 8:37; Eph 5:18b; 2 Tim 4:2a; John 21:15; 1 Thes 2:7; Eph 4:11-12; Heb 10:24-25; 1 Thes 2:11 OUTLINE All the New Testament believers being priests to serve God Rev 1:5-6.
[23]  The priests of the gospel of God Rom 15:16: Being built up into God's holy priesthood the whole church becoming the New Testament priesthood of the gospel 1 Pet 2:5a.
[24]  Offering up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God, that is, offering up the saved sinners as members of Christ to constitute the Body of Christ 1 Pet 2:5; Rom 15:16b.
[25]  In this message we will see the New Testament priestly service ordained by God.
[26]  The New Testament service ordained by God in the Scriptures indicates that all New Testament believers are priests to serve God Rev 1:5-6 .
[27]  To be the priests of the gospel of God is to tell out the virtues of what He is, to tell out how He has saved us out of darkness into His marvelous light.
[28]  Third, the priests of the gospel of God should carry out the stewardship of the grace of God in God's economy Eph 3:2; 1 Cor 9:16-17 .
[29]  Sixth, we have been chosen and appointed by God to bear remaining fruit John 15:16 .
[30]  What we spoke previously concerns the preaching of the gospel to save sinners, which is also what we call begetting.
[31]  CHAPTER FIVE THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTLY SERVICE 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:3, 12, 4-5, 1, 39a, 31, 23-25 OUTLINE Prophesying for God: Being not predicting.
[32]  But speaking to men: Building up for the church 1 Cor 14:3.
[33]  In 1 Corinthians 14, in speaking of prophesying for God, Paul did not have any intention for us to speak in tongues or to predict; his intention was that we all speak for God.
[34]  Therefore, when we prophesy for God in the church meetings, we first need to take care of the building of the church of God, that the church may be built up.
[35]  First Corinthians 14:31 says, "For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged."
[36]  THE CONSUMMATION OF THE AGE Scripture Reading: Dan 9:24-27; Matt 24:3, 15, 21, 27, 32-33, 36-42; Luke 21:34-36; Rev 3:10; 1 Thes 4:16-17; 2 Thes 2:3-4, 8; 2 Pet 1:19 OUTLINE Seventy weeks being apportioned out by God Dan 9:24-27.
[37]  Matthew 24:3 says, "And as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us,...what is the sign of Your coming and of the consummation of the age?"
[38]  In 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 Paul also said, "Let no one deceive you in any way; because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or an object of worship, so that he seats himself in the temple of God, proclaiming himself that he is God."
[39]  Concerning the rebuilding of the temple, first we need to see the two halves of the last week.
[40]  It seems that God will say to the men on earth, "I created all things for your existence, and My purpose is that you would fear Me, serve Me, love Me, and pursue after Me; yet you cooperate with Satan to oppose Me and reject Me. Now I am shaking the earth and the heavens; see if you will still be able to live peacefully." Furthermore, Satan will be cast out of heaven to the earth by the overcomers, and knowing that he has a short time, he will collaborate with Antichrist, and the two will do their best to destroy and injure the human race, and they will severely persecute the Jews and the Christians Rev 12:7-13, 17 . However, for the preservation of His people, God will limit the time of the great tribulation to only three and a half years; otherwise, no flesh would be saved.
[41]  TOWARD THE COMING OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Rev 12:5; 14:1; Luke 21:36; 1 Thes 4:16-17; 2 Thes 2:8; 2 Tim 4:8; Phil 3:20b-21; 2 Tim 4:1; Matt 24:42-44; 25:13 OUTLINE The coming parousia presence of Christ: Beginning from the heavens before the great tribulation Rev 12:5; 14:1; Luke 21:36.
[42]  If we trace the history in the Old Testament, we see that God raised up Gentile powers to chastise Israel because of Israel's rebellion.
[43]  Now we will speak concerning the coming parousia of Christ.
[44]  During the great tribulation, Israel will be trampled under foot by Antichrist and his army Rev 11:2 .
