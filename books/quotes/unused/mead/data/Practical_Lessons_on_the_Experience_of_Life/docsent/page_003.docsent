   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HELPING PEOPLE IN A PRACTICAL WAY TO BE REGENERATED Helping Them to Repent and Believe</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to contact an unbeliever we must first realize what kind of person he is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may compare this to fishing: We need to know what kind of fish we are after in order to choose the right kind of bait.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we use the wrong bait, we may scare the fish away, but if we use the right bait, we will attract the fish.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we know what kind of person someone is, we will know in what way to approach him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we can give this person a message, a teaching, or a verse for five or ten minutes at the most.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This paves the way, clears his understanding, and helps him to realize his need.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In other words, it creates his appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we can point him to the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps we may realize that someone is a moral person, a person who pays much attention to morality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this case we need to approach him in the highest way, telling him, "In order to have a certain morality, you need a certain kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you do not have the highest life, you cannot have the highest morality."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may create an appetite in him by illustrating: "If a flower has a poor life, it can never bring forth a better flower.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may be very good, but the life we have is not the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may be patient to a certain degree, but you do not have the life to be patient to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The highest life is Christ as life to us."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not give such a person mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must give him something living and "cooked."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times our talk with people is like giving them uncooked flour to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>People cannot take this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, we must give them "baked cakes" ready to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we speak in a convincing way, a person will want to know how to receive Christ, but simply to say, "The gospel tells us that we have to repent and believe" is a doctrinal, not a practical, way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to speak with people in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should say, "To repent means to realize that you are sinful and that you must confess your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is holy, and we are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to receive Him we must confess.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I believe that you are a good person, but in the eyes of God we are all sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You need to confess your sins before Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the practical way to speak about repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After confessing his sins, a person must believe, that is, he must open his heart from the depths of his being to receive Christ into him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we use the word spirit, he may not understand us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can keep this term for later and simply speak of "the depths of your heart" or "your innermost being."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can continue to tell him to say to the Lord Jesus, "You died on the cross for me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You are the living Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I know that You are the very God, the living and omnipresent Lord, so I receive You.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I accept You."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should stress to this person that he must have a personal contact with Christ, saying, "Although you cannot see Him, He is here.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Wherever you are, He is there.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is so living and real.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is the real God, the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, you need to open yourself to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Tell Him that you receive Him into yourself as your Savior and your life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the very God, Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just as the only way to contact the air is by breathing, the only way to contact Christ as God, our Savior, the living Spirit, is to pray."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If this person asks how he should pray, we can say, "To pray is simply to speak something to Christ from your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not consider what to speak; there is no need to compose a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Simply speak from your heart."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all must believe that after a person contacts the Lord by prayer, something will happen, either right away or after one or a few days, because this is a real contact in the human spirit with the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Helping Them to Be Assured of Their Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After we give a person this kind of instruction, we need to give him some verses from the Scriptures, such as John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can help him to read this verse and understand and grasp it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then we can give him other verses, such as John 3:36, 5:24, and 6:47, reading and stressing the central point to confirm to him that if he confesses his sins and opens to receive Christ, he has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is a little complicating to use verses like John 1:12, which speaks of being children of God, and Romans 10:9 and 10, which speak of righteousness and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we are speaking with an unbeliever, it is best to speak in a concentrated way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not give them too many points.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, we should hit one point.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is like digging a well in one place until the water comes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we dig a little here and a little there, we may dig for our whole life without getting any water.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In summary, the way to receive Christ as our life is to repent, realizing that we are sinful and under God's condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then it is to open our heart and whole being from within to have a living contact with Christ by praying to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then we have the confirmation and assurance of God's salvation by His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This assurance is something written.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Someone may owe a person a thousand dollars, but if he does not put that into writing, there is no assurance that it will be paid.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We may ask a person who has just received Christ, "Have you believed in Jesus Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If he is not clear, we can say, "You have confessed that you are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You realized that you need Him, and you opened yourself to Him, prayed to Him, and told Him that you receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This means that you already have believed."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This helps him to be clear that he has received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then we may ask if he knows that he has the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Again, if he does not know, we can read John 3:16 and ask him if it says, "Every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would not know if he has eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should help him to say, "Every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He can know he has eternal life because it is written.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should give him two or three passages like this as a definite confirmation that he has the life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To not do this is like wrapping something up but not tying a knot around it; what we wrapped will come loose again.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we speak to someone properly, the Holy Spirit will work, and he will be saved very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This kind of person may immediately realize that in the past he did many evil things, and he may ask us what he should do about his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need to learn how to help one like this by reading some passages that tell him that his sins have been borne by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is why we need to learn passages such as 1 Peter 2:24, which says, "Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then we should quickly turn to 1 John 1:9, which says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In this way we will cause him to realize that Christ bore all his sins and that God is now willing and ready to forgive him.</S>
