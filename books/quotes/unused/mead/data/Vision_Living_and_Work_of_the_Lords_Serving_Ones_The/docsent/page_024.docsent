   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT LEADING NEW BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO KNOW THE CHURCH 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When leading a new believer to take the way of life, we should ultimately bring him to the church, because the Lord in His salvation desires to obtain the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although this truth has not been clearly seen and is neglected in various denominations in Christianity, the fact is that every believer is a member of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word church occurs only twice in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus spoke concerning numerous truths in the Gospels, but He spoke of the church only twice, and both instances are in the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first instance is in 16:18: Upon this rock I will build My church ; the second is in 18:17: If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we read Matthew 16:18 and 18:17 in context, we will see that the truth concerning the church is presented in an all-inclusive and complete way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE LORD S SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>CONCERNING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>IN MATTHEW 16:18</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Matthew 16 the Lord Jesus took His disciples far away from Jerusalem, a place with a strong religious atmosphere, and brought them to Caesarea Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Caesarea Philippi is at the foot of Mount Hermon in the northern part of the Holy Land and is very close to the border; it is almost in the land of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It had a clear atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then in chapter 17 the Lord Jesus took three disciples up to the high mountain, Mount Hermon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1977 some brothers and I visited Israel, and we drove from Jerusalem to Caesarea Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We went to the foot of Mount Hermon and saw the source of the Jordan River.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The source is a big fountain with water constantly gushing up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The water that gushed up not only felt cool but also caused the air to be fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The air in that area is cool and clean.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The atmosphere there is refreshing and clear.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus took His disciples to Caesarea Philippi in order to ask them, Who do you say that I am?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was there that the heavenly Father gave Peter a revelation, and he answered, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Breaking Away</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>from a Religious Atmosphere</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>to Know the Church</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The context of verse 18 has several important points.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to know the church, we must leave Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot know the church in a place where the religious atmosphere is thick.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jerusalem was permeated with a very thick religious atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus had to take His disciples away from the thick religious atmosphere to Caesarea Philippi, where everything was clear.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is where the disciples were able to receive revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we remain in a religious atmosphere, we will not be able to receive a vision of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We will neither see nor receive revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To speak about the church in a Catholic cathedral will not have any effect.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, in order to know the church, we must break away from the religious atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Knowing Who Christ Is</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>to Know the Church</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to know the church, we also must know who Christ is and obtain a revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regarding the Lord s person, He is the Son of the living God, and regarding His commission and ministry, He is the Christ, God s anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Greek word translated Christ means the anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To anoint a person is to commission him, to entrust him with a mission.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Regarding His Person, the Son of the Living God</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Being the Expression of God;</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>regarding His Ministry, the Christ Being</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>for the Accomplishing of God s Economy</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are the Christ, the Son of the living God is an all-inclusive statement.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Son of the living God speaks of the Lord s person, and the Christ speaks of His commission, His duty, His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In His person and His life, He is the Son of the living God, the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Just as a son expresses the father, the Son of the living God expresses the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is the effulgence of God s glory and the impress of God s substance Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is also the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the meaning of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>With regard to His ministry, His commission, He is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He came to fulfill God s eternal plan, to fully accomplish what God had planned for His economy in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, the Son of the living God and the Christ mean that the One who expresses God and is the embodiment of God came to accomplish God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What does God desire to gain in His economy?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Ephesians 3:9-11 says, To enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God s economy is His eternal plan, His eternal dispensation, arrangement, to obtain the church.</S>
