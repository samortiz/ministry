"In that hour" can be translated "at the same time." It is connected with the fishing in the preceding portion. The fishing there indicates that the Lord covers His own glory and manifests His own grace. The first section of chapter eighteen indicates how the believers in the present life should imitate the Lord in hiding their own glory, manifesting grace, and giving up their privileges. "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?" The disciples argued concerning this matter several times. It was truly an unsolvable problem to them. Even on the night the Lord was betrayed, they were still arguing. On this occasion the disciples were arguing because: (1) nine people had been left at the foot of the mountain (17:1); (2) Peter was called Petros (16:18), the rock for the building; (3) the keys of the kingdom of the heavens were placed in Peter's hands (16:19); and (4) the Lord had paid the temple tax for Peter (17:27). All men like to be great; no one likes to be small. Men aspire to great achievements within their limits. There is not one person who does not desire to be great.</P><P>Verse 2:"And He called a little child to Him and stood him in their midst." The Lord used not only parables but also demonstrations. He called a little child to stand among the disciples, to make a comparison with them. One can know a child by a glance; there is no need to ask. Concerning many matters, there is no need to ask; one only needs to look.</P><P>Verse 3:"And said, Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens." "Turn" indicates regeneration; it is to begin a new life. "Become like little children." This does not mean that we should behave like children, but that we should become children; it is not to be childish like a child. One who can pretend to be a child is surely not a child. (Only a wise man can pretend to be a fool.) Everyone who lives in this world must pass through the stage of being a child. Likewise, everyone who enters into the kingdom of the heavens must pass through the stage of being a child. There are three explanations concerning the kingdom of the heavens: it is (1) the realm of Christianity, (2) the church, and (3) the millennium. Here it refers to the second. This does not mean that to enter into the kingdom of the heavens one must be a child physically; it means that one must become like such. The actual child is only used as an illustration. Otherwise, Nicodemus could not have been regenerated. One who is not regenerated cannot understand the matter of regeneration. "Become like little children." This means to be selfless, dependent, and humble.</P><P>Verse 4:"He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens." Verse 3 deals with the problem of entering in. Verse 4 deals with the problem of being great or small. After regeneration, if a person remains humble and always like a little child, this one is the greatest. Unfortunately, the conditions are here, yet most men reject them and do not care for them. There are some infants who act too much like an adult. They think that they have been pastors for sixty years or have been elders for twenty years, yet in reality they are still infants (1 Cor. 3:1). "Become like little children" is the condition for entering into the kingdom. If one can always keep this condition, he will become great. When the Lord was paying the temple tax, He was humble like a little child. It is right for believers to progress in knowledge and to teach and help other people. The humility here refers to the attitude. One should have a humble attitude like a little child who does not look at himself and who does not try to compare himself with others. (The worst thing is to compare in spiritual matters.) Paul considered himself the least of the apostles (1 Cor. 15:9). He did not come to this conclusion by comparison. For the salvation of Israel, he would rather be separated from Christ (Rom. 9:3). He was altogether selfless, not looking at himself; he was the best child. Paul ran the race and did not look at Peter or John; he cared only for the things that were before that he might gain the prize from above (not from below) (Phil. 3:13-14). To be humble is to be without pride. It does not mean that one should not conduct revival meetings or preach the word. Even a little child can have pride. It is only when one is humble and "becomes" a little child that he can be without pride. "He who humbles himself shall be exalted" (Luke 18:14).</P><P>Verse 5:"And whoever receives one such little child because of My name, receives Me." "Because of My name" is deeper than "for my sake." To receive "one such little child" is to be humble. With him there is the glory and honor of Christ. Therefore, to receive him is to receive Christ. The saints should love not only Christ but all the saints as well (see Philem. 5). Hence, he who humbles himself should at the same time regard others highly.</P><P>Verse 6:"And whoever stumbles one of these little ones who believe in Me, it is more profitable for him that a great millstone be hung around his neck and he be drowned in the open sea." In dealing with people, a believer either receives them or stumbles them. To cause others to stumble is worse spiritually than to become a murderer in the flesh. A person who stumbles others shakes their faith in Christ and affords them the opportunity to rebel against God. Christ paid the temple tax. On the one hand, He was humble, and on the other hand, He did not want to offend others. If a person does not want to offend others, he must be humble and must lower himself.</P><P>Verse 7:"Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! For it is necessary for stumbling blocks to come, but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes." There are many offenses in the world. "Woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes," especially if he is a Christian. Although he will not lose eternal life, he will suffer much loss in the millennium.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_065.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_067.html">Next</a> </body></html>
