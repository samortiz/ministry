   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 17 says, "And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 17 came out of Abraham's escorting and conducting in verse 16.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If Abraham would have just said, "See You again, Lord," and would not have escorted the Lord for a distance, the Lord would not have had further fellowship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord could not hide what He was going to do from His intimate friend.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He had to let him know what He was about to do.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then the Lord told Abraham that He was going to judge Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, at this time the Lord had a real burden for Lot, and He needed someone to pray for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord always needs some intercession so that He can do something for others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through his fellowship with the Lord, Abraham came to know the Lord's intention.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because they were intimate friends, there was no need for them to mention Lot by name.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verses 22 and 23 say, "And the men the two angels turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even though the two angels left, Abraham was not willing to leave the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He stood before the Lord for more intimate fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Abraham began to intercede by asking the Lord if He would destroy the righteous with the wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This meant that he was praying for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This shows that the burden for intercession comes from our contact with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then the Lord reveals His heart to us, we know His intention, and His intention becomes our burden, which returns to the Lord as our intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord's desired intention in His heart was to save Lot from Sodom, but the Lord needed someone to pray for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without someone to pray for Lot, the Lord could not act.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the new creation, in the work of the Lord's grace in salvation, there is always the need of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that there is always the need of someone to cooperate with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the Lord has the ground to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Genesis 19:29 indicates that when the Lord destroyed Sodom, He saved Lot to answer Abraham's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After Abraham's thorough fellowship with the Lord, Genesis tells us, "And the Lord went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place" 18:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By reading Genesis 18 we can see that Abraham spoke, but verse 33 says that as soon as the Lord had ended His speaking to Abraham, He went away.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This shows us that the best prayer is not that we speak to the Lord but that the Lord speaks to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should let the Lord end His speaking to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we can say amen to His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should ask, "When we ended our prayer and said amen, did we end our speaking or did the Lord end His speaking?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Strictly speaking, the proper prayer is the Lord speaking through the one who prays.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why we must learn to pray to behold His beauty and to inhale Him in order to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not know what to pray, we can groan, saying, "O Lord, I do not know how to pray or what to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>O Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>" Then we will have the best prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to practice the fellowship in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We first must learn to read and pray over the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We also need to pray to behold the Lord and breathe the Lord as our spiritual air.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps in the morning we can take ten or fifteen minutes for reading and praying over the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After this we need another time, perhaps five minutes, just to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should open ourselves to the Lord, look to Him, and seek His face to behold Him, adore Him, worship Him, praise Him, and thank Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have some feeling within which we do not know how to express, we can groan before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we practice this kind of living and intimate prayer, we will be nourished, refreshed, and strengthened by the Lord not only in the morning but also throughout the day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to learn to pray in this way all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First Thessalonians 5:17 charges us to pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is only by this way of prayer that we can unceasingly pray.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To pray in this way is to breathe spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No matter what we are doing, we can pray in the way of spiritual breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should breathe unceasingly, no matter what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we will enjoy Christ continuously.</S>
