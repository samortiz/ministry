<h1 class="title">THE INFLUENCE OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 5:13-16</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that the first section of the Lord&rsquo;s word that relates to the reality of the kingdom of the heavens concerns the nature of the kingdom people (Matt. 5:1-12). In this chapter we will consider the second section of the Lord&rsquo;s word in verses 13 through 16. This section concerns the influence of the kingdom people on the world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INFLUENCE OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE<br />
BEING TARGETED AT THE CONDITIONS OF THE WORLD</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:13-16 says, &ldquo;You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt has become tasteless, with what shall it be salted? It is no longer good for anything except to be cast out and trampled underfoot by men. You are the light of the world. It is impossible for a city situated upon a mountain to be hidden. Nor do men light a lamp and place it under the bushel, but on the lampstand; and it shines to all who are in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo; This portion reveals that a person who lives in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens will surely have influence on the world. Today many Christians lack influence on the world because they are not living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. However, the more we have the condition of the kingdom people, the more influence we will have on the world.</p>
<p>Those who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens will have a certain influence on the people around them. This influence is not the result of human effort; rather, it is spontaneous. Verses 3 through 12 reveal that the kingdom people live out God because they allow the heavens to rule over them. Hence, their influence causes people to touch the authority of the heavens and to know God.</p>
<p>In verses 13 through 16 the Lord Jesus described the influence of the kingdom people and referred to them as the salt of the earth and the light of the world. This means that the condition of the world is the target of the influence of the kingdom people. Although the world is complicated, it has only two main elements: corruption, or rottenness, and darkness.</p>
<p>Christians acknowledge that the world is corrupt and dark, and even people in the world acknowledge that this world is corrupt and dark. The world is being corrupted and degraded daily. An organization may have a grand and noble appearance, but under the surface it may be rotten and corrupt. Just like the age before the flood, the present age is completely corrupt in the eyes of God. Furthermore, the world is dark and without light. The world is evil, and its future is perilous, but people in the world continue in their sins as if they do not see anything. They are completely ignorant regarding divine and spiritual matters. They do not know what they should escape from, nor do they know what they should gain. This proves that this world is in darkness.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus spoke concerning the influence of the kingdom people on the world, He specifically targeted the conditions of corruption and darkness. Only those who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens can influence this corrupted world and give light to this world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SALT OF THE EARTH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Eliminating Corruption and Seasoning</h2>
<p>In verse 13 the Lord said that the kingdom people are the salt of the earth. If fish or meat is marinated in salt, it will not easily rot, because salt has the function of killing germs and preventing corruption. If the kingdom people have the nature spoken of in verses 3 through 12, they will be the salt of the earth. Wherever they are, they will manifest the functions of killing germs and preventing corruption. As a result, it is possible to deal with the corruption in the earth.</p>
<p>The other function of salt is seasoning. In the spiritual sense, to season is to blend together different elements that cannot otherwise be blended. In other words, to season is to make peace. Suppose the saints in a local church are full of the flesh and spiritual germs. These saints will always be in conflict and discord. When people visit this locality, they will smell a bad odor. However, if some saints in this locality live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, that is, allow the heavens to rule and allow God to live out from them, the flesh and the spiritual germs will eventually be killed. As a result, there will no longer be conflict, opinions, contentions, or discord, and the saints will be blended together. Then the people who come into their midst will smell a good fragrance. This is the function of seasoning.</p>
<p>The kingdom people can manifest the function of seasoning because they kill spiritual germs and because they blend different flavors together to produce a pleasant taste. This function comes out of their nature. As the salt of the earth, the kingdom people spontaneously have the function of killing germs and seasoning.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Living and Principles of the Kingdom People &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
