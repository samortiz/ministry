   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE FIFTEEN HAVING HOME MEETINGS FOR REMAINING FRUIT Scripture Reading: John 15:16; 21:15; Acts 5:42; 20:20; 1 Thes 2:7; 1 Pet 2:2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the first step of God's ordained way is to preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The second step of the God-ordained way is to have meetings with the new believers in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Acts 5:42 and 20:20, the words "from house to house" indicate home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must have proper home meetings in order for our fruit to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE WORD, THE SPIRIT, SINGING, AND PRAYING</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are four elements that constitute a meeting: the Word of God, the mingled spirit our spirit mingled with God's Spirit, singing, and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These are like the four legs of a table.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If one leg is missing, the table will not stand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Word, the spirit, our singing, and our praying are the four "legs" that support a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without these four elements, a meeting will be flat like a tabletop lying on the floor with nothing to support it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, the more we have the living Word, the more we exercise the spirit, and the more we sing and pray, the more a meeting will be strengthened and built up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we are in a meeting, many of us do things as a form, without being genuinely living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our singing and even our shouting can often be religious forms.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the more we exercise our spirit to speak, sing, and pray in a free and released way, the better and more living the meeting will be.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if we come and sit in our seats in silence, the meeting will be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes a Christian meeting can be like a cemetery, so quiet and proper yet dead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This kind of meeting is a shame to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To sit in silence kills the meeting and is an insult to the God whom we serve.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul indicates that the dumb, voiceless idols v. 2 make their worshippers dumb and voiceless.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the living God causes His worshippers to speak in His Spirit v. 3 . The worshippers of God should not be silent but utter some voice by speaking forth the Lord Jesus in the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we come into a meeting, we should speak something.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Singing, praying, shouting "Hallelujah!", or speaking the Word by reading from the Bible or reciting a verse are all proper kinds of speaking for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we have these four elements the Word, the spirit, singing, and praying the richer our meetings will be.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>BEING NORMAL AND SPONTANEOUS BY LIVING IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we go to visit the homes of ones whom we have recently baptized, we should not go in a religious way according to our usual practice, habit, or custom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may plan to pray for a certain amount of time before going out to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, even this can become part of our religion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is easy for us to take any way and make it a religious practice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all must learn to forget religion and live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we will be quite living in a very normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may arrive home from work only half an hour before our appointment with a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we will not be able to have our planned time to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may not even have time to eat, so we might take a sandwich to eat on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>While we are going and while we are eating, we can be praying, calling on the Lord, and singing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can go in a very spontaneous way because we are persons living in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you arrive at the new ones' home, you may knock on the door and begin singing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You should sing the hymn, the song, or the chorus that you sang with them on your last visit when they were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are already familiar with the tune, and before they open the door, they can realize who has knocked.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If they have a small child, he may join in your singing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You would be singing outside, and their small boy would be singing inside.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this way the meeting has started even before the door has been opened.</S>
