<p>In this lesson we will continue to see how to corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity through living in the Body of Christ in the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being Mingled Together with God</h2>
<p>In the Body we are being mingled together with God. First Corinthians 12:23-24 says, &ldquo;Those members of the body which we consider to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely members come to have more abundant comeliness, but our comely members have no need. But God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked.&rdquo; The word <em>blended</em> has the connotation of being tempered. The Amplified New Testament supplements the word <em>blended</em> with <em>mingled,harmonized,</em> and <em>subtly proportioned the parts of the whole.</em> God has blended together the various members of the Body of Christ to be one Body. To be blended in the Body is to be mingled and blended together. Through this blending we are coordinated, balanced, and adjusted. To be blended is to be balanced by dealing with one&rsquo;s extremes. In the local churches there are many saints with different dispositions. Some are very spiritual, and some are not so spiritual. The spiritual ones need to blend with those who are not so spiritual so that the spiritual ones can be properly spiritual. There is a need for weaker ones; they test the genuineness of our spirituality. Hence, we should not expect every saint to be a spiritual giant; this is absolutely not according to the condition of the church. According to the Holy Scriptures, we all need to be blended. The hot ones need to be blended with the cold ones, the quick ones with the slow ones, and the spiritual ones with the not so spiritual ones.</p>
<p>The Body is built up through all the different members&mdash;the comely and the less honorable, the strong and the weak. The different members should not be arranged into different categories; rather, all must be blended together in the Body. When we are blended together, the uncomely ones share the comeliness of the comely ones, and the weak ones receive the nourishing and support of the stronger ones. In this way, the Body is realized.</p>
<p>If we have not been blended into the Body, it will be impossible for us to be built together and for us to coordinate with others. The quick ones have no way to coordinate with the slow ones unless both are willing to be blended. Without the blending, it is impossible for two saints to become one in reality. In our experience the blending often comes from the coordination in the work. The church life is a life of always needing to be blended. God not only places the members of Christ in the Body, He also blends the Body together.</p>
<p>In the church life there are people with different skin colors and of different races, nationalities, and social ranks; however, we are one Body. This is possible only through God blending the members of the Body together. He blends us by the inner life and through His indwelling. Everything the Lord does in the Body is a matter of His dispensing. Therefore, the blending of the Body is also a matter of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. The more God blends, adjusts, and balances us, the more He dispenses Himself into us. The balancing, adjusting, coordinating, and blending are all related to the divine dispensing, that is, the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us.</p>
