   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE JUSTIFYING, SPEAKING,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND GUARDING SPIRIT IN 1 AND 2 TIMOTHY,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE RENEWING SPIRIT IN TITUS, AND</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE SPIRIT OF GRACE IN PHILEMON Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 4:7-8; 3:16; 4:1; 2 Tim 1:7, 14; 4:22; Titus 3:5-7; Philem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>10, 16, 25</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people consider the two Epistles to Timothy and the one to Titus to be the pastoral Epistles, the books intended to teach certain ones how to pastor a church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These books do tell us something about how to take care of a church, but if we spend the time to get into their depths, we will see that this isnot their basic thought.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The basic thought of these three books is the exercise unto godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Timothy 4:7 and 8 say, The profane and old-womanish myths refuse, and exercise yourself unto godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the present life and of that which is to come.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Godliness is a key word in these books 2:2; 3:16; 6:3, 5, 6, 11; 2Tim.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3:5; Titus 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word exercise in Greek corresponds to the English word gymnastics.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just as people exercise in gymnastics for the sake of their body, we need to exercise ourselves unto godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the Spirit in 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus is the Spirit for the exercise unto godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>IN 1 TIMOTHY THE JUSTIFYING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BEING RELATED TO GODLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE MANIFESTATION OF GOD IN THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First Timothy 3:16 says, Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Epistles to Timothy and Titus, the Spirit is mentioned for the first time in this verse, a verse related to godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Godliness is God manifested in the flesh, that is, God expressed in human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That the man Jesus was God manifested in the flesh was justified, proved, and vindicated only in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit constantly vindicated that Jesus was not an ordinary man but one in whom God was manifested Matt 3:16-17; 12:28; Rom 1:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the same principle, whenever we are not doing things in a way that expresses God, the Spirit condemns, but when we exercise ourselves unto godliness to walk and live in a way that expresses God, the Spirit justifies, vindicates, that we have godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This vindication is not only within ourselves but in the hearts of those who observe our saintly walk and life of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no need to proclaim that we manifest God in the flesh or to try to prove that our life and walk is one of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Spirit justifies, vindicates, and proves this for us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may do things that are very good, but they are not God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may love people or show patience, but our love and patience may not be God; they may only be good.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the other hand, we may have a love that is not merely good but isGod Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, our patience may give people the impression not merely that we are good but that we are living out God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot explain how we know this, but within us there is something that vindicates, justifies, or proves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The sense and realization that we have by the vindicating Spirit within tell us whether someone s love is good or whether it isGod Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sometimes when a brother loves us, we have the deep sense that this love is not merely something good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, this brother s love is the expression, the manifestation, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The brother is a human being in the flesh, but his love is the expression of God; it is in godliness, God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is the same with humility.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The submission that a sister shows to her husband may seem good, but in actuality it may be with a poor attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In such a case, the Spirit indicates that this submission is of herself and not the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot explain with mere words how we sense that something good is actually poor and out of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This can be compared to our sense of taste, by which we know what is sweet and what is salty.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit within us is the vindicating Spirit, always vindicating whether or not we live in godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By this Spirit we can realize whether or not our love, humility, submission, patience, and goodness are God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the meaning of justified in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Spirit is constantly vindicating what is of God and what is merely out of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may come to a brother to say something good to him, but deep within us we will have the sense that our words are simply from our self; they are not the expression of Christ or the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this case we do not have godliness but merely a kind of human, sinful morality.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The vindicating Spirit proves whether or not we are exercising unto godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are, the vindicating Spirit will confirm that we are right; otherwise, the Spirit will condemn and protest that we are acting, living, and doing things to express ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we love others or submit to them, we may love and submit only for our own glory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No one can tell us this; only the Spirit can vindicate.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brother Watchman Nee once told me, People can deceive us, but they can never deceive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we are not persons in the Spirit, we can be cheated by others, but if we have the Spirit and are in the Spirit, we cannot be cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more someone loves us, the more we may realize that this love is not godliness, the manifestation and expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, we may sense a wrong motive in this kind of love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The searching Spirit vindicates whether or not we are persons living in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the matter of godliness, He vindicates what is within us, and He vindicates what is in others.</S>
