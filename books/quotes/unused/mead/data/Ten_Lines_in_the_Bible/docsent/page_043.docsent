   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE LINE OF SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Just as the Bible speaks about God and man, it also speaks about Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not forget that immediately after man was created, God put him in front of two trees: one was the tree of life, and the other was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have mentioned repeatedly that the tree of life denotes God and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil denotes Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, in the very beginning of the Bible we see these three characters: God, Satan, and man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The entire Bible is a record of the things concerning these three characters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, in reading the Bible, we should not only know the things concerning God and the things concerning man, we should also know the things concerning Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have a good grasp concerning these three lines the line of God, the line of man, and the line of Satan, the Bible will become crystal clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we will look at the line of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this line the points that require our attention are numerous and somewhat complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. THE CREATION AND ANOINTING OF SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Originally, Satan was created and anointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A. Being the Created</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>and Anointed Cherub Originally</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Cherubim have the highest position among the angels in the heavens, and in particular, Satan was an anointed cherub Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>28:12-15 ; thus, he was unquestionably the highest among the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jude 9 says, Michael the archangel, when he contended with the devil and disputed concerning the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him but said, The Lord rebuke you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From this we can see that even Michael s position was lower than that of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, Satan s position was very high.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ephesians 2:2 also says that Satan is the ruler of the authority of the air.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>B. Being Set by God to Be over</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>the Original Universe</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the Scriptures, the anointed cherub, the archangel, was originally set by God to be over the universe, the preadamic universe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Luke 4:6, Satan said to the Lord Jesus that the glory of all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth had been delivered to him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should realize that Satan could not deceive the Lord Jesus, nor did the Lord Jesus refute his word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What Satan said was a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we should ask, When was this glory delivered to him?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible does not speak of it being delivered after Adam was created, because Satan fell before Adam was created.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, this delivery must have occurred before Adam was created.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE REBELLION OF SATAN A. Rebelling against God Due to Pride</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>and Becoming Satan, God s Adversary</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Satan was once a created and anointed cherub, appointed by God to rule over the former universe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At one point, however, he rebelled against God and became Satan, God s adversary, due to his pride.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is clearly shown in Ezekiel 28:15 and 17 and Isaiah 14:13-14.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>B. Being Followed by</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One-third of the Angels under Him</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>in His Rebellion against God, Who Became</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>the Evil Spirits in the Air the Forces of Evil</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Revelation 12:4 shows that when Satan rebelled against God, one-third of the angels under him followed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ephesians 6:12 says that these rebellious angels are forces of evil in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, Ephesians 2:2 says that Satan is the ruler of these evil spirits, these forces of evil in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, when Satan rebelled, some of the angels under him also rebelled; these rebellious angels became the evil spirits in the air, the rulers and authorities of the air, with Satan as their leader.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>C. Being Followed by a Group of Living Creatures</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>in His Rebellion against God,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Who Became the Unclean Demons</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>and Evil Spirits on the Earth and in the Sea</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the record in the Bible, the unclean demons and evil spirits who are upon the surface of the earth and in the waters of the sea must be a group of living creatures who were under Satan in the preadamic world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Satan rebelled against God, they followed him and also rebelled against God; thus they came under God s judgment of destruction by the flood and became the unclean demons and evil spirits, who today are on the earth and in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Matthew 8:32, Mark 5:9-13, and Luke 8:2 all speak of the demons on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to see these three groups: Satan, the fallen angels under him, who became the evil spirits in the air, and the demons on the earth and in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not regard demons as angels, nor as humans who died.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They are something different.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to the Scriptures, we can infer that they must have been a group of living creatures under Satan in the preadamic world, who became demons through their rebellion and God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>D. Defiling and Destroying the Universe</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>under His Rule through His Rebellion</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The preadamic universe was delivered into the hands of the cherub, the archangel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But the universe was defiled and destroyed because of his rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This can be seen in Job 9:5-6 and Genesis 1:2.</S>
