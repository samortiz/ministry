   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Details As Members of the Body,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Speaking Truth One with Another</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the details of the believers' living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first point is that as members of the Body, we need to speak truth one with another v. 25 . We should never lie to our fellow members.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To lie is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Any kind of lie, whether wild or cultured, is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Often the highly educated people lie in a cultured way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They hide their lies in a nice cloak.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should speak only truth with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Being Angry, but Not Sinning;</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not Letting the Sun Go Down on Our Indignation,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Neither Giving Place to the Devil</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not let the sun go down on our indignation v. 26 . We should not "lose" to the sunset, but should "beat" the sunset by letting our indignation go before the sun sets.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, we should never give place to the devil v. 27 . If we do not let our anger go, but rather keep our anger, we will give the devil a place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our marriage, a little anger is like a little kindling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if we do not quench it, it will bring in a big fire that can burn our entire marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The same thing is true in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As Christians, we meet together often.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is very easy for us to offend one another.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to let these offenses go.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Anger that is due to offenses is very damaging to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is even damaging to our stomach; we may develop an ulcer because of it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we let go of our anger before the sun goes down, we will be free and will be able to sing and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not Stealing, but Laboring,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Working with Our Own Hands</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The third point is that we should not steal v. 28 . We may think that we have never stolen, but actually, everyone steals.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whether we are a gentleman or a lady, a boy or a girl, in God's eyes we have all stolen from others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A teacher may bring home a piece of chalk from school, and a worker may bring home some things from his office.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may say that this is not stealing; but in God's eyes, this is stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All young girls have stolen from their mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we check with ourselves, we will find that there are many different kinds of stealings in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But we should steal no more.</S>
