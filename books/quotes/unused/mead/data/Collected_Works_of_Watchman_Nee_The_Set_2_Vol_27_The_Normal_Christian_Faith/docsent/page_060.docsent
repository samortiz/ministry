   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO NEED TO WAIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once I was invited to dinner at a missionary's home.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We sat and talked for a long time concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I asked him, "Can you say that you have overcome all your sins?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He answered, "I have to wait and see if this will work or not."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What he meant was, "Paul said that he had died and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But I cannot say the same because if I say it and then lose my temper, what am I going to do?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Am I not still alive?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, I must wait a few days to see if it works or not."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I told him, "God has put you into His Son; you are now dead with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has also put you into His resurrection that He may be your life within.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What you should do is believe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead you are just waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you really believe?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You are not believing because if you were, you would praise God for Christ being your life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You would not even worry whether this would work or not.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is responsible for it, and He never fails.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All His accomplished works become real when you exercise your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What are you waiting for?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Are you doubting the Word of God?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BELIEVING IN THE FACTS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once again it is a matter of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Faith always concerns accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Anything for tomorrow is not faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nor is anything in hope.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many, after hearing such messages, say that they have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But whether or not they really possess it is an open question.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let me illustrate my point by a real story.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have two co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One is a brother by the name of Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The other is a sister called Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both started in their Christian work recently and both are nearsighted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, both had a pair of glasses.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Miss Lee went to the Lord and prayed, "Lord, You have healed the blind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Can't You do the same for me?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is very inconvenient for me to go around preaching in villages with this pair of glasses.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lord, heal me."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She made this prayer on a little steamboat on her way to a village.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After her prayer she knew that God had answered her request.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She had the faith within her to throw her glasses into the river.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Her eyes were consequently healed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>FAITH IS NOT FOR THE FUTURE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The news came to Mr. Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One day he came to me, saying, "God has healed Miss Lee's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I believe that He will do the same for me."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I answered, "You said that God will heal you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This proves that you do not have the faith yet.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You will not be healed."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He insisted, however, that God would work a miracle and that he had such a faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After two days he was on a steamboat.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He took off his glasses and threw them into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A month afterward I saw him, and he told me that his eyes had not improved any.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It seemed as if God had not healed him yet.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I said, "If you are wise, you had better spend twelve dollars to buy another pair of glasses."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He said that he was going to preach in Ku-tien and would be back in four months.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He had the faith that by then he would be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I said, "If you think that four months from now God will heal you, you are putting your faith in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is not genuine faith."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>THE PROPER FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do you see it now?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Miss Lee has the genuine faith.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She said, "Lord, I thank You that I am no longer nearsighted.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For this reason I throw my glasses away."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But Mr. Nee said, "When I throw away my glasses I shall be healed." She believed that God had accomplished her healing already.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is what real faith demands.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is a faith that believes that God has accomplished and has fulfilled all His will.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The same principle applies to our salvation and the living of a victorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are not hoping that God will save us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I am afraid some will keep hoping even after they reach hell.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Neither are we hoping that victory will come in another two days.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What we should say is, "Lord, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>My sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Thank You, Lord, that it is no longer I who live, but You live within me."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have to believe in what is and what has been.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we do this we will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>RECEIVED THROUGH FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is another passage in the Bible concerning faith.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Mark 11:24 should be read with care: "For this reason I say to you, All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The crucial word in this verse is "received."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I have underlined this word in my Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>"Believe that you have received them, and you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The first clause gives the past tense, while the second is in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Bible gives only this kind of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is faith that believes in having received, not one that hopes to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Only the receiving that is through faith is the true receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Without the receiving in faith, there is no receiving in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Sometimes my co-workers or I would anoint sick people with oil and pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Often I ask a sick man, "Has God answered your prayers yet?"</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Those who have faith say, "Yes, God has answered prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>My illness is gone."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This kind of patient may still have a high fever and not look too positive, but he eventually gets well.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There are others who say, "God will heal me," or "I will be healed."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We have to pray again for these because we detect no faith in them.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>What they have is not faith, but mere hope.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>To hope to be healed and to believe that one is healed are very different.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Those who believe that they have received will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The same is true of victorious living.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If you believe that you are victorious already, then you will experience victory after victory.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But if you put your hope in the future, you can only experience victory in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The past tense occupies a vital position in our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It is what I have and not what I want.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Wanting something is a sign of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The word want often blocks our prayers from being answered.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The word of the Lord is clear: he who believes that he has received shall receive.</S>
