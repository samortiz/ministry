<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 16</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>STUDY ON THE BOOK OF JONAH</H2><P>Ten cents. This book was written by a British teacher. Its clarity in exposition and depth of knowledge has been welcomed by most Bible-believing men. In an age when the modernists have greatly criticized the historical value of the book of Jonah, this author boldly proved the story of Jonah as a history and not an allegory. This book is knowledgeable and contains much spiritual insight. The translation is not bad. It is a suitable book to give to those seminary students who are deceived.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 20</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>GUIDELINES FOR TEACHING THE BIBLE</H2><P>Writer:______. Fifty cents. This is an instruction manual based on psychology for those teaching Bible classes in schools. We find many suggestions in the book interesting and valuable. But we cannot fail to find one great mistake and disastrous lack in the book! The Christianity described in this book is only one which teaches men to behave according to Christian principles. It is not concerned with regeneration, the receiving of a new life by a sinner. Like all other modernist books, this book does not offer a gospel to sinners. Instead, it only leads men to receive some Christian ethics and moral laws. This is again the arguments of the Young Men's Association. We often ask these ones: "If Christ is superior to others only in His moral and ethical teachings, why do we have to lead others to believe in Him? There are so many people in this world who talk about ethics and morality already!" What sinners need is the gospel, a gospel that will save them, and not better examples.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 24</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>INTRODUCING DR. SCOFIELD'S<br>BIBLE CORRESPONDENCE COURSE</H2><P>Since the inception of this Bible correspondence course at the beginning of this year, over one hundred sixty students have enrolled for the course. Many readers of this paper have enrolled themselves in this course, but I myself wish there could be more readers who would enroll in it. Scofield's correspondence course can be considered the most complete for those seeking foundational knowledge of the Bible. If a believer receives the foundational help from Scofield, he will be able to do deeper research on the Bible at a later date. At this juncture, while this paper is being suspended, I would take this opportunity to remind all to pay attention to this matter. Of course, if we study merely with our mind, the harm of reading the Bible is no less than anything else. This is something that we should be careful of. Detailed instructions for enrollment can be obtained from Mr. Chen Chi-kwei in ______, Nanking.</P><P>Watchman Nee</P>
