First Corinthians 3 speaks of the planting, the watering, and the growing. Paul said that he planted; he sowed the seed. Then Apollos came to water, to irrigate. Then God gave the growth (v. 6).</P><P>We all need the planting of the life seed, not knowledge. The things of life are always in the Spirit. Knowledge is in the mind, but life is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reality of life. The Lord said, "It is the Spirit who gives life...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" (John 6:63). Romans 8:6 says that the mind set on the spirit is life. Life is in the Spirit, and knowledge is in the mind.</P><P>To plant is absolutely a matter of life in the Spirit, not a matter of mere teaching. This is why Paul told us that when he came to Corinth the first time, he did not use enticing words of man's wisdom, but he exercised his spirit to demonstrate the Spirit (1 Cor. 2:1-4). His speech was in demonstration of the Spirit, not of knowledge. By this he sowed the life seed, planting something of Christ into the spirits of the Corinthians. Then Apollos came to water the seed. God goes along with this organic work. When we plant and water, God follows to give the growth.</P><P>Paul told us that we are God's farm (3:9). Planting, watering, and growing are all for the farm, the cultivated land. On God's farm we have to grow something, and what we grow is Christ. Christ has been sown into us, and now Christ has to grow out of us. The Greek word for cultivated land in 1 Corinthians 3:9 means "farm" or "tilled ground." The church is God's farm to grow Christ.</P><P>Paul also said that we are God's building (v. 9). This indicates that the growth on God's farm is for the building. The church is built up by the growth in life. Whatever grows on God's farm is for the building. In other words, God's farm grows Christ, and Christ is for the building. The church is not built up by teaching or by organizing but by the growth in life. Paul planted, Apollos watered, and God gave the growth for the building up of the church.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
