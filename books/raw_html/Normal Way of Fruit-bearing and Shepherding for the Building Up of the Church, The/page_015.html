 <h2 class="head1">EVERY MEMBER BRINGING FORTH ONE FRUIT<br />
AND CARING FOR ONE YOUNGER ONE</h2>
<p>According to this principle, almost all of us are abnormal. We should not wait to be appointed to be elders so that we may take care of others. This does not work. In the proper church life, we do not need &ldquo;pastors&rdquo; or good speakers to preach the gospel and care for others. What we need is every member as a branch of the vine to bear fruit and take care of the younger ones. We should bear the burden for at least one younger brother or sister. The Lord does not require us to bear many. It is sufficient to have a yearly crop of one person as fruit and one younger one under our care. If we would all bring one person to the church life each year and care for one younger one, the church life will be wonderful. To expect a revival in a miraculous way is abnormal. We do not desire to have a miraculous yet abnormal situation. Rather, we desire to have a very normal situation in which nothing is miraculous, but everything is in life. We do not expect anyone to bring fifty people to the Lord after praying for only a few weeks. Instead, we desire that by the end of the year, at the latest, we would all bring one person solidly into the church life and be burdened to take care of one younger one. If we do this, we will learn many lessons. The church life and fruit-bearing affords us many lessons, but caring for young ones gives us even more lessons. We must all pass the tests of the church life, of fruit-bearing, and of caring for others.</p>
<p>Our enjoyment of the riches of Christ&rsquo;s life and our lessons in the spiritual life and church life depend mostly upon our fruit-bearing. If we do not bear fruit, we will be cut off from the enjoyment of Christ&rsquo;s life, and we will forfeit the lessons in our Christian life and church life. Therefore, if we wish to constantly enjoy the riches of Christ&rsquo;s life and to learn the lessons, there is no other way but to bear fruit and care for others. We must bring this matter to the Lord and deal thoroughly and seriously with Him. We may say, &ldquo;Lord, my eyes have been opened. Now I see that I am not normal because I do not bear fruit. I am too careless in fruit-bearing. Now I come to You to have a thorough dealing.&rdquo; If we would go to the Lord in this way and have a thorough dealing, the Lord will speak to us concerning a price we must pay or how we need to be broken and dealt with in certain matters. If we do not listen to His speaking, we will be cut off from the enjoyment of the vine tree, but if we do listen, we will have the deep experience of the enjoyment of the Lord&rsquo;s riches. The reason we are not clear concerning what to deal with and in what matters we must pay a price is that we are under a cloud, but if we listen to the Lord&rsquo;s speaking, our inward &ldquo;sky&rdquo; will be clear. There will be no need for others to tell us what to deal with; we will be clear within. We will also be clear as to which of our relatives, classmates, neighbors, and friends we should care for. The Lord will not burden us with too many.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOING TO THE LORD TO DEAL WITH HIM<br />
CONCERNING FRUIT-BEARING</h2>
<p>We should not try to apply any methods when caring for others. We have learned that mere methods do not work. Even to make regulations for ourselves and to make up our mind do not work. Paul says, &ldquo;To will is present with me, but to work out the good is not&rdquo; (Rom. 7:18). Therefore, we should not merely use our natural will. We should simply go to the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, I can do nothing, and I am not normal. O Lord, have mercy upon me.&rdquo; The Lord is the heavenly radiance. When we go to Him, He will radiate His love and His burden into us. If nothing else forces us to go to the Lord, at least our need for fruit-bearing will cause us to go to Him. Many of us are abnormal because we have been fruitless. Therefore, we must go to the Lord to confess our fruitlessness to Him and stay in His presence and radiance for some time. Then something will be radiated into us. What we receive will be not a mere word or training from man but a heavenly &ldquo;radiation.&rdquo; Then we will be enlightened. We will see the things that we must deal with, and we will see in what matters we must pay a price. We should not say, &ldquo;Do not speak to me of paying a price. I want something for free.&rdquo; Rather, we must go to the Lord to deal with Him.</p>
<p>May the Lord impress us that we are abnormal in the matter of fruit-bearing. We must go to Him to receive a heavenly radiation. Then as we become normal, we will be the church in our locality composed of sound Christians who live a proper Christian life, not bothering people but impressing them that we in the church have something shining. This shining will spontaneously attract people and convince them. Even without our speaking to them, our relatives will be gradually convinced and attracted, and whomever we contact will be under our shining all year round. We may not speak to others about Jesus all the time, but we will have a shining, attracting power and a convincing element among our relatives, neighbors, and schoolmates. Even if they do not like us, they will have to admit that we are a higher kind of person. Then we can follow the inner &ldquo;radiation&rdquo; to take care of them. In this way, it will be easy to bring one person to the Lord and into the church life yearly. Eventually, everyone in our locality will know that the church is a wonderful group of people, and the church will double in size by the end of the year. At that time, every new one will be the same as we are. Just as children are the same as their parents, all the new ones will be fruit-bearing persons, and by the end of the following year the church will double again. This will build up a good reputation and credit with people. Even the unbelievers will say, &ldquo;If you want to believe in Jesus, the best place to go is that church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we go to the Lord and remain with Him, the living Spirit will burden us to pray for certain ones among all those whom we know. To go to the street to find people is good, but this is not the best. It is better to work on people whom we know and who know us. Therefore, we need to build ourselves up among the ones we know, not in a natural way but according to Christ. Then they will all know the kind of life we live and the kind of persons we are, and they will be impressed, influenced, and convinced by us. Even if at first they do not care for us or for the gospel, they will not be able to deny that in our living there is something high, weighty, and bright. Then we can pray for them, not in a general way but in a specific way according to the inward leading. We may be burdened to pray for a certain relative for a whole month. The Lord knows how to gain that one. If we pray for him, then at a certain time he will come to us, or we will go to him. Of course, we should also have meetings for preaching the gospel, but the basic factor for the preaching of the gospel in a local church is the living of all the members. Without the daily living of all the members, the church has no ground for preaching the gospel. The gospel preaching of a local church is fully based upon the preaching daily life of all the members.</p>
<p>If a Christian means business with the Lord, it will be easy for him to bring one person to the Lord and into the church life. It is fair to expect this. To not do this is to go against the natural law of the life of the vine. Every fruit-bearing tree bears fruit annually. This is according to the natural law, the natural principle. The Lord does not require anything of us that is beyond the proper principle. According to the law of life, we should bear one fruit yearly. We must admit that this is true. This is the requirement according to the law of life. We should not place blame or make excuses. We must all admit that we have not lived in a normal way. If we had been normal, we would have fulfilled the requirement of fruit-bearing. From this time on, we must all go to the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, this year I want to live a normal Christian life and a normal church life. I want to be fruitful.&rdquo; We must go to the Lord to deal with Him thoroughly. We should pray, not in a miraculous way but in a very normal, constant way that all the members in all the churches will be brought into the normal Christian life and church life with a proper preaching and that we will all bear fruit according to the principle of life.</p>
