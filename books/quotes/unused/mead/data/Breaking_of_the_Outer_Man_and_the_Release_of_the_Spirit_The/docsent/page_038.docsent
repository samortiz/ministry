   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Some may say, "I do not feel that God's word can do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have been listening to God's word for a long time, and I have accepted His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But I have not received anything special.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I do not know what it means to pierce and to divide.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I know that God's word pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in my experience I do not know what it means to pierce and to divide."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible answers this concern.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the first part of the verse it says, "Piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What does it mean to pierce to the dividing of soul and spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The next part of the verse says, "And able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thoughts are what we think in our heart, and intentions are our motives and purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's word can discern what we think in our heart as well as our motives.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We often concede that something is of our outer man, that it is of the soul, of the flesh, and is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We concede that it is something that originates from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet even as we are saying this, we do not see this matter in actuality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God grants us mercy and enlightens us, He will speak to us in a serious and sober way, as if to say, "This is it!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the self that you have been talking about for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is your self!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have been talking so glibly and lightheartedly about the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is it!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is what I hate.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what I abhor."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we do not see the flesh, we speak about it jokingly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we are under the light, we will fall on our face and confess: "This is it!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The flesh that I was speaking of is this very thing!"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The dividing of the soul and the spirit is not a division in knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It occurs when God's word comes to us and reveals the thoughts and intentions of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The dividing of the soul and the spirit happens when, under God's shining, we see that our thoughts, our mind, and our actions are all of the flesh and that our motives are all for the self.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose two sinners are before us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both are sinners, but they are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One is a sinner with knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He comes to the meeting and hears many teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He knows that man is a sinner, and that he is a sinner by virtue of this and that fact.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The preacher is lucid in his preaching, and our friend has picked up much knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He confesses that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet in talking about himself being a sinner, he is very jovial and unconcerned.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The other man hears the same thing, but God's light is upon him, and he falls on his face and says, "My goodness, this is me!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am a sinner!"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He hears God's word telling him that he is a sinner, and he sees that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He condemns himself and falls on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This enlightened one prostrates himself on the floor and confesses his sins; he receives God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The other one who jokes about being a sinner does not see anything, and he is not saved.</S>
