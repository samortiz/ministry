<h2 class="head3">Synthesis</h2><p>The third way to study the Bible is by the way of synthesis. Through synthesis we can trace a line through the Bible. There is a central line in the divine revelation. God's revelation to man comes in many portions and in many ways (Heb. 1:1). It comes a little here and a little there. Every time God's revelation comes to us, it is more advanced than the previous times. Therefore, we have to study in the way of synthesis. We have to find the complete revelation of the entire Bible through synthesis. At the end of the Bible, God's revelation is fully completed.</p><p>In order to study this way, we have to acquaint ourselves with the divine arguments presented in the Bible. The Holy Spirit has His own line of argument. Paul said that one has to exercise his spirit as well as his understanding in discerning spiritual things (1 Cor. 14:15). Hebrews 5:14 says, "But solid food is for the full-grown, who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil." In order to study the Bible, our faculties must be exercised. Only then will we be able to discriminate between good and evil. In Philippians Paul told us that he not only preached the gospel, but he was also given to the defense of the gospel. If a man is not properly trained in his understanding, he will be short of arguments and words as soon as he is challenged. The gospel was powerful in Paul, but in us it is poor. This is because our understanding is not fully exercised.</p><p>We can only synthesize topics that are similar in nature. Those that do not belong to the same group cannot be synthesized together. If we try to synthesize unrelated topics,  we will confuse the truth. For example, the four Gospels record the earthly life, ministry, and words of the Lord Jesus. In reading His words, we have to differentiate between commandments and exhortations. We have to differentiate words of righteousness from words of grace (cf. Heb. 5:13). The Epistles were all written by the apostles under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, yet they are not all God's commandments. With God's Word, it is not simply a matter of taking it or leaving it. Paul did not have God's commandment, yet he still spoke God's word (1 Cor. 7:25, 40). Paul could do this because he had been constituted by God through many years. Although he argued and reasoned with the church in Corinth, his word still became a revelation to the church.</p><p>We cannot wander through the Word mindlessly. We have to follow a definite line. In reading Paul's Epistles, it is very important that we follow his divine arguments and capture his thoughts. The thoughts governing Paul at the time he wrote his Epistles are the thoughts of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 7:40). If we gloss over everything indiscriminately, we will not understand what we have read even after studying it.</p><p>The problem with us today is that we are too poor in utterance. There should be an abundance of utterance in the church. In order to be rich in utterance, we have to spend time to study the Bible.</p><h2 class="head3">Bible Versions and Reference Books</h2><p>To study the Bible, one needs good translated versions and reference books. The Chinese Union Version is one of the seven best versions in the world. It is based on the best version of the Greek text. There are several versions that are good for comparison. Of the Chinese translations for reference, the best version is the Wen-Li Union Translation. In many cases, its translation of single-syllable expressions is better than that of the Chinese Union Version. Concerning the Lord's resurrection, it makes a distinction between resurrection, fu-hwo, and raising up, fu-chi. Another version which is also acceptable is the Joseph Shi translation. The translator was a converted Jew who aimed at providing a good translation for the Chinese. He studied Chinese and finished this version all by himself. It was published over twenty years ago. The expressions he used are not the best; they are somewhat awkward. But the translation is very accurate. Reference books can be read as one has the time. But we must exercise discretion in choosing which ones to read. Some expositional reference books are not that common, and they can be quite deep. For example, Darby's Synopsis of the Books of the Bible renders help to some but is a damage to others. The flow of the Holy Spirit is always advancing. Such reference books should be studied only with proper fellowship. This fellowship will provide the proper protection and safeguard.</p>
