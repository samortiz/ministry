<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TRANSFORMATION BY THE SPIRIT</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:2, 6, 16, 29; 12:1-2, 4-5; 2 Cor. 3:17-18</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR NEED TO SET OUR MIND ON THE SPIRIT</H2><P>In this chapter we want to fellowship about our need to be transformed by the Spirit. Within our spirit we have the wonderful all-inclusive Spirit, but without we have something awfully troublesome. This is our natural man, the man of the flesh. Outwardly, people may look nice, but actually no one is nice. Everyone is troublesome. We have this wonderful One within us, but we still have the old man, the old nature, the flesh, and the soulish life.</P><P>We have two realms from which to choose: the realm of the spirit and the realm of the flesh. Now the crucial thing is what we do with our mind. Our mind may be a mind of the flesh, or it may be a mind of the spirit. The mind represents the man. Whether we stand with the spirit or with the flesh depends on the attitude of our mind. The mind set on the flesh is death, and the mind set on the spirit is life and peace (Rom. 8:6). What is the attitude of our mind today? Is it set upon the spirit or the flesh?</P><P>In the garden of Eden there were three items: the tree of life, the tree of knowledge, and a man standing before the two trees (Gen. 2:8-9). Do you realize that within you today there are these three things? First, you have the spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with your human spirit, with all the wonderful things of God. Second, you have the flesh with something of Satan. Third, you have the mind representing yourself. Where does your mind stand? If your mind is set on the flesh, that means you are standing with Satan. If your mind is set on the spirit, that means you are standing with God. Therefore, the central point, the main thing, today is the attitude of the mind.</P><P>Now we realize why in Romans 12:2 the apostle said that we need to be transformed by the renewing of the mind. In Romans 8:2 there is the law of the Spirit of life. Then in Romans 8:6 there are two possibilities. We may stand either with the flesh or with the spirit. If we stand with the flesh, we are in death. If we stand with the spirit, we are in life. Romans 8:29 says that we have "to be conformed to the image of His Son." By the renewing of our mind we are transformed and conformed to the image of Christ. Also, by being transformed we will realize that the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God is the Body life revealed in Romans 12.</P><P>Romans 8 reveals that we have the law of the Spirit of life within us. If we stand with this law, we will be transformed and conformed to the image of Christ. Then Romans 12 shows that by our being transformed, we realize the good will of God, which is to have the Body life. Hence, the church life is a life of transformation, a life in which Christ as the Spirit is transforming us all the time.</P>
