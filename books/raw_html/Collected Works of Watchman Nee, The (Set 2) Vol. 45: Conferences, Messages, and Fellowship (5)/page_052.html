<h1 class="series">SECTION FIFTEEN<br />MESSAGES AND FELLOWSHIP<br />IN SHANGHAI IN 1941</h1><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S ETERNAL PLAN</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: 1941<br />Place: Shanghai<br />Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:3-23 (Please pay special attention to vv. 4-5, 11, 16-19.)</h1><h2 class="head1">EPHESIANS AND GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE</h2><p>Ephesians is a book on God's eternal purpose. It speaks of God's purpose more than once and covers the lofty and eternal aspects of His purpose. In chapter one Paul prayed for the saints to see and know. Chapter two points out the saints' relationship with the Lord and with the church. In chapter three Paul prayed for the building up of the church. Today we will concentrate on the prayer in chapter one.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEING AND KNOWING THREE THINGS</h2><p>Paul prayed for three things in chapter one. He prayed that the saints would see and know God's calling, His inheritance in the saints, and His power toward those who believe. God's eternal plan is related to His calling, His inheritance, and His power.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Calling</h2><p>First, the saints must see the hope of God's calling. Verse 4 describes this calling: "Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love." God has called us to this condition, that is, to be holy and without blemish. If we compare this picture with the actual situation of Christians today, we can see that there is a great difference between the two.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Inheritance in the Saints</h2><p>Second, the saints have to see God's inheritance in them. Concerning His inheritance, verse 5 says that God predestinated us unto sonship and verse 11 says that He predestinated us to be an inheritance. God's inheritance in the saints is for us to become His inheritance, which is for us to receive the sonship. God's plan is related to sons. God's predestination has nothing to do with man's salvation or perdition; it has to do with Him having many sons. God has predestinated us unto sonship. Theologians pointlessly argue about predestination unto salvation or predestination unto perdition. Galatians 4 and Hebrews 2 both speak of sonship. At the appointed time God will redeem His people unto sonship, that is, He will receive His inheritance. Redemption is a parenthetical move, whereas predestination unto sonship is a matter that occupies an eternal place in God's things.</p><p>What does it mean to inherit an inheritance? When we inherit an inheritance, it means that someone else's possession becomes ours. All fixed assets and other assets become ours. On the one hand, we receive an inheritance, which is the sonship. On the other hand, God receives an inheritance in us, which means that He gains and possesses us.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Power in the Believers</h2><p>There are two parts in God's work. The first part was accomplished before the foundation of the world. The second part was accomplished on the cross. God's plan was accomplished before the foundation of the world, whereas the problem of man's fall was dealt with by the accomplishment of the Lord on the cross. Ephesians 1:7 says, "In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace." God's power in the believers is the power which He caused to operate in Christ. This power raised Christ from the dead and seated Him at God's right hand in the heavenlies. Today this power is operating in the believers for the accomplishment of God's purpose.</p>
