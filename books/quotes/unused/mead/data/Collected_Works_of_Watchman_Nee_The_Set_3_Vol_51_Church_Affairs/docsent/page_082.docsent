   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Making Tents so that He Could Be an Apostle</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Therefore, we see here that apostles truly need to leave their own occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Apostles also need to have only one occupation, which is the occupation of being an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But I want to mention Paul to clarify this one matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This does not mean that he could not go and make some money.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul was an apostle, and he always worked as an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we read the book of Acts, we would never dream that Paul changed his line of work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul went to Ephesus and made tents, yet he was still an apostle, and in Ephesus especially he made many more tents so that he could experience the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether one made tents or practiced medicine, all were for the purpose of being an apostle, not that he might not be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps he could not be an apostle if he did not make tents.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I hope we can see this point clearly before God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many times, God allowed Paul to do some work to enable Paul to be an apostle all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do we see this?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a matter entirely different from occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is entirely different from what we ordinarily call occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today, if Matthew would go back to be a tax collector, we would say that Matthew was looking for a job.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But, today if Paul would go to make tents, we would not say that Paul was looking for a job.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Matthew could not say that he must be a tax collector in order to be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, Paul could say, "Behold, these two hands!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without them, it seems that I cannot be an apostle.''</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His tentmaking enabled him to be an apostle all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His purpose was to be an apostle, his living was as an apostle, his work was as an apostle, and his life was as an apostle; all that he was, was as an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His two hands helped him to be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His two hands did not distract him so that he could not be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers, is this clear?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This way is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Question of a Second Job</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A certain brother asked me a month or two ago whether we should give up our occupation completely or take a second job in the future, if we go out to preach the gospel for the Lord and do the work of an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I tell you, this is my answer today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone who wants to be an apostle must throw away his occupation, throw away what man calls occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, please note that while you travel to various places for the gospel, it would be better to take a second job to enable you to be an apostle rather than complain that the church lacks love, as some do because of their own lack of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather than being weak in faith and maintaining hope toward God in appearance, but in reality having hope toward man and the brothers, it would be better to be like Paul and say, "These hands!''</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It would be better at that time to work a little with your own hands so that you could support yourself and also support others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I think and believe that the most dishonorable thing to God is to look to the love of the church more than having faith before God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I think and I believe that the most dishonorable thing to God is to complain against men, yet not be able to trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I think it is more dishonorable to God for a man to hope in God in appearance, yet in reality to turn his eyes not heavenward but toward his surroundings and environment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is even more dishonorable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Principle of "These Hands!''</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, here is a matter which I would do my best to emphasize the principle of "These hands!'', that is, that these two hands will enable me to be an apostle all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The two hands of many people do not need to fish.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do we see this?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must emphatically maintain before God what we are really doing, what we are here for on this earth, and what kind of persons we are before God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please remember that before God you are an apostle called by God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because you are an apostle, you must leave your occupation entirely.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From now on, even if you work with your hands again, it is not for an occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you work with your hands again, it is to supply you and the needs of your fellow workers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are needs because you are an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You have become an apostle; therefore, there are needs, and you must work with your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>My brothers here have needs; therefore, I need to work with my hands so that they can be apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I work with my hands in the hope that I may support myself and my co-workers, not because of a lack in my own finances, or because I am hindered, or because I have taken a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, I hope the brothers and sisters can see that this way is different.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not a change of occupation, but the support of our apostleship with a job.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not changing from apostleship to the occupation of tentmaking, but supporting our apostleship by the work of tentmaking.</S>
