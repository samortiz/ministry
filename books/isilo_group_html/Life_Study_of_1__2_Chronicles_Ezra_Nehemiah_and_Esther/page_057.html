The Dedication of the Rebuilt Wall</h2>
<p>The reconstitution also included the dedication of the rebuilt wall (vv. 27-43).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The People Seeking the Levites<br />
from All Their Places</h2>
<p>The people sought the Levites from all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem in order to hold the dedication with rejoicing, thanksgiving, and singing with cymbals, harps, and lyres (vv. 27-29). The main service of the Levites was to sing in praise to God. For us today, singing hymns in the meetings is a primary need. Singing opens the heavens and brings us to the heavens. We should spend time to sing in different ways whenever we meet.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Priests and the Levites<br />
Purifying Themselves</h2>
<p>During the dedication the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and they also purified the people, the gates, and the wall (v. 30). Everything was purified, for they would not dedicate to God anything that was not pure.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Nehemiah Appointing Two Great Companies</h2>
<p>Nehemiah appointed two great companies to give thanks to God, to go in procession, and to stand in the house of God with him (vv. 31-42).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Offering of Great Sacrifices</h2>
<p>They offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced with their women and children, for God had caused them to rejoice greatly; and the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar (v. 43). Today our neighbors should know that we are singing Christians, that we are the worshippers of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Appointment of the Services of the Priests<br />
and the Levites and the Supply of Their Needs</h2>
<p>The reconstitution also included the appointment of the services of the priests and the Levites and the supply of their needs (vv. 44-47). Nehemiah not only brought the serving Levites and priests into function; he also supplied their daily necessities. Before that time, no one had taken care of this matter properly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Clearance Exercised<br />
on Israel as God&rsquo;s Elect</h2>
<p>Nehemiah 13:1-30a describes the clearance exercised on Israel as God&rsquo;s elect. There were many cleansings. This clearance was also part of the reconstitution of the nation of God&rsquo;s elect.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Separating All the Mixed Multitude<br />
from Israel according to the Law</h2>
<p>First, all the mixed multitude were separated from Israel according to the law (vv. 1-3). When the people heard the law concerning Ammonites and Moabites not entering the assembly of God forever, they separated the mixed multitude from Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Purifying the Chambers of the House of God</h2>
<p>In verses 4 through 9 Nehemiah purified the chambers of the house of God from the evil occupancy by a relative of the priest who had been appointed over the chambers of the house of God. Eliashib the priest prepared for his relative Tobiah the Ammonite (2:10; 4:3; 6:1) a large chamber in the courts of the house of God where they had previously put the meal offering, the frankincense, and the vessels (13:5, 7). When Nehemiah perceived the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, he was grieved and would not tolerate the situation. He cast all the household utensils of Tobiah out of the chamber and commanded that it be purified. Then Nehemiah returned to the chamber the vessels of the house of God, the meal offering, and the frankincense (vv. 8-9). In this matter there was a thorough clearance.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Removing the Negligence<br />
in Taking Care of the Need of the Levites</h2>
<p>According to verses 10 through 13, Nehemiah went on to remove the negligence in taking care of the need of the Levites. He found out that the portions of the Levites had not been given to them and he contended with the rulers regarding this. Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, the new wine, and the oil to the storehouses. Thus Nehemiah took care of all the daily necessities of the Levites.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Getting Rid of the People&rsquo;s Profaning<br />
of the Holy Sabbath</h2>
<p>Nehemiah also got rid of the people&rsquo;s profaning of the holy Sabbath (vv. 15-22a). The Tyrians had been bringing their merchandise into Jerusalem and selling it there on the Sabbath. Nehemiah caused this profaning of the Sabbath to cease. He commanded that the gates of Jerusalem be shut before the Sabbath and not opened until after the Sabbath (v. 19). Then he commanded the Levites to purify themselves and keep the gates in order to sanctify the Sabbath day (v. 22a).</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Cleansing the People and Especially the Priests<br />
from the Defilement of Their Marriages<br />
with the Nations</h2>
<p>In verses 23 through 30a the people and especially the priests were cleansed from the defilement of their marriages with the nations. Nehemiah required those who married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab to separate themselves from their foreign wives. In this matter he cleansed the people from everything foreign (v. 30a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Appointing Duties<br />
for the Priests and the Levites,<br />
for the Wood Offering, and for the Firstfruits</h2>
<p>Lastly, Nehemiah appointed duties for the priests and the Levites, for the wood offering at the appointed times, and for the firstfruits (vv. 30b-31a). All these arrangements were a reconstituting. Before Nehemiah&rsquo;s time the situation was a mess. The duties of the priests and the Levites were not clear, and there was not a proper arrangement for the wood offering and for the offering of the firstfruits of the produce of the land every year. There surely was the need for the reconstituting accomplished by Nehemiah.</p>
<p>In doing all these things Nehemiah asked God to remember him and spare him according to the greatness of His lovingkindness (13:14, 22b, 31b).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther &nbsp; pg 57</div><br></body></html>
