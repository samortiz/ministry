   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. HIS TYRIAN FATHER DYING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND HIS DANITE MOTHER BECOMING WIDOWED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Apostle Paul was truly a Hiram.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I do not know who Paul's mother was, but, spiritually speaking, I am certain that she was a "daughter of Dan," a daughter of the tribe of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Undoubtedly, in principle, Paul's father was a "Tyrian."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul was brought up "at the feet of Gamaliel" Acts 22:3 , a doctor of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time, law was the highest science among the Jews, and whoever became a doctor of law was considered to be most outstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Gamaliel taught Paul everything regarding the religion of their forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul's studying under Gamaliel was equivalent to studying in a seminary today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although a seminary does not teach a trade and thus is different from a technical college, the principle of both a seminary and a technical college is the same in teaching knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Consider also the example of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moses was born of a Jewish mother, but he was brought up in the royal family in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Acts 7:22 says, "Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in his words and deeds."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was a scholar in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul was a scholar of religious knowledge, and Moses was a scholar of secular knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, again the principle was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, both Moses and Paul became pillar builders.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 1 Corinthians 3:10 Paul said that he was "a wise masterbuilder."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both Moses and Paul had a "Danite" mother and a "Tyrian" father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The royal Egyptian family was Moses' "Tyrian" father, for it was there that he learned all the wisdom of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was the source of his Egyptian skill.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The teaching of Gamaliel was the source of Paul's knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way, Gamaliel became Paul's "Tyrian" father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we must see a crucial point: All the "Tyrian" fathers must die.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hiram learned his trade from his Tyrian father, but eventually this Tyrian father died.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As far as Moses was concerned, the royal family of Egypt died and was cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After Moses had learned everything of the Egyptians, that Egyptian source was terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, after Paul had learned everything from Gamaliel, the source of Gamaliel was cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In like manner, we all must be sons of a widow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our father must die, but our mother may remain as a widow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our Egyptian father or our Gamaliel must die, leaving us as the sons of a widowed mother.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that the source of our secular or religious skill must die, but that the source of our human being must still exist.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today, we all must have a deceased father and a widowed mother.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Moses' time, no one could have understood God's plan for the tabernacle like he could, because no one else had gained all the wisdom of the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moses acquired the wisdom of the Egyptians before he was forty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After gaining it, he thought that he was qualified to deliver his people out of the hands of the Egyptians Acts 7:23-25 , but he failed in this endeavor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After Moses fled from Egypt, he lived in the wilderness for forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By the time he was eighty years of age, he considered himself to be a dead man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In his Psalm, Psalm 90, Moses said that people may expect to live to be seventy, and that the stronger ones may live to be eighty v. 10 . When Moses was eighty years old, he might have said to himself, "I am finished.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What can I do?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Forty years ago I could have done something, but I cannot do anything today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am not yet dead, but I am dying."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As Moses was dying there in the wilderness, he one day saw the burning bush Exo 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although the bush was burning, it was not consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the vision of the burning bush God seemed to be telling Moses, "Moses, I will make you burning, but I will not burn you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I don't need you to be the fuel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When you were forty years of age, you had a great deal of fuel, but now you are old, dried up, and have no more fuel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have come to make you burning."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the time of this vision, Moses' "Tyrian" father had finally died.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Later, as Moses led the children of Israel in the wilderness, what he had learned in the royal palace became useful.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because no one else had all the wisdom of the Egyptians, no one else could have done the work he did in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The principle is the same with a brother who has gained a great deal of Bible knowledge in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This knowledge of the Bible is his "Tyrian" father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But this "Tyrian" father must die.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The source of his Bible knowledge must be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then whatever he has learned in the past will become useful in resurrection, and he will be able to deliver a word as few others are able to do.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Just as the wisdom of the Egyptians became useful in the resurrected Moses, so whatever we learn in college, seminary, or Bible school will become useful in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, if our "Tyrian" father still lives and we remain in the natural life, the "Tyrian" skill will be of no avail to the building up of God's temple.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I encourage all the young people to get a college degree.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not make spirituality an excuse for not studying.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, study more diligently than the secular students, get the highest grades, and go on for advanced degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not stop with one Ph.D., but get two or three Ph.D.'s. Also learn to speak a number of other languages.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Gain the "Tyrian" skills and the "Egyptian" knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Become a doctor in biology, medicine, or nuclear physics.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But then let the "Tyrian" father die.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I have told you how I encouraged my grandson to study medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now I will tell you what is truly on my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After he finishes medical school, I will say, "Forget about being a doctor and use your medical training to interpret the Bible."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>His medical training will make him very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Young people, gain all the up-to-date knowledge, graduate from college, and then say goodbye to your "Tyrian" father.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Graduate from seminary and then say, "Seminary, thank you and goodbye.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I have nothing more to do with you, but I will use the skill I have gained from you."</S>
