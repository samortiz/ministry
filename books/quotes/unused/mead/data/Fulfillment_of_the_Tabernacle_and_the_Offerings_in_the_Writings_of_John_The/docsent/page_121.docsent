   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Need of the Laver</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the time we come to chapter twelve all the offerings have been fulfilled: the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although the ones in the house in Bethany were feasting with the Lord Jesus and were enjoying the peace offering, they were still in the outer court, around the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They had not yet come into the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, it was necessary for the Lord to accomplish something further to bring them into the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the nine cases recorded in chapters three through eleven, plus the record concerning Bethany in chapter twelve, we see the fulfillment of the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the offerings have been fulfilled by Christ as the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is the real sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, it was still necessary for Christ to prepare the place and cut the way for His believers to enter into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning this, chapter thirteen is of vital importance, for it is a dividing line and a turning point.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the type in the Old Testament, between the altar of burnt offering and the tabernacle was the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The laver was a place where the priests washed their hands and feet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was necessary for those who had come to the altar and who were ready to enter the tabernacle to come to the laver to be washed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have seen that in chapters three through twelve the people have to come to the altar, where they enjoy Christ as the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now they are ready to enter into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But for this there is the need of washing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the washing in chapter thirteen is the turning point, for it brings us from the outer court into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>LOOKING INTO THE DEPTHS OF JOHN'S WRITINGS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In their reading of John 13 many Christians pay attention to the matter of foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No doubt, this chapter is a record of foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But what does this foot-washing signify?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I first came to the United States, I was asked by a certain believer if we practiced foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The one who asked me this question was a member of a foot-washing group, a group that emphasized foot-washing to such an extent that they believed it was not possible to be a proper church apart from this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I was somewhat bothered by his question.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I realized that although we certainly are not a foot-washing group, there have been occasions when we literally washed one another's feet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, that was not done as a legal practice, but was done according to the inner leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I mention this incident as an illustration of the fact that many Christians read the Bible only according to letters in black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Reading the Gospel of John in this way, they may completely miss the significance of foot-washing in chapter thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Gospel of John is a book of divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As such a book, this Gospel begins like this: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Surely this opening word indicates that the Gospel of John is a book that is concerned with profound matters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Chapter one goes on to tell us that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality, and that the disciples beheld His glory, glory as of an only begotten from a father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All this is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the beginning in verse 1, and what is the Word?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What does it mean to say that the Word became flesh and that it tabernacled among men?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is the significance of the incarnated Word being full of grace and reality?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is the glory beheld by the disciples?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may also go on to ask the significance of regeneration in chapter three and of resurrection in chapter eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to be impressed with the fact that all these matters are deep and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because the Gospel of John deals with such profound things, we should not be satisfied with a superficial understanding of it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John's writings are deep, and we need to delve into them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we look into the depths of the writings of John, we shall see many precious things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These precious things, which include the extracts, are found only in the depths, not on the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we should not be content to read and understand the Gospel of John in a superficial way.</S>
