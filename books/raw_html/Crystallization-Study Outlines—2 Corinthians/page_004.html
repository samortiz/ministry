<h1 class="title">The Function of the New Covenant Ministry<br />
and<br />
the Spirit of a New Covenant Minister</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:1-6; 2:13; 6:6; 12:18</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The function of the new covenant ministry is to write living letters of Christ with the life-giving Spirit&mdash; 2 Cor. 3:1-6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The believers became the apostles&rsquo; letters of commendation, written by the apostles with Christ as the content in every part of their being&mdash;vv. 1-2.</li>
	<li>Because the apostles were filled with Christ, in their ministry they spontaneously ministered Christ to others, inscribing Christ into them.</li>
	<li>When the apostles preached Christ or ministered Christ, they ministered Him into the spirits and hearts of the believers&mdash;v. 3; Eph. 3:17a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>First, Christ as the life-giving Spirit is ministered into our spirit; this means that Christ is written in our spirit.</li>
		<li>By further ministry Christ spreads from our spirit into our mind, emotion, and will:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Eventually, Christ will be written into every part of our inward being.</li>
			<li>This is actually Christ making His home in our heart&mdash;Eph. 3:16-17a.</li>
			<li>Christ making His home in our heart equals the writing of Christ throughout our inner being.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The writing that takes place in our hearts by the ministers of the new covenant has the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the element&mdash;2 Cor. 3:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This element is actually the processed God; thus, it is the Triune God who is being written into us&mdash; 13:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
		<li>The ministers of the new covenant write letters with the processed Triune God as the element.</li>
		<li>The heavenly ink is the Spirit, and the essence of this Spirit-ink is Christ with all His riches; to have this ink in our experience, we must enjoy Christ, possess Christ, be filled with Christ, be saturated with Christ, and be covered with Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 3:3; Gal. 1:15a, 16a; 2:20; 4:19; Eph. 3:8, 16-17a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The only One qualified to do the work of writing living letters of Christ is God&mdash;2 Cor. 3:5-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The living God Himself is the sufficiency, competency, and qualification of the apostles&rsquo; ministry for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy to dispense Christ into God&rsquo;s chosen people for the building up of the Body&mdash;v. 5.</li>
		<li>Only the Triune God constituted into us is sufficient to carry on the work of writing letters of Christ&mdash; v. 6.</li>
		<li>God is writing Himself into His chosen people; the Writer is God, the writing substance is God, and the issue, the result, is also God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The writing of living letters of Christ involves both dispensing and constituting:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>With respect to the One doing the writing, it is a matter of dispensing&mdash;13:14.</li>
		<li>With respect to the one being written upon, it is a matter of constituting&mdash;a constituting that takes place through the divine dispensing&mdash;Eph. 3:16-17a; Gal. 4:19.</li>
		<li>Spiritual letter writing involves the dispensing of the Divine Trinity; this dispensing results in constituting, and the issue of this dispensing and constituting is that we become letters of Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To preach the gospel is to write a living letter; gospel preaching is a matter of letter writing&mdash;2 Cor. 10:14, 16; cf. 4:3-4.</li>
	<li>The inscribing of Christ into others is not for our work; it is for the church so that God&rsquo;s administration may be carried out and His eternal purpose may be fulfilled&mdash; 1 Cor. 14:4-5, 12; Eph. 1:22-23; 2:21-22; 4:16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The spirit of a new covenant minister is exemplified by the spirit of Paul:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In 2 Corinthians we see that Paul&rsquo;s spirit is:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>An open spirit&mdash;6:11-13.</li>
		<li>A holy spirit&mdash;v. 6.</li>
		<li>A frank spirit&mdash;10:7-12; 11:5-31; 12:11.</li>
		<li>A pure spirit&mdash;v. 14.</li>
		<li>A bold spirit&mdash;7:4, 16; 10:11; 13:2.</li>
		<li>A humble spirit&mdash;10:1; 12:21.</li>
		<li>A loving spirit&mdash;vv. 15, 19.</li>
		<li>A tender spirit&mdash;7:3-4b.</li>
		<li>A spirit that is not self-seeking&mdash;2:13; 7:2; 12:14, 17.</li>
		<li>A coordinating spirit&mdash;v. 18; 2:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Since our spirit has been joined to the Lord as one spirit, our spirit should be the predominant part of our being; first, our spirit becomes the spirit of our mind, and eventually, the spirit of our body&mdash;1 Cor. 6:15-20; Eph. 4:23.</li>
	<li>In order to have the spirit of a new covenant minister, we need to:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Know the spirit by the sense of the spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 6; 2 Cor. 2:13.</li>
		<li>Deny the self, crucify the flesh, and exercise our spirit unto godliness&mdash;Matt. 16:24; Gal. 5:24; 1 Tim. 4:7; John 4:24.</li>
		<li>Discern the spirit from the soul through the dividing of soul and spirit&mdash;Heb. 4:12.</li>
		<li>Be subject to the discipline of the Holy Spirit&mdash;12:9; 1 Pet. 5:6; Rom. 8:28.</li>
		<li>Experience the breaking of the outer man for the release of the spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16.</li>
		<li>Pray at every time in spirit&mdash;Eph. 6:18; Jude 20; Luke 18:1; 1 Thes. 5:17.</li>
		<li>Live and walk according to the spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:16, 25; Rev. 1:10.</li>
		<li>Have a burning spirit of love&mdash;2 Tim. 1:6-7.</li>
		<li>Pray that the Father would strengthen us with power through His Spirit into the inner man&mdash;Eph. 3:16.</li>
		<li>See the relationship between our regenerated spirit and the Body&mdash;1:17; 2:22; 3:16; 4:23; 5:18; 6:18; 1:22-23.</li>
		</ol></li>
