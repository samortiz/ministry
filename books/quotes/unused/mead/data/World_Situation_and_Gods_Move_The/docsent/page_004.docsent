   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SATAN'S COUNTERMOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Satan followed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What God uses, Satan also comes along to use in order to cause damage.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The emperors began to persecute the Christians, and countless numbers were martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Persecution, as we know, did not terminate the Christians; it rather helped them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then Satan changed his strategy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Under the rule of Constantine the Great the Roman Empire made Christianity legal, and Christians had the full freedom of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because of the favors he granted the Christians, thousands of pagans were baptized and became Christians in name.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These were the tares spoken of in Matthew 13:24-30.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That ruined Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Constantine was a clever politician.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He wanted to bring all the warring factions of the empire together.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Realizing that Christianity could be a peaceful influence, he decided that first the conflicts that were raging among theologians must be resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He therefore convened a council to meet at Nicaea to discuss the matters of Christology and the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These were the two main issues that were being fought over, even as they are today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Constantine himself presided over the council.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Under his influence the Nicene Creed was drawn up A.D. 325 . He acted openly as head of the Church, which in his reign was first called Catholic; at the same time he kept his title of high priest of the heathen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This ruin progressed from the fourth to the sixth centuries, by which time the papal system was fully established.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With this the Roman Catholic Church reached its full development; it claimed to be the one, universal church catholic means universal and exercised worldly power over people and nations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No protest or dissent was tolerated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Over the centuries when it held sway, the Roman Catholic Church killed more genuine Christians than the pagan Roman Empire had killed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Under such a dark Church, the so-called Dark Ages were produced, lasting about ten centuries, from about A.D. 500 to 1500.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE REFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Around 1500 the Reformation came in. God used Germany to protect Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But once again, what God used Satan also used.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Luther was bold in defending justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When it came to the matter of the church, however, he was weak.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Satan used Germany to interfere with Luther's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first state church was formed in Germany; this was due to Luther's weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even today this state church exists in Germany, supported by public taxes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Other state churches sprang up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are the state churches of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The monarchs of these countries are the heads of the state church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The same is true of Great Britain; Queen Elizabeth is the head of the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What a ruin to the church of God, which is the Body of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This historical background shows how God used the world situation in the carrying out of His economy and then how Satan followed, using the same means, to ruin God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Around the time of the Reformation, another thing happened: the discovery of the new land by Columbus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These two things, the Reformation and the discovery of the new land, liberated human mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Science and scientific knowledge grew, leading to modern machines and weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The free mentality plus the newly discovered land changed the world a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was the period of time when Spain was the dominant power.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was Spain which provided the support for Columbus' voyages.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This gave Spain the right to lay claim to vast portions of the Americas.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even today in the southwest of the United States the Spanish influence is apparent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many cities along the west coast, like Los Angeles and San Francisco, have Spanish names.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Spain reached out even to the Far East and took possession of the Philippines.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a result, the Catholic influence there is still strong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All of Central and South America, except Brazil, speak Spanish because of the Spanish conquests.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Until the close of the sixteenth century, Spain was the leading power on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If she had remained on top, the whole world would be under Catholicism, as is the case with Latin America.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God could not allow this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore He raised up the small island of Britain, and in 1588 the British navy dealt a fatal blow to Spain's supremacy by defeating the larger, seemingly better equipped, Spanish Armada.</S>
