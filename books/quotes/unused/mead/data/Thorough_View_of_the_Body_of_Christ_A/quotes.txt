[1]  CONTENTS The Origin of the Body of Christ The Element, Essence, and Reality of the Body of Christ The Living in the Body of Christ The Service of the Body of Christ
[2]  The Body of Christ is similar to our human body; it was born into being, not manufactured.
[3]  Regenerating Them to Become the Sons of God and the Members of Christ
[4]  Now that we have obtained this life, we are no longer individual persons, but members of the Body of Christ.
[5]  The Father, the Son, and the Spirit Becoming the Consummated Spirit Who Baptizes the Many Members of Christ into the Unique Body of Christ
[6]  We have already seen that the Father is the source, that the Spirit came to regenerate, and that the Son came to be life, so that we and the Triune God may have an organic union.
[7]  There is also an "outside" story; that is, the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit having become the consummated Spirit, came to baptize the members of Christ into the unique Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:13a .
[8]  This completed Spirit is the ultimate completion of the Triune God Rev 22:17a , which implies that the Son through death and resurrection 1 Cor 15:3-4 became the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, and compound Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , to baptize all the sanctified, regenerated persons into the Triune God Matt 28:19 , so that they and the Triune God could become one John 17:21a, 23a and be baptized into the Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:13a .
[9]  Now since we have seen the origin of the Body of Christ and have also realized that everything related to the Body of Christ is entirely a matter of the Spirit, we should not pay attention to other things; we should only take care of the inward, essential Spirit for life and also the outward, economical Spirit for work that we may be normal and proper members in the Body of Christ.
[10]  CHAPTER TWO THE ELEMENTS, ESSENCE, AND REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4-6; John 20:22; Rom 8:4, 6, 9-11, 13b; Gal 2:20a; 1 Cor 1:2a; John 3:5-6, 29; Titus 3:5; Rom 12:2a; Eph 4:23; 2 Cor 3:18; Phil 3:21; Rom 8:30; John 17:21a, 23a; 1 Cor 6:17; 1 Tim 3:15b-16; John 15:1, 5; John 7:39; Rev 22:17a; Phil 1:19; 2 Cor 4:16; Phil 3:10a; John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13-15; 1 John 5:6; Rom 15:16b; 14:17; Eph 3:16; 1:23 OUTLINE The elements of the Body of Christ: The processed Triune God the divine element Eph 4:4-6: The Triune God passing through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection in order to enter into the members of Christ to be the element of the Body of Christ John 20:22.
[11]  This Spirit of reality making everything of the processed Triune God a reality in the Body of Christ John 16:13-15: All that the processed Triune God is, including righteousness, holiness, life, light, power, grace, and all the divine attributes, being realized by this Spirit of reality to be the attributes of the Body of Christ in reality Rom 15:16b; 14:17; Eph 3:16.
[12]  The essence and reality of the Body of Christ being altogether matters of the Spirit of the processed and consummated Triune God: This Spirit being the secret to all that the processed Triune God is to the Body of Christ: The Spirit being the processed Triune God.
[13]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You again from the depths of our being.
[14]  Now that we have acquired a clear impression concerning element, essence, and reality, we can apply all three to the Body of Christ.
[15]  The Tripartite Man Regenerated by God the Human Element
[16]  Each one of us who was saved and belongs to the Body of Christ possesses these two elements or constituents, that is, the divine constituent and the human constituent.
[17]  The Capacities of the Essence of the Body of Christ
[18]  The Spirit as the essence of the Triune God has now become the essence of the Body of Christ, and there are certain precious capacities associated with this essence.
[19]  Referring to the origin and being of the Body of Christ.
[20]  In the last message, we saw the elements, essence, and reality of the Body of Christ.
[21]  Now based on that, we are going to speak about the living of the Body of Christ.
[22]  We have already been baptized, have come out of Adam and believed into Christ, and have been joined to Christ; hence, Christ is our life, our element; He is our Lord.
[23]  The Lord is the element of the Body of Christ; the Spirit is the essence and reality of the Body of Christ; and the Father is the source of the Body of Christ.
[24]  The living of the Body of Christ takes Christ as the Head, life, and content Eph 5:23; Col 3:4a, 11b ; this concerns Christ as the source and element of His Body and refers to the origin and being of the Body of Christ.
[25]  Taking the Spirit as Its Essence, Reality, Secret, and Effectiveness
[26]  The second aspect in the relationship of the Body of Christ is its relationship with the Spirit as its essence, reality, secret, and effectiveness.
[27]  The essence and the reality Eph 4:4a; 1 John 5:6 are related to the intrinsic nature and the outward condition of the Body of Christ.
[28]  Taking the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ as Its Regulation
[29]  For this reason, in the living of the Body of Christ we need to take the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ as the regulation.
[30]  On the negative side, we take the crucifixion of Christ as the regulation; on the positive side, we take the resurrection of Christ as the regulation.
[31]  CHAPTER FOUR THE SERVICE OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1, 5; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; Rom 15:16; Eph 4:11-12; Acts 2:36; 2 Cor 4:5a; Acts 13:2; 1:8; Matt 28:18-19; Acts 4:31b; 1 Cor 2:4; Acts 6:10; 11:18; Rom 12:4; 1 Cor 12:7, 11; John 21:15-17; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 31; Eph 4:16; 1 Pet 2:2; Col 1:28-29 OUTLINE Being the service of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel 1 Pet 2:5, 9: Being centered on the preaching of the gospel to save sinners and offer them as sacrifices to God Rom 15:16.
[32]  The goal being to build up the Body of Christ Eph 4:11-12.
[33]  Prayer: O Lord Jesus, we thank and praise You from the depths of our being.
[34]  In the previous message, we said that the living of the Body of Christ takes Christ as the Head, the life, and the center, and the Spirit as the essence and the reality, the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ as the rule, and life and the Body as the principle.
[35]  THE SERVICE OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Being the Service of the New Testament Priesthood of the Gospel
[36]  Taking the Body as the Means Every Member Serving in the Coordination of the Body
[37]  Furthermore, we also need to take the Body as our means Rom 12:5 .
