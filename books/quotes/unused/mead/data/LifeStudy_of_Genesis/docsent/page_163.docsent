   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>d Inventing Weapons for Defense</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Zillah, Lamech's other wife, brought forth Tubal-cain, who was "an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron" 4:22 , meaning that he was the inventor of weaponry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The weapons he produced were for the purpose of killing others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The modern arsenal is the full harvest of the weapons found in Genesis 4.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All these weapons are, of course, for man's defense.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The name Zillah means "a shade," a "covering."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What kind of covering does this refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The covering by weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One of Lamech's wives was for adornment, and the other was for a covering, a shadowing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She was used as a shade to cover him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, we see four items invented by the first human culture, a culture without God: a city for existence, cattle-raising for making a living, music for amusement, and weapons for defense.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These four items are also the main aspects of modern human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They all came into being because man lost God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you analyze the present world situation in the light of history, you will discover that it is simply a further development of the human culture devised in Genesis 4.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The present world situation, like the culture invented in Genesis 4, is composed of four elements: cities for man's existence, various means of earning a living, amusements, and defense.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A godless culture began to develop in Genesis 4 and will continue to develop until it climaxes in the Great Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We thank the Lord that we are not in that culture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>3 The Issue</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have seen that man has produced a culture without God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The issue of this culture is the fulfilling of lust, the committing of adultery, and the fighting against and slaying of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have found both of these exemplified in the person of Lamech.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, we see from the holy Word that the small seed injected into human nature in Genesis 3 has developed to such a degree.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To all the evils of Cain were added the fulfilling of lust and the fighting amongst the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How many evils have developed from the one small seed sown into human nature!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Zillah not only gave birth to Tubal-cain, but also to a daughter named Naamah 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The name Naamah means "making herself lovely and pleasant."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For what purpose did she make herself attractive?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For the sake of man's lust.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This also is an aspect of modern society.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The young ladies are fond of making themselves pleasant and lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, every item of contemporary culture, in seed form, was pres-ent in Genesis 4.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we know the source of human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It came into being because man lost God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you read Genesis 5, you will discover that it lists the ages of all the people that it names.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It tells us, for example, that Adam lived nine hundred thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, the genealogy in Genesis 4 does not list the years of any person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because this genealogy is the genealogy of the lost.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the persons in Genesis 5 were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, that genealogy is the genealogy of the saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The saved persons walk in the way of God and, as a result, their days and years are reckoned in His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The lost people, on the contrary, are finished in His sight, and their days and years are not counted before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How long did Jabal, Jubal, and Tubal-cain live?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No one knows.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we are told clearly how long Adam and Methuselah lived nine hundred thirty years and nine hundred sixty-nine years respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Genesis 5 also speaks of Enoch a different Enoch from that found in Genesis 4 telling us that he lived three hundred sixty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His days and years were reckoned in the eyes of God.</S>
