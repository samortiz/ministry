   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO OUR TRIPARTITE BEING Scripture Reading: Rom 8:16; Eph 4:23; 1 Cor 6:19, 17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible speaks about our relationship with the Spirit of God in a detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This relationship involves all the parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are persons created by God in His image inwardly and according to His likeness outwardly Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Genesis 1, each living thing was created according to its own kind vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>12, 21, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man, however, was created according to God's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The human life and the divine life are two different lives, but they are lives of the same kind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Outwardly, we were created in the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Darwin taught wrongly that man evolved from the apes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The apes are after their own kind, but man is directly related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Inwardly, we are in the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our human life is not in our physical body alone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our physical body was formed of the dust of the ground, but there was no life in it until the Creator breathed His breath into it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God breathed into man, man began to have life Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The real human life came from the breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's breath in Genesis 2:7 was not the same as the breath breathed out by the Lord Jesus in John 20:22.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The breath in John 20:22 was the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Hebrew word for breath in Genesis 2:7 is neshamah, the same word translated as spirit in Proverbs 20:27, which says, "The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, even though the breath of God in Genesis 2:7 is not the Spirit of God or the life of God, it is still very closely related to God's Spirit and God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The inward human life is related to the breath of God, and the breath of God is the source of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE DISPENSING OF THE SPIRIT INTO OUR BEING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Testament speaks much about God as the Spirit dispensing Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God dispenses Himself into us in three steps.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first step is His dispensing into our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 3:6b says, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit"; Romans 8:16 says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God"; and 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, "But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The divine Spirit comes into our spirit, and these two spirits become mingled as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then He spreads from, through, and with our spirit into our mind Eph 4:23 , the main part of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Romans 8:6 says, "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we set our mind on our flesh, we will suffer death, but if we set our mind upon the spirit, we will enjoy life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, the Spirit even gives life to our mortal body Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul said, "Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>1 Cor 6:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit of God comes to dwell even in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our body is for our human existence, but it bothers us very much.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many of our troubles come from our body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But sometimes we are too influenced by our fallen situation, and we do not consider our body in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1 Thessalonians 4:4 Paul charges us to possess our own vessel, our body, in sanctification and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to consider our body in a positive way because it is the Spirit's holy habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The divine Spirit enters our spirit, spreads into our soul, and even indwells our body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should be persons touched by the divine Spirit in the three parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit's coming into the three parts of our being is His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First, God was incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This was the first step in His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then God died in the flesh on the cross, not only to take away sins, but also to release the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That releasing of the divine life was also a part of His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then His resurrection imparted His divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ's death released His divine life, and His resurrection imparted His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This impartation was also part of His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then the Spirit, who is the very pneumatic Christ, entered into us to regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That was a further, very intimate step in His dispensing of the Spirit into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Incarnation was wonderful, but it had nothing to do with us directly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Likewise, His precious death and resurrection did not reach us until the divine Trinity regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Regeneration was a very intimate step to dispense the Triune God into our being.</S>
