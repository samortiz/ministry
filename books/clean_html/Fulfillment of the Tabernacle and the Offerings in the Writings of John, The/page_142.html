<h2 class=head2>To Terminate the Old Creation</h2><p>The Son’s going through death was also to terminate the old creation. Concerning this Paul says, “Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him that the body of sin might be made of none effect” (Rom. 6:6). This verse indicates that our old man, our old creation, has been crucified with Christ. When Christ went to the cross, He terminated the old creation.<h2 class=head2>To Judge the World</h2><p>John 12:31a says, “Now is the judgment of this world.” The world is an evil system, arranged systematically by Satan. Satan has systematized all the things on earth, especially those related to mankind, and the things in the air, into his kingdom of darkness to occupy and frustrate people from the purpose of God and distract them from the enjoyment of God. When the Lord Jesus was crucified, this evil system, the kingdom of darkness, was judged. Therefore, the Lord’s going involved the judgment of the world.<h2 class=head2>To Destroy Satan and His Works</h2><p>By going through death the Lord also destroyed Satan and his works (John 12:31b; 16:11; Heb. 2:14; 1 John 3:8; John 3:14). John 12:31b says, “Now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.” When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3). Through His death the Lord destroyed Satan, who had injected himself into man’s flesh (Heb. 2:14). By judging Satan (John 16:11), the Lord also judged the world. The Lord’s going included the destroying of Satan and his works.<p>When in John 14 the Lord said that He was going, He was indicating His all-inclusive death. The Lord’s going took away the sin of the world, terminated the old creation, judged the world, and cast out the ruler of the world, Satan. By this we can see how much is included in the Lord’s going.<p>The word “going” is very rich in its significance. Sin has been taken away, the sin offering has been offered, the world has been judged, and Satan has been destroyed. If the disciples in John 14 had realized the significance of the sign of the Lord’s going, they would have been excited and offered praise to God. How wonderful is the sign of the Son’s going!<h2 class=head2>To Abolish the Law of the Commandments and Ordinances</h2><p>Through His death on the cross Christ also abolished the law of the commandments and ordinances (Eph 2:14-16). One of these ordinances was that the Jews, God’s chosen people, could not be one with the Gentiles. In John 10:16 the Lord Jesus indicates that, as a result of His death, the Jews and the Gentiles can be one: “And I have other sheep which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.” The one flock signifies the one church, the one Body of Christ, brought forth by life, which the Lord imparted into His members through His death (John 10:10-18). The “other sheep” in John 10:16 are the Gentiles. When these sheep are brought together with the Jewish sheep, there is one flock, one church, composed of both Jewish and Gentile believers. However, as long as the ordinances of the law remained, the Jews were prohibited from being one with the Gentiles. Therefore, the Lord died on the cross to annul, to abolish, the law of commandments and ordinances.<p>Today there no longer are ordinances separating the Jewish and Gentile believers. The Lord’s purpose in dying to abolish the ordinances was that the Jewish and Gentile believers might be built up into one building, and this unique building is the Father’s house. Praise the Lord that through His going to the cross He removed all the obstacles and cleared the way for us to enter into the Triune God for the building up of the Father’s house! How profitable was His going!
