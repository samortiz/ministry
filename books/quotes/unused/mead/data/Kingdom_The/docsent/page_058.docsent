   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MUSTARD SEED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the parable of the mustard seed 13:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus said that the mustard seed is the smallest of the seeds, yet it grows into a great tree.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although it may not be readily apparent, this also is damage caused by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Genesis 1, all the vegetables are to reproduce each after its kind, and the animals each after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, a peach tree should bring forth after its kind, and an apple tree should bring forth after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, an herb should be after its kind, and a tree should be after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, in this parable we see something that grows not according to its kind an herb becomes a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is growth out of proportion and growth which breaks the regulation of the life law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With every kind of life there is the life essence, the life power, the life shape, and the life law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have the confidence that if a peach sprout grows, it will become a peach tree, it will attain the height of a normal peach tree, and it will bring forth peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not need to be concerned that the peach tree might grow into another kind of tree and not produce peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is impossible, for within the peach sprout is the peach life, and within the peach life are the peach essence and the peach law which regulate its development.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to its law of life, the peach sprout will grow into a peach tree and will bring forth peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A Great Tree</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The mustard herb, however, grew into a great tree.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The shape, nature, and form were changed; it broke the law of life and grew out of proportion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This represents Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christendom has become a great tree.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to its nature, a mustard herb is small and good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But this herb grew out of proportion and became a great tree with many evil birds lodging in its branches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As such it was no longer good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Earlier in the same chapter, the Lord Jesus told us the interpretation of the birds, saying that they were the Devil and his angels.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many evil spirits lodge in Christendom today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The branches have become the lodging place of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This should not be a mere doctrine to us; we must have the practical application.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Growing out of Proportion</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The mustard herb became a great tree by breaking the life law and growing out of proportion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many Christians are ambitious to be great.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To desire to be great is very dangerous because it can break the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We thank the Lord that the move of His recovery in this country has been growing gradually throughout the years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we conducted the training on the Psalms in 1969, we had seven hundred attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 1972 we had close to 2200, more than three times the number in 1969.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This has been the proper growth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although it has been rather slow, it is nevertheless the normal growth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>During the past years we have been growing slowly because we do not like to have a big work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we do not use propaganda and advertisements.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Recently, a reporter from a newspaper contacted one of the brothers, wanting to give us some advertisement and publicity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The brother told the reporter that we do not like to be advertised.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We prefer to remain hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are a little mustard herb; we do not want to be a great tree.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the natural human concept, it is good to be a mushroom, growing up overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A mushroom grows up overnight, but it also disappears overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Anything that comes fast will also go fast.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You can be sure of this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let us seek the growth in the proper proportion according to the law of life, growth that is after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We do not want growth that is out of proportion and not after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will not rise up fast; neither will we go down fast.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must grow according to the law of life and be after our kind, in the proper proportion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I advise you never to use any advertisement.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you are going to get a name, it is better to have a bad name.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let people speak about you in an evil way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not display your best points to people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If people come to examine you, let them find out your weak points.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have always practiced this because we do not want to be great.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We desire to remain a little mustard herb and never become a great tree.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the Lord's recovery we have no giants.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If anyone comes to your locality asking who is your minister, you should tell him that everyone is a minister.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even the little sisters are ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We do not have a great leader; we are the little mustard herbs.</S>
