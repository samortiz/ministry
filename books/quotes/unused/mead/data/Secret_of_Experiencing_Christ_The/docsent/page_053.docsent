   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Want</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The last of the negative things in Philippians is what Paul describes as want 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To be in want is to have a material need.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Being short of the supply to meet a material or financial need may be a cause of serious concern.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such circumstances certainly are a negative thing which needs to be overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>AND THE WORD OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1:19 Paul says, "For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in verses 20 and 21 he speaks of magnifying Christ and of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To live Christ and magnify Him requires the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But how can this bountiful supply be applied to us?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The secret of experiencing this bountiful supply is in holding forth the word of life 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As Paul was living Christ and magnifying Him, he was no doubt holding forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was the reason that even some among Caesar's household could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They realized that Paul, a prisoner there in Rome, was holding forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul's word in 2:16 indicates that the bountiful supply of the Spirit was applied to him because he was receiving the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From Ephesians 1:13 we have seen that the Spirit is inseparable from the Word and comes with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If there is no Word, there can be no Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But when there is the preaching of the Word, it will be possible for those who hear this preaching to receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul received the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the word of life entered into him, it became the bountiful supply of the Spirit which enabled him to magnify Christ and live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Philippians 1:20 Paul speaks of magnifying Christ and in 2:16, of holding forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, Christ is the word of life, and the word of life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, in 2:13 Paul says that God operates in us "both the willing and the working for His good pleasure."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yes, it is God who works in us and operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But when this operating God is expressed, He is the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Unless we receive the word of life into our being, we shall not be able to hold forth this word, to magnify it, to manifest it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How can we magnify the word of life if the word has not come into us to be magnified?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to hold forth the word of life, we must first receive the word of life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Take eating as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a person does not eat properly for several days, his face will not have a healthy color.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if he daily receives a nourishing supply of food, his complexion will be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It will be the expression of the nourishing food he has eaten, digested, and assimilated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The principle is the same with holding forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The secret is to handle the Word in a proper way and thereby to receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit will then function in us as our living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way we shall overcome rivalry, vainglory, murmurings, reasonings, our own things, anxiety, and want.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we shall be able to say with Paul, "I can do all things in Him who empowers me" 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ empowers us through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose you neglect the Word for several days.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Will you still be empowered by Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Food empowers you only when you eat of it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Likewise, Christ empowers you only when you take the Word into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By taking in the divine element through the Word, we are empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we can do all things in Him who empowers us through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul concludes the Epistle to the Philippians by saying, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is important to realize that whatever we enjoy by receiving the Word eventually becomes the grace in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once again we see that we need to contact the Word and receive it by prayer, exercising our spirit to pray-read the Word in order to be supplied with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Receiving the Spirit through the Word, we shall have the faith to receive grace as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we shall have the experience of Christ with the enjoyment of the church life.</S>
