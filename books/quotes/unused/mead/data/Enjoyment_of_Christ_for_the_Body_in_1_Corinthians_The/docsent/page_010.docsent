   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>COMING BACK TO THE PROPER GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE ONENESS OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some may say that they are not in division because they are no longer in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To give up the denominations is a good beginning, but it is still short.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must come all the way back to the proper ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may illustrate this with the typology of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the time Solomon built the temple in the good land, all the children of Israel were one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because of their degradation, however, some of them were carried away into Syria, some into Egypt, and some into Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They all were scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead of being one, they became several divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many years later, God commanded them to return to the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After becoming clear that Babylon was not the right place to be, many came out of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, some might have stopped midway between Babylon and Jerusalem, some in one place and some in another.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, the result was that there were more divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At first there were only a few large divisions, but after many left Babylon, they became many smaller divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some, however, received the vision not only of leaving Babylon but of coming back to Jerusalem, and many eventually did come back.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Babylon there might have been a kind of oneness, a oneness in division, a subtle, divisive oneness, but Jerusalem was the place of the proper oneness Deut 12:5-18; 2 Chron 6:5-6; John 4:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a picture of the many non-denominational groups.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no oneness among the many free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The proper oneness is the oneness of the church on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who have come out of the denominations are happy to be nondenominational.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, it is good not to call oneself a Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, or Catholic.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the other hand, God has no intention that we be a part of nothing and remain midway.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this sense, we must be neither denominational nor nondenominational, because God s intention is to have the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Satan in his subtlety has damaged the Body, but God is coming in today to carry out His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is demanding that all His seekers and lovers leave Babylon, not remain midway, and come back to the ground of oneness, the spiritual Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By this we can see that there are two different kinds of oneness the oneness in Babylon and the oneness in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, only the oneness in Jerusalem is the proper oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although many of the children of Israel remained in Babylon, they were not the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The nation of Israel was in the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When those who returned to the good land stood on the ground of oneness to declare that they were the nation of Israel, some in Babylon might have been unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They might have said, Are only you the nation of Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Are we not Israel also?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are all brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all have the same Jewish life and are of the same Jewish blood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How can you say that you are the nation of Israel and that we are not?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The same condition exists today among the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There are nearly thirteen million Jews on the earth today, and over one million are in New York City alone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only a few million, however, have returned to Palestine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is only this small number that are recognized as the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Concerning those who return to the proper ground, the number is not the most important factor cf.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Ezra 2:64-65 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What matters is the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those Jews in New York are real Jews, and they may give much money for the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, they are not the nation of Israel, because they are not on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If they want to be in the nation of Israel, they must return to the land of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is the same with the Lord s recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we say that we are the church, many in the denominations are offended.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thousands of them may be genuine Christians, children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They may love the Lord, love the Bible, and love people s souls, and they may do a certain amount of work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, they still say that they are Lutheran, Presbyterian, or something else.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since they do this, they lose the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They are the right persons, but their position is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They need to come back to the real Jerusalem, the proper ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the Jews in the world today are privileged to return to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because they have Jewish blood, they will be received into the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Likewise, as believers we have the proper birth; however, most Christians have the wrong position.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As long as they keep their old position in Babylon or at a midway point, they miss the proper ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They are right persons on the wrong ground.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must all give up the wrong ground and return to the proper ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must stress this, because today we are under a situation of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God s intention is that we would be a corporate Body in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to know which meeting of Christians is on the proper ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There are many Christian organizations, groups, and bodies today.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Again, we may compare them to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Among the Jews today there are many organizations formed to help the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Among all these gatherings of Jews, however, only that group in Palestine is on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If all the Jews in Israel were in New York, they would no longer be the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They would lose the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Likewise, if those in the Jewish organizations would return to Palestine, they would become the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is not the number that is important; it is the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we remain in Babylon or midway in the free groups, we are not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We may be members of Christ s Body, but we lose the ground to be the church in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We all need to come back to the proper ground of the genuine oneness, not the oneness in the divisions.</S>
