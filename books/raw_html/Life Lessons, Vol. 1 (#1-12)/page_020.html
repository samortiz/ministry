<h1 class="msg">LESSON TWELVE</h1><h1 class="msg">KNOWING THE CHURCH</h1><p>The church is the goal God wants to obtain in His eternal economy. Each one of us who is saved participates in this goal, that God may obtain His heart’s desire according to His good pleasure. Therefore, we must also know the church.</p><h2 class="head1">I. WHAT THE CHURCH IS</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Called Out Assembly</h2><p><b>1) “On this rock I [Christ] will build My church”</b> (Matt. 16:18).</p><p>The church is what Christ will build through His death, resurrection, and ascension. The term “church” is ekklesia in Greek which means the called out assembly. Thus, according to its literal meaning, the church is the congregation called out from the world by God. It is not a church building or any edifice for the worship of God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Body of Christ</h2><p><b>1) “The church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all”</b> (Eph. 1:22-23).</p><p>The church is the Body with Christ as the Head; it is constituted for Christ in His life and Spirit with all those who have believed into Him. It is a living organism and not a lifeless organization, such as the clubs and associations in society.</p><p>The body of a man is the fullness of a man to be his expression. Likewise, the church is the fullness of Christ to be His expression. Since Christ is the One who is unlimited, extensive, and filling all in all, He needs a great Body to be the fullness of Himself who fills all in all to express Him in all things.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Counterpart of Christ</h2><p><b>1) “Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her”</b> (Eph. 5:25).</p><p>This word reveals that the church is also Christ’s counterpart. As the Body of Christ, the church receives life from Him for His expression; this is a matter of life. As the counterpart of Christ, the church receives His love for the satisfaction of His heart’s desire; this is a matter of love.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The House of God</h2><p><b>1) “That you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth [reality]”</b> (1 Tim. 3:15).</p><p>To Christ, the church is His Body and His counterpart, while to God, the church is His house. On the one hand, this house refers to God’s dwelling place, and on the other hand, it refers to God’s family, God’s household. These two, God’s household and God’s dwelling place, are just one. God’s household is the very house for God’s dwelling (Eph. 2:19, 22). A person’s house is his place of living, residing, and rest. The church, being God’s house, is also such a place to God. Today, the living God is living, residing, and resting in the church on the earth.</p><p>God is living, and the church as His house is also living, having the life of God, living, residing, and resting with God. Thus, the living house of God is the pillar and base of all His reality, which is the reality (truth) of the universe. Everything of this living God is the reality in the universe. Without Him, the universe is vain and empty; yet all His reality is being supported and upheld by the church, which is His living house.</p>
