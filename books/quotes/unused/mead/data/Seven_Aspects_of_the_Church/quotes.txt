[1]  SEVEN ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; 2:15-16, 19, 21-22; 4:4, 12-13, 16, 24; 5:5, 25, 31-32; 6:11, 13
[2]  Satan's goal is to divide the Body of Christ through knowledge and doctrine and to destroy the functions of the members of the Body through organization, especially organization that issues in the clergy-laity system.
[3]  In Ephesians 5 we see the church as the Bride of Christ.
[4]  This aspect reveals that the church comes out of Christ, as Eve came out of Adam Gen 2:21-22 .
[5]  The church has the same life and nature as Christ and becomes one with Him to be His counterpart, as Eve became one flesh with Adam Gen 2:24 .
[6]  Eventually, as Eve went back to Adam and was presented to him, so the church will go back to Christ and be presented to Him as His Bride.
[7]  Christ desires to make known His love to the church, and the church responds by telling the Lord how much she loves Him.
[8]  When we are not in our spirit, we do not have the church as God's dwelling place in a practical way.
[9]  They may speak a little regarding the church as the Bride of Christ or as God's family, but they have no concept that the church is God's present kingdom or God's dwelling place.
