But there are two conditions to consecration without which our consecration will not be solid. The first factor has to do with the church. Consecration is not simply for us to hand ourselves over to the Lord, but for us to hand ourselves over to the church. Surely when a person consecrates himself, he hands himself over to the Lord. But no one knows when this kind of consecration has changed or has been retracted. Only the consecration that is done under the authority of the church is solid, and only this kind of consecration will last. If a man says that he is consecrating himself, yet has not handed himself over to the church, such a consecration is not solid.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE THOROUGH CONSECRATION&#151;<br>INVOLVING MONEY AND OCCUPATIONS</H2><P>The second thing about consecration is that it always touches our money and our occupation. A consecration that does not result in handing oneself over to the church is not solid, and a consecration that does not touch one's money and his occupation is not thorough. These two subjects, money and occupation, require special attention.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MONEY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Relationship between God,<br>All Things, and Money</H2><P>How does God see money? Here we need to understand two kinds of relationships. The first is the relationship between God and all things. The second is the relationship between all things and money. God made from one all things (Acts 17:26). Everything a person touches with his hands and treads over with his feet is made by God. God not only made from one all things; He is even the Lord of all things. Satan is God's adversary. Yet he cannot deal with God directly. Because he cannot deal with God directly, he deals with all the things that issue from God's creation. Because Satan cannot damage God Himself, he tries to damage God's work. If Satan can snatch God's creation out of His hand, God will have failed. In order to damage God's work, Satan tries to snatch away God's creation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God Making from One All Things,<br>Whereas Satan Unifying All Things through Money</H2><P>Today I wish to point out to you the relationship between all things and money, and the relationship between all things and God. Satan tries to gain all things, but he cannot gain every item of all the things. "All things" are too much for him to handle. It is too troublesome to gain all things. "All things" include the cows, the goats, wood, stone, and so forth. You cannot exhaust the whole list of all things with a thousand lines. God made from one all things. Hence, Satan reduces all things into one kind of thing. This one thing is money. There is nothing in this world that cannot be bought with money. If a person has money, he has all things. This is why "money" in Chinese is tung-hwo, which means the "common good." You cannot call a piece of stone plus a piece of wood, two of anything. You cannot call a chair plus a table, two of anything. But through the invention of money, Satan is able to unify all things. He makes all things simple. Originally, the world with all its myriads of items was made from one. Now Satan is unifying these myriads of things into one through money. Everything that we see today can be reckoned in terms of money. That is why money is the means to unify all things. All things are created by God. Only money is not created by God; it comes from Caesar. When men asked Christ if there was a need to pay tribute money, He asked them to show Him a denarius, and He answered, "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar" (Matt. 22:21). He did not take any money out from His own pocket. Had He done this, others would have said that He too had Caesar in His pocket.</P><P>Money is created by Satan for the purpose of unifying all things. All things can be reckoned in terms of money. The earth is created by God. Yet, today man can reckon the price of lands in terms of money. If it is possible, man will even reckon the price of the moon, or the hydrogen in the sun, with money. Today man can buy everything. He can buy time. He can even buy human souls. One brother worked in the post office for many years. The post office has bought his soul. Included in Jacob's wealth, there were the cattle and the sheep, and there were also the souls of men. Revelation 18 tells us that the human soul is a commodity that can be bought and sold (vv. 12, 13). God has made from one all things. But Satan has unified all things into one.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_162.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_164.html">Next</a> </body></html>
