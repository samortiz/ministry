<p>In John 6 the Lord also spoke of the result of eating His flesh and drinking His blood.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Eternal Life</h2>
<p>A person who eats the Lord&rsquo;s flesh and drinks His blood has eternal life; that is, he has the Lord&rsquo;s life (v. 54). When a person eats lamb, the element of the lamb enters into him. Likewise, when we eat the Lord, His element enters into us to be our eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having an Abiding Union with the Lord</h2>
<p>A person who eats the Lord&rsquo;s flesh and drinks His blood abides in the Lord, and the Lord abides in him (v. 56). This indicates a union. Those who eat the Lord&rsquo;s flesh and drink His blood enter into a union with Him. They abide in the Lord, and He, in them. There is a union between a person and what he eats. A person who eats fish is joined to the fish, a person who eats chicken is joined to the chicken, and a person who eats beef is joined to the cow. Although these illustrations do not sound pleasant, the principle is correct. We are joined to the Lord by eating and drinking Him. &ldquo;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him&rdquo; (v. 56). We abide in the Lord, and He abides in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living because of the Lord</h2>
<p>A person who eats the Lord&rsquo;s flesh and drinks His blood lives because of the Lord. &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (v. 57). A brother has the energy to give a message because he eats breakfast, lunch, and dinner. He lives because of the food he eats. If he did not eat for three days, he would not have the strength to give a message. Similarly, when we eat the Lord, we have His life, we are joined to Him, He abides in us as our supply, and we live because of Him.</p>
<p>Many years ago the Chinese greeted one another by asking, &ldquo;Have you eaten to your satisfaction?&rdquo; This is a provincial expression, but it is according to the principle of life. A person who does not eat will not have the energy to live or to work. A person who is satisfied has the means to live, because he lives by what he eats. As Christians, we should care not only for being satisfied physically but also for being satisfied in our spirit. We should ask one another, &ldquo;Have you fed your spirit?&rdquo; We must eat the Lord until our spirit is satisfied so that we may live because of the Lord.</p>
<p>Believing in the Lord and obtaining His life is once and for all. But in order to live by Him, we need to eat Him every day. This is a very practical matter. I am not concerned about profound doctrines, but I want to ask, &ldquo;Do you eat and drink the Lord until you are full every day?&rdquo; We should not focus on understanding many doctrines, but we need to know this one fundamental matter: the Lord is the bread of life, and we must eat Him and enjoy Him daily.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TURNING FROM THE FLESH TO THE SPIRIT AND<br />
FROM THE SPIRIT TO THE WORD</h2>
<p>John 6 also tells us to turn from the flesh to the Spirit. After the Lord said that His flesh is edible and His blood is drinkable, there is another turn in the first half of verse 63: &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing.&rdquo; This verse shows that the word <em>flesh</em> in verse 55 does not refer to the Lord&rsquo;s physical flesh. Physical flesh cannot give us the Lord&rsquo;s life; it cannot enable us to live because of the Lord, and thus, it profits nothing. The Spirit can give us the Lord&rsquo;s life and enable us to live because of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord went on to say, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (v. 63). In chapter 6 there are three turns: from bread to flesh, from flesh to the Spirit, and from the Spirit to the word. The Lord first said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life&rdquo; (v. 48). Then there is a turn: &ldquo;My flesh is true food&rdquo; (v. 55). This is followed by another turn: &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing&rdquo; (v. 63), which is followed by yet another turn: &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (v. 63). We need to know the three turns in this chapter so that we will know what it means to eat and enjoy the Lord. In order to eat and enjoy the Lord, we must first see that He is the bread of life. This bread is the flesh of the One who died and whose blood was shed. However, this is not physical flesh; it is in spirit. Furthermore, the spirit is embodied in His words. His words are spirit. Thus, there are three turns: from bread to the flesh, from the flesh to the Spirit, and from the Spirit to the word. We may also say that to touch the Word is to touch the Spirit, and to touch the Spirit is to eat the Lord&rsquo;s flesh, and to eat the Lord&rsquo;s flesh is to eat the bread of life, which is to receive the Lord as our life supply. In order to eat the Lord, we must pay close attention to the Spirit and to the Lord&rsquo;s words.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
