   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE ORGANIC PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 9:22-23; 1 Thes 2:7; Eph 4:11-12; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 31, 39 OUTLINE Begetting 1 Cor 9:22-23.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Nourishing 1 Thes 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Teaching Eph 4:11-12.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Building 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 31, 39.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What I have said to the co-workers, elders, and all of you during the last week or two comes down to two things: the small groups and the prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Tonight we want to see the four things related to the organic practice of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are begetting, nourishing, teaching, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To beget is to preach the gospel to gain the new ones 1 Cor 9:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To nourish is to have the home meetings and to be nursing mothers in the homes of the new ones 1 Thes 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To teach is to have the small group meetings for the perfecting of the saints Eph 4:11-12 , and to build is to prophesy in the district meetings for the building up of the Body of Christ 1 Cor 14:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>BUILDING ACCORDING TO THE BLUEPRINT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Tonight I feel that I cannot go on speaking in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The reason for this is that in the past few meetings what we did here was like lecturing in the classroom, with some research done.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when I went down to the actual work site, I realized that either we have not started building, or we were not working according to plan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, I will make the matter very clear by speaking in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This does not mean that I have changed again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I must declare that I have not changed at all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are still on begetting, nourishing, teaching, and building, and the gospel, the homes, the small groups, and the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The gospel is for the begetting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The home is for the nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The small groups are for the teaching, and the teaching is for the prophesying, resulting in the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This blueprint has been drawn out clearly since last fall.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, all we had was simply a blueprint.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everyone seemed to be busy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But no one was busy according to the blueprint.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some have not even started on the work yet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, from this week on, all of you have to start working.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While you are building, your blueprint must be accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must not build something rectangular when the blueprint calls for something circular.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you do, you will have to rebuild everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, I will consider carefully with all of you the detailed way for the carrying out of this work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I hope that I can speak in a thorough way and that you can listen to my speaking in a sober way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to make the way to carry out this work very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every week, over five thousand people are meeting in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Among them, at least two to three thousand are active in service.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is quite a large number.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Unfortunately, due to the fact that the blueprint was not clear and that many have not actually started building, we have been moving around a lot, but accomplishing little according to the plan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I realize that we cannot go on wasting our time like this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, I want to say that from now on, every way must be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to listen carefully first before proceeding on with the work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE WAY TO CARRY OUT THE WORK Division into Small Groups</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first item in carrying out the work is to divide up the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the meeting halls have to make a proper division of the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This does not mean that the elders and co-workers divide them up for everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, they are there just to assist the saints in dividing among themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you divide up, there is no need to be too legal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Respect the wish of each individual.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At any rate, everyone must belong to a small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you do not have one, you are not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even if we have to give up our sleep and meals, we have to meet in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As to the number in the small groups, it must not be less than twelve and must not be more than twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Each small group should be from twelve to twenty in number.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I hope that you will clearly settle this matter of the division of the small groups within two weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every one has to be identified with one small group.</S>
