<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Being Taken Away by Oppression and Judgment,<br>and Being Cut Off out of the Land of the Living<br>for the Transgression of the Prophet's People</H2><P>Isaiah 53:8 says, "By oppression and by judgment He was taken away; / And as for His generation, who among them had the thought / That He was cut off out of the land of the living / For the transgression of my [the prophet's] people to whom the stroke was due?" In being arrested, judged, and crucified, Christ was oppressed and judged. He was judged in an unjust way by the high priest and by Pilate. Through that kind of judgment He was taken away and brought to Calvary and put on the cross. And as for His generation, who among those at His time had the thought that He was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of the prophet's people, the Jews, to whom the stroke was due? (Acts 8:33; Matt. 27:26b). The stroke should have fallen upon the Jewish people, but Christ as the Servant of Jehovah suffered the stroke for them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. His Grave Being Assigned with the Wicked,<br>but with a Rich Man in His Death</H2><P>Isaiah 53:9 says, "And they assigned His grave with the wicked, / But with a rich man in His death, / Although He had done no violence, / Nor was there any deceit in His mouth." Although Christ had done no violence, nor was there any deceit in His mouth, the Jews intended to bury Him with the wicked people; but under God's sovereignty, He was buried in a rich man's tomb.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. Jehovah Being Pleased to Crush Him,<br>to Afflict Him with Grief</H2><P>Isaiah 53:10a says, "But Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief." God was pleased to do this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. As the Resurrected Life-giver,<br>Producing a Seed<br>for the Building Up of His Body<br>as His Continuation<br>for Jehovah's Pleasure and His Satisfaction</H2><P>Third, the prophets' report and Jehovah's revelation unveil Christ as the resurrected Life-giver. Isaiah 53:10b-11 says, "When He makes Himself an offering for sin, / He will see a seed, He will extend His days, / And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand. / He will see the issue of the travail of His soul, / And He will be satisfied; / By the knowledge of Him, the righteous One, My Servant will make the many righteous, / And He will bear their iniquities." Although the term life-giver is not used in these verses, the thought of a life-giver is implied in the seed mentioned in verse 10. That seed surely is produced by life. Thus, Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is the Life-giver so that He can produce a seed for the building up of His Body as His continuation for Jehovah's pleasure and for His satisfaction. The Father is pleased and Christ is satisfied with the Body of Christ, which is constituted of the seed brought forth by Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</P>
