   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Mailing Address: c/o Nanking-Manchuria Railway, Ch'ang-ch'un Station, Chu Ting 5 Ting Mu, Ch'ien Yi Tung Store</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>NEWS FROM CHU CHIA CHENG TZE,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>CH'ANG-CH'UN, MANCHURIA</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Peace to the co-worker in the Lord, Brother Hung Pin:</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We received the news from Chefoo a few days ago that you had already arrived in Chefoo to visit the brothers there and to have meetings to testify for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We really thank and praise our Father and our Lord Christ because He has had mercy on us and cared for us in these last times.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He has opened a door for us in every place to preach His messages and revive His children to return to His name.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In addition to hastily sending Senior Brother T'ien P'ing Fang and my sister to Chefoo, we constantly remember the conference in Chefoo before the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We ask the Lord to grace and bless His work and help you be filled with the power of the Holy Spirit to be a bright testimony for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We also ask the Lord to grace the unsaved sinners in Chefoo so that they would come to the Lord's cross and be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother T'ien P'ing Fang can tell you of the news from our area.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It has been raining every day for many days, and the water levels have risen very high everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, I have not been able to communicate with Ch'ang-ch'un for half a month.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Chiang Shun T'ien can usually come on Wednesday and the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now there are three brothers who have been baptized into the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Brother Chiang comes, there are more brothers and sisters who want to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since the Lord has opened a door for us, we believe that no man can shut it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, there is a desperate need for the truth in Manchuria.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because the people here have been under the denominational system for a long time, they still are attracted by the activities in the denominations, even though they have obeyed the Lord and turned to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is like the children of Israel longing for Egypt in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we beg the Lord to keep us and grace us by sending some brothers to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since you have already come to Chefoo, it would only be another day and a night's journey to Ch'ang-ch'un.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I beg the Lord's Spirit to lead you here.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is something we have earnestly hoped for for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It would not delay you to come to Manchuria once.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Overcomer Conference in Hangchow is in the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May the Lord perfect us according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May the Lord bless your work in Chefoo and give you much power in the Holy Spirit and keep you healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I also hope that the brothers and sisters in Chefoo receive much grace from the Lord this time and are revived to become the Lord's overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please greet Brother Sun, Brother Chao, Brother Lin, and all the brothers and sisters in the Lord with peace!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>An Ching T'ien</S>
