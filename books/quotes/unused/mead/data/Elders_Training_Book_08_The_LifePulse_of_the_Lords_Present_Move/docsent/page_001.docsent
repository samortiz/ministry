   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>FOREWORD</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Approximately four hundred and twenty-five brothers came together in Anaheim, California for an elders training with Brother Witness Lee in February of 1986.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Book 7 entitled One Accord for the Lord s Move and Book 8 entitled The Life-pulse of the Lord s Present Move contain Brother Lee s fellowship during those days.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the Lord is bringing all the local churches into His up-to-date move, the fellowship contained in these two books of this set of the elders training series is vital.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For the carrying out of the present practice in the Lord s recovery, it is crucial that every saint enter into the burden of the word that was spoken in this training.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We trust that the vision of all the points presented in these two volumes would be wrought into us and that we would live according to this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our prayer is that all the churches with all the saints would be brought into one accord for the Lord s move and that the life-pulse of the Lord s present move, which comprises the home gatherings, the truth lessons, the burden for full-timers, with all being either a job-dropping one or a money-making one, and the spreading of the gospel, would become a living reality in all the churches.</S>
