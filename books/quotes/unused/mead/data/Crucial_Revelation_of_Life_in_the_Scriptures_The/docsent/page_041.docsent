   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE SPIRIT OF LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: John 6:63a, c; 2 Cor 3:6c; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:2a; John 3:5-6b; 4:24; Matt 28:18-19 THE SPIRIT THAT GIVES LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have covered the tree of life, the river of life, the breath of life, and the seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we come to the ultimate point, the highest point the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are three places in the New Testament that refer to the Spirit as the Spirit that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 6:63 tells us that it is the Spirit that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second Corinthians 3:6 tells us that the letter kills but the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Finally, 1 Corinthians 15:45 says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a principle in the Bible that two is the number of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To speak something a third time is a confirmation to what has been testified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What has been spoken three times has been spoken in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The matter of the Spirit giving life has been spoken, testified, and confirmed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy Spirit of God is the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The term "the Spirit of life" is mentioned only once in the New Testament; Romans 8:2 refers to the "law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this verse are four items: the law, the Spirit, the life, and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The law is the law of life, the Spirit is the Spirit of life, and Christ is the Christ of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The law, the Spirit, and Christ are related one to another, and they are one in life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Revelation 11:11 tells us that the pneuma of life, the breath of life, comes into the two witnesses, who had been killed by Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This shows us that the Spirit of life is simply the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is very difficult to define what life is, but thank the Lord that in the Bible we can trace something of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The divine life is with the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit of God today is the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, and this Spirit of life is the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we have the breath of life, we have the Spirit of life and life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is easy for us to receive life because this life is with the divine breath.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We just need to breathe in the divine breath by exercising our spirit, our breathing organ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>FOUR ASPECTS OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT God Being Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the revelation of the New Testament, the divine Spirit has at least four crucial aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, the New Testament says clearly that God is Spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 4:24 does not say that God is a Spirit but that God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is similar to saying that a table is wood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Spirit in John 4:24 refers to the divine essence just like wood can be the essence of a table.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit Being the Application of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second, the Bible tells us a mystery which we can never understand adequately, that is, that our God is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word triune is not in the Bible but the fact of God's being triune is revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Genesis 1:1 the word "God" is used for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The subject "God" in Hebrew Elohim is plural in number, whereas the verb in this verse is singular in number.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This contains the meaning that God is three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Matthew 28:19 tells us to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This verse uses the singular "name" not "names."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is one name for the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The name is the sum total of the divine Being, equivalent to His person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Father is in the Son, and the Son with the Father is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The three persons of the Godhead are not three separate beings just as man's spirit, soul, and body are not three separate parts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A man is one complete being with three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is triune and man is tripartite.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With God there are three persons, but we should not think that these three persons are three separate, divine beings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some Christians believe that the three of the Godhead are not only distinct but also separate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>While the three of the Godhead are distinct, it is wrong, according to the truth of the Scriptures, to say that they are separate.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three separate gods.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Both in the Old Testament and the New Testament, we are always told that there is only one God Isa 45:5; Psa 86:10; 1 Cor 8:4; 1 Tim 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bible tells us clearly that God is uniquely one, but that He is triune with three persons the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God the Father is in God the Son, and God the Son is in God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In John 14:10 the Lord said that He was in the Father and the Father in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, Romans 8:2 refers to the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.</S>
