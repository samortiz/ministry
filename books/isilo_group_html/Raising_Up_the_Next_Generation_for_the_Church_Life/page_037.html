<p>Jacob also charged everyone to purify themselves (35:2). We must not only put away the foreign gods but also purify our whole being. In other words, our whole being, manner of life, and expression must be changed. This is not merely regeneration or a little change in life. Rather, it is a full transformation. Here in Genesis 35, Jacob was transformed.</p>
<p>In the Bible, purifying ourselves means to be purified from every pollution. Our whole being must be cleansed from anything that is pollution in the eyes of God. In 2 Corinthians 7:1 Paul says, &lsquo;&lsquo;Therefore, since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and of spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.&rsquo;&rsquo; Paul&rsquo;s concept in 2 Corinthians 6 and 7 was the same as Jacob&rsquo;s in Genesis 35. Because the Corinthians were the temple of God, Paul told them to purify themselves. There can be no agreement between the temple of God and idols (2 Cor. 6:16). Idols are idols, and the temple of God is the temple of God. Which side do you take? If idols, then go to your idols. If the temple of God, then come to the temple without any idols.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHANGING THEIR GARMENTS</h2>
<p>In addition to putting away the foreign gods and purifying themselves, [Jacob&rsquo;s household] changed their garments (Gen. 35:2). According to the Bible, to change garments means to change your manner of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BURYING THEIR EARRINGS</h2>
<p>Verse 4 says, &ldquo;So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand and the rings which were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak that was near Shechem.&rdquo; Not only were the idols buried, but also the earrings. Earrings are self-beautifying items. These were dealt with in the same way as the idols. Many people&rsquo;s earrings, ornaments, are equal to idols in the eyes of God. When those in Jacob&rsquo;s household were putting away the foreign gods, they also put away their earrings. This indicates that to their conscience their earrings were as abominable as their foreign gods. After touching the church, many sisters had the same conviction and put off this kind of abominable ornament. This is not something related to morality but to the house of God.</p>
<p>God did not charge Jacob to make such a clearance. Still less did He say, &ldquo;Jacob, you must tell your household and everyone with you to make a clearance and to purify themselves.&rdquo; Why, then, did Jacob charge everyone in this way? Because the house of God is not an individual matter. It is not only Jacob. The house of God must be the house of Jacob becoming the house of Israel. Eventually, all the descendants of Jacob became the house of God, Bethel. The real Bethel was not the tabernacle; it was the children of Israel. Likewise, we must see that today we are the church. We must be purified not only because we are going to Bethel, but because we are to be Bethel. We must put away all foreign gods and abominable ornaments, purify ourselves, and change our garments. Putting away the foreign gods also means putting away all foreign trusts. We must be cleansed in our whole being, inwardly and outwardly, from every pollution, and we must change our manner of life. This is all for the church life. (<em>Life-study of Genesis,</em> pp. 1001-1002, 1003, 1005, 1006-1007)</p>
<h2 class="head1">SELF-BEAUTIFICATION LEADING TO IDOLATRY</h2>
<p>Another principle implied in this portion of Exodus concerns what an idol is, or what is the principle of an idol. We see this principle in Exodus 32:1-4a: &ldquo;And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered against Aaron and said to him, Come, make a god for us who will go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him. And Aaron said to them, Tear off the gold rings, which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me. And all the people tore off the golden rings which were in their ears and brought them to Aaron. And he took the gold from their hand and fashioned it with an engraving tool and made it into a molten calf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we see the kind of material that was used to make the idol. An idol, of course, must be made with something material. The material used in making the golden calf in Exodus 32 was the gold of the earrings belonging to the wives, sons, and daughters of the children of Israel. It may be that the only ones without golden earrings were the elderly men. The old men were an exception because they do not care for beautification. I can testify that, as an elderly man, I have no interest in beautifying myself. However, it is common for young men and women and also for older women to beautify themselves. Therefore, in Exodus 32 the gold rings were taken from the ears of the wives, the sons, and the daughters and used to make the idol, the golden calf.</p>
<p>Self-beautification leads to idolatry. This is the reason the Lord in 33:5 and 6 gave the children of Israel a commandment related to ornaments: &ldquo;Now Jehovah had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You are a stiff-necked people; if I were to go up in your midst for one moment, I would consume you. Now therefore put off your ornaments from you, and I will decide what to do to you. Thus the children of Israel were stripped of their ornaments from Mount Horeb onward.&rdquo; The Lord issued this commandment concerning ornaments because, as the record of chapter 32 makes clear, self-beautification leads to idolatry.</p>
<p>Do you know what many Americans are worshipping today? They are worshipping the idols of self-beautification. For example, before a young woman goes to work, she may spend a great deal of time beautifying herself. She may even spend more money on items for self-beautification than she does for food. My concern here is to point out the fact that self-beautification leads to idolatry. First the children of Israel wore golden earrings for self-beautification. Then these golden earrings were fashioned by Aaron into the idol of the golden calf.
