<h2 class="head1">TURNING FROM RELIGION IN OUR FLESH<br />
TO THE CHRIST IN OUR SPIRIT<br />
BY CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>There are always two realms before us&mdash;the realm of the flesh and the realm of the Spirit&mdash;which represent two possibilities for us. We may be in the realm of the Spirit one moment but immediately turn and be in the realm of the flesh the next moment. Therefore, we must call on the name of the Lord Jesus. It is not adequate even to pray, &ldquo;O Lord, save me from my flesh. I would like to be in the Spirit, but I am about to lose my temper. O Lord, please help me.&rdquo; Even after praying like this, we may still lose our temper. The only way to quickly turn to the Spirit is to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus. O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; To call on the Lord&rsquo;s name truly works. Whenever we call in this way, we are immediately in the realm of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Galatians 3 reveals both the Spirit and the flesh. Verse 3 says, &ldquo;Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?&rdquo; We all need to answer, &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy on me. I do not want to be so foolish as to seek perfection in the flesh.&rdquo; However, all Christians are foolish like this at some time. To make up our mind to do something or not to do it out of our own flesh is foolish. To say &ldquo;I will never...&rdquo; is not the realm we should be in. The realm we need to be in is the realm of the Spirit. We need to forget about ourselves, because we cannot do anything or be anything for the Lord unless we stay in the Spirit. We must not have any trust or confidence in ourselves. This does not mean that we are unable to love our wife, for example. A good gentleman can love his wife for a long time. Nevertheless, his love may simply be in the flesh. Whenever we try to do something for God by ourselves, we are religious and in the flesh. In this sense, to be religious is simply to be fleshly. Apparently, <em>religious</em> is a good word and <em>flesh</em> is not, but in practice both are equivalent.</p>
<p>If we are religious, we will try to adjust others. If someone is too quick and careless, we will exhort him to be slower and more cautious. However, if we have a proper vision, we will see that we do not need to be careless or more careful, quick or slow, and we do not need mere teaching. What we need is to receive the Spirit by calling on the Lord Jesus. Religion is related to the flesh and fits our natural tendency and the disposition of the flesh. Every husband, whether or not he is a Christian, realizes that he should love his wife, and every proper woman considers that she should submit to her husband. These inclinations are already in our nature. However, merely to follow our natural inclination is of the flesh and not out from the salvation in God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s economy is not that we give up evil things and do only good things. Even Confucius taught this to his disciples. God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit, into us as our life and our person so that we would deny ourselves and follow the Christ who is within us, that is, in our human spirit (2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16). We should not look only to the Christ who is in heaven, and we should not try to find Him in the considerations and analysis of our mind. Rather, we should turn to our spirit and call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE REALIZATION AND<br />
CONSUMMATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Galatians 3:8 says, &ldquo;The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles out of faith, announced the gospel beforehand to Abraham: &lsquo;In you shall all the nations be blessed.&rsquo;&rdquo; The gospel, which was first preached to Abraham, is that the nations are blessed in his seed, who is Christ (v. 16). To be blessed in Christ as the seed is not to go to heaven; heaven is not mentioned at all in this chapter. In Galatians 3 the blessing is the promised Spirit (v. 14). All the nations, the entire earth, are blessed in Christ with the promise of the Spirit. The Father is in the Son (John 14:10), and the Son is the all-inclusive Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). Therefore, the Spirit is the Triune God Himself. The Triune God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, but this does not mean that we have three Gods; there is only one God (Gal. 3:20; Deut. 6:4; Rom. 3:30; 1 Cor. 8:6; James 2:19). We must be careful even in using terms such as the &ldquo;persons&rdquo; in the Godhead. W. H. Griffith Thomas, the writer of a top exposition on Romans, wrote that our human language is inadequate to explain the mystery of the Divine Trinity. In his book <em>The Principles of Theology,</em> he writes, &ldquo;The term &lsquo;Person&rsquo; is also sometimes objected to...It certainly must not be pressed too far, or it will lead to Tritheism.&rdquo; Nevertheless, the teaching of the Divine Trinity that the three in the Godhead are separate gives the impression of tritheism&mdash;that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate Gods.</p>
<p>We believe in the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). However, we cannot systematize Him, and our human words are inadequate to describe Him. In Isaiah 9:6 the Son who is given to us is called Eternal Father. In John 14:8 Philip said, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?&rdquo; (vv. 9-10a). To see Brother Jones is to see Mr. Jones. It is foolish to say to Brother Jones, &ldquo;Show us Mr. Jones.&rdquo; Likewise, to see Jesus is to see the Father, because He is in the Father and the Father is in Him. Moreover, 1 Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam [Christ the Son] became a life-giving Spirit,&rdquo; and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; We believe Matthew 28:19, which speaks of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and we also believe Isaiah 9:6, John 14:9-10a, 1 Corinthians 15:45b, and 2 Corinthians 3:17.</p>
<p>The Spirit today is the realization and consummation of the entire Triune God, and the Triune God bountifully supplies Himself to us as the Spirit (Gal. 3:5). This Spirit is all-inclusive; the fullness of the Godhead, divinity, humanity, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and all positive things are included in this Spirit. When we receive this Spirit, we receive everything we need. We receive the Creator, divinity, humanity, the Redeemer, the Lamb of God, the resurrected Christ, the ascended Christ, salvation, life, light, love, and all positive things. All these items are in the Spirit, who has been ministered and is still being ministered to us.</p>
