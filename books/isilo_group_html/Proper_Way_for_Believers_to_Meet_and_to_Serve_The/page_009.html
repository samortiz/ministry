BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If we would walk only according to the spirit, we will be filled inwardly with the Spirit daily. Immediately after I was saved, I read numerous spiritual books, most of which were published in England. These books said that the infilling of the Spirit is a very difficult yet great matter. It is indeed a great matter for sinners to be filled with the Spirit. The books I read said that the first blessing a sinner receives is regeneration and that the second blessing is being filled with the Spirit. After many years, however, I discovered that these two matters are great but not difficult.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Miraculous Normality</h2>
<p>Recently, I spoke concerning three items of truth: regeneration, the inward filling of the Spirit, and the outward filling of the Spirit. I pointed out that these matters are miraculous yet normal. Hence, I coined the term &ldquo;miraculous normality&rdquo; to indicate that these normal things are also miraculous. Moody said that regeneration is the greatest miracle in the universe. Is it not a great miracle that a filthy, defiled, and vile sinner is able to receive God&rsquo;s life and be regenerated to become a son of God? A person does not need to roll on the floor remorsefully, moaning, &ldquo;Lord, I am a sinner, but I no longer want to be a sinner; I want to be a son of God,&rdquo; before God will respond. Rather, a person needs only to say, &ldquo;Lord, I am a sinner; thank You for dying for me,&rdquo; and he is saved immediately. Hence, regeneration is a great miracle, yet it is very normal.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Be Filled with the Spirit Being Normal</h2>
<p>To be filled with the Spirit is a great miracle, but it is also normal. Because we are one spirit with the Lord, we should exercise daily to walk according to the spirit. Even though we might not be able to walk according to the Spirit a hundred percent of the time, we should aspire to advance daily. Our being filled with the Spirit depends on our walking according to our human spirit. Let us use an illustration. Although a vessel that is nearly filled with water is surrounded by air, it can contain only a small amount of air. If the vessel is emptied of some water, it can be filled with more air. The more the water is poured out, the more the vessel can be filled with air. When the vessel is completely emptied of water, the vessel will be filled with air. Hence, it is not difficult to be filled with the Spirit; it depends on how much we are willing to be emptied. When I was younger, I was taught that it is very difficult to be filled with the Spirit. A person needs to fast, to pray, and to fulfill many other requirements. Hence, I exhausted myself and exerted much effort, but I was unable to be filled with the Spirit. Now I have experience, and I realize that we do not need to exert any effort to be filled with the Spirit. This is a miraculously normal experience. We need only to confess our sins, live according to the spirit, and walk according to the spirit, and then we will be filled spontaneously with the Spirit. For example, when I go to get a haircut, the Spirit within me tells me how long my hair should be. My hair is short not because I do not like long hair; rather, my hair is not long because the Spirit within me does not want my hair to be long. This is to walk according to the spirit, and the result is that we are filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>It is not easy for brothers to wear neckties according to the spirit. My hometown was conservative, and people were criticized for speaking English and for wearing Western suits. For this reason, I did not wear a Western suit until I was invited to visit the church in Manila in 1950. At that time it was difficult for me to wear a necktie. The Philippines is in a tropical region; therefore, most of the suits given to me by the brothers were white. It is difficult to find suitable ties for white suits. If I wore the ties given to me by the saints, I would be doing a necktie show instead of giving a message. Wearing neckties according to the Spirit is a difficult matter. Three years ago a brother gave me a necktie that had fine red stripes. Others might say that the necktie is okay, but the Spirit within me did not allow me to wear it. I still wear ties that are plain and without stripes or lines, because I feel comfortable wearing them.</p>
<p>It may not be easy to walk according to the spirit, but we have to practice. The extent to which we walk according to the spirit is the extent to which we will be filled with the Spirit. Just like a cup must be emptied of water in order to be filled with air, so we must be emptied every day in order to be filled with the Spirit. When we are completely empty, we will be completely filled with the Spirit. This is not a difficult matter. The Lord has already accomplished redemption and has resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit. Now He is waiting to fill us. Just as air surrounds the cup and is also within the cup, so the Spirit surrounds us and is in us. As soon as we are emptied, He will fill us within. It is not difficult for Him to fill us; the hindrance is that we are not emptied.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Proper Way for Believers to Meet and to Serve &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
