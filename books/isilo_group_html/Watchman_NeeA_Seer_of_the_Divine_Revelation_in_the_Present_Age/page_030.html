We must, with a single heart, look to God and never do anything which will bring disgrace upon Him. When people give us money, we must accept it on behalf of Christ, but never ask anyone for such a favor. Thank God that after I declared to my parents that I would spend their money no longer, I could still go on studying in school for two more years. Though I did not know from where my sustenance would come, whenever there was a need, God always provided. Sometimes the situation appeared extremely difficult, yet God never let me down. We often place our hope in other people, but God does not want us to look to them. We must learn this lesson: Spend as we receive and never be like the Dead Sea, with an inlet and no outlet. We ought to be like the River Jordan with inlets on one end and outlets on the other. The Levites in the Old Testament devoted themselves to serve God, yet they too had to offer tithes.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MORE PERSONAL TESTIMONIES</H2><P>In his Narration of the Past, given on December 4, 1932, he gave more personal testimonies concerning living by faith:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>After we had been holding meetings for about a month, some young brothers among us felt that we should have a proper place to meet in the future. But since we were short of money, it was beyond our means to do so. I went to school to talk the matter over with several brothers, that is, with brothers Faithful Luk, Simon Meek, and Wang Tze, and we agreed that we should continue our work among the students. Then for the first time I rented some premises, a place owned by a family named Ho, all the members of which had been saved. They agreed to rent the place to me for a monthly amount of only nine dollars. I then prayed with several brothers, asking God to supply the three months' rent which was needed in advance before we could move in.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Every Saturday I went to Ma-Kiang, Fukien, to listen to Miss Margaret Barber's preaching. This time when I saw her, she said, "Here is twenty-seven dollars, which a friend asked me to give you for your work." This sum was exactly sufficient for three months' rent at nine dollars per month&#151;not too much and not too little. On my return, without hesitation, I paid the three months' rent in advance. Later, we prayed again, and the Lord provided again.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Watchman Nee-A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
