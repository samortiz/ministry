Believing That the Lord&rsquo;s Resurrection<br />
Has Put Satan to Shame</h2>
<p>Third, we must believe that the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection has put Satan to shame. Satan no longer has any way to attack us.</p>
<p>Colossians 2:12 says, &ldquo;Buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead.&rdquo; This verse speaks of death as well as resurrection. Verse 13 tells us how we died and resurrected; verse 14 tells us what the Lord did at the time of His death; and verse 15 says that the Lord Jesus stripped off the rulers and the authorities and &ldquo;made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it.&rdquo; Verse 20 says, &ldquo;If you died with Christ,&rdquo; and 3:1 says, &ldquo;If therefore you were raised together with Christ.&rdquo; These verses begin with resurrection and end with resurrection, and the verses in between speak of triumphing in the cross. We stand in the position of resurrection, and we triumph in the cross.</p>
<p>Why can we do this? The statement we made earlier explains this: The Lord has died, and we also are dead in Him. Satan, who has dominion over the old man, can follow us only as far as the cross. Resurrection is beyond him. Just as Satan had nothing in the Lord Jesus while He was on earth (John 14:30), so also he has nothing in Him in resurrection. Satan has no place at all in the new life. He has no authority at all in the new life and cannot touch our new life!</p>
<p>When the Lord was hung on the cross, it seemed as if myriads of demons were surrounding it. They thought that they could destroy the Son of God. It was to have been their greatest victory. Little did they realize that the Lord Jesus would go into death, come out of death, and overcome the authority of death! Here is the glorious fact: The Lord has come out of death! Therefore, we have the boldness and the confidence to say that the life of God is well able to cast away death!</p>
<p>What is the resurrection life? The resurrection life is a life that cannot be touched by death. It is a life that transcends death, that is beyond the boundary of death, that comes out of death, and that death cannot hold. Satan&rsquo;s power extends only as far as death. The Lord Jesus proved how great the power of His life is through His resurrection. He dismantled the power of Satan. The Bible calls this power &ldquo;the power of His resurrection&rdquo; (Phil. 3:10). When this resurrection power is expressed through us, everything of Satan is cast down!</p>
<p>We can withstand Satan because our life is a life of resurrection. This life has nothing to do with Satan. Our life issues from the life of God; it is a life that comes out of death. Satan&rsquo;s power only goes as far as death. Whatever it does to us is limited to this side of death. But our life has come out of death. We have a life which he cannot touch. We are standing on resurrection ground, and we look back in triumph through the cross. Colossians 2 speaks of triumphing in resurrection. It is a chapter on resurrection, not death. We do not triumph in death through resurrection; rather we triumph in resurrection through death.</p>
<p>In order to withstand Satan, every child of God must declare with a strong faith, &ldquo;Thank God, I have resurrected! Satan, what can you do? What you can do goes only so far as death. But the life that I have today has nothing to do with you! This life has been tested by you already. What else can you do? You are powerless! This life has transcended over you! Satan, get away from me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We cannot deal with Satan on the ground of hope. We can only stand on the ground of resurrection, the ground of the Lord. This is a very basic principle. Colossians 2:12 tells us that we must believe in &ldquo;the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to take the same position before Satan as that which we take before God. The Bible tells us to put on the robe of righteousness when we come before God (Isa. 61:10; Zech. 3:4-5). Our robe of righteousness is Christ. We need to put on Christ to come before God. In the same way, we need to put on Christ to come before Satan. God cannot find our sins when we put on Christ. Likewise, Satan cannot find our sins when we are in Christ. When we take this stand, Satan can no longer attack us. We are perfect before God and perfect also before Satan. What a glorious fact!</p>
<p>We must not be afraid of Satan. If we are afraid of Satan, he will laugh at us. He will say, &ldquo;What a fool there is on earth. How can this one be so foolish?&rdquo; Anyone who is afraid of Satan is foolish, because he has forgotten his position in Christ. We have no reason to fear him. We have transcended over his power. We can stand before him and say, &ldquo;You cannot touch me! No matter how strong and resourceful you are, you are still one step behind!&rdquo; On the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, He led the enemy captive and openly shamed him. Today we are standing on the ground of resurrection, and we triumph through the cross!</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages for Building Up New Believers, Vol. 3 &nbsp; pg 69</div><br></body></html>
