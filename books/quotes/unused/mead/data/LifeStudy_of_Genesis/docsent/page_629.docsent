   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN JOSEPH'S LIVING CORRESPONDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH HIS VISION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Genesis, in which nearly all of the truths in the Bible are sown as seeds, may be considered a biography of eight great men: Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These eight men are arranged in two groups of four.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Adam, Abel, Enoch, and Noah make up the first group; and Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph form the second.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first group represents the created race, the Adamic race, whereas the second group represents the called race, the Abrahamic race.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because of the failure of the created race, God had a new start with the called race.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The created race began with Adam and ended with Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At both the beginning and the ending, the created race was a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Adam, the head of God's created race and its representative, became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With Abel we have the coming back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Adam, man fell away from God; but through God's redemption, Abel came back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Enoch, who came after Abel, not only returned to God, but also walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The issue of his life was a type of the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Enoch was raptured out of death unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Enoch's life issued in Noah, who also walked with God and who had an experience of reigning, although his reigning was neither adequate nor full.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, Noah's reigning issued in a fall.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Noah's descendants rebelled against God at Babel, and that rebellion resulted in God's giving up of the created race.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Forced to have a new beginning, God visited Abraham and called him out of the rebellious created race.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This marked the beginning of a new race, the called race, the Abrahamic race.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With this called race God certainly achieved a great success.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Beginning with Abraham and continuing through Isaac and Jacob, the way rose higher and higher.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually we see a full reign in Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we have pointed out, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph should not be considered separate individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, they represent four aspects of a complete, mature saint.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In them we see God's selection, God's calling, and justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We see how a called and justified saint can live in the presence of God by faith to enjoy all the riches of the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, such a one still strives to gain the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But all his struggles cause him nothing but suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In his sufferings God's hand comes upon him to deal with him, and he is dealt with by God until he becomes mature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hallelujah, in the called race we see the maturity of life!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This matured life has a reigning aspect, an aspect portrayed by the life of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the reason that in the book of Genesis Joseph is so excellent and marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I was young, my mother used to tell us Bible stories.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She spent a long time on the story of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Oh, how I sympathized with this excellent one when I heard that he was cast into a pit and sold into slavery!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although I loved Joseph and realized that he was someone special, I did not know why he was so excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I knew only that Joseph was very good and that I wanted to be like him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even after I had ministered the Word for years, I still did not know the reason for Joseph's excellence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But now I can boldly give you the reason Joseph was excellent: it was because he was the reigning aspect of the mature life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>And he was the reigning aspect of a matured Israel, not of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, Joseph was the cream of a matured life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What we see in Joseph, of course, is simply a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In reality and in actuality, the reigning aspect typified by Joseph is Christ constituted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all are Jacobs, but we have the constitution of Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the day we were regenerated, Christ was constituted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually this Christ becomes our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That part of our being that is constituted with Christ is neither our flesh nor our mind; rather, it is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Second Timothy 4:22 says that Christ is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that Christ is constituted into the depths of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Christ-constituted aspect of our regenerated being is fully represented, portrayed, and typified by Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because Joseph represents the reigning aspect of a victorious and mature life, his life is recorded in the Bible in such an excellent way.</S>
