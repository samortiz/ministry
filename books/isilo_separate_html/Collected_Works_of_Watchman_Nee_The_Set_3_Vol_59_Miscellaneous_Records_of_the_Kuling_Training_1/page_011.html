It is easy for their spirit to break out in weeping, and easy for it to break out in rejoicing. Emotions occupy a great part of a person's outer man. After the outer man is broken, the emotion becomes obedient. A man can weep and laugh without putting up much resistance. The distance between his spirit and the outside world becomes very short. Those who find it difficult to express sentiments are unbroken. When God created the universe, He exclaimed that everything was good even on the first day. He is full of feelings. Some people, however, are like rocks when they hear others talk; they are void of feelings. This is because their emotion is not broken. As a result, they cannot use their spirit. A person whose emotion is broken is easily touched by many things. He also can easily express himself. His emotions express themselves instantly, quickly, congenially, and easily.</p><h2 class="head4">The Mind Being Calm and Available</h2><p>Third, the mind of a broken person is subdued as well. Originally, a man's mind is centered around himself. When the outer man is unbroken, the mind tends to revolve around itself, and the spirit cannot make use of it. Under normal circumstances, when the outer man is broken, the mind will facilitate the release of the spirit. The mind is merely an instrument; it should always remain calm and be under the spirit's control. When the spirit has a burden, the mind should find the words to discharge the burden. A broken man is always ready in his mind; his mind is always ready to cooperate with the spirit. When something happens to him, he does not turn to his mind, but to his spirit. Only after he has exercised his spirit will he use his mind to deal with the matter. His mind is a servant, an instrument, that has been made available to the spirit's employ.</p><h2 class="head4">Easy for the Spirit to Be Released</h2><p>After the faculties in our soul&mdash;the mind, emotion, and will&mdash;are broken, we have a share in the work, and we have the ministry of the word. A man who is dealt with by God has a proper word within and adequate thoughts without. His various sentiments are expressed in a proper way, and he has a pliable yet strong will. When these things are in place, he has no trouble releasing his spirit. When the spirit within needs to be released, his outer man obeys. He speaks when he needs to speak, laughs when he needs to laugh, weeps when he needs to weep, and makes decisions when he needs to make decisions. In whatever his inner man wants to do, his outer man cooperates. In this way he becomes a minister of the word.</p><p>We fellowship with God with our spirit, and we also fellowship with the brothers and sisters with our spirit. God is Spirit, and as Spirit, He is omnipresent. Man also has a spirit, and he fellowships with God with his spirit. A man can fellowship with God with his spirit. However, the shell outside his spirit, his outer man, can prevent him from loving God and communicating with Him. Only those whose outer man is broken can release their spirit easily. Only they can fellowship with God and approach God in an intimate way. A person whose outer man is broken is very approachable to men, but those whose outer man is not broken have a constant barrier between them and others. The greatest hindrance to our spirit's fellowship, both with God and with man, is the outer man. Do we not feel the resistance the outer man gives to us? Sometimes we feel that it is hard to speak something to certain people. We know that something is wrong and that we should say something. But we dare not say it. Perhaps there is resistance in the other party, but often the resistance is with ourselves. We have a shell around us, and we cannot push our spirit out. We are too aloof. We cannot approach men. Perhaps others are waiting for us to say a word to them. Yet our spirit is clogged up; it cannot speak. Once our outer man is broken, we become approachable. Once the outer man is broken, all the barriers between us and others are removed. It becomes easy for us to reach the outside world, and it is easy to release the power within us.</p><p>God's work is not in the principle of removing the "glove" but in the principle of breaking the "glove." This is the way for the hand to come out and be exposed. This is how the cross deals with the outer man. This is also how the spirit becomes approachable to men. God is Spirit. There is no shell with Him. This is the reason He is so approachable to everyone. Once a man's outer shell is broken, he becomes very approachable to others, and the power within him comes out easily. When spiritual power is released, the distance between men is shortened, and there is no need to go through many steps for the spirit to be released. Such a person is transparent; there is nothing in his outer man that resists his spirit. Only such a one is qualified to work for God. If a man is broken by God and his spirit is free to contact men, any subsequent resistance is not from him but from others. A broken man can release his spirit in an instant. If he is smitten by God in a deep way, he can release his spirit quite readily. He does not have to pray to release his spirit. He can release it anywhere and at any time. This is the secret of God's ministry today. It is a ministry that basically issues from within. It has nothing to do with man's work, but with God's own work within man.</p><p>The fundamental experience of a minister of the word is the breaking of his outer man. The Spirit's operation can be seen every day, everywhere, and at any time. He is breaking our outer man continually. God's life is powerful within us, but we must be broken before this power can be released. The Spirit is working all the time. It is foolish to look for discipline from the Holy Spirit. We only need to submit to it and to give ourselves to God's breaking. The outer man must be separated from the inner man. Once the two are separated, the spirit can be released at will.</p><p>If our outer man is not broken and its growth is unchecked, great havoc will be done to the Body of Christ. The wanton growth of the outer man is like the invasion of cancerous cells in the body. When a man cuts himself by accident, cells around the wound grow and quickly seal up the wound. But if the cells continue to grow after the wound is healed, this inordinate growth becomes a cancerous growth. Cancer occurs when some cells break away from the normal law of the body and grow independently. They become a center to themselves and refuse to stop. Such cells are completely out of control. There is no way to deal with them except to cut them off. Under normal circumstances every cell in the body is defined and governed by definite laws of growth. Cancerous cells, however, differ from the rest of the body in that they have their own law. Wherever cancer hides, cells grow in a way that is detrimental to the body. The whole body normally joins together to fight diseases, but with cancer, the whole body joins together to feed the illness and to help its growth and expansion. The result is destruction to the whole body. Our outer man is like a cancer cell; it has become a second center, a separate area of growth. Some people are cancerous in that the more we feed them with spiritual things, the more arrogant they become. Some people are full of opinions; they can even be given the name of Opinion. Their entire being is an aggregate of opinions. Worse still, they are unwilling to subject themselves to dealings. These ones become cancers in the Body of Christ. The more spiritual experiences they have, the more they remain in darkness. Cancer areas are centers of division. Cancer cells absorb and expand to build up their own centers. Our outer man is a cancer to the Body of Christ. We must deal with it severely. We have to remove it, cut it out, and reject it. We have to deal with the outer man like dealing with cancer.</p><h2 class="head4">The Separation of the Inner Man from the Outer Man</h2><p>God destroys and breaks down our outer man in two ways. First, He deals with it by the rebukes from the ministry of the word. When the Lord cursed the fig tree, it wilted. No matter how strong we are, as soon as the Lord takes hold of us in His mercy, He rebukes us through the ministry of the word. Such strong words will shatter our whole being. This kind of ministry of the word is not an ordinary ministry. It does not scratch us politely in insignificant areas; rather, it overpowers us. We hope that the church will have many such ministries. Second, He breaks down our outer man through the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The expression the discipline of the Holy Spirit is our invention. It means the operation of the Holy Spirit through His ordering of our outward environment. The Holy Spirit works within us as well as in our environment. For example, Brother Chow has a big problem with his emotion. It is not easy to touch it unless our brother first puts himself under the hand of God. If our brother hands himself over to God, God will work on him through the Holy Spirit and will put him to death through the environment. The Holy Spirit will coordinate His inward operation with His outward discipline and bring him through. A person must pass through such experiences. God will not let him go. There must be a fundamental breaking experience. Then this experience should be followed by the Spirit's continual discipline. This is how the stubborn outer man is defeated. This work is seen all too rarely in the church today. Every brother and sister has to be open to advice and exhortation. We have to ask God for grace to receive rebukes from others. If anyone is angry at a rebuke, we should ask him whether he is living on this earth for his own "face" or for God to have a way through him.</p><p>The work of the Holy Spirit is like the work of the duck farmers in Foochow. Ducks like to roam freely, and the farmers have to goad them with a rod before they fall into line. The Lord has been disciplining some people in many ways for years, yet they are still turning around in circles. We should not be like dumb ducks. We have to take lessons from the discipline of the Holy Spirit. After we learn our lessons, we will be able to deal with the brothers and sisters, and we will be able to preach the gospel and serve God. When our outer man and inner man are separated, we will be able to keep outward things separate from the inner man; they will not be able to affect the inner man. We will be able to effectively convey the things in our inner being. We will have the ministry and the supply, and the power within us will be released.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
