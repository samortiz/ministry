<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN GOD'S CREATION</H2><P>The Spirit was first the Spirit of God in God's creation (Gen. 1:2). In His person He is forever the Spirit. But through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, many ingredients have been added to Him. In Genesis 1:1 God created the heavens and the earth. In verse 2 the earth became waste and empty because of God's judgment on Satan's rebellion. Then God came in as the Spirit of God to move upon the face of the waters. This Spirit is God in the element of His divinity. As the Spirit of God, He is related to the creation of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF JEHOVAH<br>IN GOD'S RELATIONSHIP WITH MAN</H2><P>The Spirit is not merely a power or an influence; He is a wonderful person. In Genesis 1 this wonderful person was the Spirit of God in God's creation. In chapter two the name Jehovah is mentioned for the first time (v. 4). Jehovah is God's name in His relationship with man. God's relationship with man is more intimate than His relationship with creation. After creating man, God remained intimately involved with him. This is why in the Old Testament the Spirit is usually referred to as the Spirit of Jehovah (Judg. 3:10; 6:34; Isa. 61:1; Ezek. 11:5). The Spirit of Jehovah came upon certain people (Judg. 3:10; 6:34; 11:29; 14:6, 19; 15:14; 1 Sam. 16:13). This indicates that the Spirit of Jehovah has to do with God's reaching of man. As the Spirit of Jehovah, He empowered man to carry out His purpose. Therefore, in the Old Testament two wonderful titles of the Spirit are unveiled. The first title is the Spirit of God in God's creation, and the second title is the Spirit of Jehovah in His reaching of man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE CONCEPTIONS<br>OF JOHN THE BAPTIST AND THE LORD JESUS</H2><P>In the New Testament, when the Lord was about to move forward to do something further in His economy, the title the Holy Spirit is used for the first time. (In Psalm 51:11 and Isaiah 63:10-11 the King James Version uses the term Holy Spirit; but the proper translation of this term should be "Spirit of holiness.") He was the Holy Spirit in the conceptions of John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus in order to sanctify humanity for Christ's incarnation (Luke 1:15, 35; Matt. 1:20).</P><P>There is a distinction between the work of the Holy Spirit in the conception of John the Baptist and the work of the Holy Spirit in the conception of Jesus Christ. In the conception of John the Baptist the Holy Spirit came to an overage, elderly person in order to produce a son who was merely human. This was God's miracle. John the Baptist was full of the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb (Luke 1:15), but he had only the human nature and lacked the nature of God. John's being full of the Holy Spirit enabled him to stand against the tide of that evil religious age and initiate a new dispensation for God's economy. This also qualified John to be the one who introduced the Savior to His people.</P><P>In the conception of Jesus the Holy Spirit went further. Luke 1:35 says, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore also the holy thing which is born will be called the Son of God." In the conception of Jesus the divine essence of the Holy Spirit was added to the human essence. According to Matthew 1:20, the Triune God was born into Mary's womb through the Holy Spirit. The result of such a work of the Spirit was a God-man with two natures, divinity and humanity. Jesus is the complete God and the perfect man. He is the God-man.</P><P>Today the Holy Spirit is still working. He is working in us not according to the conception of John the Baptist but according to the conception of the Lord Jesus. According to 1 Corinthians 12:3, whenever we call on the name of Jesus, we are in the Holy Spirit. This Spirit is operating in us to saturate us with God's holy nature, making us holy for God's purpose.</P>
