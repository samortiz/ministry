<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE HIGHEST REVELATION OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 107 to 110</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 107:31-32; 108:1-3; 109:1, 30; 110:1-7</h1><p>By the end of Book IV we have the consummation, the completion. Everything now has been recovered—Christ, the house, the city, and the earth. We need nothing more. All we need to do is praise. Therefore, Book V, Psalms 107 to 150, indicates how the house and the city of God become the praise, safety, and desire of the saints. Furthermore, it tells us how Christ will come to reign over the entire earth through the house and the city of God. In the first four books of the Psalms, we have Christ, the house, the city, and the earth: now in Book V, the last book, we have the praise, the hallelujahs.<p>Again in Book V, Christ is stressed, not in a deeper way, but rather in a higher way. Book II reveals something of Christ in a deeper way (Psalm 45). But Book V, as we shall see, speaks of Christ in the highest way. Book V emphasizes even more the city of God; it speaks of the city much more than all the other books. It does not refer much to the house, for ultimately the house will disappear. When our brother John saw the new Jerusalem, he mentioned that he saw no temple in the city (Rev. 21:22). When we come to the last book of the Psalms, the temple has all but disappeared; but we do have the city as a high mountain. Eventually and ultimately a local church must become a city. When we come to the end, we will praise God for Christ and the city.<p>Take, for example, the church in Los Angeles. In retrospect, we did have at the beginning the sense of the reality of the house of God. In a very real sense the church life was God’s house to us. Then gradually, little by little, something of the city began to come forth. There is still something of the house here, but mainly the church life is as a city now. This indicates the improvement of the local church. I do expect that one day the church in Los Angeles will give everyone the impression that it is a city, the city of God.<p>In Book I, as we have seen, there was very little about the city. In Book I we mainly see Christ and the house. Then, both in Book II and in Book III, we have the city with the house. In Book IV we have something added; we see there the city with the house for the earth. Finally, when we come to Book V, we see very little of the house, but we see much of Christ, revealed in such a high way, with the city to possess the earth.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AT GOD’S RIGHT HAND</h2><p>Now let us consider the first four Psalms of Book V, Psalms 107, 108, 109, and 110. In Psalms 107 and 108, the saints thank and praise God for His care, deliverance, and victory through Christ. “Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!” (Psalm 107:6-8).<p>In Psalm 109, within the saints in their suffering, we have the cry of Christ to God. (Compare Psalm 109:8 with Acts 1:20.) In Psalm 110 we see the answer, God’s answer, to Christ’s cry. This answer is exceedingly high—not deep, but high. Martin Luther said that this Psalm is the greatest of all the Psalms. In a sense, I agree with him. It has only seven verses, just as Psalm 87, that wonderful Psalm regarding the city. Psalm 110, however, is not about the city, but about Christ in the city. It is divided into four sections: (1) the first three verses, (2) verse 4, (3) verses 5 and 6, and (4) verse 7.<p>Verse 1 tells how God makes Christ sit at His right hand: “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool” (see Matt. 22:42-45; Acts 2:34-36; Eph. 1:20). Here the title “the Lord” is Jehovah in Hebrew. This verse has been quoted frequently in the New Testament—more than ten times as a direct quotation and another ten times indirectly. All together, there are more than twenty instances in the New Testament where Christ is referred to as sitting at the right hand of God. Of course, it was from the time of His ascension that God made Him to sit at His right hand. This is proved by Hebrews 1:3, “When he had by himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.” He is sitting there until God makes His enemies His footstool. Now we are still in the period of “until.” We are still in the time when God is working to bring all enemies under the feet of Christ. This period is the age of the church.<p>Verse 2: “The Lord shall send the scepter of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” We know that this has not yet transpired, but it will come to pass. This means that when God has secured Zion in a full way, Christ will return. Then, out of Zion, God will send forth the scepter of Christ’s power to rule over all the nations. The day will come.
