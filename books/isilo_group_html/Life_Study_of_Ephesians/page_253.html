For the new man to come into being, the law of the commandments in ordinances had to be abolished. Christians realize that on the cross Christ dealt with sin, the old man, the flesh, the world, and the Devil, Satan. But very few Christians have seen that on the cross Christ also dealt with the ordinances.</p><p>It is rather easy to understand that the cross of Christ deals with sin. It is also easy to realize that the old man and the flesh are problems that are dealt with by the cross. In like manner, when we read in the New Testament that the death of Christ has also dealt with the world and with Satan, we have no problem with understanding these truths. However, we may not realize that ordinances also present a serious problem.</p><p>Ordinances are related to different ways of living and worship. They do not appear to be negative. On the contrary, they seem quite good. For example, some ordinances are related to table manners. Who can say it is not good to be properly regulated when we eat? However, different peoples have different kinds of table manners. Therefore, regulations concerning table manners can be a source of division and enmity between peoples.</p><p>Ordinances are involved in the matter of worship. The Jews worship God according to their ordinances, and the Moslems worship according to their ordinances. This is also true with the various denominations today. Because ordinances seem helpful, it is difficult to recognize that they also need to be dealt with by the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">REDEMPTION IN RELATION TO GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE</h2><p>The fall of mankind was the source of all ordinances. If man had not fallen, there would be no ordinances today. After God created man, He did not give him a list of ordinances. But as soon as man fell, the ordinances began to come in. Then, at Babel, the man created by God for His purpose became divided and scattered into a number of races and nations which began to fight against one another. This made it impossible for God&rsquo;s eternal plan to be fulfilled.</p><p>If we view the redemption of Christ from the angle of God&rsquo;s purpose, our concept of redemption will be broadened. Most Christians view Christ&rsquo;s redemption only from the perspective of their personal salvation. They are not concerned with the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose, but are concerned only with being saved from hell and assured of spending eternity in heaven. Their concept of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross is extremely narrow. It is crucial for us to see that God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to dispense Himself into man and to become one with man in order to express Himself through man. But Satan has sought to frustrate the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose by damaging humanity through dividing it into different peoples who war against one another. Christ came to redeem fallen mankind in order that God&rsquo;s purpose may be fulfilled, not merely that we may be saved from hell and assured of heaven. In order to redeem divided mankind, Christ died on the cross to deal with all the negative things, including ordinances. On the cross Christ abolished all the regulations regarding living and worship, regulations that have divided the nations. God does not care for any ordinances. He cares only that we are one and that Christ is wrought into us. Christ abolished all the ordinances not that we may go to heaven or that we may be spiritual or victorious. He abolished the ordinances in order to create in Himself one new corporate man. He created the new man not only within Himself as the sphere, but also with Himself as the very element. By abolishing the ordinances and creating the Jewish and Gentile believers into one new man, Christ has made peace. Now those of different nationalities have peace in Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_252.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_254.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Ephesians &nbsp; pg 253</div><br></body></html>
