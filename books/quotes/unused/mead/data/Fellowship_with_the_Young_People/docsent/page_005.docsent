   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR COMPANIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You must have such a life of fleeing and pursuing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, when you endeavor to flee and pursue, you will find that you are not able to do so by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The way to flee youthful lusts and pursue Christ is in the last part of 2 Timothy 2:22.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This verse says, "But flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You need "those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By yourself you are inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The key is to be "with those."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a young person you may be very strong, but your strength means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The enemy, Satan, is stronger than you are, but under God's sovereign provision, you have "those."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You must pursue "with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The young people must make the decision to pick up some others as companions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Daniel had his three friends.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Under the Lord Jesus in the New Testament none of the disciples were individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were sent two by two; they all had companions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Peter and Andrew and James and John are referred to in the Gospels in pairs Matt 4:18, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Young people need at least one companion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You must consider before the Lord whether you have a real companion in pursuing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Joshua could have said that Caleb was his companion, and Caleb could have said that Joshua was his companion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, it is better to have three or four companions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because of these perilous times, we need more companions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have four companions to support us from each direction, we will not fall, regardless of what storm may come.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If one stands by himself, he will possibly be captured by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is best for four or five young ones from junior high school to come together as companions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let the young brothers be companions to one another, and let the young sisters be companions to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need companions not only because we are weak to stand by ourselves, but also because we are all so natural.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to our natural disposition, it is very hard for us to have companions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our individualism is a pleasure to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We enjoy our individualism so much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may not care for a brother or a sister because they are not like us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We demand that others be like us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Wanting people to be like us is devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we love the Lord, we should be able to go to any young brother or sister, not caring for what they are like.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They may be slow or quick, dull or smart, like you or one hundred percent different from you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should forget all the differences.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must have companions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the young people would be grouped in this way, Satan will be put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If five junior high school students would be grouped together as one, their school will be "overthrown."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If they start with five, after not long a time, perhaps two months, there will be fifteen.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The preaching of the gospel in their school will be like wildfire.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even the college age and working age saints need companions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They need to work together, live together, and have their daily walk together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ecclesiastes 4:12 says, "A threefold cord is not quickly broken."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If one person has four companions, the five of them will even be a fivefold cord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Nothing can break this cord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The gospel preaching of these five will be prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They will subdue people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Their grouping together will convince people, and Satan will be put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not have companions in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not take a brother as a companion because you like him and tomorrow reject him because you do not like him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If he is a brother, you must take him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This will subdue and break you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You need to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Who will break you?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Wives are good "breakers," but I do not trust the wives to completely break the husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The good "breakers" are the brothers and sisters with whom you group yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The young people must look to the Lord to get four or five companions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even the people in the world say that union is power.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By myself I would not dare to do many things, but when I have four companions, I would dare to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The five companions should always call on the name of the Lord together 2 Tim 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They should always come together to fellowship, pray-read, pray, and take care of new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One brother's new ones should be another brother's new ones also.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this way one group of five saints will have fifteen new ones under their care.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All these new ones will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The principle for the saints in both the Old and New Testaments is that they should be grouped together.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The young people need to flee youthful lusts and pursue the Lord with some companions.</S>
