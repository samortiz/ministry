   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION NINE THE ANALYSIS OF THE SOUL 3 THE WILL CHAPTER ONE THE BELIEVER'S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man's will is the organ with which man makes decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our willingness or unwillingness, our wanting or not wanting, and our deciding or not deciding are all the functions of our will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The will of man is his "rudder."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a ship turns according to the rudder, a man moves according to his will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man's will can be said to be his true self, the man himself, because the will represents the man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the actions of the will are actually the actions of this "man."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we say, "I am willing," we actually mean that our will is willing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we say, "I want this" or "I decided to do this," it means our will wants it, or that our will decided it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The function of the will is to express the intention of our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The emotion is only what we feel, the mind is only what we think, but the will is what we want.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, the will is the most important part of our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man's will is deeper than his emotion and mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, when a believer pursues after the spiritual life, he has to pay attention to the will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many are misled to think that "religion" using this word for the time being is only a matter of the emotion, and that its only purpose is to make man's emotion comfortable and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are others who think that "religion" should fit in with reason mind , and that it should not be too slanted toward the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only a rational religion is believable to them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Little do they know that the real "religion" is neither for the emotion or the mind, but for man to obtain life in the spirit and to bring man's will into subjection to the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If all our experiences do not bring us to the point where we willingly receive all the will of God, they are but very shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the spiritual life of the believers does not find much expression in the will, what good does it do?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In such a case, the will, which represents the self, remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The true way of salvation is to save a man's will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whatever is not deep enough to save a man's will is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the wonderful feelings and clear thoughts are only external.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A man can obtain happiness, comfort, and peace by believing in God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He can also understand the mysteries of God and have high, wonderful knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet he still does not have the deepest union with God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Apart from the union of the will with God, there is no other union in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, after a believer has obtained life, in addition to his intuition, he should pay attention to his will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>FREE WILL</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In speaking about man and man's will, we should always keep in mind that, as human beings, we have a free will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that man is self-governed; man has an independent will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whatever is not approved by him cannot be forced upon him, and whatever he opposes cannot be pressed upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Having a free will means that man has his own opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man is not a machine to be maneuvered by others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the actions of a man are controlled by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Within man there is a will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This will controls the things within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man is not like a machine to be controlled by any power from outside.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Within man there are governing principles that decide man's conduct for him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was the condition at the time of God's creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God created a man, not a machine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God told him, "Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" Gen 2:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In these verses we can only see God's command with persuasion and prohibition, but without compulsion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If Adam would have been willing to obey and not eat, it would have been Adam who so willed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Adam became disobedient and ate, there was no way for God to stop him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is free will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God put the responsibility of eating or not eating on man and allowed man to choose according to his free will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God did not create an Adam who could not sin, who could not disobey, or who could not steal.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This would have made man a machine.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God could advise, prohibit, and command, but the responsibility to obey was upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because of His love, God cannot help but command in advance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But because of His righteousness, God will not force man to do anything that he is not willing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If man wants to obey God, it must be man himself who is willing; God will not force him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God may use many ways to make man willing, but unless man consents, God will not do anything to force him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a very important principle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As we will see later, God's work never goes against this principle, even though the work of evil spirits' does.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, we can differentiate what is of God and what is not.</S>
