Only an Accurate Person<br>Being Able to Study the Bible</H2><P>Who can study the Bible? The Bible is not understood through methods, but through the proper persons. A person can listen to, study, and read the Bible. But if he wants to get some light out of it, he has to be an accurate person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Appointment of Elders</H2><P>The fifth point concerns the appointment of responsible brothers. Not everyone can appoint elders. Paul asked Timothy to appoint elders, but he did not ask Mark, Silas, Luke, or Demas to appoint elders. Some are hands, and they cannot be the eyes. Some people say that they have to consider more. But if you are a hand, will you know if the pillar is white by more consideration? Even if you are to consider five days, you will still not be clear if the pillar is white. It is better for you to seek the help of the eyes. It is easy to appoint a person, but it is troublesome to ask anyone to step down from responsibility. If you do this, the whole church will be greatly affected. For this reason, we cannot appoint responsible ones lightly. Paul asked Timothy to look for the faithful ones. It is not an easy matter.</P><P>When the Western missionaries select personnel, most of the time they select the good and the lovable persons. To us these ones may be the most useless ones; they may even be swindlers. Some people ask why we do not appoint certain brothers as responsible ones. We have to realize that some brothers are good people and nice gentlemen, but they can easily be deceived. Do not say that this is only the missionaries' problem; we the Chinese can have the same problem. It is not a light matter for a man to receive a ministry before the Lord. There are certain basic qualifications in appointing a person. It is not such a simple matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Concerning the Physical Needs<br>of the Co-workers</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Taking Simple Luggage When Traveling</H2><P>Sixth, the co-workers should pay special attention to their physical needs. Concerning our personal life, the Lord's principle is first that our personal belongings have to be simple when we travel. It is too improper for a worker to travel with five or ten pieces of luggage.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Eating What Others Serve</H2><P>Second, you must pay attention to the things you eat. Whatever others put in front of you, you have to eat. Other than for reason of physical weakness, you have to make yourself an easy person to be served. When you are at home, you can do whatever you like. But when you are traveling, it is not so simple.</P><P>Once I was in Anhwei. The people there like sesame oil, but I hate sesame oil. Among them, I had sesame oil continually for sixteen days. They saw that my appetite was not good, and they asked if I like preserved eggs. I said yes, and they served me preserved eggs, only soaked in sesame oil again!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Learning to Overcome Our Bodies<br>in Our Dwelling</H2><P>The third thing has to do with the place we live. The co-workers should not pick places for sleeping that are too good or too coarse. They have to select moderate places. Once they have decided where to stay, they should stay there until they leave the city. Even if you find that you are staying in the lion's den, you have to wait until daybreak. If the king has not come, you cannot go out by yourself. Unless others make further arrangements for you, you should not make any choice of your own. Many workers are involved in trouble merely through moving around.</P><P>Once someone prepared a bed for me. It was supposed to be a sofa bed, but it was a bed that no one could lie on. The bed was put together with blocks of wood. When the body turned, the wood would make noise. I was disturbed not only by others' noise, but by the noise I made also. A worker has to learn to live in abundance, and he also has to learn to live in poverty. A worker must learn to put his body under.</P><P>There was a brother in southern Fukien province who had a somewhat high standard of living at home. When he had to work in a place that had a lower standard of living, he found that he could not handle the situation. Whatever I eat and wear, and however I live at home is a personal matter before the Lord. But when we are guests in others' homes, we have to live according to the standard of that family. Habit is one thing, and a mind to suffer is another thing. No matter how weak I am or how many needs I have, I have to learn to lower myself. Do not let any church think that it is a troublesome thing to provide hospitality for a servant of God. If you practice living in a low way at home, even when others put you in a lower place, you will be able to stand it. Only those who have learned to overcome their bodies can present no difficulty to others. Only a mind to suffer can give us the strength to humble ourselves before men. Hence, we have to learn to overcome our bodies.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_198.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_200.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 199</div><br></body></html>
