   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT HOW TO BE IN CHRIST Date: October 21, 1936, evening</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Kulangsu</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:30; John 3:16; Heb 11:1; Rom 6:3, 11</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During the past four evenings, we have seen the biblical meaning of being "in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The opposite of being in Christ is being in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, we spoke on the life and nature of two great communities the community of Adam and the community of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Next, we saw that we need to move out of the community of Adam and into the community of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is our salvation and regeneration, which gives us a new beginning and leads to our life in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We also saw how we moved out of the first community and into the second community, that is, out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We saw that God did not work individually on men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All other religions work on men individually.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But Christ's salvation is not accomplished through human ways; it is God's own work in and through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A Christian is one who is joined to Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit and who partakes of all that Christ has.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although we are poor in ourselves, we are joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everything of Christ flows to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When God put us into Christ, He became everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of course, we need to emphasize the truth in our messages.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, after we have presented the truth, we must also present the way to practice the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some can tell me that Amoy is very good, but in the end they must also tell me how to get to Amoy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Tonight we will consider the way we can be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>IT BEING OF GOD THAT WE ARE IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first half of 1 Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Being "of Him" means to originate from God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the time the Lord died on the cross, we were put into Christ already.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During the first evening, I spoke of putting chalk into a chalk box and throwing it into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If an ordinary person like me, who is five feet eleven inches and one hundred forty pounds, has the power to do this, how much more power does God, the Creator of the universe, have in putting us into Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has done this and unveiled it to us in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not know how He did it; we only have to believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>BELIEVING INTO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is of God that we are in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since this is the case, what do we have to do?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have said that God has put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But how can we obtain this blessing?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is one book in the New Testament that tells us how we receive life in Christ the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The most familiar verse in John is 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many unbelievers have criticized the church for not exhorting people to do good and for not teaching people other things; it only does one thing it asks people to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, the Bible does not ask people to just believe; it asks people to believe into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible does not say that we should believe a thing, like believing some news published in the newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible says that when a man believes, he believes into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through believing, we become one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To be one with Christ means to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the one hand, it is of God that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the other hand, we have to believe into Him.</S>
