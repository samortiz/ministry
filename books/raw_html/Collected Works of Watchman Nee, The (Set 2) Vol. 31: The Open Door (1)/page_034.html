<h2 class="head2">A Letter from Sister Liu Hwei-fen,<br />Shanghai</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>I received your letter from Mr. Ho last night. I read it carefully. Thank our Father for bringing me through the last few months so that I can count more of the Lord's grace and give Him more thanks. They have caused me to realize even more that God is faithful. The Tuesday women's meeting is very good. Many sisters come to work. There are also many outsiders. The Saturday sisters' meeting is very living. Many sisters stand up to testify. The refugee camp in Jiao-Tung University has not closed yet. Thank God. He brought the people from the countryside into Shanghai so that they would have the opportunity to hear the gospel. The newspaper reported that forty-nine refugee camps have closed for lack of funds. It is said that the International Relief Organization will open its sixth facility to meet the need. Thus, there is a lot of work among the refugees. If Sister Wang and Sister Chang do not forget, please have them greet Mrs. Yuan for me. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister, Hwei-fen<br />January 6<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Shan Kai-fen,<br />Shaohsing, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Greetings to my beloved Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>Please forgive me in the Lord for my sin of laziness in not communicating with you for so long. Since the beginning of the war, the heart of the people in Shaohsing has been fearful, and the inhabitants of the city have fled. Nine out of ten houses are now empty. But the brothers and sisters in the Lord have been preserved by the Lord Himself and are at peace without concern. Some have fled to the countryside, while others are still in the city. The Lord's Day meeting continues as usual. Siao-Shan had several hundred shots fired at it, and at least two hundred people are dead or wounded. However, the Lord's children are preserved and not hurt. These are perilous days, but I deeply believe that He will preserve His own beloved children and bring us safely through. The day of the Lord's coming is near. As to my unfaithfulness, "If You, O Jehovah, marked iniquities,/Who, O Lord, would stand?/But with You there is forgiveness,/That You would be feared" (Psa. 130:3-4). A month ago I went with Brothers Shou-lin and Hsin-yih to the assembly in Nan-Sha. At that time we heard that Da-Chang had been lost and that Jia-Shing was in trouble. We were afraid that the Nanking-Hangchow Rail would be closed. The brothers hurriedly went back to San-Chiao-Bu, and I have not heard from them since. I am really concerned about them! Do you have any news about where they are? I still have one of Brother Chou's suitcases in my home, with two letters to him from Brother Chang of Chungking and Brother Hsu of Wu-Yi. I will not travel in the near future because of the recent political situation. My family has been graced by the Lord and is well. Please do not worry. Peace.</p><p>Your weak little brother,<br />Shan Kai-fen<br />December 14<br />[Address omitted]</p>
