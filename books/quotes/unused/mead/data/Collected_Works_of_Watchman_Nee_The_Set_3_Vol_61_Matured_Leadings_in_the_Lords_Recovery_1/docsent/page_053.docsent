   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN HOW TO HANDLE THE ITEMS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED OVER Date:Tuesday, February 7, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Weigh: Lord, You are the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is Your Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We pray that the church will receive something from You as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>May Your Body feel what the Head feels.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>May it be directed by the Head and receive supply from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>May each member in the Body receive the same rich supply from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, in ourselves we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May Your anointing be with us, and may Your church speak the right things and make the right decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>May the church be under Your full control.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CHURCH ON EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>BEING THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Watchman Nee: The gospel is a work that the Lord has assigned to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church exists on the earth for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The entire New Testament shows us clearly that the responsibility of the church is to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Last night we went one step further and saw that the preaching of the gospel by the church means that the preaching is not done by just a few people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not preach when we are hot and stop when we are cold.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not a preaching in which each person takes turns being burning and preaching by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The whole church has to rise up to preach in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Evangelism is a matter of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The whole church has to further the gospel of God in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church has the responsibility of joining hands together to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is the Body of Christ; it is always active.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the gospel should always be moving; there must not be any lull.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the early church, we find men who handed themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today we should see men doing the same thing, not just in ones and twos, but as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone has to offer up himself as well as his all.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If only a few offer up themselves, or worse still, if none offer up themselves as in the past, the gospel will never reach the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>DEALING WITH THE ITEMS THAT WERE HANDED OVER</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Tonight we will address the brothers and sisters who have handed themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are not going to give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, we would like to have a talk with you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We want to say something on the negative side as well as something on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Presently, we have a good number of saints who have handed themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope that you can testify to the other brothers and sisters how you have willingly forsaken everything to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We want to make suitable arrangements concerning the items that have been handed over.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We want to do this according to the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not want to make mistakes with the things that have been handed over.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We hope that we can make proper arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should address two matters first the things that have been handed over and then the very persons who have handed themselves over, including what to do with their future.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are two groups of people among those who have handed themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One group is the brothers and sisters who have been holding a job in the world for a number of years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The other group is the young brothers and sisters who are still in school and have not touched many of the things of the world yet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A man goes through only a limited number of crises in his lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If he fails to gain something beneficial through these crises, he will stumble and falter before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will make some arrangements concerning their future.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our hope is that they will be brought into coordination and that their way ahead will be straight.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Tonight we will deal with the items that have been handed over.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sister Cheng</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sister Cheng is a student.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On her consecration slip she consecrated her whole life to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the items that were handed over, she included three U.S. dollars and a few dresses.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sister Cheng, you are living with your parents at home.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do they have a problem with your consecration?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God does not want us to steal or rob for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The heaven, the earth, and everything therein are His.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He does not need us to give Him anything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whatever is in your house that you do not have a full right to dispose of should not be offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even if you are giving these things to God, He will not take them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Concerning your personal clothing, you should go home and discuss this matter with your parents.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You can sell one or two of them and give the money to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You have handed over your belongings to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now the church hands them back to you to be placed under your trust.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These things are no longer yours.</S>
