<h1 class="title">IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to fellowship concerning service that builds up the church. If we would have a part in the service that builds up the church, we must clearly see Christ and the church, including the relationship between Christ and the church. A clear view concerning Christ and the church is a fundamental prerequisite for the building up of the church. If we do not have a thorough understanding of Christ and the church, our concept concerning the building up of the church will not be accurate, and our service, at the most, will consist of bringing people to salvation and leading them to pursue the Lord.</p>
<p>A person needs only to be saved in order to be in the church, the Body of Christ. If such a one pursues spirituality, it is even better. However, being built up is a further step. It is possible to be saved and to pursue the Lord without being built up in the church. This is also true with regard to service. We may be involved in much work related to the salvation of souls, but we may not be participating in any work related to the building up of the church. It is also possible to lead others to love the Lord, to pursue Him, and to live a sanctified life but still not take part in the work of the building up of the church. Although every believer is in the church and although those who pursue the Lord may be more attached to the church, this does not mean that they are being built up into the church. Being saved and pursuing the Lord are one thing, but being built up in the church is quite another thing. It is paramount that we see this distinction.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, these two things should be one. When a person is saved, he should immediately begin to build up the church. It is not normal for a person who is saved to be unrelated to the church. Nevertheless, it is possible for someone who pursues the Lord personally, who loves the Lord very much, and who lives a sanctified life to have no regard for the church.</p>
<p>Many people know that a person who is saved is in Christ, but few know that a person who is saved is also in the church. Believers are not only in Christ but also in the church. Nevertheless, an abnormal situation exists among believers today; that is, many believers who are in Christ are not related to the church practically. I say this from practical experience. According to doctrine, every believer is in the church; however, according to the real situation of believers in general, some people are saved but do not live in the church and have no concept or consciousness of the church. The church has no place in their being, and it makes no difference to them whether or not they are in the church. This means that in actual experience, they are in Christ but not in the church; they have Christ, but they do not have the church.</p>
<p>This situation applies not only to those who are merely saved but also to many who pursue the Lord, love the Lord, and live a sanctified life. Even ones such as these do not have an understanding of the church, and the church is a matter of little consequence to them. This is a great problem. Although God&rsquo;s Word shows that a believer is in Christ, it also shows that the purpose of being in Christ is to be in the church. We are in Christ so that we may be in the church. A believer should endeavor to love the Lord and be sanctified so that he can live the church life. Our salvation and growth in life are for the church. Regrettably, the church does not have much ground in many believers. Many Christians do not even have a concept of the church. Even many who serve the Lord and work for Him have no consideration of the church. This lack of consideration is the result of having a limited understanding of the relationship between Christ and the church. Therefore, we need to speak concerning who Christ is, what the church is, and the relationship between Christ and the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING A HYBRID OF GOD<br />
MINGLED WITH MAN</h2>
<p>First, we must see who Christ is. Christ is God mingled with man. This is the simplest description of Christ. To speak of Christ as being only God is not accurate, and to speak of Him as being only man is also not accurate. Christ is God mingled with man and man mingled with God. This is a most practical and simple utterance.</p>
<p>In the universe there is God, and there is also man. Before Christ came, the two were separate and distinct. Although there was a Creator and creatures, the two were not mingled as one. It is not until Christ came that God was mingled with man. Some people may ask, &ldquo;Who exactly is Christ?&rdquo; The simplest answer is to say that Christ is God mingled with man. Christ is neither just God nor just man; Christ is the mingling of God and man.</p>
<p>Many do not have an accurate understanding of this truth concerning Christ. This has been a great issue in theology. Nevertheless, we must put theology aside and not consider Christ merely from a doctrinal perspective. The facts concerning Christ are simple. Christ is God and man mingled as one. In the person of Christ, God entered into man, and man entered into God. In Christ, divinity has been mingled with humanity, and humanity has been mingled with divinity. Christ is the mingling of two natures&mdash;divinity and humanity&mdash;as one. In the past we used the term <em>hybrid.</em> A hybrid refers to things of different natures being mingled together to become one entity. Christ is a hybrid of God mingled with man, because Christ is not only God but also man. Christ is God mingled with man.</p>
