   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MEANING OF CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Merely being constrained by love or acknowledging His legal right does not constitute consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After a person has been constrained by the Lord's love and has acknowledged His right, there is a further step that he should take.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This step will bring him on to a new position.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through the Lord's constraining and based on His purchase, we separate ourselves from every other thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Henceforth, we live for and unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In some instances in the Old Testament, the Chinese Union Version translates the word consecration as "the receiving of the holy service."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To receive the holy service is to receive the ministry of service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a holy service.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Consecration is receiving the ministry of serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is to say to the Lord, "Today I will separate myself from everything to serve You, because You have loved me."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A CONSECRATED PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us look at Exodus 28:1-2 and 29:1, 4, 9-10.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After reading these verses, we can see that consecration is a very special matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The nation of Israel was a nation chosen by God Exo 19:5-6 , but it did not become a consecrated nation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There were twelve tribes among the Israelites, but not all the twelve tribes received the holy service.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The tribe of Levi was one of the twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They were a tribe chosen by God Num 3:11-13 , but they were not a consecrated tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Among the many Levites, only the household of Aaron received the holy service.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not all of the Israelites received the holy service, not even all of the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only the household of Aaron received the holy service.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to be consecrated, one had to belong to this household.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If one were not a member of this household, he could not consecrate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only the members of this household the household of Aaron were qualified to be priests, and only they could consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thank God, today we are the members of this household.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who believe in the Lord are the members of this household.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All who have been saved by grace are priests Rev 1:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God has chosen us to be the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Initially, only the members of Aaron's household could consecrate themselves; if anyone else came near, he would have been put to death Num 18:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must remember that only those chosen by God to be priests can consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, only the members of this household could consecrate themselves.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, we are qualified to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here we see that man does not consecrate himself because he has chosen God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, God is the One who chooses and calls, and then man consecrates himself to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who consider that they are doing God a favor by forsaking all are but outsiders; they are not consecrated at all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must realize that our service to God is not a favor or courtesy to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not a matter of offering ourselves to God's work, but a matter of God being gracious to us and giving us a portion of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is God who has given us the glory and the beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible tells us that the holy garment of the priest is for glory and beauty Exo 28:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Consecration is God giving us glory and beauty; it is God calling us into His service.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are not uplifting God, as if we were sacrificing anything for Him or as if we had any glory in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Consecration is God giving us the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should prostrate ourselves before Him and say, "Thank You that I can have a part in Your service.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are so many people in this world, yet I am chosen to have a part in it!"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Consecration is our honor, not our sacrifice.</S>
