   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Holding the Mystery of the Faith in a Pure Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 9 says, "Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The faith here, as in 1:19 and 2 Timothy 4:7, is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It refers to the things we believe in, the things which constitute the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The mystery of the faith is mainly Christ as the mystery of God Col 2:2 and the church as the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A deacon in a local church should hold this mystery with full understanding in a pure conscience for the Lord's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the deacons know the mystery of the faith, the standard of their service will be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever the deacons are asked by the elders to do a certain thing or to help others in a particular way, they should realize that they are serving the saints in the mystery of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This will uplift their service.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It makes a tremendous difference if the deacons' contact with others is based on God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Years ago, I visited the royal palace in London.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I noticed that every aspect of the service of the palace, from the changing of the guard to the work of the janitors, was done with a high standard and with dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even the janitors conducted themselves with dignity and gravity, in a way which invited others' respect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How much more true this should be of the service of the deacons in a local church!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even the cleaning of the rest rooms should be done with gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who serve in this way should realize that they are not cleaning in a worldly place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, they are serving the church, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 9 Paul speaks of a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A pure conscience is a conscience purified from any mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To hold the mystery of the faith for the Lord's testimony, we need such a purified conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to have a pure conscience, the deacons need to behave according to their knowledge of the mystery of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may know this mystery, but not live according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a result, instead of having a pure conscience, we have a conscience that condemns us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A deacon should consider how he deals with his wife, his children, and the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He then may realize his shortage, that he does not live according to the mystery of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A deacon must be justified in the first place by his own conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He should have a conscience which testifies even to the demons that he lives according to the standard of the mystery of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then he will truly hold the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Unreprovable</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 10 Paul continues, "And let these also first be proved; then let them minister, being Unreprovable."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Unreprovable here means blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word that the deacons should first be proved may imply a period of apprenticeship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word minister in this verse means to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the function of a deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Husband of One Wife</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 12 says, "Let deacons be husbands of one wife."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The requirement here is the same as that of the overseers, as mentioned in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Managing His Children and His Own Household Well</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 12 Paul also says that deacons should manage "their children and their own households well."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Managing the children and the household well proves the capability of a brother to serve the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>B. Blessing on a Good Deacon 1.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Obtaining a Good Standing</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verse 13 Paul mentions the blessing on a good deacon: "For those who have ministered well obtain for themselves a good standing and much boldness in faith which is in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The word ministered here means served.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The expression "a good standing" refers to a firm and steadfast standing as a believer and a saint before God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To serve the church well as a deacon strengthens one's Christian standing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Obtaining Much Boldness in Faith Which Is in Christ Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By serving well, a deacon will also be blessed with much boldness in faith which is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The word boldness also means confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To serve the church well strengthens the boldness, the confidence, of the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Faith here is subjective and refers to our act of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>DEACONESSES</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 11 says, "Women similarly must be grave, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The word women in this verse refers to deaconesses Rom 16:1 , not to the wives of the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sisters who are serving ones in the church are deaconesses.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Such ones must be grave.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, they should not be slanderers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This corresponds to "not double-tongued" in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Devil is a slanderer Rev 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To slander is to practice the nature of the evil slanderer.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A sister who is a deaconess, a serving one in a local church among many other sisters, should flee slander, the evil act of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Deaconesses must also be temperate and faithful in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have pointed out that to be temperate is to be self-controlled, moderate.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The charge to be "faithful in all things" corresponds to "not seeking gain by base means" in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A sister as a deaconess needs to be faithful, trustworthy in all things, especially in things concerning gain.</S>
