Christ's salvation ushers us into a life in Christ, a life of objective realities. Humanly speaking, the feelings that we possess seem very reliable, but they change; they are not really reliable. We need the spirit, and we need faith. These two things interact with objective facts. Through faith and by the spirit, we touch objective facts and thus are not easily shaken. This requires the breaking of the outer man. If the outer man is not broken, it will be easy for us to live in our feelings and hard for us to find rest.</p><p>Let me give you a simple illustration. Suppose I have a need, and I want a brother to help me. To solicit his help, I first try to offer him something as an "incentive," using financial support by deceit as an enticement. I may "feel" that there is nothing wrong in this, but such a "feeling" is altogether wrong. As soon as I touch my conscience, I will know that I am wrong. The conscience is a function of the spirit, and the spirit touches objective facts. The facts are in Christ, in the Bible, in the Holy Spirit, and in God's word. Truth is not in feelings. If I am wrong, I am wrong, whether or not I feel that I am wrong. It is wrong to judge things by what we feel.</p><p>Our rights and wrongs are found in the Bible. Our life and walk are based on the Holy Spirit. Our history and facts are rooted in Christ. We have to learn to touch these things. With many things, it is not a matter of good or bad, but of being in the Holy Spirit. A good thing is not necessarily life unless it is done in the Holy Spirit. What use is something if it is not done in the Holy Spirit? Without the Spirit, the result is only death. Whether or not something is good should be judged by God's Word. We should ask whether it is according to God's Word instead of whether it satisfies our reasoning. As soon as we live in our reason, we quench all expressions of life.</p><p>The extent to which a person lives in spiritual reality is inversely proportional to the extent to which he lives in his feelings. The more we live in spiritual reality, the more we will be free from living by our feelings. There is no need to analyze too much whether or not we are living in spiritual reality or in our feelings. As a rule of thumb, we should ignore our feelings altogether when we are not clear.</p><p>On our part, we should not live by our feelings. On God's part, He will break our outer man. All feelings and deception come from the outer man. As soon as the outer man is broken, these deceptions no longer frustrate our inner man, because the inner man is able to take care of itself.</p><p>The fundamental lesson we have to learn is to not listen to the outward feelings, but to simply live in the Holy Spirit and in the facts. We should say "Amen" to whatever the Bible says about our life in Christ. Believe that it is true. I may be in Hong Kong physically, but I should have the sense that I am living in the heavens. I only know Ephesians 2, which says that we are raised up together with Christ and seated with Him in the heavenlies (v. 6). I do not trust in my feelings. I reject my feelings. If we persist in this for three or five years, our feelings will wither and fade away. Once these feelings subside, the facts will gain ground. The more we ignore our feelings, the less momentum they have and the less they can assert themselves. The more we pay attention to our feelings, however, the more we will be beaten down. We should not pay attention to these feelings. We should only lay hold of the facts. In conclusion, your question is a big one. It is not easy for you to ask, and it is not easy for me to answer.</p><p>Lo Yi-xin: If a Christian is put in a painless environment and still feels pain, is this pain just his feeling?</p><p>Watchman Nee: Since the Bible says that a Christian should rejoice always, we should learn to not have any painful feelings. We should be free from painful feelings. It is not a matter of whether or not the environment is painful. It is a matter of God's Word. Whatever God's Word says, we should be. His Word says that we should be anxious for nothing and that the Lord is near. Even if the environment is painful, we should still rejoice.</p><p>Sister Tseng Wen Su-chi: It is easier to neglect personal prayer than corporate prayer. What should we do?</p><p>Watchman Nee: We cannot skip personal prayer just because it is easy to do so. We should still have private, individual prayers. As for corporate prayers, I hope that the co-workers can come together to pray once a day. They should also come together to read the Word.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
