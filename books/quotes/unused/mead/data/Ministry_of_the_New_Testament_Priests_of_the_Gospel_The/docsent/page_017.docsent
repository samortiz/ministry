   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A FEW GIFTS PERFECTING ALL THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 4 speaks of the perfecting of the saints, whereas 1 Corinthians 14 speaks of prophesying by all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers should not only carry out their respective works.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead, they should perfect the saints to be able also to do what they do.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The evangelists should not go out by themselves to preach the gospel; rather, they should perfect others to be able to preach the gospel like them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we rely only on a few gifted evangelists to preach the gospel, then there will be too few who are able to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The result will be that a small number of people will become the evangelistic clergy, while the majority will become the laity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This kind of distinction is unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The intention of the New Testament is that all of us, the saved believers, would be the "clergy."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It does not allow anyone to be a layman.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All of us who are saved have been called by God to be the "clergy."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is the same with prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have a wrong concept, thinking that speaking for God and speaking forth God are such great matters that not every saint is able to do them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the contrary, the New Testament tells us that every believer can prophesy without any distinction between clergy and laity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If only a group of clergy prophesies while all the others are the laity, then a religious hierarchy will be formed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Catholic Church, there is a strong hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They even say that the only ones who can understand the Bible are the clergy under the leadership of the pope; the laity not only cannot speak for God but also are not qualified even to understand the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a grave error.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then, what is the situation in the Protestant churches?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible was released from the chains of the Catholic Church in the 1500s and has been translated into many languages over the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today, it is possible to obtain a copy of the Bible in almost every place in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless, there are still many in the Protestant churches who cannot find the way to enter into the Bible when they read it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible, which is a divine book of God's revelation, contains many special terms that are beyond the comprehension of ordinary people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, God has raised up a group of teachers among His children to explain and define His holy words in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Acts 8 the Ethiopian eunuch sat in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah without understanding what it meant.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that moment, Philip, who was sent by the Spirit, approached his chariot and asked him, "Do you really know the things that you are reading?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The eunuch answered, "How could I unless someone guides me?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture he announced Jesus as the gospel to him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>26-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Luke 24:44-45 the Lord appeared to His disciples after His resurrection and opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What the Lord Jesus and Philip did is what today's teachers should do.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their particular function is to explain God's scriptural revelation to His children and teach the holy word to every saint.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The result should be that every saint is able to teach the Bible to others.</S>
