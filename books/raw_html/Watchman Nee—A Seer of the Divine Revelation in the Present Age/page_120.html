<P>The announcement in the combined thirteenth and fourteenth issues concerning The Christian was as follows:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>PURPOSE: To proclaim the salvation of the cross, to cultivate the Christian's spirituality, to warn of the danger of modernism, and to declare all of God's will.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>CONTENT: The Christian contains messages, short articles, stories, signs of the times, studies, expositions of the Bible, and questions and answers (anyone desiring to ask questions about the Scriptures may do so). Every other month we issue a "Scripture-expounding" special, devoted exclusively to expounding the Bible. The current topic is the book of Revelation.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>Each issue of this monthly periodical was approximately eighty pages in length. In those issues he expounded the first three chapters of Revelation, spending much time on the seven epistles. It was through these messages on the seven epistles that denominationalism was fully exposed and the proper church revealed. By reading these papers, many young people throughout the whole of China had their eyes opened. I was one of them. It was thus that I came to see the evils of the denominations and also to see the church. We still have twenty-three of the original twenty-four issues of The Christian. They were filled not only with much revelation but also with much inspiration. They were marvelous. It is almost unbelievable that that young man of just twenty-two years of age could expound the Scriptures in such a way. In those issues he expounded not only the first twelve chapters of Revelation, but also the first two chapters of Genesis. He spoke of the first, second, and third days and applied them all very much to Christ. He said clearly that the land rising out of the water on the third day was a type of Christ coming forth from the dead. Christ was the good land resurrected on the third day to produce all kinds of life. What a marvelous revelation!</P><P>The following five excerpts, four of which are taken from the editor's word in The Christian, and one from Notes on Scriptural Messages, reveal his burden and purpose in publishing The Christian.</P>
