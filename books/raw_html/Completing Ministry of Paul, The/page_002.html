	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE HEAVENLY CALLING OF PAUL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 9:1-15; 26:13-19; Gal. 1:11-17; 2:20; 3:27; 4:19; Col. 1:24-29</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR PAUL&rsquo;S MINISTRY</h2>
<p>Without Paul&rsquo;s completing ministry, there is no way for Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry to be carried out. Of course, without Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry Paul&rsquo;s ministry would have no ground. These two ministries work together&mdash;the one in the heavens and the other within us. Paul&rsquo;s ministry reflected what Christ was ministering in the heavens.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry began in Acts 2. Between chapters two and nine Christ&rsquo;s ministry was proceeding, but Paul&rsquo;s had not yet begun. Something was missing. Yes, Peter was ministering, but if we compare his ministry with Paul&rsquo;s, we shall sense a lack. In Acts 9 the story of Paul&rsquo;s momentous conversion is recorded, a conversion that was brought about, not by any human being, but by the direct intervention of the Lord Jesus from the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CALLING FROM THE HEAVENS</h2>
<p>In Hebrews 3:1 Paul calls the Hebrews to whom he was writing &ldquo;partakers of a heavenly calling.&rdquo; The word heavenly shows that Paul&rsquo;s calling was specific. Those Hebrews were companions in receiving the heavenly calling.</p>
<p>This was not a calling on earth. Consider, in contrast to Paul, how Peter was called. Peter was at the Sea of Galilee, fishing with his brother, when a Man from Nazareth came by and called them. &ldquo;Come, follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men,&rdquo; the Lord Jesus told them (Matt. 4:18-19). How much I loved this story when I was young! I longed also to be a fisher of men. How much better to be a fisher of men rather than a fisher of fish!</p>
<p>After we consider Paul&rsquo;s calling, however, we shall see that there is no comparison between the two. Peter&rsquo;s calling was marvelous, but it was simple and from this earth. Peter was called by the Lord Jesus in His incarnation. That call is easy to understand. Paul&rsquo;s calling, on the other hand, is beyond our comprehension. The call to Saul of Tarsus came from the heavens, not from the Jesus on this earth, but from the ascended, glorified One in the heavens.</p>
<p>Saul of Tarsus was one of a strong character. He was happily nearing the end of his journey from Jerusalem to Damascus, eager to arrive and fulfill his task of arresting all those who believed in Jesus. It was midday as he approached Damascus. Suddenly &ldquo;there shone from heaven a great light round about&rdquo; him (Acts 22:6). He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?&rdquo; (v. 7). He must have thought, &ldquo;What do you mean? I have been persecuting Peter, and John, and Stephen. But all those whom I have persecuted were on the earth. I have never harmed anyone in the heavens. Who can this be, saying that I am persecuting him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he asked. Calling this unseen One Lord, he said, &ldquo;Who art thou, Lord?&rdquo; (v. 8). The answer came, &ldquo;I am Jesus!&rdquo; Saul must have been filled with consternation. Jesus was crucified and buried. How could He be speaking from the heavens? How could He be alive?</p>
<p>Such was the calling of Paul. All mysterious!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO PAUL</h2>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s completing ministry is to tell us that God is through with religion. Religion is an enemy to God&rsquo;s economy. Have you ever heard the gospel preached with this as its message? You have no doubt heard that God condemns you because of your sinfulness and worldliness. Have you ever been told that you must get out of religion? that religion is God&rsquo;s enemy? What you have heard as the gospel is not the completing ministry. The gospel pertains not merely to sin and the world. What God wants is not religion. He wants His Son revealed in you (Gal. 1:16). This is the completing ministry. At the time of Saul&rsquo;s calling he was not gambling nor cheating others. He was an upright, honest man. He could say of himself, &ldquo;As to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless&rdquo; (Phil. 3:6).</p>
<p>But Saul was altogether in religion. He needed to be rescued. He needed revelation. Why did the Lord Jesus come to preach the gospel directly to Saul? Peter, James, and John all knew how to preach the gospel. Their preaching, however, was to sinners. They would not have known how to preach the gospel to such a zealous religionist as Saul. What was the gospel message Saul heard from the Lord Jesus? A light from heaven first made him fall to the ground. Then a voice asked, &ldquo;Why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; When Saul replied, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; the voice answered, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could Peter have preached such a gospel? No! Only Christ Himself could. In his own sight Saul of Tarsus was not sinful or against God; he was zealous for God and righteous according to the law. Yet actually he was against God and His economy. God&rsquo;s economy is that we forsake the law and religion and have His Son revealed in us. At the time when Saul was called, however, Peter did not clearly realize this. John and James did not know this in a full way either. Thus the Lord Jesus Himself had to touch Saul directly.</p>
