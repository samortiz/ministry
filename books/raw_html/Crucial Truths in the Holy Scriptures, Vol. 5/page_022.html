	 <h2 class="head2">Being Persecuted for the Sake of Righteousness</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 5:10).</p>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens is righteousness, and the kingdom is where God carries out His righteousness and exercises His authority. Therefore, if we want to participate in the kingdom of the heavens, we must be righteous and even be willing to be persecuted for the sake of righteousness, that is, to be persecuted for holding on to righteousness. The world today and everything in it is evil. We are in this world, but we stand before God in a position of righteousness. As we live in a condition of righteousness, we will certainly meet with opposition and persecution. But it is only by being persecuted for the sake of righteousness that we can participate in the righteous kingdom of God. If we cannot suffer persecution for the sake of righteousness in this evil world today, we cannot reign because of righteousness in God&rsquo;s righteous kingdom. We must hold to righteousness in an unrighteous age and suffer persecution for the sake of righteousness in order for us to carry out God&rsquo;s righteousness in the coming righteous age.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Surpassing Righteousness</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 5:20).</p>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens is surpassingly righteous, so those who would enter into it must have a righteousness that surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees. The righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees is of the law, of the letter, and dead; the righteousness that surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees is of life, of the Spirit, and living. The righteousness of the law speaks of not killing, which is something outward; however, the righteousness of the kingdom speaks of not even being angry or hating, which is something inward. The righteousness of the law speaks of not committing adultery, but the righteousness of the kingdom speaks of not even lusting, which is a matter of our inward thoughts. The righteousness of the law does not break an oath; in contrast, the righteousness of the kingdom does not even swear, but simply says yes for yes and no for no. The righteousness of the law takes an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, but the righteousness of the kingdom does not resist evil people. When someone slaps the right cheek, the left is turned as well. When someone takes the inner garment, the outer garment is given as well. The righteousness of the law loves its neighbor and hates its enemy, but the righteousness of the kingdom loves both neighbors and enemies, prays for persecutors, loves as God loves, and is perfect as God is perfect. The righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees is according to law and in outward actions; it is of the letter and weak. However, the righteousness that is a condition for entering the kingdom of the heavens is the righteousness that surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees. It surpasses the law, it is according to life, and it is lived out from within. It is spiritual and living, and it surpasses the requirements of the letter of the law to match God&rsquo;s divine nature. The Lord Jesus said that if we want to enter the kingdom of the heavens, our righteousness must surpass that of the scribes and the Pharisees. This kind of surpassing righteousness is not obtained by faith in Christ but through living Christ.</p>
<p>In the Bible clothing typifies righteousness (Isa. 64:6). Matthew 22:11 speaks of a &ldquo;wedding garment,&rdquo; and Revelation 19:8 speaks of &ldquo;fine linen.&rdquo; Both of these verses refer to the surpassing righteousness that is a condition for entering the kingdom of the heavens. These verses show that a surpassing righteousness is required in order to attend Christ&rsquo;s wedding feast, which is the feast of the kingdom of the heavens. If we want to enter the kingdom of the heavens as the bride of Christ and attend Christ&rsquo;s wedding feast, we must live by the life of Christ today and live out His surpassing righteousness as our &ldquo;wedding garment&rdquo; and as our &ldquo;fine linen&rdquo; in order to see Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Doing the Will of God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 7:21).</p>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens is for God&rsquo;s rule and for the carrying out of His will. Therefore, if we want to participate in the kingdom of the heavens, we must also do the will of God. A person who has no consideration for God&rsquo;s will and who does not submit to the heavenly authority or accept the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens cannot enter into the kingdom of the heavens. In order to diligently take care of God&rsquo;s will, we must put ourselves aside and deny our interests and desires. We should not care for our own enjoyment and glory; instead, we must whole-heartedly pursue God&rsquo;s delight and acceptance, not caring for the desires or praises of man. This should be our attitude in matters related not only to our daily living but even more in preaching the Word, in casting out demons, and in doing works for the Lord. Doing the will of God is necessary for entering into the kingdom of the heavens. It does not matter how much we preach the gospel, how many demons we cast out, or how many works of power we do; what is important is whether we do the will of God. Preaching the gospel, casting out demons, and doing works of power can all be done according to our own desires, but in order to do the will of God, we must put ourselves aside. Only those who do God&rsquo;s will in their actions will be able to accomplish God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. If we want to enter the kingdom of the heavens in its manifestation, we must do God&rsquo;s will today.</p>
