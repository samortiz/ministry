<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Resurrected with a Body</H2><P>Both John 20 and Luke 24 provide evidence that Christ was resurrected with a body. On the night of His resurrection, the disciples were gathered together in a closed room. There was no opening, yet the Lord Jesus was suddenly in their midst (John 20:19-22). Some of the disciples could not believe that it was Jesus with a physical body, so the Lord Jesus asked His disciples to touch His hands and feet (Luke 24:36-43). He had a real body that could be touched, yet He entered a closed room without any opening. This is a mystery.</P><P>Christ is human and divine; He is the Creator and He is also a creature; He still has a physical body, yet He dwells in our spirit. We simply do not have the capacity to reconcile these things. Even in the physical realm there are many things that we cannot understand. How can we understand all the divine things? We can understand the reality of everything only through the Bible, a book of revelation. Apart from the Bible, we cannot know God, man, or the universe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST AS THE SEED OF DAVID<br>BECOMING EVERYTHING TO US<br>AND BEING ALL IN ALL IN THE CHURCH,<br>IN THE BODY, AND IN THE NEW MAN</H2><P>The Bible is a book that clearly reveals Christ in many aspects. In 2 Samuel 7 God promised a seed to David. Eventually, this seed of David was designated the Son (Rom. 1:3-4). Today Christ as the seed of David has become all in all to us. He is the centrality and universality of God. He is the hub and the circumference. He is the condensation and consummation of God and man. He is the all-inclusive, all-extensive Christ. He is God and He is man. He is the Creator and He is a creature. He is the First and He is the Last (Rev. 1:17). He is the beginning and He is the end. He fills all in all (Eph. 1:23), and He has been consummated to be the Spirit. He is our food, our drink, our breath, and our clothing. He is also every member of the Body and He is within every member. The Body is not the Head, nor the Head the Body, but Christ is both the Head and the Body (1 Cor. 12:12; Col. 1:18). In life, in nature, in constitution, we as the Body are the same as Christ the Head. Eventually, this Christ is every person in the new man (Col. 3:10-11). In the new man there is no room for any nation, any race, or any class of persons. There is room only for Christ.</P><P>Regarding this, we need a vision to see that we are nothing. We have been annulled by Christ, and Christ has become all of us. In the church, in the Body, and in the new man, Christ is all, and He is in all.</P><P>The person of Christ is the greatest mystery in the universe. With Him, everything is a mystery, yet everything is real. We can experience Christ as the Spirit because He is within us and with us all the time, even until the consummation of the age (Matt. 28:20). Where there are two or three gathered into His name, He is in their midst (18:20).</P>
