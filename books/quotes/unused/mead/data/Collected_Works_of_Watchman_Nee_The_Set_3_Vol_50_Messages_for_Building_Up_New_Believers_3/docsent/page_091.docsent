   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHOOSING FOR OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE PATHWAY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today I present these four churches to us all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The last three came out of Roman Catholicism, and all four will remain until the Lord Jesus comes again.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today every child of God has to choose the pathway he should take with regard to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do you want to be a Roman Catholic?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do you want to be a Protestant?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do you want to follow the oneness of Roman Catholicism?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you want to follow the many denominations of Protestantism?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Or do you want to take the way of Philadelphia?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Or were you once Philadelphia but are now living in the shadow of history and boasting of your former glory, thus becoming Laodicean?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When a person becomes proud, forsakes the way of life, and neglects reality, while reminiscing on his history and his own riches, the only thing left will be the opinions of many.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Among such ones there can only be discussion and consensus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It appears to be a democratic society but bears no resemblance to the Body relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you do not know the binding, authority, and life of the Body, you do not know brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These four churches will remain with us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must be faithful to continue in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not be curious about Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who are curious will always suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not touch the denominations in Protestantantism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible shows us clearly that the Protestant movement as a whole had God's blessing, but that there are also many things which the Lord condemns and rebukes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not need to delve into these things or ask about them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must learn to stand on the ground of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Always keep the Lord's word and never deny His name.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hold fast the brotherly stand and never be proud!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not be proud in the face of Catholicism, Protestantism, or the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once you are proud, you become Laodicea and are no longer Philadelphia!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As soon as you show your pride before them, you are no longer Philadelphia but Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Which way do you want to take?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May God bless His children and may the brothers take the upright path with regard to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The God-ordained pathway for the church is the way of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I may not have tens of thousands of cases to prove that the best of God's children speak the same thing and take this same way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But I have hundreds of cases to prove what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once the general issue of Protestantism is settled, we need not nit-pick the minor issues.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Similarly, once the overall issue of Roman Catholicism is settled, we do not have to be so concerned about its minor issues.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Roman Catholic Church has twenty-one different organizations in China.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no need to involve ourselves with the Catholic Church, and there is no need to learn about the organizations of its different daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once the overall issue of Roman Catholicism is settled, these twenty-one organizations are no longer a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Likewise, once the general issue of Protestantism is settled, we do not need to deal with all of its fifteen hundred denominations one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord's way is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is the way of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Walk on this way, but be careful not to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once we take the way of Philadelphia, the greatest temptation is to become proud and say, "We are better than you are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our truths are clearer than yours, and we understand them better than you do!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have only the Lord's name and we are different!"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once we become proud, we fall into Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those who follow the Lord have no pride.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord will spew the proud ones out of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May the Lord be merciful to us!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a warning to all of us: We must not be proud in our speaking!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A person must live before the Lord continually before he can refrain from proud words.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only those who live before God continually will not consider themselves rich.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only they will not be proud!</S>
