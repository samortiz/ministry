   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING AGGRESSIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN LEARNING EVERYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>RELATED TO SERVING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must be aggressive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I hope that the young people who are serving full time will study Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are even good videotapes available that teach Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to serve the Lord, you must be immersed in the Lord s Word and spend time in it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, you must learn some Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some may wonder when they can find the time to learn Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You can find the time to learn Greek by spending less time for your meals, your sleep, talking on the phone, conversing, and reading the newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Saving time in this way is what the Scriptures call redeeming the time Eph 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, it is important to know the world situation, but for this there is a need to read only the international section of the newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since I understand the Bible and the truth, and I also know history, I know the spiritual application of history.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The book The World Situation and God s Move proves that I have a thorough understanding of world history.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, you need to study a little history and know the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This will help you in serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you know history and the world situation, you will understand people and different circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Young people should have this kind of training.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You must be aggressive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more you learn, the more useful you will be.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You should not rely on the diploma from your school; instead, you should study hard and be aggressive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You are still young and full of potential.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Your time is precious; you must redeem every minute by learning everything related to serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In addition to Chinese, you should study at least two other languages: Greek and English.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will help you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You should also be aggressive to learn how to converse with others and how to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You should learn how to have the proper attitude, expression, and gestures when you converse with others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have studied all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1927 I realized that I would spend my whole life preaching the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I did not study theology, nor did I study methods of preaching, but I came up with two ways to practice I would preach to the ocean, and I would stand before a mirror and practice preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This practice helped me greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When it was time for me to stand up to give a message, everyone was surprised and asked where I had learned to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I also learned how to contact others and to use proper mannerisms in greeting or shaking hands with others so that I could earn others respect</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You should not think that these matters are unrelated to serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we go out to contact people, our attitude, expression, speaking, and conduct have much to do with serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are proper in these aspects, we will give others the impression that we are a weighty person who does not act rashly or frivolously.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, what we say will be taken into consideration by others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our work consists of nothing but speaking with others to help and to enlighten them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the way we speak or conduct ourselves is not acceptable, no matter what we say, others will have a negative impression of us, and this will nullify everything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, I advise you to learn all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who learn to be diplomats must be trained to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only must they be courteous, but they must also have a certain demeanor.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A diplomat represents his country.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, when he meets with the heads of other countries, he must have a proper demeanor in order to gain others respect before he can gain their trust.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are not uplifting ourselves, but when we speak for the Lord, we are what Paul calls an ambassador of Christ 2 Cor 5:20; Eph 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, we should learn to speak and conduct ourselves with gravity even though we are young.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not be hasty in our speaking; rather, when we speak, we should consider to whom we are speaking, what to say, how much to say, and when to stop speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must learn all these things because we represent the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Suppose you are a young sister who recently graduated from college.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You will know how to conduct yourself and how to speak with gravity if you are properly aggressive.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The saints in your small group will be impressed and think that you are special.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the Spirit leads you, you can pray a few simple and weighty sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After the meeting, you will not be frivolous; rather, your contact with others will be proper before leaving.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This will leave the saints in your small group with the impression that you are a person who is worthy of respect.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even your reading of the Bible should be proper in a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you conduct yourself in this way, the saints in your group will be gained by your proper reading.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, over time you will build up a certain amount of credibility among them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord raised up a church in my hometown when I was young.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A year later the Lord led me to leave my job, and after that He took me to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At that time I prayed that the Lord would give me wisdom to know how to go out and come in among His people cf.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>2 Chron 1:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I prayed this for at least two or three years, and I believe that the Lord heard my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must be aggressive.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should pray concerning the way we dress.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should consider even the style and the color of the clothes we wear.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must not love fashion.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As soon as we dress fashionably, we sell ourselves cheaply.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, we should not dress like an old person.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we pray concerning how to dress appropriately, the Lord will lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You should conduct yourselves such that others consider you as weighty young persons full of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If others have this impression of you, your words will have weight.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>People will be amazed that you are only in your twenties, and they will treasure and receive your words.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I was saved through the gospel preached by Sister Peace Wang.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I was not yet twenty years old then, and she was a young woman who was six years older than I. When she preached the gospel in my hometown, I went to hear her out of curiosity.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As she was speaking, I was greatly touched, and I received everything she said.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I was genuinely saved at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Seven years later the Lord raised up a church in my hometown, and in the spring of the following year, around March or April, she was the first person who came to visit us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We observed her attitude, her mannerisms, her way of contacting people, and the way she handled things.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Everything she did impressed us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>At that time she was a very influential sister in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>No matter what she did, whether she was standing to give a message or sitting down, she impressed others.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It was not only the power in her spirit that impressed others, but much more it was her demeanor.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You must learn all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You should not behave in a loose or crazy way, nor should you be old fashioned or too conservative.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You must pray and learn to be appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Even how we style our hair requires much learning.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must not forget that serving the Lord is contacting people, and an important part of contacting people is our appearance, because this affects the impression that others have of us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Hence, we must be aggressive to learn, even in the matter of cutting our hair.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>These points illustrate that we must learn to be aggressive in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If the two hundred full-timers are aggressive to learn, even your hairstyle and clothing will show others your quality.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>All these things are related to your serving the Lord; hence, you must be aggressive, not casual, in everything.</S>
