   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN SERVING IN ONENESS AS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HOLY AND ROYAL PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO BE BUILT UP AS A SPIRITUAL HOUSE Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:2-5, 9; John 1:51; Gen 28:11-22; Psa 133 THE PRIESTHOOD BEING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A BUILT-UP SPIRITUAL HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not easy for Christians to understand what the real service is that we render to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The natural thought is that anything we do for the Lord is a service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word service has even been damaged in Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>People speak of the Lord s Day morning meeting as a service, and in the evening they also have an evening service.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What they mean by service is simply a Christian gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Bible, however, service has a much different meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The best portion to see the proper understanding of the service is in 1 Peter 2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 5 says, You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the original Greek of the New Testament, there are two words translated as priesthood in English.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One word is used in Hebrews 7, referring to the priestly service, the service of the priests vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>11, 12, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The other, used in 1 Peter 2:5 and 9, refers not to the priestly service but to the group of priests, the priestly body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The spiritual house in verse 5 is the priesthood, the priestly body, and this priesthood is the spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both the spiritual house and the holy priesthood are being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 5 continues, To offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To offer is to serve; the offering up of spiritual sacrifices is the real service.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The true service which we render to the Lord is an offering by a built-up body of priests, and this built-up body is the spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By this we can see that the genuine, proper service depends upon the building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If there is no building, there can be no house, and if there is no house, there can be no priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The building is the house, and the house is the priesthood, the priestly body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we speak of service groups in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a good term.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the biblical language, the service groups are the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Service group is simply a modern way to refer to the classical, or scriptural, term priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The service of arranging chairs is a chair-arranging priesthood, and the cleaning service group is a cleaning priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We also have the junior high, nursery, and clerical priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word priesthood should remind us that our service groups are the building up of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are not serving as priests in this way, what we have is not a service group.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who arrange the chairs in the meeting hall are not merely chair arrangers; they are priests.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that they not only arrange the chairs; they render a service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Chair arranging is not their business, duty, or service.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their service is something holy and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In itself, chair arranging is not holy or spiritual; it is not a service.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our chair arranging is different.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is a holy and spiritual service rendered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first test of our service is whether we are serving as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The second test is whether we are serving as individual priests or as the hood, the corporate priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who arrange the chairs are priests, but this is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They should serve not as individual priests but as the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Priests are many, but the priesthood is one and unique.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the service groups there is only one priesthood, which is composed of the many priests.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This implies the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The genuine service in the church has the nature of being priestly and of being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If our service is not of this nature, it is not genuine; it is a counterfeit and an imitation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our service is a priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE PRIESTHOOD BEING HOLY AND ROYAL</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A priest is not a common, natural person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Of the billions of people on the earth today, relatively few are priests.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They are merely common people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A priest is, first of all, one who is separated, not common.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everyone in the church service must be a separated, sanctified, marked-out person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is why 1 Peter 2 says that the priesthood is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is something special, separated, and sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must not be common in our thinking, attitude, speaking, expression, in the way we dress, and in every matter and every aspect of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we are common even in one matter, we will lose our standing as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A priest is a holy, separated person.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the ancient time among the Israelites, the priests clothed themselves, ate, and lived in a different way, and they lodged in a different building.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This was a type, but today the reality is the same in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As priests we must take care of what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must be separated, different, and not common.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must be special.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some may say that we need to be human, but we need to be careful when we say this.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we are human in a common way, we are finished as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need to be human in a holy way with a holy humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the meaning of being a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Moreover, a priest must also be royal, or kingly.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>First Peter 2 speaks of both the holy priesthood v. 5 and the royal priesthood v. 9 . To be royal is not only to be uncommon and special but to have a high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Many dear saints love the Lord and know the church, but the way they behave, speak, and do things is too low, not like kings.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must not be proud, which is to be ugly and foolish, but we should not forget that we are kings.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We are high persons who belong to the royal family.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This also is included in the matter of service.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Those who arrange chairs are royal chair arrangers; they are kings arranging the chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In this way, chair arranging becomes a kingly service.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Some Christians are ambitious for position in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They desire to be one of the leaders, even the leading one among the leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should not care for whether we are elders, leading ones, or simply small brothers with no name.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Rather, we should care for the kind of person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If a beggar ascends to a king s throne, his kingship will be beggarly, but if a king sweeps the street, his street sweeping will be kingly.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If the chair arranging brothers and sisters are kingly, the chair arranging in the church service will be kingly, and people will see something high.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They will not see a group of lowly workers arranging the chairs; if this is all that people see, we are altogether a failure in our church service.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Instead, the new ones should be able to see something high and kingly even in the lowly affairs such as chair arranging and cleaning the hall.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Whether these matters are high or low depends on who does them.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If the President of the United States comes to arrange the chairs, the chair arranging would be a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Arranging chairs is the same business one way or another.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>What makes a difference is who does it.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We are the holy and royal priests.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We must be holy, separated, and not common, and we must also be kingly, with a high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In the church service even the young ones should consider themselves kingly.</S>
