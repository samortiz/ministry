It means that we are willing to submit to the authority that God has put upon a person. We are responsible for handing ourselves over. In the Old Testament, when men laid their hands on the heads of the goats, it meant that they were willing to hand the goats over to the priests. If they wanted to keep the goats, they should not lay their hands on the goats, because they were not willing to hand the goats over. The Bible says that a man has to come to the altar willingly and offer his sacrifices willingly. God wants man to hand himself over in a voluntary way. The Acts of the Apostles records the matter of baptism; it also records the matter of the laying on of hands. The laying on of hands signifies the acceptance of the authority of the church. Today man sees that baptism is a separation of the believers from the worldly system. But he does not see that the laying on of hands is an acceptance of God's authority that He establishes in the church. When a man refuses authority, confusion results. If a man is willing to hand himself over to the serving ones, it will become easy for the serving ones to do their job.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE OF THE WORK&mdash;<br />THE CO-WORKERS HANDING THEMSELVES OVER</h2><p>The principle in the work is the same. The co-workers in all the places should first hand themselves over and place themselves under the Head and be directed by the Head. Only then can the Lord do something, and only then will the work have a way to go on. We hope that in these days the Lord will at least give us a way to go on.</p><p>Henceforth, we have to accept the judgment of the Body. All major decisions and directions must be placed in the hands of the Body. If we do this, we will have life, power, and direction. Otherwise, there will be rebellion and insubordination. If we hand ourselves over, we will surely feel an "amen'' and a sweet sense within us.</p><p>In the past the situation in Foochow has been one of confusion. The meetings there became a little kingdom by themselves. The saints were closed and would not fellowship with others. Their hearts were not broad enough and did not include all the believers; they did not see the unique Body of Christ. The manifestation of the Body in the future will be determined by the nature of the testimony of the local churches today. The local churches are the models of the coming universal church. This is like an architect designing a house: first he builds a model. Although the model is not very big, it represents in nature what will be built. First Corinthians 12 speaks of the universal Body on the one hand and the Body life in the local churches on the other hand.</p><h2 class="head1">THE OUTLET OF THE WORK&mdash;<br />HANDING ONESELF OVER TO THE BODY<br />TO BE A THREE-DIMENSIONAL VESSEL</h2><p>In our work we must find an outlet for the Lord. We are not lacking power today, but we are lacking an outlet for the Lord. The problem among us is that the co-workers have not properly handed themselves over. Although there is a little power, this power is not great. A three-dimensional cup can hold a lot of water. But a flat piece of glass or a broken cup cannot hold any water. Because our work has been "flat,'' we have lost many blessings. The tabernacle and the temple in the Old Testament both typify the church in the New Testament, the Body of Christ. Only when this Body becomes a "three-dimensional" Body can it be a vessel of God. Only then can it contain God's riches and be a strong and powerful testimony for the Lord.</p><p>Not only should the co-workers do this, but the brothers and sisters should also consecrate themselves fully in this way. No matter where he or she is, every brother and sister should be a servant of God. All of us need a specific declaration; we should count the cost and hand ourselves over.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
