<h1 class="title">STEPS TO RAISE THE NEW BELIEVERS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 10:12-13; 2 Tim. 2:22; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; Acts 13:52; 4:8, 31; 2 Cor. 4:13; 1 Cor. 14:26; Heb. 10:25; Rom. 10:9; Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will see some of the practical steps to raise the new believers. We must learn the steps of how to raise up the new believers in the growth in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES<br />
TO CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>If we are going to raise the new believers, we must learn how to lead them to call on the name of the Lord (Rom. 10:12-13; 2 Tim. 2:22). There are many ways to lead the new believers into calling on the name of the Lord; the way largely depends upon your practice. Learn to call and practice calling on the name of the Lord. If you are a person who spontaneously, constantly, and instantly calls on the name of the Lord, this will not only impress the new ones, but also stir them up to spontaneously call on the name of the Lord. As little children like to follow their parents, the new believers will follow you to copy and imitate whatever you practice. We should not merely teach the new ones but lead them to call on the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>In order to help the new ones to do anything, we need to read and study the proper verses in the Old and New Testaments. We must do everything based upon what the Word teaches. Calling upon the name of the Lord is mentioned throughout the holy Scriptures. Beginning with the third generation of mankind, men learned to call on the name of Jehovah (Gen. 4:26). Then throughout the Bible, from the Old Testament to the New Testament, there is the line of such a life of calling on the name of the Lord (See Acts 2:21, note 1 in the Recovery Version).</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 2:22 Paul charged his young co-worker Timothy to pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with all those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. This indicates that at Paul&rsquo;s time all those who sought after the Lord with a pure heart called on the name of the Lord. Calling on the name of the Lord is the unique way to seek after the Lord. We must learn to practice calling upon the name of the Lord all the time&mdash;spontaneously, instantly, and constantly. In Romans 10:12 Paul tells us that the Lord is rich to all who call on Him. Calling on the Lord is a unique way to touch the Lord, to contact the Lord, and to enter into the full enjoyment of His unsearchable riches.</p>
<p>We obtain salvation by calling on the name of the Lord (Rom. 10:13). To receive salvation from the Lord, believing alone is inadequate. You need to call on His name. From the first time we contact the new believers, we should lead them into the practice of calling upon the name of the Lord. You should tell them that the name of the Lord is very available. Wherever they go, the name follows them because the name is always with them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Name Denoting His Person</h2>
<p>In the Bible, especially in the New Testament, the name of the Lord denotes the Lord Himself, His very person. A name always denotes a person. When you call a person, you call his name. Humanly speaking, without having a person&rsquo;s name, there is no way to call a person. The name of the Lord Jesus is always with you. Wherever you go, the name goes with you; wherever you are, the name is also there with you.</p>
<p>We touch the Lord by naming His name (2 Tim. 2:19b). We can name His name, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; at any time. While we are listening to a message or engaged in any other kind of activity, we can call on the name of the Lord within. It is so convenient to call on the name of the Lord because His name is always available. We may call on others&rsquo; names and not have any sense that they are presently with us. But when we call on the Lord Jesus, right away we have the deep sensation that He is with us. This is because He is the Spirit who can be with us at any time and anywhere (2 Cor. 3:17). When we call on Him, we have the sense that He is with us because today He is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). For our redemption, the Lord Jesus was the Lamb of God on the cross. But in order to be with us as our life, He became a life-giving Spirit through death and resurrection. As the life-giving Spirit, He is omnipresent. Thus He is in us, with us, upon us, and through us.</p>
<p>Even when you do not call, He is still with you all the time (Matt. 28:20). However, if you do not call, you do not have the sense of His presence. Your calling brings in the sense of His presence. We should not hold the concept that when we call on the Lord, He is present, and that when we do not call on the Lord, He is absent. Regardless of the situation, whether we call or not, whether we are up or down, whether we do well or not, He is always with us. But the sensation we have within concerning His absence or presence depends upon our calling. When you call, you have the sensation of His presence; when you do not call, you have the sensation of His absence. Calling brings you into the enjoyment of His practical presence. He does not come and go; rather, He remains with us and makes His home in us. When you like Him, He is present with you. When you dislike Him, He is still with you. When you love Him, He is present; when you are cold toward Him, He is still present. His indwelling presence is not changeable. But your sensation of the enjoyment of His presence depends upon your calling. We all must call on the Lord&rsquo;s name to enjoy His presence.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_060.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_062.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 61</div><br></body></html>
