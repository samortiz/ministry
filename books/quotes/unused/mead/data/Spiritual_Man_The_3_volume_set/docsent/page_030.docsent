   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Although this spirit is dead to God, it still works as actively as the mind and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is indeed dead to God, but it is still active in other areas.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes a fallen one can have a spirit that is stronger than his soul or his body and that can still rule over his whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most people are soulish or are carnal.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the former kind of people are "spiritual" their spirits are greater than others'.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One can find such cases in those who practice planchette, divination, witchcraft, etc. They communicate with the spiritual realm, not through the Holy Spirit, but rather through the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The spirits of sinful men are joined to Satan and the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Their spirits are dead to God but alive to Satan and receptive to the operation of the evil spirits within them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The soul becomes subject to the demand of the senses and becomes their slave, so that even when the Holy Spirit would fight for a place for God, the fight is futile.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why the Scripture says, "My Spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh" Gen 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The flesh in the Bible refers to the life and nature of the soul and body of the unregenerated man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>More often it refers to the sinful nature within the body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This flesh is the common nature which man shares with other animals.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now man is completely under the control of the flesh, and there is no possibility of escape.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The soul has replaced the spirit as the ruling one, and everything is independent and self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man now walks according to the desires of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even in matters of religion and in the most zealous pursuit of God, man exercises the power of his soul and decides on his own to seek after God and to please God apart from the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The soul not only exercises itself in this way but is controlled by the body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The lusts of the body, its feelings and demands, are all summoning the soul to obey, to carry out their commands, and to gratify them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only are all the descendants of Adam dead in their spirits, but they are "out of the earth, earthy" 1 Cor 15:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are fully under the control of the flesh and walk according to the soulish life and the carnal nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such people cannot have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes they express their intellectual power, and sometimes they express their lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>More often, they express both.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The flesh controls the whole being without hindrance and without any interference.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the kind of people mentioned in Jude 18 and 19: "Mockers, going on according to their own lusts for ungodliness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are those who make divisions, soulish, having no spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be soulish is the opposite of having the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now, the spirit that was the highest, that ought to be joined to God, and that ought to rule over the soul and the body has become surrounded by the soul, whose motive and purpose are totally earthy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The spirit has lost its original position.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Its condition is now abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why the Bible says that they have no spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The result of such a fully soulish condition is to mock, to go on according to one's own lusts, and to make divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First Corinthians 2:14 also speaks of this kind of unregenerated soulish person: "But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such persons are controlled by their souls and are suppressing their spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are the opposite to the spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although these ones can be very intelligent and can come up with wonderful ideas and theories, they cannot say anything about the things of the Holy Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They cannot receive the revelation from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How different is this from the world's view!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The world thinks that man's intellectual power and his reason are almighty, that he can find out all kinds of truth in the world by his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But God's Word considers these as very vain.</S>
