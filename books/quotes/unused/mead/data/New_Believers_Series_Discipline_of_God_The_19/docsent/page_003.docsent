   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Discipline Being the Father's Education</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once you become a Christian, you should be prepared to accept discipline from God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you are not His child, God will let you go.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He will allow you to live an undisciplined life and walk your own way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But once you have accepted the Lord Jesus as your Savior, once you are born of God and have become His child, you have to prepare yourself for His discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No father has the time to discipline another man's child.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whether his neighbor's son is good or bad is not of his concern.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A good father, however, will always discipline his own son in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He will deal with his son strictly according to guidelines that he has set in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He will not discipline his son in a mindless and haphazard way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He will train his son according to a few objectives, namely, honesty, diligence, long-suffering, and noble aspirations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The father puts together a certain curriculum to discipline his son.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He molds his son into a certain character.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the same way, since the day we were saved, God has been arranging a curriculum for us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He wants us to learn certain lessons so that we will be conformed to His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He wants us to be like Him in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why He arranges, disciplines, and scourges.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His goal is to make us a certain kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the very beginning of his Christian life, a child of God must realize that God has prepared many lessons for him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He has made many provisions in the environment and has ordered many things, experiences, and sufferings for the purpose of producing a certain kind of character and disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is what God is doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He wants to build up a certain kind of character in us, and He does it by ordering all kinds of circumstances to come our way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The minute we become Christians, we have to realize that God's hand is guiding us in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The ordained circumstances will come, and the scourgings will come.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As soon as we get off the right way, His scourges will be upon us and will goad us back to the way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every child of God should be prepared to accept God's disciplinary hand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God disciplines us because we are sons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God does not waste His time on others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He has no time to discipline those who are not His beloved sons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has no time to reprove those who are not yet accepted as sons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Scourging and discipline are expressions of God's love and acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only Christians can have a share in God's scourging and discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>C. Discipline Not Being a Punishment but a Glory</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What we are receiving is discipline; it is not punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Punishment is for the retribution of one's mistakes, while discipline is for the purpose of education.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Punishment comes because we have done something wrong; it responds to the past.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Discipline is also related to our mistakes, but it is something for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Discipline bears an element of the future; it has a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have been called into the name of the Lord today; we belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we must be prepared to allow God to make us vessels of glory to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I can say with much confidence that God wants every one of His children to glorify Him in certain areas.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every child of God should glorify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, each one does it in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some will glorify Him in one way, some in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We glorify God through different circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a consequence, God is glorified in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everyone has his own part and his own specialty.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God wants to create a certain kind of character in us for the purpose of glorifying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No one is exempt from God's disciplinary hand.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such a hand works to accomplish the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have never seen a child of God who was exempt from His disciplinary hand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>D. Ignorance of Discipline Being a Great Loss</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is indeed a great loss if God's children do not understand His discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many people live a foolish life in the eyes of God for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They do not know what the Lord wants to do in them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They walk according to their own will and wander in a wild, unrestrained, and aimless way through the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God does not operate this way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is a God of purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He does things for the purpose of molding a specific character in us so that we may glorify His name.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All discipline is for the purpose of bringing us on in this way.</S>
