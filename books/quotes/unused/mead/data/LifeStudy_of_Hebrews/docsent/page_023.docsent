   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. For Christ to Take Possession of the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The coming inhabited earth in the coming age of the kingdom will be for Christ s possession.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ will take possession of the coming inhabited earth Psa 2:8 for His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s purpose is to recover the earth from the usurping hand of Satan and to establish His kingdom on the earth for the expression of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has given such an earth to Christ as His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we, the saved ones, as His partners shall share in His inheritance of the coming inhabited earth, we shall have a share in such a glorious earth with God s kingdom established on it for the expression of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To miss the sharing of this earth will be a just recompense to those who neglect so great a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we neglect so great a salvation today, we shall not escape this just recompense of missing the sharing of the coming kingdom on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE MAN JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s purpose for man is in three stages: the stage of creation, the stage of prophecy, and the stage of fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The man in God s purpose is both Adam and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Adam was the first man, and Christ was and still is the second man 1 Cor 15:45, 47 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With respect to both men there are these three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us firstly consider the man in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A. The Man in Creation 1.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To Express God with His Image</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In creation, God ordained man to express Him with His image Gen 1:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man was made in God s image that he might be able to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To Represent God with His Dominion</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God also intended that man represent Him with His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After creating man, God committed His authority to man, thereby authorizing him to be His representative.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, at the time of creation, man was ordained to do two things: to express God and to represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Having Failed God in His Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The man in creation, however, failed God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man became poisoned by Satan and fell.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, the man in creation was damaged and failed God in His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we only had the book of Genesis, we would be very disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regardless of the many excellent records in the book of Genesis, at the end of that book we are told that Joseph died and was put into a coffin in Egypt Gen 50:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How pitiful it is that the book of Genesis closes in this way!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Joseph, the one who represented God, died, was put into a coffin, and was left in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before we go on, I would like to say a word about Jacob and Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jacob, who became Israel, the prince of God, and Joseph were actually one complete man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Joseph was a part of Israel, although he was not a part of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jacob was a supplanter, a stealer, but he was transformed into Israel, the prince of God Gen 32:28; 35:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When he was experienced and matured, he certainly expressed God with His image.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Jacob was young, he was a supplanter and deceived everyone: his brother, his father, his uncle, and his brothers-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But God is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is able to transform such a supplanter and deceiver into a prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Jacob became an old man, he did not know how to deceive, fight, or supplant.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He only knew to stretch forth his hands and bless people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jacob blessed whomever came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even Pharaoh, the greatest king on earth at the time, was blessed by Israel when Joseph brought his father to see him Gen 47:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Israel was greater than Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By that time Israel was mature and expressed God as the very God who blesses.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our God is a blessing God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, Israel, who was fully in God s image, bestowed blessings wherever he went.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When he was brought in before Pharaoh, he stretched forth his hands and blessed him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That was truly the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The name Israel contains the name of God, for the last two letters of Israel, el, mean God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nevertheless, Israel needed Joseph as one of his parts, as the reigning part, the representing part.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that time, the entire earth was not actually under Pharaoh s rule; it was under Joseph s rule.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Israel with Joseph expressed God with His image on the one hand and represented God with His authority on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nevertheless, the book of Genesis ends by saying that Joseph died, was put into a coffin, and was left in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The conclusion of the book of Genesis is so poor.</S>
