Some Christians think that calling on the Lord is the same as praying to Him. Formerly, I held the same concept. One day, however, the Lord showed me that calling on His name is different from merely praying. Yes, calling is a type of prayer, for it is a part of our prayer, but calling is not merely praying. The Hebrew word for call means to "call out to," "to cry unto," that is, to cry out. The Greek word for call means "to invoke a person," "to call a person by name." In other words, it is to call a person by naming him audibly. Although prayer may be silent, calling must be audible.</P><P>To call on the Lord also means to cry to Him and to experience spiritual breathing. "I called upon thy name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon. Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry" (Lam. 3:55-56). These verses indicate that calling is also crying and breathing. Crying is the best breathing. I have been told that crying is the best exercise for little babies. Whenever you cry out, you breathe spontaneously and deeply. By crying and breathing we both exhale and inhale. Inhaling always follows exhaling. By exhaling we breathe out all the negative things. Whenever you breathe out the negative things, the positive things of the Lord will fill you up. Let me take the example of losing your temper. When you are about to lose your temper, do not try to suppress it, but call, "O Lord Jesus." Then add a short prayer, "Lord Jesus, I am going to lose my temper." Do this and see whether you still lose your temper. By calling on the name of the Lord you will breathe out your temper and you will breathe in the Lord Jesus. You will exhale your temper and inhale the Lord. Do you want to be holy? The way to be holy is to call on the name of the Lord Jesus. By calling on His name all the sinful, evil, and unclean things will be breathed out, and all the positive things&#151;the riches of the Lord&#151;will be breathed into you.</P><P>A. B. Simpson wrote a hymn on breathing the Lord. Let us read some of the stanzas:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>O Lord, breathe Thy Spirit on me,<br>Teach me how to breathe Thee in;<br>Help me pour into Thy bosom<br>All my life of self and sin.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>I am breathing out my sorrow,<br>Breathing out my sin;<br>I am breathing, breathing, breathing,<br>All Thy fulness in.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Breathing out my sinful nature,<br>Thou hast borne it all for me;<br>Breathing in Thy cleansing fulness,<br>Finding all my life in Thee.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_165.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_167.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Genesis &nbsp; pg 166</div><br></body></html>
