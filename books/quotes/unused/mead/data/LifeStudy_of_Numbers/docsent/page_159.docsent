   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE FORTY-TWO FIGHTING 11 Scripture Reading: Num 30:1-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Numbers 28:1 30:16 is a section dealing with statutes, which are additional laws.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These statutes concern two matters: offerings 28:1 29:40 and vows 30:1-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>B. Concerning Vows</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The statutes concerning vows follow the statutes concerning the offerings, which are God's food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is our duty, our responsibility, to present the offerings to God, whereas vows are voluntary.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God wants us to do something more than carry out our duty and responsibility to fulfill His requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He would like us to do something additional to make a vow to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>An example of a particular vow is the vow of the Nazarite in Numbers 6.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the church life today, we also have the two matters of fulfilling God's requirements and of making a vow to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we simply fulfill God's requirements, we have not yet come up to the highest standard.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to make a vow to God, volunteering ourselves in a definite and particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to church history, all those who were used by God to fulfill His New Testament ministry were volunteers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They not only fulfilled God's requirements but also volunteered to make a vow to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John Nelson Darby is an example of such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He fulfilled God's requirements, and he also made a vow, for the sake of the need in the church life, to remain unmarried.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The extent to which the Lord will use us depends on our vow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course, a vow is not limited to the matter of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may make a vow to the Lord regarding many different things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The higher our vow is, the more the Lord will use us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I hope that many of the young people in the Lord's recovery will be touched and inspired to make a vow to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord's recovery needs young people who have made vows to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A young person who volunteers to make a vow may say, "Lord, by Your mercy and grace I have fulfilled Your New Testament requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But I would like to do something additional.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I would like to make a vow to live for You absolutely."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all need to make some kind of vow to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A Man Vowing a Vow to Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>or Swearing an Oath to Bind Himself by a Pledge</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A man vowing a vow to Jehovah or swearing an oath to bind himself by a pledge was not to break his word Num 30:1-2a .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, he was to do according to all that proceeded out of his mouth v. 2b . This indicates that when we make a vow to God, we must keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we break our word, we will suffer loss.</S>
