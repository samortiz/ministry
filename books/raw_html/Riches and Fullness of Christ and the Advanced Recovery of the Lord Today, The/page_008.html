<h2 class=head2>As Power Tabernacling over the Believers</h2><p>This grace is what God is in Himself as all His riches. Now it is gradually wrought and constituted into us. In this way, this power becomes everything to us, and it has become the power that tabernacles over us.<h2 class=head2>Empowering the Believers in All Things, Making Them Uncommon</h2><p>Moreover, this grace is empowering us in all things. Paul told us that he became an uncommon person not through himself, but through the grace of Christ that was present in him. We can use electricity as an illustration of how Christ is present in us. When electricity is present with the microphone, it will transmit our voice. Of course, when electricity is present with man, man will be killed by it. This is the result of the presence of electricity. When Christ is present with us, the first thing He brings is the killing element. After this, He enables us to live with Him.<p>Our destiny is to die with Christ and to live with Him. Without the presence of Christ, we can never experience death, and we can never experience resurrection. We will remain in ourselves. This is something to be condemned. We can only be a proper and right person when we die with Christ and live together with Him. This is like an electric toy: without electricity, it will not move but will remain in the same place all the time. But when electricity is applied, it will turn around unceasingly. It is the same way with us, the believers. When the grace of Christ is present with the believers, it will empower them in all things and will make them uncommon persons.<h2 class=head1>THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>The Spirit of Jesus Christ Being the Embodiment of Christ, Who Is the Pneumatic Christ in Resurrection</h2><p>The all-inclusiveness and limitlessness of Christ become the riches of Christ. Today, these riches become the grace that we enjoy. This grace comes upon us through the Spirit. The Triune God is Spirit. The ultimate consummation of the Triune God is also the Spirit. Moreover, after the Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead, He also became a life-giving Spirit. But this does not mean that there are three Spirits. It is only the three aspects of the one Spirit. As far as God is concerned, His nature is Spirit. As far as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God is concerned, and as far as the Lord’s incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension are concerned, He is also the Spirit. Furthermore, all the riches of Christ that come to us as grace and enjoyment are also a matter of the Spirit.<p>From my youth, I learned to treasure the grace of God, but I had no idea what this grace is, or how this Spirit comes to us. Even at that time, however, grace came upon me day by day, and the Spirit was with me all the time. Second Timothy 4:22 says, “The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.’’ The Lord’s grace is simply the Lord being with our spirit.<p>This morning we feel happy and sweet while we are singing the hymns. This is because the Spirit of God is with us. This Spirit of God that is with us is grace. If your parents bother you, you can still sing and can still say “Hallelujah.’’ This is because grace is with you. If others praise you and commend your merits, you will not be proud. On the contrary, you can be humble and can have the full sense that you are glorifying God. This shows that the Spirit is present with you. This Spirit that is present with you is the grace. Whatever we could not do formerly but are able to do now is done through the presence of the Spirit, that is, through the presence of this instant grace.<h2 class=head2>The Riches of Christ Becoming the Bountiful Supply of This Spirit to the Believers</h2><p>The riches of Christ realized in the Spirit are the bountiful supply to the believers. Whatever we need is supplied to us in this bountiful Spirit. If we need God, this bountiful Spirit is God in us. If you think that your humanity is too poor, the Spirit within you will supply you with the humanity of Jesus. If you need patience, this Spirit will supply you with patience. If you need utterance, this Spirit will supply you with utterance. If you need joy or peace, this Spirit will supply you with joy and peace. These bountiful supplies are also the grace that continually supplies us within.<h2 class=head2>This Spirit Abiding in the Believers to Become One Spirit with Them, That They May Experience Christ and Live Him</h2><p>We have seen that this grace is a Person, and this Person is the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God is simply the reality of Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. In the end, what comes to us is the Spirit. When He is enjoyed by us, He becomes grace. Hence, the key today is the Spirit. He is not in our ears, or in our mind, but in our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, “He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.’’ This shows that the Spirit can become one spirit with our spirit. The end of this experience is that our whole being will become the grace of Christ, who is the all-inclusive and limitless One.<p>At the end of his Epistles, Paul often mentioned grace and peace being with us. We know that peace comes from grace, and grace is the Spirit that is present with us. Now this Spirit with His bountiful supply is in our spirit. Whenever we exercise our spirit and use our spirit, we can contact the Spirit, and we can experience the God of grace. We can also experience His all-inclusiveness and limitlessness. These are the riches of Christ that we enjoy.<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Quezon City, Philippines, on March 23, 1989)
