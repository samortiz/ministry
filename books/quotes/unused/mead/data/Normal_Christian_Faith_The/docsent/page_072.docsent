   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD NEVER CHANGES OUR LIVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Can we change the human life?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Never!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not only are we unable to change it; even God cannot change it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The life of man is like a sin factory that daily manufactures hundreds of products.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, in addition to the work of forgiveness, God had to deal with the source of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since He is not going to change our life, what basic solution did He provide to save us?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to look at the second aspect of His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 6:7: "For he who has died is justified from sin."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a man wants to be delivered from sin, the only way is for him to die.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He who has died is freed from sin; it is no longer possible for him to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I know a friend who had an insatiable appetite for card games.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Day and night he was obsessed by them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When he could not find partners for a game, he felt tormented beyond measure.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even when he did not have cards in his hands, he would feel better just looking at them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His whole life was governed by cards.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, he is dead now.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After he died, he no longer loved cards.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if you stuffed cards into his hands, he would not take them anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Death has delivered him from his cards.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consider another example of a very arrogant person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He boasts of everything about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no way to remove or suppress his pride.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One day he dies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the whole world gathered around him to eulogize and extol his glorious deeds, what would he do?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Would he still be proud of himself?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>DEATH DELIVERS US FROM SIN</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's salvation for man is death!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He who is dead is freed from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to see the verse that precedes the one we just read.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 6:6: "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to take a closer look at this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Greek word "annulled" has two meanings: one is unemployed; the other is paralyzed or crippled.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The idea of unemployment is stronger in this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, we can translate this as "that the body of sin might be unemployed."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>SIN, THE OLD MAN, AND THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There are three important agents in this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first is sin, the second is the old man, and the third is the body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sin is personified; it is a master.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This sin does not refer to individual sins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, it is a powerful lord that binds, entangles, and compels man to commit all of the particular sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Man becomes the slave to sin, being subject to such a tyrant and carrying out all its dictates.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Under ordinary circumstances, man does not feel too much pressure from this master.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the minute he makes up his mind to overcome it, he will find that no matter how much energy he summons, he can never succeed in overturning its power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more he tries to control his temper, the more he will lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sin is the master.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It forces man to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The old man mentioned in the Bible is our own person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Deep in man there is a love for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When temptation comes, man rejoices to hear its call and gladly succumbs to its sway.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is true that sin is a powerful agent, but when it is met by the old man, the result is an instant collaboration.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In such a setting, the two go about searching for an instrument and discover the body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The body is thus employed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They will either tell the eyes to look, the ears to listen, or the hands to move.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this way the body executes the order dictated by sin and seconded by the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sin is the director, the old man submits to its orders, and the body carries them out practically in the form of transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They agree with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The product of this collaboration is the multitude of sins that we commit.</S>
