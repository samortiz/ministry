[1]  The Advance of the Lord s Recovery Today CONTENTS
[2]  IN THE NEW TESTAMENT 1 Scripture Reading: Matt 3:1-4; Mark 1:1-4; Heb 10:1-4; Mark 1:5, 7-8; Rom 15:16; Rev 1:5b-6; 5:9-10; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; 1 Tim 1:16; Rom 12:1; Col 1:28-29
[3]  I am here on this earth to labor with the Lord and in the Lord so that He can recover the gospelizing by the New Testament priests of the gospel of God, the organic building up of His organic Body, the perfecting of all the common saints by the gifted persons, and all prophesying, speaking Christ into others for the building up of the church.
[4]  Let us look first at the present translation of this verse in our Recovery Version: That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.
[5]  Thus, a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations is a ministering priest of the gospel of God, a working priest of the gospel of God, an energizing priest of the gospel of God.
[6]  In the New Testament, two different Greek words are translated into the word priesthood.
[7]  In Hebrews 7:12 the priesthood refers to the priestly office or the priestly service.
[8]  The New Testament priests should not be individualistic, but they should be a corporate body of priests.
[9]  Fourth, God put man in front of the tree of life, indicating that God desired to have a man to receive Him as the tree of life so that man might live God.
[10]  Genesis 22 tells us that God eventually asked Abraham to offer his son Isaac as a burnt offering v. 2 . When Abraham was about to offer his son, God stopped him and provided a ram as a replacement for Isaac v. 13 . That ram was a type of Christ as our burnt offering for our acceptance by God.
[11]  Revelation 5:9-10 says that we were purchased to God by the blood of Christ out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and we were made priests to our God.
[12]  Revelation 20 tells us that in the millennium all the overcomers will be co-kings with Christ, and these co-kings of Christ will be the priests of God and of Christ who will reign with Him a thousand years v. 6 . Eventually, all the believers will participate in the priesthood for eternity in the New Jerusalem, in which we will serve Him as priests 22:3 . In the New Jerusalem, we shall also reign with Christ in the kingship 22:5 . The priests who compose the New Jerusalem will undoubtedly have the four characteristics of man in God s creation of man.
[13]  FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT TO THE NEW TESTAMENT IN JOHN THE BAPTIST
[14]  John s father was a priest named Zachariah, who was serving in the priesthood according to the Old Testament.
[15]  Elizabeth could not have a child, so Zachariah prayed for his wife to bear him a son, and the Lord heard him v. 13 . God performed a miracle by giving them a son whose name was John.
[16]  THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS The Qualifications of the Priesthood
[17]  As priests, we must also be persons very close to God.
[18]  We must be persons who are one with God, who know God s will, God s heart, and who receive God s oracle to speak for God.
[19]  A New Testament priest should be a person who lives Christ in His death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension.
[20]  In the New Testament, he taught much concerning our human spirit, and he used his spirit to contact God, to receive God.
[21]  This shows us that a New Testament priest should be a person in the experience of Christ s death and in the enjoyment of Christ s resurrection power.
[22]  I have told the saints that we need to come to the meetings with Christ, with the surplus of Christ, with the riches of Christ, to offer Christ to God.
[23]  In the past, we pointed out that the sacrifices we offer to God are Christ as the reality of all the sacrifices of the Old Testament types, our praises, and the things we do for God Heb 13:15-16; Phil 4:18 .
[24]  To tell out God s virtues is the preaching of the gospel of God s salvation in His virtues according to our experiences.
[25]  The sinners are offered to God in Christ, with Christ, and one with Christ as the very enlargement of Christ.
[26]  In order to function as priests of the gospel of God, we need to see what the gospel of God is.
[27]  In Romans 1:1, Paul said that he was separated to the gospel of God.
[28]  A minister of Christ Jesus is one who serves people with Christ.
[29]  He ministers Christ to people like a waiter in a restaurant serves people with food.
[30]  We may not consider that this chapter is the gospel, but Paul indicates that the entire book of Romans is the gospel of God.
[31]  Thus, the gospel of God comprises Christ, His redemption, our faith, our being redeemed, our being transformed, our becoming the members of Christ, how Christ s Body is constituted, and how His Body is expressed on this earth in many localities.
[32]  When we preach the gospel we make sinners the sons of God and the members of Christ, and we help them to grow so that they can be the active members in the practice of the Body life.
[33]  To serve God is to handle the gospel, and to handle the gospel is to preach the gospel in order that Christ might be imparted to others, dispensed to others, that others might become the members of Christ, that Christ s Body might be constituted, and that many local churches could be raised up for His Body to be expressed in many localities.
[34]  By doing this He made us, the sinners, on the one hand, the sons of the living God Gal 3:26 , and on the other hand, the members of the organic Body of Christ Rom 12:4-5 , which is the fullness of Christ as the very expression of the One who fills all in all Eph 1:22-23 .
[35]  The Triune God desired to be incarnated in the Son to be a man, to die on the cross to solve all the problems, and to enter into resurrection to produce the sons of God as the members of Christ who constitute the Body of Christ, which is the church to be expressed around the globe as the local churches.
[36]  To preach Christ until His Body is constituted and expressed in different localities that many local churches will be raised up is to preach the gospel of God, which equals God s New Testament economy.
[37]  In this chapter we want to see three crucial matters concerning the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament.
[38]  First, we need to see what it means to carry out the priesthood in the reality of the New Testament.
[39]  In the Gospel of John, Jesus the Son of God told us in chapter six that He is the bread of life v. 35 . As the bread of life, He said, He who eats Me shall also live because of Me John 6:57b . Christ is our food, and He is eatable.
[40]  In Romans 5 we are told that we are now in Christ, and in this Christ, who is our sphere and element, we have life.
[41]  In the New Testament, Christ is the dwelling place of God John 1:14; Col 2:9 , the church is the dwelling place of God Eph 2:21-22; 1 Cor 3:16 , and our spirit is the dwelling place of God Eph 2:22; 2 Tim 4:22 .
[42]  Included in this gospel are the three small, practical points of arranging Christ as the showbread, trimming the saints in the churches to make Christ shine through them with the sevenfold Spirit of God, and burning the incense in prayer to God.
[43]  To preach the gospel is to carry out God s New Testament economy, which is His all-inclusive gospel, and to carry out God s New Testament economy is to fulfill the New Testament priesthood, the priestly service.
[44]  The unique pattern of the priests of the gospel in the New Testament is the Apostle Paul 1 Tim 1:16 .
[45]  We need to see how Paul did his work as a priest of the gospel.
[46]  First, Paul saved sinners to offer them up to God as acceptable sacrifices Rom 15:16 .
[47]  Paul s announcing of Christ in Colossians 1:28 is to tell out Christ.
[48]  When we preach the gospel to them and they receive the Lord, they are transferred out of Adam into Christ.
[49]  When I am preaching the gospel to offer saved persons to God, I am offering Christ not the individual Christ but the corporate Christ.
[50]  In our daily life, we must impart God and dispense Christ into others to make them, the sinners, parts of Christ that we may present these parts as sacrifices offered to God for His good pleasure.
[51]  I present this one to God in Christ, with Christ, and as a part of Christ, as a spiritual sacrifice.
[52]  Warning and Teaching Every Saint in All Wisdom to Present Each One Full-grown in Christ
[53]  Because the believers are still not fully matured, there is the third step of Paul s gospel work in the New Testament priesthood.
[54]  This third step can be seen in Colossians 1:27-29: To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: whom we announce, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ; for which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power.
[55]  The Christ whom he announced is not that simple.
[56]  In Acts 20 Paul said that he taught the saints publicly and from house to house v. 20 . He also said that he admonished each one of the saints for three years night and day with tears v. 31 . Paul went to the homes of the saints to teach them and admonish them one by one.
[57]  The apostles who handle us, who serve us with Christ, desire to present us in Christ to God as parts of the corporate Christ.
[58]  When the priests in the Old Testament offered bulls and goats, they did not realize that these sacrifices typified Christ in His incarnation, in His human living, in His all-inclusive death, in His resurrection as life, in His coming to us as the life-giving Spirit to indwell us, in His ascension, and in His descension to be one with His saved ones and to make them one Body.
[59]  I do admit that the big preaching meeting did fulfill and still fulfills the purpose of saving sinners.
[60]  It fulfills the purpose of soul-winning, but it does not fulfill the purpose of God s economy.
[61]  It may be all right to practice preaching the gospel with big gospel meetings, but this depends upon whether our practice of preaching in this way annuls or develops the saints ability in preaching the gospel.
[62]  To tell the saints that we do not need to go out to preach the gospel and that all we need to do is bring all our new contacts together for a big gospel meeting is wrong because it annuls the saints function in preaching the gospel.
[63]  OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 1 Scripture Reading: John 15:1-5; Col 2:19; Eph 4:16; John 3:3, 5; 1 Cor 4:15; 1 Pet 2:2; Heb 6:5; 5:13-14; Eph 4:11-14
[64]  The first crucial item of the advance of the Lord s recovery today is the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament.
[65]  We have seen that we all need to be priests of the gospel of God.
[66]  We may think that it is easy to understand the organic building up of the Body of Christ, but actually this matter is difficult to define.
[67]  Since I began to share on the organic building up of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God beginning in August of 1988 see The Body of Christ published by Living Stream Ministry , I have listened to the testimonies and fellowship of the saints regarding this matter.
[68]  Many of the saints have the following concept of what the organic building up of the Body of Christ is.
[69]  The church is the issue of the dispensing Triune God, and this church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all to express the Triune God.
[70]  A person grows with the essence of the food that he takes in. Some may have pointed out that God grows in us in knowledge, but we need to see that God Himself essentially grows in us.
[71]  This essential increase of God in all of us is the growth of the Body of Christ, which is the building up organically of the Body of Christ.
[72]  When I first met a certain brother, I realized that he was short of God, but today I have the full realization that he has more of God in Christ as the Spirit.
[73]  The organic building up of the Body of Christ is the growth of the Body through the members of the Body growing into Christ, the Head, in all things Eph 4:15-16 .
[74]  The growth in life is the organic building, and the growth in life is our getting into Christ more and more.
[75]  Many of the young people love the Lord, but in many things they are still outside of the Lord.
[76]  A brother who has long hair and a beard like a hippie may love the Lord, but in the way that he keeps his hair and his beard, he is not in Christ.
[77]  Many sisters may have grown into Christ in many things, but in the matter of the way that they comb their hair, they have not grown into Christ.
[78]  In the previous chapter, we saw that the Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God, not an organization of human beings.
[79]  We also saw that the organic building up of the Body of Christ is the increase of the Triune God in the believers for their growth in Christ.
[80]  In this chapter we want to see more concerning this organic building up.
[81]  For the organic building up of the Body of Christ, we need to serve in an organic way by ministering Christ to others.
[82]  Furthermore, the Body of Christ is built up organically through the members of the Body feeding on the milk and food of the holy Word and through the saints being perfected by the gifts.
[83]  To build up the Body of Christ, the church of God, is to minister Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, essentially to people for their growth into Christ.
[84]  Christ in His essence is Spirit, and we must be filled up with this Spirit, the very essence of Christ.
[85]  Our ministering of Christ into others causes the increase of the essence of Christ within them for their growth in Christ.
[86]  The increase of the essence of Christ within the saints of a local church is the growth of this local church, and this is also the organic building up of this local church.
[87]  If we minister Christ to the saints, the saints in our locality will grow to build themselves up, and the totality of their being built up will be the organic building up of the Body of Christ.
[88]  The organic building up of the Body of Christ, the increase of the Triune God in the believers for their growth in Christ, is through the members of the Body feeding on the milk and food of the holy Word as the embodiment of Christ as the living Word of God.
[89]  In order for the Body of Christ to be built up organically, we need to feed on the milk and food of the holy Word.
[90]  The holy Word is the embodiment of Christ, and the embodiment of Christ is the living Word of God.
[91]  THROUGH THE SAINTS BEING PERFECTED EQUIPPED BY THE GIFTS THE GIFTED PERSONS
[92]  If we are being perfected by the gifted persons the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers we will grow.
[93]  Through our growth we will arrive at three things: at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a fullgrown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Eph 4:13 .
[94]  To arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God is to arrive at the oneness of truth and of life.
[95]  BY THE GIFTS Scripture Reading: Eph 4:11-12; 2 Tim 2:2; 1 Tim 3:2; 5:17; 1 Pet 5:1-3
[96]  In chapters three and four, we saw that the Lord desires to recover the organic building up of the Body of Christ.
[97]  The building up of the Body must be organic.
[98]  In His ascension, after He completed such a constitution of all the believers as God the Father s inheritance, God the Father gave all of us as an inheritance to His Son, Christ.
[99]  The gifts in Ephesians 4:8 are the gifted persons listed in verse 11.
[100]  Ephesians 4:11-12 says, And He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.
[101]  In these verses we see the perfecting of the saints by the gifts.
[102]  These persons are the particular gifts, the top gifts, that the Lord Jesus as the ascended Head in His ascension gave to His Body for the building up of His Body.
[103]  We need to realize, however, that these dear ones, these gifts, do not build up the Body of Christ directly.
[104]  Now we need to go on to see the function of the prophets.
[105]  The prophets speak for the Lord, speak forth the Lord, to dispense, impart, and minister Christ to others.
[106]  To prophesy is not mainly to foretell or to predict as they do in the Pentecostal movement.
[107]  The final category of gifted persons listed in Ephesians 4:11 is the shepherds and teachers.
[108]  The shepherds and teachers take care of the believers and teach the saints.
[109]  As we have pointed out, these gifted persons also perfect the saints to do the work that they themselves do.
[110]  The work of the ministry is organic to help the organic members of the Body of Christ to grow in Christ with the divine life and elements of the processed Triune God by enjoying Him as their nourishment.
[111]  We need to labor organically until all the members of Christ are mature in the full growth of the divine life and reach the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Eph 4:13 for the organic building up of the organic Body of Christ, the very embodiment of the processed Triune God.
[112]  The organic Body of Christ is the organism of the processed Triune God because Christ is the very embodiment of the processed Triune God.
[113]  We need to be perfected to do the work of the gifted persons.
[114]  Suppose that two families move to a city where there is no church life.
[115]  They may feel that they need to ask a gifted brother to come to set up the church for them because they are not apostles and do not know how to set up the church.
[116]  We may not be apostles, but we need to be perfected to do the apostles work.
[117]  If we are perfected in this way, we will know how to set up a church when we move to another locality.
[118]  We will know how to feed them, how to bring them into the group meetings, and how to bring them to meet with the saints as the church.
[119]  This kind of perfecting to enable the saints to do what the gifted persons do is God s ordained way.
[120]  We need to ask the Lord, Lord, lead me and guide me in using my time to fulfill the first item of the priesthood in getting sinners saved to make them the sons of God and the members of Christ.
[121]  AS THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:3, 24, 25, 4, 5, 31, 1, 39; Eph 4:12
[122]  The first three major points of the advance of the Lord s recovery today are the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament, the organic building up of the Body of Christ, and the perfecting of the saints by the gifts.
[123]  In this chapter we come to the last major point the prophesying for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ.
[124]  Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 3 that we build up the church with gold, silver, and precious stones v. 12 . Gold, silver, and precious stones signify the three main characteristics of the Triune God, and the embodiment of the Triune God is Christ Col 2:9 . Therefore, to speak building up is to speak Christ as the very material with which the church is built up.
[125]  Chapter one goes on to tell us that God has put us into Christ and made Christ wisdom to us from God.
[126]  First Corinthians 14 goes on to say that when the whole church comes together and all prophesy, a new one will be convicted by all and judged by all, having the secrets of his heart exposed vv.
[127]  He means that this is the way to bring people to Christ and to lead people to receive Christ, to take Christ.
[128]  But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all; the secrets of his heart become manifest; and so falling on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is really among you.
[129]  There are some predictions in the Epistles, but mainly they speak for Christ, speak forth Christ, and speak Christ into people, dispense Christ into people.
[130]  If we know the New Testament, whatever book or page we read, we will be impressed with the present Christ, the Christ today, the Christ this hour.
[131]  In the last chapter we saw that the fourth major item in the advance of the Lord s recovery today is the prophesying for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ.
[132]  Prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 is not in the sense of predicting but in the sense of speaking for the Lord and speaking forth the Lord to dispense Christ to people.
[133]  In this chapter we want to see three more crucial points related to prophesying: first, all the believers have the capacity and the obligation to prophesy; second, all the believers have been charged by the apostle to pursue, to desire earnestly, and to seek to prophesy; and third, in the Lord s advanced recovery, there is the need for the highest meetings of the church.
[134]  We can pursue, desire earnestly, and seek to prophesy by learning v. 31 in the Word of God, in the growth of life, and in our contact with God.
[135]  We need to enter into the biblical way, and we need to see what this biblical way is.
[136]  Then in time He sent His servants to call out His chosen ones, who become gifts to His church.
[137]  I am saying this to help us realize that all of us are gifts to the church, Christ s Body.
[138]  In this chapter we want to see how to carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel according to the Lord s up-to-date recovery.
[139]  This is the top point for building up the organic Body of Christ, and this will fulfill God s eternal plan according to His divine economy.
[140]  The function of the elders in the churches is absolutely necessary, but equal opportunity should be afforded to all the saints to speak in the meetings, to preach the gospel, to feed the new ones, to take care of the young ones, to perfect the saints, etc. In all things, opportunities should be afforded to each one of the saints equally.
[141]  To carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we first must get sinners saved through our preaching of the gospel by visiting them in their homes Luke 10:1-6; 19:1-6, 9-10; John 4:3-7 .
[142]  We also need to bring the believers under our care to the group meetings.
[143]  When we bring them to the group meetings, spontaneously they will participate in the fellowship, interceding, and mutual care with the saints.
[144]  In these group meetings, we can incite one another to love and good works, exhorting one another Heb 10:24-25 .
[145]  THAT THEY MAY DO THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY
[146]  To carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we have to perfect the saints that they may do the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ Eph 4:11-12 .
[147]  By growing in Christ, eventually we will arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, which is the Body of Christ, the expression of Christ.
[148]  According to our experiences and the study of the New Testament, we have found out that the group meetings occupy about eighty percent of the practical church life.
[149]  If there are no group meetings in our local church, our church life cannot be that practical, strong, and living.
[150]  The group meetings are also for us to participate in the fellowship, interceding, and mutual care with the saints.
[151]  In a group meeting, a brother may say, Saints, I must let you know that Brother So-and-so was in a car accident yesterday.
[152]  THE LORD S UP-TO-DATE RECOVERY 3 Scripture Reading: Luke 10:1-6; 19:1-6, 9-10; John 4:3-7; 1 Pet 2:5; 2 Tim 4:2; 1 Cor 9:22-23; Acts 5:42; John 21:15; 1 Thes 2:7; Rom 12:1; Heb 10:24-25 PRACTICING THE PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL
[153]  The New Testament revelation concerning the priesthood of the gospel is entirely different from the practice in Christianity.
[154]  Because the priesthood of the gospel is according to the divine, biblical revelation and not according to human thought, we have to receive it.
[155]  We are believers chosen by God, redeemed by Christ, and regenerated by the Spirit.
[156]  If we do not understand that our preaching of the gospel is the fulfilling of our priestly duty, we will only preach the gospel when we feel like it.
[157]  During the past four and a half years, I have been burdened to reconsider our way.
[158]  In my reconsideration, I was reminded of Brother Nee s fellowship with us in 1937 concerning the need to recover the church meeting of mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14.
[159]  He proposed that we put this kind of meeting aside and encourage all the saints to go out and preach the gospel on the Lord s Day.
[160]  To carry out God s New Testament economy, His eternal plan for the New Testament age, all of us who are His children should learn to exercise the capacities in the divine life He has given us.
[161]  If we say that we love the church, and our service is only to do something such as vacuuming the carpet for the Lord s Day morning meeting, this is to despise God s divine life, to annul the functions of God s divine life, to put aside all the abilities concealed in God s divine life.
