   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>CHAPTERS 2 16 6 THE SEVENTH CYCLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF ISRAEL S MISERABLE HISTORY Scripture Reading: Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>13:1 16:31</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The book of Judges records seven cycles of Israel s miserable history of forsaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In reading through these cycles in Judges, it is difficult to understand how someone as positive as Gideon could become so negative.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Between his success and his failure, it must have been that a demon entered him, because he forsook God and joined himself to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This principle can be seen even more in the case of Samson.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His birth was a miracle initiated by the appearing of the Angel of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Samson was in the bosom of his mother, he was sanctified to be a Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As he grew up, he was clean and pure according to God s ordination, and he was empowered by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Israelites were under the tyranny of the Philistines, the Spirit of God as the holy, economical Spirit came upon Samson, and he became powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, Samson s unique problem was in the matter of sex.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was not genuine in seeking for a spouse; rather, his contacting of women was just to indulge his lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He indulged his lust with a Philistine woman, with a harlot in Gaza, and with a woman named Delilah.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although he had been empowered by God, he was damaged and destroyed to the uttermost because of his indulgence in lust.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Shortly after I decided to give up my job and serve the Lord, I went to Shanghai to see Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He told me that in serving the Lord the brothers must learn the principle of not contacting a female, especially a young one, in private.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was deeply impressed by this, and from that time I have practiced Brother Nee s instructions and have also passed them on to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The sisters should clothe and cover their body in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Timothy 2:9 charges the sisters to adorn themselves in proper clothing with modesty and sobriety, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word proper denotes fitting to the sisters nature and position as saints of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Greek the word for clothing implies deportment, demeanor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A sister s demeanor, of which clothing is the main sign, must befit her saintly position.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word modesty means, literally, shamefastness, denoting being bound or made fast by an honorable shame Vincent , implying not forward or overbold but moderate, observing the proprieties of womanhood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word sobriety means sobermindedness, self-restraint; the restricting of oneself soberly and discreetly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The sisters in a local church should clothe themselves with these two virtues shamefastness and self-restraint as their demeanor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hebrews 13:4 says, Let marriage be held in honor among all, because through marriage mankind continues to exist on earth and is propagated to replenish the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God created a need and desire within man to be married.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A desire to be married is not sinful; on the contrary, it is according to God s ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the time to consider marriage is after graduation from college.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the brothers and sisters should consecrate to the Lord, giving themselves to Him and promising that they will live for Him and even live Him their entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then they should pray to see if there is the leading of the Lord in this matter, rather than trying to be too selective.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Keeping these items will be a great protection to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At this juncture, let us consider the details concerning Samson recorded in Judges 13:1 16:31.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE SEVENTH CYCLE A. Israel Again Doing That Which Was Evil</S>
