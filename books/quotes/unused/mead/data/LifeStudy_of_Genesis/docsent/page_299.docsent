   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b The Unveiling of the Divine Title</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 17:1 God came in to unveil His divine title, unveiling what He, the very God, is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To unveil a name is to unveil a person, for a name always represents a person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since God's divine title denotes His divine Person, the unveiling of the divine title is actually the revelation of the divine Person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1:1 God was unveiled as Elohim, which primarily means the Mighty One, the Strong One, and which is mainly related to God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Genesis 2 God was revealed as Jehovah, the great I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The name Jehovah means "I Am that I Am," implying that God is the self-existent and ever-existing One.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This title of Jehovah refers to God's relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, God revealed to Abraham that He was the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth 14:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is mainly related to God's care for His people's existence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But now in chapter seventeen, God comes in to unveil Himself further, revealing Himself to Abraham as El-Shaddai, the all-sufficient Mighty One with an udder.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's all-sufficiency is in His divine udder.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps some readers are unhappy with the use of the word udder and prefer that we use the word breast.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, if we were to use the word breast, most people would associate it with the matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the divine title in 17:1 denotes that God is the rich source of supply as grace to His people for them to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although He wants us to fulfill His purpose, He does not need anything from us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He wants to be our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our God has an all-sufficient source of supply, and this source is likened to an udder.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the meaning implied in the title El-Shaddai.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everything that is supplied to us from the udder of a cow comes into us and even becomes our constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All of the elements and ingredients of the riches of the milk we drink become our constituent, our organic tissue.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It seemed that God was saying to Abraham, "You have known Me as the Most High God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although that is wonderful, it is no longer adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am not only the Most High God to you objectively, but I want to be the divine milk to you subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I must be the One that you drink into your being."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our mind may be bothered at the thought of such a divine drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first time that I gave a message on the eating of Jesus was in 1958.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After that message, a very highly educated brother said to me, "Brother Lee, that message was very good, but the term 'eating Jesus' is too wild."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I replied, "Brother, I am not the first one to use this term.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In John 6:35 and 57 the Lord Jesus said, 'I am the bread of life' and 'He who eats Me shall also live because of Me.'"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are you troubled by the likening of God's rich breast to the udder of a cow?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although I would prefer to liken God to a nice, tender, gentle mother with a loving breast, it is more meaningful to liken God to a cow with a rich udder, as the Scripture implies.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all have been positioned under this divine udder.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many verses in the Bible give us the ground to speak of God in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Exodus 3:8 says, "I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The good land is a type of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With this Christ there is the flowing of milk.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before the children of Israel came into the good land to drink of the milk, they drank of the water that flowed from the riven rock which also was Christ Exo 17:6; 1 Cor 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Revelation 22 we see that in the New Jerusalem there will be a river flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we put all of these verses together, we can see that our God today is One out of whom something is flowing to quench, supply, and satisfy us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Regardless of whether we call it milk or living water, it flows out of God's being to supply us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, 1 Corinthians 12:13 says that we have all been made to drink of one Spirit, who is God Himself John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we are drinking of the Spirit, we are drinking of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our God is so rich that one type or symbol cannot give us a complete understanding of Him, so the Bible uses different types and symbols to reveal the various aspects of His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The milk and the living water both reveal how rich God is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The principle in each case is the same: that the riches of His divine being are flowing out to be our supply as grace to us for us to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all must drink of the rich supply that flows out from our God that we may be able to fulfill the divine purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>None of us is qualified to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although religion tells us that we must do certain things for God, what God wants us to do is to take Him in as our supply so that He may become our constituent and that we may become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible reveals that God's intention is to get into us and that we must eat and drink of Him, taking something of Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As we take into our being some element of His divine being, partaking of His divine nature, this divine element will work in and through us to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At the time of Genesis 17, God needed to reveal this divine title of His to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Genesis 16 Abraham did something not for his own purpose but for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, what Abraham did for the fulfilling of God's purpose was accomplished by his natural being and natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since he did something for God by his natural strength, God was displeased and disappeared from him for thirteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After that long absence, God came in and seemed to say, "Abraham, you must know that I am the all-sufficient One with an udder.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You must drink of the supply of this udder and not do anything for Me by your natural strength or natural ability.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Doing something for Me by your natural strength is an insult to Me. I don't want anything from you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I want you and I need you, but I do not want you to use your natural strength and natural ability to bring forth the promised seed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You must bring forth a seed by My supply.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Stop using your strength, deny your natural being, and put aside your natural ability.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Since I am the all-sufficient Mighty One, you should not do anything by yourself or apart from Me. Apart from Me, it is impossible for you to fulfill My purpose because apart from Me you can do nothing for My economy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Abraham, in order to fulfill My purpose, you must drink of the supply out of My udder and take Me in. I am not here now as the Most High God or as the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You have learned that already.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I am now here before you as El-Shaddai, the all-sufficient Mighty One with an udder out of which is flowing a rich supply for you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Abraham, you must walk before Me. This means that you must drink of My udder and live by Me." The Divine Word is deep, and we cannot understand it superficially.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must dive into it before we can see what is revealed there.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How good it is that God revealed Himself to Abraham as the Mighty One with an udder full of the all-sufficient supply for His people to fulfill His purpose.</S>
