   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Trying to Understand the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The biggest frustration to understanding the Bible is trying to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This thought may contradict our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may think that when we read the Bible, the purpose is to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is certainly nothing wrong with understanding the Bible, but trying to understand it is a great mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We simply need to read the Bible; we do not need to try to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The more we try to understand, the more we will not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are two main ways of coming to the Bible: the way of eating and the way of reading.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The way of eating, which we should practice especially in the morning, is to read and pray over a few verses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The way of reading, which we can practice in the afternoon or evening, is to read a few chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When coming to the Bible in the way of eating, we need to avoid exercising our mentality to understand what we read.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This kind of exercise is a frustration to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We simply need to come directly to the Bible and to God s presence by reading, praying, and pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not allow any kind of hindrance or distraction to come in. We simply need to read and pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many portions of the Bible are difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first seventeen verses of the New Testament, for example, are in this category.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, many Bible readers tend to skip the first seventeen verses of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, we should not skip over any portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not need to try to understand everything in the Bible; we simply need to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we finish reading through the Bible the first time, we should read it a second time, then a third and a fourth time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although we may not understand a portion the first time we read it, we may understand it the second or the third time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Also, we may not understand or receive any light from a portion at the time we read it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, we may receive light from that portion years after we read it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes light will come through a portion of the Word a few days after we read it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not know when the light will come.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the shining of the light, we are supplied and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Often while we are fighting against the devil, a strengthening supply will come from a portion of the Word that we read months or years before.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible is a wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We simply need to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether or not we understand as we read does not mean much.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some may argue that if understanding the Bible does not mean much, they do not need to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to read the Bible, but we do not need to try to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we try to understand, we often will not understand, but if we simply read, we cannot avoid understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as we read, we will understand something.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We will never read the Bible in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will always receive something spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What we receive does not depend on us or our effort.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we endeavor to understand something, we will be frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we read, what is given to us depends on the Lord and His timing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The timing is not in our hands but in His.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We simply need to build up a habit to daily and hourly read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then the Lord will send us the proper help of light, life, cleansing, killing, and resurrecting at the proper time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we practice to daily read and pray-read the Bible, we will see a positive change and much growth in life after only a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I hope that all the saints would practice this.</S>
