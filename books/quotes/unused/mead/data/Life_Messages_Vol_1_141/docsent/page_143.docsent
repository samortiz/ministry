   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN STRENGTHENED INTO THE INNER MAN GOD'S GOOD PLEASURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As human beings, made up of body, soul, and spirit, we need to understand more about our person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The body is not our person, but a vessel containing it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The spirit is not our person either, but an organ through which God may be contacted.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is the soul which is our person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order for us to adequately know our spirit, we must first distinguish these different parts of which we are comprised.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In referring to people, the Bible calls them souls.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"All the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls" Exo 1:5 means that there were seventy people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"There were added unto them about three thousand souls" Acts 2:41 means there were three thousand more persons with them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every person is a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From this we may infer that the soul is the person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the rich man in Luke 16 died, his body was buried, but his person still existed in Hades vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>22-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our human life, the self, is in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The body is the seat of bios, the physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Psuche, our person, is in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A CHANGE AT REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we are regenerated, this picture of the soul as our person and the spirit as the organ by which we contact God, changes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With the divine life coming into our spirit, another Person is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our existence becomes complicated, because the natural person in our soul is not in agreement with the Person in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a way regeneration is like getting married.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you are single, you make all the decisions according to your preference.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But once you have a husband, he may want the window open when you want it shut, or he may want you to go out with him when you want to stay home.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This same complication, of two persons with conflicting ways, arises in us as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our soul is the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our spirit, regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit, is the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is this second Person, the inner man, that is the object of God's good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In actuality, this Person is Jesus Christ, mingled with you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is God's delight.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The person in your soul is offensive and displeasing to God, but the One in your spirit is a sweet fragrance to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This mingling of the Holy Spirit with the human spirit is a mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The life that has come into us is divine and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>COPING WITH TWO PERSONS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How shall we take care of these two lives?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is the person in the soul to be nourished and beautified?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible calls him our old man and says that he has been crucified with Christ Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What we must do with this first person is to disregard him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the words of the Lord Jesus, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me" Matt 16:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To take up the cross means to stay there, where Christ has put us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Declare to the old man in the soul that he is on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then deny him by disregarding him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Does this mean that the soul is nullified?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The natural life in our soul has been crucified, but the functions of the soul still remain and are still useful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our soul still thinks and decides, loves and hates.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not our mind, emotion, and will which have been crucified, but rather the old man in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What has happened is that the soul is no longer the person, but an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now the spirit is the person, no longer only an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In our daily experience we find that part of the time we are persons in the soul and other times our person is in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While we are attending the meeting, we may be a person in the spirit, listening to God's Word, praying, and worshipping.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But after we get home, something our spouse does may annoy us, and again we become persons in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our irritation may last most of the night, making us sleepless.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we get up the next morning, we say to the Lord, "Forgive me, Lord, for my failure last night.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Cleanse me by Your blood."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once again we enjoy the Lord's presence and become a person in the spirit.</S>
