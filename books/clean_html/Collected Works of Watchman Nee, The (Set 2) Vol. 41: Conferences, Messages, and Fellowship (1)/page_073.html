<h2 class="head2">Dealing with the Soul</h2><p>First Thessalonians 5:14 mentions the consolation of those who are "weak," which in Greek literally means "little-souled." Those who are little-souled are the ones who are psychologically weak. Some people have a strong soul, while others have a weak soul. The rest have an "average" soul. Just as the human body varies in size from one person to another, man's soul also varies in size. It is not easy for a man to be balanced. He tends to be either strong-souled or little-souled. Those who are strong-souled think that they have the strength to do many works. They are full of self-confidence. Those who are weak-souled have no self-respect. They are afraid of everything and are withdrawn. Both kinds of people are wrong and are of little use in the hand of the Lord. God can only use those who have a will, feelings, and are sensitive, but who have no self-consciousness.</p><p>In Shanghai there is a brother with a little soul and a big heart. In the prayer meetings, he prays long prayers and loves to say, "Holy, holy, holy," in his prayer. This kind of person will never change unless he experiences the outpouring of the Spirit. Those with a strong soul tend to despise those with a weak soul because weak-souled ones appear to be unresponsive and fragile. The strong-souled ones are the opposite. We should not criticize others. We should only deal with our own weaknesses. Those who are little-souled lack power in their soul and cannot accomplish much. However, those with a strong soul work by the power of their soul rather than by the power of the spirit. For these reasons, neither kind can work for the Lord. If we do not deal with this matter properly, we will not be able to experience the resurrection life. There are several famous evangelists in China who are strong-souled men.</p><p>Those with a strong soul need the cross to break down their strongholds. Those with a weak soul need the outpouring of the Spirit to make up what they lack. Little-souled ones need to read 1 Corinthians 12 to 14. They should seek for the outpouring of the Spirit so that their lack can be filled up. In order to become a suitable vessel of the Lord, we have to deal with our soul. A preacher can be tall or short in physical stature and speak just the same. However, if his soul is too big or too small, he will have a problem. A worker must first deal with himself in this matter. He must also consider the factors mentioned above when he assigns responsibilities to local brothers. We tend to appoint people with a strong soul because they exhibit their talent more readily. Yet such people must be dealt with by the cross before they can engage themselves in spiritual works. Those with a small soul must receive strengthening from the Spirit. Otherwise, they will not work. The best kind of people are those who are balanced, but such people are hard to find. This is a great matter, and we have to handle it carefully.</p><p>There are two co-workers in Chekiang. Most people agree that they are little-souled ones. Someone asked me once how I felt about them. I agreed that they were little-souled. Others would be stirred up, but they would still be cold. Others would come up with some ideas, but they would find it hard to follow. Yet both of them have an excellent spiritual life. Once they came to me and said that they wanted to quit. I asked, "Who do you think are the ones who can have great achievements and accomplish great works in China?" They answered, "Those who are strong-souled." I then asked them to read 1 Corinthians 12 through 14 and charged them to seek after the outpouring of the Spirit. Little-souled ones should not be discouraged; they should pray earnestly to the Lord for the filling of the Spirit. On the one hand, we should not entrust matters to the little-souled ones too quickly. Rather, we should wait until they have received the outpouring of the Spirit. On the other hand, we should realize that strong-souled ones must go through the dealing of the cross.</p><p>You will know if you have a strong soul or a weak soul if you humble yourselves and ask others about it. You will know your lack. If we do not deal with this matter properly, God's work will suffer much loss. This is truly a serious problem. I hope that the workers will have a thorough dealing with the Lord concerning this matter.</p><p>The cross deals with the negative things. It deals with what a man already has. The Spirit deals with the positive things. It deals with what a man does not have. Few people like the little-souled ones; everyone tends to love the strong-souled ones. Yet the latter soon tire people out. Little-souled ones are exactly the opposite. Others do not like them at the beginning, but they become likable after a while. Many people boast about the strong-souled ones and feel sorry for the little-souled ones, but if a little-souled one is perfected, he may become more useful than a strong-souled one.</p><h2 class="head1">QUALIFICATIONS OF A CO-WORKER</h2><p>In order to be a co-worker of God, there are at least eight qualifications. One must (1) be saved, (2) be victorious, (3) have power, (4) be called, (5) have gifts, (6) have a ministry, (7) have dealt with all the negative things mentioned above, and (8) know the Body life and not be divisive. In order to work for the Lord, a man must be dealt with by the cross and be filled with the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">OTHER POINTS</h2><p>Our testimony today is an extension and continuation of the apostles' testimony; it is not a new testimony. Hence, strictly speaking, we should not call anyone our brothers.</p><p>In the Body of Christ, the affair of one member is the affair of the whole Body. This is like eating, seeing, and hearing. When the mouth eats, the whole body eats; when the eyes see, the whole body sees; and when the ears hear, the whole body hears. During this conference, we have only covered the experience of Galatians 2:20 and 2 Corinthians 12:9. There are many more riches in His Word than what we have covered. For this reason, we should all have the proper ambition to keep on pursuing. We should not have any ambition for the things and people of the world, but we should have a healthy ambition for God. Unless a person is dealt with by the Lord daily and seeks after the Lord personally, he cannot deal with others or help others.</p><h2 class="head1">A PRAYER</h2><p>Lord, forgive me for pointing out the attitudes, shortcomings, lack, and weaknesses of others. May I not be reproached that day at Your judgment seat by my reproach of others today. May my judgment today not become a judgment on me on that day. Lord, cover me with Your precious blood.</p>
