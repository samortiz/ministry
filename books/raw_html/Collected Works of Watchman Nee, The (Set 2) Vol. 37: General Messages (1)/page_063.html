<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">THE ARK&mdash;</h1><h1 class="title">THE CENTER OF THE TABERNACLE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 25:10-22</h1><p>The ark occupies a very important place in the Bible. When God ordered Moses to build the tabernacle, the ark was the first thing that was mentioned. On the day the tabernacle was erected, the altar for the burnt offering and the laver were in the outer court, and the lampstand, the table, the showbread, and the golden incense altar were in the Holy Place. But in the Holy of Holies there was only the ark (Exo. 40:17-33). God met with man upon the ark and spoke with man from the midst of the cherubim upon the mercy seat on the ark. Hence, the ark is the center of the tabernacle, and it occupies a very important position.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>Let us first consider the name of the ark. In Exodus, it is called the ark of the testimony; it does not say the ark of the covenant. The ark of the testimony means that God's testimony was among the Israelites. Wherever the ark was, God was there also. The presence of the ark proved the presence of God's law. In Numbers, the ark is given another name, "the ark of the covenant" (10:33; 14:44). This means that the ark was related to the covenant. Wherever the ark was, the covenant was there also. In 1 Samuel, we see another name, "the ark of God" (4:11, 13, 17, 19, 21-22). Wherever the ark was, God was there also. The ark represented God. When the ark was with the people, it meant that God was with His people.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>What does the ark typify? The ark typifies the Lord Jesus. The ark was within the tabernacle, which typifies that God is with man. The coming of the Lord Jesus is the presence of God among men. He is Emmanuel (Matt. 1:23). Wherever He went, God was there. In the Old Testament, the ark was in the Holy of Holies. Today Christ is in the heavenly Holy of Holies (Heb. 8:1-2). When God ordered the Israelites to make the tabernacle, the first thing He mentioned was the ark. This signifies that the Lord is the center of everything. The ark was built with acacia wood and covered with gold within and without. Acacia wood is a very hard wood; it typifies the humanity of the Lord. Gold in the Bible signifies God's righteousness, glory, and all His attributes. Hence, gold typifies the Lord's divinity. The Lord Jesus is both God and man. With Him there is both divinity and humanity.</p><p>Upon the ark, which was two and a half cubits by one and a half cubits by one and a half cubits, there was a mercy seat. The mercy seat covered the ark and was made of pure gold. Its length and width were the same as the ark. Two cherubim wrought of gold were placed on the two ends of the mercy seat. They stretched their wings and covered the mercy seat. The cherubim had their faces toward each other and were over the mercy seat. (Cherubim signify the manifestation of God's glory&mdash;Ezek. 9:3; Heb. 9:5.) God told Moses: "And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel" (Exo. 25:22). From then on, God directed the Israelites in their walk and work from the place of the ark. The mercy seat in the Old Testament signifies the place that God dispenses His grace. In the New Testament, all of God's grace is dispensed to us through Christ. Leviticus 16 tells us that the high priest brought the blood of animals into the Holy of Holies every year on the seventh month when he offered up the sacrifice of the sin offering and sprinkled blood upon the mercy seat. In the same way, the Lord accomplished redemption, and His blood declares before God that the work of redemption is finished and that God must forgive our sins. Simply put, the ark typifies Christ; it typifies God's dispensing grace to us through Christ. When we have Christ, we have God's presence, and through Christ, we receive God's leading.</p><p>There were four golden rings upon the four feet of the ark, and two staves made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold were placed through the rings in order to carry the ark. The staves were to be inside the rings all the time and were not to be taken out. This meant that the ark could be moved at any time. This shows us two functions of the ark. On the one hand, it was the center of worship to God. The ark was placed in the Holy of Holies, which was the place where God met with man. In order to worship God, one had to go to the ark. Without the ark, there could be no worship. On the other hand, the ark was the direction to God's people. When the ark moved forward, the people followed (Num. 10:33; Josh. 3:3). The Israelites could not go as they pleased. They could only go where the ark directed them to go. This shows us that Christ is the One who directs us to the proper way.</p><p>How was the ark carried? Numbers 4:5-6 says, "And when the camp is to set out, Aaron and his sons shall go in and take down the veil of the screen, and cover the ark of the testimony with it; then they shall put a covering of porpoise skin over it, and spread over that a cloth all of blue, and they shall place its poles in it." Every time the ark was about to move, three things covered it. First, the veil that separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies was taken down and laid on it. Second, a covering of porpoise skin was used to cover it. Third, a cloth all of blue was used to cover it. The moving of the ark signifies the time for the proclamation of Christ. The veil signifies the body of Christ (Heb. 10:20). Now the veil is rent, which means that the Christ we proclaim has become an approachable Lord. The ark was also covered with porpoise skin. Porpoise skin looks ugly on the outside. This signifies the Lord's humiliation and rejection. The ark was also covered with a cloth all of blue. In the Bible, white signifies righteousness, gold signifies glory and anything divine, purple signifies authority, while blue signifies heavenliness, because the sky is blue. This shows us that the Christ we follow is, on the one hand, outwardly uncomely like the porpoise skin; He was rejected by men. But on the other hand, He was like a cloth all of blue, heavenly and acceptable to God. In short, the Christ we proclaim is an approachable Lord, a rejected Lord, yet a Christ who is acceptable to God.</p>
