   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of the Obedience and Submission to God</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>and the Breaking of the Outer Man</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may have obeyed God, but we may never have submitted to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must have the experience of obedience and submission to God and the breaking of our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>19.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Of the Knowing and Experiencing</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a great lesson for us to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>20.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Of the Church Life in a Locality</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many Christians do not have a local church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must have the experience of the church life in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>21.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Of the Practice</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>of the God-ordained Way in Its Four Steps</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The practice of the God-ordained way in its four steps should be our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first step is to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To preach the gospel is to get sinners saved to be members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The second step is to nourish and feed the new believers in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The third step is to perfect the saints through the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we do not say small group meetings, but group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word small is not needed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, the group meetings should not be that small.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The home meetings may be small, with two or three persons taking care of a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the group meetings should take care of a group of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The fourth and last step of the God-ordained way is prophesying in the church meetings for the building up of the church, consummating in the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should endeavor to build up the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, this building up will consummate in the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>22.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Of the Watchfulness and Readiness</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>for the Pre-tribulation Rapture and</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>the Expectation and Preparation</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>for the Secret Appearing of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>as the Morning Star</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For the practice of prophesying, we should have the experience of the watchfulness and readiness for the pre-tribulation rapture and the expectation and preparation for the secret appearing of the Lord as the morning star.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The morning star appears before the sun rises.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must get ourselves ready for the secret appearing of the Lord as the morning star.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should endeavor to learn all of the foregoing items of truth and the experiences of life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This learning will enrich our speaking, and we will prophesy in the heavens, from the heavens, and with the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To gain all of these items requires time and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But we should not be disappointed; rather, we should be encouraged and burdened to get into all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In a sense, all of these items are like subjects in graduate school.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the 1940s I was working in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One of my former classmates, who was a Christian, came to stay with me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He told me that if someone were to meet with us for four years, he would have a degree in theology.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This should be our situation in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to learn all the truths and the experiences of life enumerated in this message.</S>
