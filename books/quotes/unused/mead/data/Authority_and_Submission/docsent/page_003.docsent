   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ALL DISPUTES IN THE UNIVERSE BEING A MATTER OF AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The center of dispute in the whole universe relates to who has the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to contend with Satan by asserting that authority is with God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to set ourselves to submit to God's authority and to uphold God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must meet God's authority face-to-face and have a basic realization of it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before Paul realized authority, he wanted to eradicate the church from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But after he met the Lord on the way to Damascus, he realized that it was difficult to kick against the goads God's authority with his feet man's energy .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He immediately fell down, acknowledged Jesus as Lord, and submitted to the instruction of Ananias in Damascus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul met God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At his conversion, Paul was brought not only into a realization of God's salvation, but also into a realization of God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul was an intelligent and capable man, while Ananias was a very insignificant, small brother.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible refers to him only once.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If Paul had not met God's authority, how could he possibly have listened to the words of Ananias?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Unless a man meets authority on the way to "Damascus," he cannot submit to an insignificant, small brother in "Damascus."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows us that anyone who has met authority will deal with the authority alone; he will not deal with the person involved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should only think of the authority, not of the person, because our submission is not to a person but to God's authority in that person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If this is not our attitude, we do not know what authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we deal with the person before submitting to authority, we are completely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we touch the matter of authority first and then submit to the person, irrespective of who he is, we are on the right path.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has only one goal in the church, which is to manifest His authority in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can see God's authority from the coordination in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God exercises the utmost of His strength to uphold His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His authority is stronger than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We who are so self-confident, but who are in reality so blind, have to come face-to-face at least once with God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only when we are broken can we come into submission.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we will begin to learn what God's authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only when a man meets God's authority will he submit to the deputy authority whom God appoints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE GREATEST DEMAND IN THE BIBLE BEING SUBMISSION TO GOD'S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The greatest demand God has on man is not bearing the cross, offerings, consecration, or self-sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's greatest demand on man is submission.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God commanded Saul to smite the Amalekites and utterly destroy all that they had 1 Sam 15:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But after Saul overcame the Amalekites, he spared Agag the king of Amalek.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He also appreciated the best sheep, the best oxen, and all that was good and refused to destroy them, hoping instead to offer them as sacrifices to God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>7-9, 14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But Samuel said to him, "To obey is better than sacrifice,/And to heed, than the fat of rams" v. 22 . The sacrifice spoken of here is the burnt offering; it has nothing to do with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is for God's acceptance and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, Samuel said that to heed and to obey are better than sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is because even in this kind of sacrifice there was the possibility of a mixture with the self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only in heeding and obeying is there an absolute honoring of God and an exaltation of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Obedience is the other end of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to have obedience, one must first keep the self out of the picture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One must not try to obey with the self.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There the possibility of obedience only by living in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Obedience is the highest expression of response to God's will.</S>
