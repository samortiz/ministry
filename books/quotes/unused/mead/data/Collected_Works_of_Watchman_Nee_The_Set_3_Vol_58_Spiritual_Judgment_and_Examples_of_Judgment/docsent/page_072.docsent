   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 52 Date:September 3, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER O. J.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I heard the story of Christ and His cross and was moved to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I attended a revival meeting in Canton, I experienced a great change and saw the importance of saving souls.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I quit my job as a teacher and accepted the invitation of a denomination to be their woman preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At one point I felt uneasy in the denomination where I was, and I left.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In April of this year, two brothers introduced me to Brother Nee and allowed me to come to the training.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The training makes me realize that the standard is very high.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am afraid that I will not be able to meet the standard, and I am somewhat discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yet I do not want to return empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once, I heard the story of Absalom and was touched to commit myself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I subsequently was revived in soul and body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My locality does not have any co-worker or local church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May the Lord send someone there to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our sister has one merit: She is more disciplined in her character than most young people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A young person can boast of knowledge and gift, but he cannot boast of the character that is formed in him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After we live with a person for a long time, we spontaneously pick up the idiomatic expressions and gestures of that person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Similarly, if a man yields to the Lord, he will be conformed to the Lord in godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He will be like Him in character, and he will be built up in his disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A young person cannot match an older one in character.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many young people are raw, hard, bitter, and caustic in their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I hope that the shining of God's great light will yield greater results, not merely general results in your character.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose a man waits for heavy rainfall to come yet only has a small cup or spoon to contain it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Would that not be a joke?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The same can be said of spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When God wants to give to man, man should open his mouth wide.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He should stretch his capacity for God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the Holy Spirit works, every vessel should be full.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should ask God to increase our capacity so that we can be fed and our thirst fully quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When God grants us grace, we experience wonderful days.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But unless God grants us grace, it is not easy for us to receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, when God gives, we should increase our capacity to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He will fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should be like the woman in 2 Kings 4, who went out to borrow more empty vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the vessels she borrowed were filled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When she stopped borrowing, God stopped filling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only then did God's oil cease.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can tell the Lord, "Give me what I need today, and even give me what I do not need today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Give me what I can take today, and even give me what I cannot take today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Give me what I can understand today, and even give me what I cannot understand today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Give me everything."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the principle of borrowing vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God will fill us beyond our own measure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord's word will create the need and satisfy us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His word is full of light and will produce an earnest desire in man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Chinese produce goods only when there is a demand for them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But Americans produce goods first and then create a market by demonstrating their usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not pray according to man's need, but according to God's riches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should ask for things that we do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the meaning of increasing our capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In working for the Lord, a worker has to learn to diagnose man's condition with his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some people only need to speak five minutes, and we know whether or not they are even a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once we have the experience of salvation, we know how to discern the genuineness of salvation in others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is useless for a doctor merely to prescribe medicine to others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He must know a patient's sickness and find the cause of this sickness before he can write the prescription.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You have to start learning while you are in the training here on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After you leave the mountain, you have to exercise your observation, pray and consider before the Lord, and listen more to God's speaking in you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you do this, you will have a good knowledge and a firm understanding of men in another ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But unless you practice this, you will not be able to know men even after ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The knowledge of men does not come as an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some people know men by exercising their natural discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is not how we know men.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we try to know men by exercising our natural discernment, we will suffer great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have no intention of minding other people's business or of criticizing them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For the sake of helping them, however, we have to learn to know them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are not here to gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A doctor does not seek to know a sickness for the purpose of talking about it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He speaks of it for the purpose of curing it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The work of a doctor is to discern, not to criticize, to heal, not to nitpick.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May the Lord help us to learn our lessons first.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then we will know men and be able to help solve their problems.</S>
