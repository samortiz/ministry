   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN THE CROWD OR IN THE UPPER ROOM?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, great crowds followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Multitudes were saved and healed, and multitudes received the favor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eventually, however, there were only about one hundred and twenty in the upper room.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The crowds, the multitudes, did not afford the Lord Jesus anything for His move.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord's move was with those in the upper room, with those whose eyes had been opened and whose hearts had been touched.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This small number came into the upper room to be burned, and then they turned the whole world upside down.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The principle is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is a small number who will turn the world and change the age.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you intend to be in the crowd or in the upper room?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Will you remain one of the multitude, or by the Lord's mercy will you come into the upper room?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I do not know who you are.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only the Lord knows who will be in the upper room.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I would urge you to pray to receive the Lord's mercy that you might be in the upper room.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are not willing to come here, then what you have read in these chapters will have nothing to do with you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then you will be like those in the crowds, those the Lord did not count on.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you would be in the upper room, you need to pray in a specific way and say, "Lord, I am willing to be in the upper room for the recovery of Your testimony."</S>
