   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIFTY-EIGHT EATING AND MANNA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the manna in the golden pot 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>EATING, A BASIC MATTER IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we would understand what the hidden manna, the manna in the golden pot, is, we must understand a basic concept in the Bible, a concept which most Christians have not grasped.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After God created man, He did not do anything with him, nor did He charge him to do anything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Genesis 1 and 2, the basic requirement for living in the presence of God is to eat properly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What matters the most in God s presence is what and how we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, in the Bible eating is a basic concept concerning our relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has created everything, including man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If He can make the heavens and the earth and billions of items, what is there that He cannot do?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He can easily do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, there is even no need for Him to do anything, for He just speaks and what He desires comes into being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, there is one thing which God cannot do He cannot eat for us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although a mother may do many things for her children, she cannot eat for them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The children must eat for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As far as our relationship with God is concerned, the basic matter is eating properly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>EATING FOR THE SUPPLY OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AND FOR REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Genesis 2, man s eating was a matter of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After man fell, God came in to redeem him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when God brought in redemption in Exodus 12, the eating was changed to include more than just the one item, the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eating was no longer simply to have the supply of life; it was also related to redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Exodus 12 the children of Israel were instructed to eat a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The tree of life is of the vegetable life, and a lamb is of the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While there is no blood with a tree, there is blood with a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Bible, blood is for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the time of the exodus, the children of Israel struck the blood that they might be redeemed and they ate the lamb that they might have the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the first stage, eating was only for man s life supply, but in the second stage, eating was for both redemption and the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>EATING THE LORD S FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>AND DRINKING HIS BLOOD</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During the years in the wilderness, the children of Israel ate manna.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since there certainly was no blood in the manna, the eating of manna was unrelated to redemption; it was altogether for the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How could the children of Israel, who wandered in the wilderness for forty years, continue to live and move?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They lived and moved by the supply of manna which they ate every day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In chapter six of John, the Lord Jesus said, I am the bread of life v. 35 . This troubled the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then the Lord said, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves v. 53, Recovery Version . In this chapter the Lord firstly said that He was the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then He said that we must drink His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How could the bread have blood in it?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This bread is not only the bread of the vegetable life but also the meat of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In John 6:51 the Lord said, The bread which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The bread is of the vegetable life and is only for feeding; the flesh is of the animal life and is not only for feeding but also for redeeming.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before the fall of man, the Lord was the tree of life Gen 2:9 , only for feeding man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After man fell into sin, the Lord became the Lamb John 1:29 , not only for feeding man, but also for redeeming him Exo 12:4, 7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE NEED TO KEEP EATING</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I want to say again that after the creation of man and even in God s redemption of man, the basic concept regarding our being in the presence of God is this matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, we must devote our complete attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not try to learn so many things just continue to eat well in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I was a Christian for over thirty years before I knew anything about eating in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I was never taught about this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many of us can testify that before we came into the church, we were never told that we could eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But from beginning to end, the Bible covers the matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible begins and ends with the eating of the tree of life Rev 2:7, 22:1-2,14 .</S>
