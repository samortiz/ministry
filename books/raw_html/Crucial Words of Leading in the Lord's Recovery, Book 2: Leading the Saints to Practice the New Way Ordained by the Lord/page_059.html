<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY BENEFITTING<br />
THE WHOLE BODY</h2>
<p>In human society typically many things are not discussed in public meetings but privately in small gatherings. The private discussions are then followed up by public meetings. This should not be our practice in the church life. In the church, matters should be discussed and fellowshipped by everyone in public meetings and not discussed in private fellowships. For over fifty years we have been paying attention to and leading the saints into this practice; nevertheless, at present this matter has not yet been adjusted among us.</p>
<p>It is not proper for us to have our private fellowships and then announce our private decisions in the meetings or present our private decisions as an order. It is wrong for only a few people to make decisions for everyone and for the majority not to have much knowledge about the matters at hand and to be in the passive position of receiving orders. This is altogether wrong because this is not the Body. Similar to our physical body, it is not proper for four or five members in private fellowships apart from the Body to make decisions for the Body. Any private fellowships apart from the fellowship of the Body are improper.</p>
<p>If someone desires to discuss matters privately in order to avoid revealing secrets, this is a great mistake. In the Body there should not be the need to keep secrets; when there is a secret in the Body, it is a cancer. A cancer is produced when a group of &ldquo;cells&rdquo; gather by themselves to keep a secret. In the end they become a cancer. Hence, in the church life we need to avoid keeping secrets. Do not be afraid that others would know something, because we are not organizing a political party; we are in the church. Almost every nation in the world has two, three, or four political parties that are always involved in intrigue against one another. Even a great democratic country such as the United States is no exception. In contrast, we need to see that there are no parties among the churches. There is only one church, one Body. As we are serving in different localities, there should be no distinction between Taipei and Taichung. We are one church expressed in every place as the one Body.</p>
<p>There is nothing that cannot be made public among us. We should not be afraid that others know of our affairs. For instance, all the churches should be able to know about the affairs of the church in Taipei. The advantage is that the other churches can pray for the church in Taipei. Recently, we completely &ldquo;dissected&rdquo; the church in Taipei. At the time, it was as if the church in Taipei was put on an operating table; after being dissected, it was sewn back up. Not only did the church survive, it became even more living and healthy than before. Whether the church is in Kaohsiung, Tainan, or Taichung, nothing should be hidden; rather, everything can be completely displayed. For instance, in the past because the church in Taichung had a need, it had the courage to tell us that the church in Taipei should not take care of only itself. Likewise, the church in Tainan had similar fellowship concerning its need. This is good because it proves that we do not have private fellowships among us. Through open fellowship, all of us are able to see the needs of the churches. This is the lesson we all need to learn.</p>
<p>According to the intention of the elders of the church in Taipei, originally they felt that there was no need to ask so many halls to fellowship regarding their condition; instead, they wanted to choose only good halls and good districts to give their testimonies. This kind of attitude is to report the good news and conceal the bad news. To exhibit only the nice things is similar to inviting people to our house and allowing them to sit only in the living room while preventing them from entering the bathroom. When we go to someone&rsquo;s house, if we see only the living room, it is difficult to determine whether the house is neat and clean; in order to determine whether the house is neat, clean, and orderly, we need to take a look at the bedrooms, kitchen, and bathrooms. Hence, in leading the church, we should not be afraid to reveal the true condition of the church for fellowship; this will help us to know what needs to be improved and strengthened.</p>
<p>Concerning the work with the students, we first need to study the college work and then work with the high school and junior high students. Every church involved with the students&rsquo; work should fellowship with one another to learn from one another&rsquo;s practices. If some have been warned or admonished due to their mistakes, we can receive help from them. In this way we will all receive the blessing. During fellowship, we need to try to speak without giving any opinion. For example, if we are studying the college work, and someone working with high school students speaks up, this may only be an opinion. His fellowship, however, may not be an opinion if it is confined to the issue under discussion. Through fellowship, we will receive both the burden to pray and the revelation. When we listen to others&rsquo; fellowship, we need to realize that we are being placed on the altar to be slaughtered so that the entire Body may reap the benefit.</p>
