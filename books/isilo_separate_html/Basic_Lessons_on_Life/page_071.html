In the previous lesson we saw four things related to the sense of the spirit: life, law, peace, and death. Now we want to talk about the consciousness of these four things and about how to know the spirit by the sense of the spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. CONSCIOUSNESS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Of Life</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Higher the Life,<br>the Richer Being Its Consciousness</H2><P>Life has its own consciousness; it has its own sense. The higher the life is, the richer its consciousness is. The plant life is the lowest life, so it has nearly no consciousness. Then in the animal life there are different levels of consciousness. The consciousness of life on different levels differs according to the standard of life. Our human life is higher than the animal life, so the human life has a richer consciousness. The divine life, of course, has the richest consciousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Divine Life Being the Highest Life<br>with the Richest Consciousness</H2><P>Among all the different lives, the divine life is the highest, so it has the richest consciousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. This Life within Us Causing Us to Be Full<br>of Spiritual Consciousness, Enabling Us to Sense the Spirit and the Things of the Spirit</H2><P>The divine life in us causes us to be full of spiritual consciousness. The more we are filled with this divine life, the more we are filled with spiritual consciousness. This enables us to sense the spirit and also to sense the things of the spirit. This is the consciousness of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Of the Law of Life</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Law of a Conscious Life<br>Belonging to the Realm of Consciousness</H2><P>The law of life is not a law of something that has no consciousness, but it is the law of a conscious life. Thus, it belongs to the realm of consciousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Law of the Spirit of Life<br>Being Full of Consciousness</H2><P>The law of the Spirit of life is something in the sphere of consciousness and is full of consciousness.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_070.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_072.html">Next</a> </body></html>
