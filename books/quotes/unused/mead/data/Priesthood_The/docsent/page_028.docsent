   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Showbread</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although we cannot cover all the offerings, let us illustrate what the showbread means to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The showbread is one of the foods for the priests, and we have seen that it signifies Christ as our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To handle Christ as the showbread and to minister Him to others, we must first enjoy and feed on Him as the showbread.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that we must experience Christ as the inner life and the life supply by feeding on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not many Christians know how to feed on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all must learn to feed on Him, to take Him in, and to enjoy Him as our spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we minister Christ to others, we also feed ourselves with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While we are feeding others, we are fed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every time I minister, the first one to be fed is myself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the ministry, I am satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am satisfied by my ministering of Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Trespass Offering</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Another example is the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The whole trespass offering was to be eaten by the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that when we minister Christ as the Savior to a lost person, not only will the person be saved, but we will also be fed with Christ while we are ministering Him in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By doing this we enjoy Christ within.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While we are ministering Christ to others, regardless in what aspect, we are fed and we enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some brothers have told me, Brother Lee, we cannot stop preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not minister Christ to the sinners, we are hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Their spiritual food was the very Christ whom they ministered to others as the trespass offering!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are lazy and do not go out to reach others, we are hungry within.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when we go out to minister Christ to others as the trespass offering, we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After we return home, we have the sense that we are really full.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the way to eat Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We handle Christ as the trespass offering for others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Christ as the trespass offering becomes the Savior to others, He becomes the food to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is our food?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It must be Christ, not a Christ in doctrine or teaching, but Christ in our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ ministered to others as the trespass offering will be their Savior and our food.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is also true with the sin offering, the peace offering, and the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I cannot elaborate on all the items, but the principle is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more we handle Christ and minister Him to others, the more we feed upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot minister an objective Christ, but One who is so subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He as our merchandise is also our food, for we must eat what we sell.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more I speak about Christ, the more I am satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If this is not true, then I am a false minister.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more I talk with you about Christ and present Christ to you, the more I feed on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While I am ministering Him, I am feeding on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is so subjective to me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am not selling Christ by my thinking mind, but by my enjoying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is my food.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nothing is so subjective to us as food.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The food we eat becomes our very being after a short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all must experience Christ in such a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>CHRIST AS THE CLOTHING OF THE PRIESTS</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the priest s office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron s sons.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And thou shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, for glory and for beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise-hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron s garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the priest s office.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest s office.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two edges thereof; and so it shall be joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel: Six of their names on one stone, and the other six names of the rest on the other stone, according to their birth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be set in ouches of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>And thou shalt make ouches settings of gold; and two chains of pure gold at the ends; of wreathed work shalt thou make them, and fasten the wreathed chains to the ouches.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold, of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined linen, shalt thou make it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, even four rows of stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this shall be the first row.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>And the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they shall be set in gold in their inclosings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet; every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron s heart, when he goeth in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD continually Exo 28:1-11, 13-21, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christ as our food is the very content of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is not only our satisfaction, but also our content.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Furthermore, Christ is also the garments of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>These are their manifestation or outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must experience Christ in an inner way and express Him in an outer way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are not merely to eat of Christ, but also to wear Christ, putting Him on as our garment.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are not only to enjoy Christ, but also to express and magnify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Christ must be manifested through us and magnified upon us!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He is our inner satisfaction and our outer expression.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Four or five things are very important concerning the garments of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>First, they have a robe made of white linen to cover the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then they have the ephod, which is something like a vest upon the robe.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Next, they have a mitre, which is a head piece, something like a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Finally, upon their shoulders are two precious stones, and upon their breast is the breastplate, with twelve precious stones and the Urim and the Thummim.</S>
