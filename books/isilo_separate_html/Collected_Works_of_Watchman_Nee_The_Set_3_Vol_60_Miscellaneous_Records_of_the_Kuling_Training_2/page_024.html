He is an ignorant and foolish man as far as salvation is concerned. Since this is the condition of the sinners we are dealing with in our preaching, how can we turn their ignorance into enlightenment and their darkened thoughts into light? There is no way to do this. Just as it is impossible to tell a darkened room to transform itself into light, there is no way for us to make a darkened mind bright and shining again. We should not presume that we can enlighten a man's mind by simply relating the truth to him in a clear way. Many times when we argue with sinners we turn them away. Many times we defeat the excuses of the sinners, yet their mind remains dark. We win the argument, yet lose the soul. First Corinthians 1:21 says that the world through its wisdom did not know God because its thoughts were darkened. First Corinthians 2:9 also says that God's salvation is something that has not come up in man's heart. Hence, man's mind is fully darkened with respect to salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">In His Emotion</h2><p>What about the desires in man's emotion? Romans 3:11 says, "There is none who understands, there is none who seeks out God." There is none who understands&mdash;this refers to the mind, and there is none who seeks out God&mdash;this refers to the emotion. In John 5:40 the Lord Jesus said to the Pharisees, "You are not willing to come to Me that you may have life." They were not willing to come to the Lord because they had no desire or hunger to do so. In Matthew 13:15 the Lord said, "For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed, lest they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and they turn around, and I will heal them." The Jews were not able to understand because they rejected in their heart. They did not have the desire in their hearts to be saved. They could not understand salvation because they did not want it. If their eyes could see and their ears could hear, their minds would understand. Hence, in order for a sinner to be saved, the first gate he has to pass through is the understanding. The second gate is his willingness and desire to be saved. Yet before a man can will and desire, he must first want to be saved, like to be saved, and hope to be saved. Otherwise, he will only run away from salvation. John 15:23-25 says that man's emotion has no desire for the Lord; on the contrary, it hates Him without a cause. It mocks believers without reason and considers it a shame to be called a Christian. The unbelievers behave this way because they are ignorant. They do not seek after God and have no desire for the Lord. Instead they hate Him.</p><h2 class="head2">In His Will</h2><p>Next we come to the will. The will is the organ of deliberation. An unbeliever decides within himself to reject the Lord. In Matthew 23:37 the Lord said, "How often I desired...and you would not!" The Lord was determined to give, but the Jews were determined to reject. They were determined to reject the Lord. From this point forward they were fully rejected in return. Read Romans 6:17 again: "But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which you were delivered." The Jews were rejected by the Lord through their own rejection of Him. Those who have believed have obeyed from their heart. They have decided that they want Him. God commands man to repent. A man only has to be willing to believe. The Holy Spirit will come to those who obey.</p><h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL TURNS THE HEART</h2><p>The Bible says that a man must believe before he can be saved. Faith is a thing of the heart. This is the reason the book of Hebrews associates unbelief with an "evil heart" (3:12). Romans 10:9-10 says that a man has to believe in his heart. In order for a sinner to believe, he must understand with his mind, desire with his emotion, and deliberately decide with his will. His mind, emotion, and will have to turn. A good gospel preacher knows how to turn a sinner's mind, stir up his desire, and pin down his will. If he does this, his preaching will prevail.</p><p>Today a preacher of the gospel faces a fundamental temptation, or, we may say, a fundamental error. He only pays attention to turning man's mind. He wants to impart nice doctrines into man's mind and to clarify his mental faculty concerning the subject of salvation. Such a person does not know the constitution of a sinner. He thinks that a man must understand the gospel before he can be saved. He does not realize that a sinner's thoughts are very shallow indeed. He may understand what he hears, but he will still reject it. What will the preacher do then? We have to understand that man's mind cannot entirely represent his heart. It is wrong for a gospel preacher to pay attention only to the mind. The mind is the most superficial and outward part of man's heart. Even if a preacher can convince others with doctrines, they will still not believe. The quickest way to touch man's heart is through the mind. However, it is also the most unreliable and ineffective way because the mind is the shallowest part of man's heart.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> </body></html>
