[1]  Although many consider the universe and man s purpose on this earth to be an insoluble riddle, the Bible, one of God s greatest gifts to mankind, unlocks this mystery.
[2]  In the same way, the human life was created according to the image of God so that God could dispense Himself as the divine life into the human life.
[3]  All of man s human virtues, such as love, honor, and goodness, were created by God so that man may have God s life and live out the divine attributes.
[4]  Before man partook of God s life and nature in the tree of life, he was seduced by Satan, God s archenemy, and thus became corrupted and fell into sin.
[5]  Because man disobeyed God s word, he fell under God s condemnation, became separated from God, was deprived from fulfilling God s purpose, and is destined to an eternal death in the lake of fire.
[6]  Although man was created in the image of God and thus possesses a good nature that matches God s nature, with virtues such as truthfulness, goodness, holiness, wisdom, kindness, and valor, through man s fall an evil nature entered into man and now wars against his good nature.
[7]  According to the Bible, He died as 1 the Lamb of God to take away man s sin John 1:29 , 2 the bronze serpent to destroy God s enemy, Satan John 3:14-15 , and 3 a grain of wheat to release the divine and eternal life of God and impart it into us John 12:24 .
