<h2 class="head4">Without Any Noise</h2>
<p>For the building of the temple, there was the need for a design and for consecration. Moreover, the work had to be done without any noise. Every piece of stone used for the building of the temple was, in principle, already cut and dealt with in the mountains (1 Kings 5:15-18; 6:7). At the time of the building, there was only the need for the pre-cut and shaped stones to be placed one on top of the other. There was no need for additional work with an ax or hammer. Thus, the sound of the hammer and ax were not heard, and the temple was built quietly.</p>
<p>A person must be dealt with by God in order to have his function manifested and to be built up in the church. Before someone can become an elder, he must be dealt with by God. Likewise, before someone can become a deacon, he must also be dealt with by God. A brother is not qualified to be an elder merely because he has attained a certain level of seniority, knowledge, capability, morality, and reputation. He may be a good stone, but his sharp edges may not have been dealt with by God. If this kind of person becomes an elder, the church will be filled with the noise of the hammer and ax. The secret for building the church is that it is accomplished without any noise. If a church is not noisy, it is strong and healthy.</p>
<p>If God has never dealt with a person, that person should not be an elder or a deacon. In principle, everyone who serves in the church must be a cut stone. If a newly saved believer or a brother from another Christian group comes into the church and begins to criticize recklessly, saying things that he should not say, the responsible brothers should not create any noise. If everyone remains silent after the contentious brother has spoken, his voice will surely disappear within a short time. However, if a person responds to what this brother has spoken, there will be more speaking and debate. In this way, the church will be weakened.</p>
<p>All those who have been dealt with by God are able to be silent and can bear people&rsquo;s rebukes and criticisms. If a person has not been adequately broken by the Lord and has not sufficiently learned some deep lessons, he will be inwardly provoked when he hears the rebukes or criticisms of others, and he will answer back or even quarrel with them. On the contrary, one who has truly learned the lesson would never argue with people. If he can receive help from others, he will seek the help; if he can render help to others and if they are willing to receive the help, he will try his best to teach them what he has learned according to the leading of the Spirit. However, if he notices that the other party only seeks to argue, oppose, and criticize, he will swallow his words and remain silent. This one has truly learned the lesson; that is, he has been cut by an ax and dealt with by a hammer in the mountains.</p>
<p>The building of the church should be without noise. In all the church service, we should hear only praising, thanksgiving, and singing. These are the proper sounds in the church. There is a saying, &ldquo;A single hand cannot clap.&rdquo; In any meeting, if a brother stretches out his hand and another brother also stretches out his hand can they clap. In the Lord&rsquo;s table meetings we have sometimes heard people fighting against one another by praying to nullify another one&rsquo;s prayer. This shows that the church has not been genuinely built up. A necessary condition for the building of the church is the absence of noise.</p>
<p>In the church, if we hear others&rsquo; criticism, judgment, and opposition, we should withdraw into the Holy of Holies, that is, turn to our spirit and be silent. When we are silent, others will also be silent, but when we are loud, others will be louder. The temple was not built with the sound of hammering and beating; it was built in quietness. This requires that we learn a serious lesson before the Lord.</p>
<p>In order to build the temple, to build the church, we must live in resurrection, live a consecrated life, and receive God&rsquo;s dealing. These three items are indispensable. Resurrection, consecration, and dealings are the way to build the church. Hence, we must all constantly live in resurrection, reject all that we are, live a consecrated life, and receive God&rsquo;s dealings. David was such a person. He gave all that he had for the temple and continually submitted himself under God&rsquo;s hand to receive God&rsquo;s dealing. May God have mercy on us that in both our service and church life, we would live in resurrection, receive God&rsquo;s dealings, and live a consecrated life. This is the way for the church to be built up.</p>
