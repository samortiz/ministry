<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SALVATION OF JEHOVAH<br>TO HIS BELOVED PEOPLE AND THE NATIONS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>JEHOVAH'S HUMILIATING JUDGMENT<br>ON THE HAUGHTY NATIONS<br>AND<br>THE USHERING IN OF THE GOD-MAN, CHRIST,<br>ISSUING IN THE RESTORATION<br>OF THE NATION OF ISRAEL</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Isa. 2:7-22; 4:2-6; 2:2-5; Zech. 8:20-23; Hosea 2:18</H1><P>In this message we will cover two more of the secret and mysterious points in the book of Isaiah. These two points, which are much higher than the matters covered in the previous messages, are related to Christ as the God-man and to Israel. As we will see, Jehovah's humiliating judgment ushers in the God-man, Christ, and issues in the restoration of the nation of Israel. Both the ushering in of Christ and the restoration of Israel come from Jehovah's righteous judgment on the nations. The more God judges the nations, the more Christ is ushered in; and the more Christ is ushered in, the more the restoration of Israel issues out. The ushering in of Christ and the restoration of Israel will result in the millennial kingdom. Finally, the millennium will consummate in the ultimate age of God's economy, that is, in the new heaven and new earth.</P><P>If our understanding of Isaiah is limited to matters such as our sins becoming white as snow (1:18), our understanding will be too low. The highest point in the book of Isaiah is the ushering in of Christ as the God-man, issuing in the restoration of the nation of Israel, which brings in the kingdom and consummates in the new heaven and new earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. JEHOVAH'S HUMILIATING<br>JUDGMENT ON THE HAUGHTY NATIONS</H2><P>Because the nations were so haughty, it was necessary for Jehovah to humiliate them, to bring them down, through judgment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Prophet's Accusation</H2><P>In 2:7-9 we have Isaiah's accusation against the haughty nations. Isaiah was displeased with the nations, and he brought their case to the heavenly court and accused them before Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Their Land Being Full of Silver and Gold,<br>and Their Treasures Being Limitless</H2><P>The nations were extremely rich (v. 7). Their land was full of silver and gold, and their treasures were limitless. Their land was also full of horses, and their chariots were limitless.</P>
