The Son and the Father Being One,<br>and the Spirit Being One<br>with both the Father and the Son</H2><P>The Son came with the Father to accomplish redemption (John 6:46), and the Father was with the Son all the time while the Son was on the earth (John 8:16b, 29). In John 6:46 the preposition translated from carries the sense of from with. Thus, when the Lord Jesus came to the earth to accomplish redemption, He came not only from the Father but also with the Father. In John 8:16 and 29 the Lord Jesus told us that He was not alone, but the Father was always with Him.</P><P>The Son also came in the name of the Father (John 5:43). This is why in Isaiah 9:6 the Son is called the Father. Moreover, the Father sent the Spirit in the Son's name (John 14:26a). These two things are evidence not only that the Son and the Father are one, but also that the Spirit is one with both the Father and the Son. The Three of the divine Trinity are one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. For the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity<br>into the Believers</H2><P>This kind of economy, arrangement, or plan, is for the dispensing of the divine Trinity into the believers. In Romans 8:5-11 we can see this dispensing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. For the Believers to Experience and Enjoy<br>the Processed Triune God</H2><P>This arrangement is also for the believers to experience and enjoy the processed Triune God (2 Cor. 13:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. That the Processed Triune God<br>and the Regenerated Believers May Be Mingled as One<br>for the Building Up of the Organic Body of Christ</H2><P>This arrangement is also that the processed Triune God and the regenerated believers may be mingled as one (Eph. 4:4-6) for the building up of the organic Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12-13, 15-16). Ephesians 4:4-6 tells us that there is one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father of all. This indicates that the Triune God is mingled with the Body of Christ, that is, with us, the believers. This mingling is for the building up of the organic Body of Christ. Ephesians 4:12-13 and 15-16 are four verses that show us that the mingling of the divine Trinity with the believers is for an organic building, the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>All the aforementioned items have been altogether missed by most Christians today. In the training received by most students of theology, they are merely told in a general way that God is triune&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Most Christians have not gone beyond this point in their understanding of the divine Trinity. However, all the points mentioned above are clearly revealed in the divine revelation, especially in the New Testament.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>A Brief Presentation of the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
