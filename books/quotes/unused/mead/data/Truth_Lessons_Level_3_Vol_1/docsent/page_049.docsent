   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Bringing God to His Chosen People</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Bringing God s Chosen People</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>into the Rich Supply of God s Full Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Moses was sent by God and God was with him Exo 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, when he was sent to the children of Israel, he brought God to them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, he would not only bring the children of Israel out of Egypt, the land of slavery, but he would also bring them into Canaan, a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey Exo 3:8, 10, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Milk and honey signify the two aspects of the riches of Christ s life: the animal life, representing the redeeming life, and the vegetable life, representing the generating life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These two aspects of the riches of Christ are the riches of God s full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, Christ as the Apostle came from God and with God to us in order to bring God to us and to bring us into the rich supply of God s full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>C. Faithful to God</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>in All the House of God</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moses as one sent by God to take care of God s house was faithful to God in all God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Old Testament times the house of God was the house of Israel Lev 22:18; Num 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This typifies that Christ as the Apostle sent by God for God s house, the church, was faithful to Him who constituted Him Heb 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>D. Christ Having More Honor and</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Being Worthy of More Glory Than Moses</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hebrews 3:3-4 says, He Christ has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by as much as He who built the house has more honor than the house.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This clearly indicates that Christ, who built God s house, is God, and as such, He has more honor and has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, who was built as a part of God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>E. Christ Being the Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>over God s House;</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moses Being a Servant of God for a Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>of the Things to Be Spoken Later</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hebrews 3:5 says, Moses...as a servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken later.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Servant here is a designation that implies dignity and freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Testimony may also be rendered prefigure.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, although Moses was an honorable servant of God, he was merely a type of the real, typical, and genuine Apostle sent from God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 6 says, But Christ...as a Son over His God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>House in Greek denotes family, referring to the members of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s house is not a physical house but a living family; God dwells in His living family, His folks.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His folks are His house.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, God s house is a living constitution constituted with the many children of God in the Father s life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a house is built up, ruled over, and taken care of by Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who is the Apostle sent by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is not only building up this house but also ruling over and taking care of it, carrying it on with Him to walk and move with God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is typified in the Old Testament by Moses, who took care of all God s house, the house of Israel, and led them to walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>MOSES TYPIFYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>AS THE PROPHET OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A prophet is God s spokesman, not mainly to predict things that are coming but to speak for God and speak forth God by God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In his forty years of leading the children of Israel, Moses continually spoke to them for God, and especially in Deuteronomy he repeatedly spoke God s words to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although it was Moses who spoke, he did not speak his own words; he spoke God s words.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He spoke for God, spoke forth God, and spoke God into the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every word he spoke also became God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As such a prophet Moses was also a type of Christ Acts 3:22-23 .</S>
