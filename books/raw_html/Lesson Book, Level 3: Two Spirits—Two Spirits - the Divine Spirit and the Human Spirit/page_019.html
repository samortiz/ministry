<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Not Separate from Christ</H2><P>[The Holy Spirit today is the seven eyes of Christ. Many Christians argue that the Holy Spirit of God is separate from Christ, but the Bible says that the Holy Spirit is the eyes of Christ. Do you think of your eyes as being separate from you? It is ridiculous to say this. When I look at your eyes, I look at you, and when you look at me with your eyes, you look me. The eyes of a person express that person. To say that the Holy Spirit is separate from Christ does not correspond with the pure revelation of the Holy Word.]</P><P>[Day by day, we sense that Someone is looking at us. This Someone is the Spirit, who is Christ Himself....Our Christ is not a blind Christ. He is the Christ with the seven eyes. Often, He transfuses His elements into us. At other times, He observes us like a flashlight, saying, "What are you doing? Are you fighting with your husband? Stop!" Have you not had this kind of experience? Day by day we experience this watching, observing, and transfusing Christ. This watching, observing, and transfusing take place through His eyes. His eyes are the Spirit, and the Spirit is simply Himself. If you do not believe it, you will miss the blessing.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE SEVEN SPIRITS, SEVEN LAMPS,<br>AND SEVEN EYES FOR GOD'S BUILDING</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Lamps and the Building</H2><P>[The lamps in Exodus 25 are for the building up of the tabernacle, especially for the move in the tabernacle. Without light, it is impossible to move. The light is for the move, and the move is for God's building. The seven lamps, therefore, are for the building up of the tabernacle, God's dwelling place on earth. </P><P>The seven lamps in Zechariah 3 and 4 are for the recovery of God's building. The principle is the same in the rebuilding of the temple as it was in the building of the tabernacle. The same is true of the book of Revelation....Revelation begins with the seven local churches and it ends with the New Jerusalem. Although this book contains the judgment of God, this judgment is not the goal. Judgment is not for judgment; it is for God's building. The New Jerusalem, God's eternal dwelling place, issues out of this judgment.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Stone with Seven Eyes</H2><P>Zechariah 3:9 says, "For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes." In Revelation 5, the seven eyes are of the Lamb, but in Zechariah they are upon a stone.</P><P>[In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus said, "And I say also unto thee, That thou art a stone, and upon this rock I will build my church" (Gk.). Here the Lord refers to Himself as the rock. In Matthew 21:42 He said, "Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?" The stone referred to here is the very stone with the seven eyes in Zechariah 3:9.]</P><P>The verses show us clearly that the stone is just Christ Himself and that this stone is related to the building of God's house. Christ is the Lamb-stone with seven eyes for God's building.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Cleansing and Infusing</H2><P>[Because your condition is not pure, some of you are still under the seven burning lamps. You are still involved with certain things that need to be searched and judged. Mainly we are not under the flaming lamps, but under the infusing eyes. Are you under the searching lamps or the infusing eyes? I am happy to be under the seven eyes. Suppose you are about to quarrel with your wife. The seven eyes will immediately become the seven lamps. At such a time, you need to repent and say, "O Lord Jesus, forgive me. I am still in the flesh, and I am so pitiful. Lord, thank You for Your blood. I confess my failure and I apply Your blood to my situation." Whenever you do this, the seven lamps turn into the seven eyes looking at you, and immediately you are once again under His transfusing. Christ's essence and certain of His attributes are transfused into your being.]</P>
