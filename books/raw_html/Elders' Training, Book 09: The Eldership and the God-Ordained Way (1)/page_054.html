<P>Now that we have picked up the God-ordained way of preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes, others are following us to do the same thing. In a conference of some Catholic bishops in 1987, one bishop said that if we have never knocked on people's doors, we have never consecrated ourselves to the preaching of the gospel. The Southern Baptist denomination recently decided to train eighty-nine thousand young laymen to go to visit people in their homes in Texas to get one million people saved within two months. They said that preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes is according to the New Testament plan and will never be improved on. They discovered that this is the top way to preach the gospel. Out of this one million they intend to baptize seventy thousand to make them members of the Southern Baptist denomination. Their success in this endeavor will contribute to convincing all the believers that the top way to preach the gospel is to visit people where they are, to go to their homes.</P><P>To preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes does not exclude other ways to preach the gospel. Peter took advantage of the situation on the day of Pentecost to speak to thousands of people, and three thousand were added in one day. This was a special occasion arranged by the Lord, but it is not the God-ordained way to preach the gospel. The God-ordained way is to go to people where they are. Because they are in their homes, we must go there.</P><P>Actually, to knock on doors means to visit people. This is the scientific way to preach the gospel. It has been fully tested, and the results have been marvelous wherever it has been practiced in a proper way. Anything that is scientific remains. To preach the gospel to the people where they are is not only scientific but also logical and reasonable. Can we be satisfied merely by bringing a few people into Christ by inviting them to come to us? We invited many new ones to our love feasts in the past, but we did not bring in that many.</P><P>A spiritual giant may have big campaigns for the preaching of the gospel, but what is the real result for the building up of the church? Furthermore, when this spiritual giant is gone, who has been perfected to preach the gospel? Tradition has killed us, cheated us, and deceived us, so we must come back to the ordained way of perfecting all the saints. Ephesians 4:11 and 12 say, "He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints." The evangelists are not only for preaching the gospel but also for the perfecting of the saints to do the work of preaching the gospel as they do. We need to be perfected by some evangelists. We do not know how to preach the gospel in a proper and adequate way. Anyone can move his fingers on the keys of a piano, but to learn how to play the piano, a person must be perfected. The Lord's way is for all of us to be perfected. We need to be perfected by the evangelists who are the experts in preaching the gospel.</P>
