   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DISPENSING OF THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The dispensing of the Father can be seen in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 32 of chapter six says that the Father gives us the true bread out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus told us clearly that He is the very bread from heaven given by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that the Father is dispensing Christ as food to all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John 6:40 says that the will of the Father is that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ as the heavenly bread dispensed to us is the embodiment of the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we receive this bread and eat it, we have this bread within us as the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Father gives us the heavenly bread, which signifies the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, the Son is the heavenly food for our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can also see the dispensing of the Father in John 8:29, which says that He the Father who sent the Son is with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Father gives the Son as the heavenly bread, but when He gives the Son, He comes with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Father who sent the Son is with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The natural thought is that the Father remained in the heavens when He sent the Son to us to be our food supply.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But according to the divine revelation, the Father was with the Son when the Son came.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that not only the Son but also the Father is the component of the heavenly bread.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we receive the Son, we have the Father with the Son as our food supply.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the dispensing of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 5:24 says that He who hears the Son and believes the Father who sent the Son has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The book of John repeatedly tells us that God has given Himself for us to receive Him as our eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This giving and receiving indicates the dispensing of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE DISPENSING OF THE SON</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we want to see the dispensing of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Son, who shared in our blood and flesh, was manifested in the flesh Heb 2:14; 1 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we have seen, the Son came of a woman in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The dispensing of the Son is also seen in grace and reality coming through Jesus Christ John 1:17b .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jesus Christ came for the purpose of dispensing God Himself as grace and reality to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God Himself as grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the dispensing of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Son came that we might have life and have life abundantly John 10:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He desired to dispense Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This can also be seen in John 19:34, which says that the soldier pierced His side and there came out blood and water.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The blood is for our redemption, and the water is for God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The blood deals with sins, and the water is the flow of the divine life to quench our thirst and swallow up our death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The water is for the dispensing of the divine life into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Son of God loved us and gave Himself for us Gal 2:20; Titus 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His giving of Himself was for His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Son gave Himself to us that we might eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord Jesus established His table, He gave the bread to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this is My body" Matt 26:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This shows us that to remember the Lord at His table is to enjoy Him by eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus, who gave Himself on the cross for us, is edible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The bread on our dining table has been processed, or cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After the cross our Lord is now the heavenly bread who has been cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now this bread is ready for us to take and eat.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today Jesus is edible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord's table, of which we partake, is a sign, a symbol, of our daily walk, indicating that our daily walk is one of taking Christ as our life supply and living by this supply.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One day a week we come together to give a testimony to the entire universe with a declaration that this is the way we live.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We live by eating Jesus as our food, our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to see the vision of Jesus being edible.</S>
