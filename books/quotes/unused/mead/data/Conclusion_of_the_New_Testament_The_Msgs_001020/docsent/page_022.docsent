   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 Timothy 6:15 Paul, when he was under Caesar's rule, tells us that God is the only Sovereign, indicating that God is the only Ruler, the only Potentate, who has the most absolute and the highest authority and power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, He is the King of those who reign as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Caesar was under Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Undoubtedly the apostle who was imprisoned under Caesar was encouraged by knowing God as such a Sovereign.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Greek word for "sovereign Lord" is despotes, denoting a slave's master who has absolute sovereign power over the slave, as in Acts 4:24; Luke 2:29; Jude 4; 1 Timothy 6:1-2.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The saints who suffered martyrdom for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus recognized the very God, whom they served and who allowed them to be martyred, as such a sovereign Master, who is holy distinct from all things and true truthful in His nature and character and has made them holy sanctified, separated and true truthful, faithful to Him cf.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1 Timothy 1:17 Paul speaks of God as the King of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here "ages" actually means eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This word needs to be understood in relation to the decline of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Paul was in prison, the churches began to decline, and the situation was very disappointing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>were discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even some of Paul's co-workers left him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But he had a strong faith with an absolute assurance that the very God in whom he believed, the One who had entrusted him with the gospel of glory, is the King of the ages, the One with the absolute authority for eternity, who never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No earthly king can be called the King of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Caesar was a temporary ruler, but how different is our God!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The God whom Paul served truly is the King of the ages, the King of eternity.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, He is the only Sovereign in whom the apostle trusted.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>23.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Incorruptible</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1 Timothy 1:17 we see that as the King of the ages, God is the incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He never changes in His nature, power, and any kind of His attributes; He always remains the same.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This indicates that God remains immutable, not subject to any change due to any kind of environments and circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since the God who gives this command is eternal, remaining unchangeable forever, so is this command.</S>
