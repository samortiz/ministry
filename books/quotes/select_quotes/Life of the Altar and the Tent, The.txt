It is impossible to have an altar without a tent, and it is also impossible to have a tent without a return to the altar
We need to realize that the power to offer oneself to God comes through His appearance; it comes from His revelation
The altar here does not refer to the Lord Jesus' vicarious death for us; it refers to the consecration of ourselves to God
Many of us think that we offer ourselves to God to do this or that for Him, whereas what He wants of us is a burning
Abraham had not heard many doctrines about consecration, nor had he been urged by others to consecrate himself
It was with Abraham, and so it has been with everyone who has met God throughout the two thousand years of church history
In our life before God everything must truly be on the altar, but for our life in the world we still have need of many material things
We ought to consecrate our all to God and live for Him alone; but if He says we may retain a certain thing, then we may retain it
We must still inquire of God concerning all the objects in the tent; we can only keep those that God allows us to keep
Everything has to pass the altar first; we must first check with God about every one of them before we can put them into the tent
If we cling to it and say, 'This is mine,' then in our heart we have forsaken the altar and are no longer consecrated
God demands that everything we have be placed on the altar and that we have placed what He has left for us in the tent
Three or five years after this, we collect many things from the world again, and we cannot go back to the altar anymore
Have any of you gone down into Egypt, so that now you have your own demands, your own hopes, your own interests, and your own aspirations?
May He be gracious to us and cause us to see the importance of consecration so that we may live a life of the altar and the tent!
