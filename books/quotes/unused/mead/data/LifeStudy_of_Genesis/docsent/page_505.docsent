   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a In Addition to the Basic Offerings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>after the Experience of the Riches of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although all the offerings are types of Christ and are for our experience, there is a difference between the basic offerings and the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The sin offering, one of the basic offerings, was a type of Christ for the experience of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before sinners come to offer the sin offering, they do not have any experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They gain experience by presenting the sin offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No experience is required beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before you can pour out a drink offering, however, you must have a measure of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without experience, you will not be able to have this offering because the drink offering is composed of our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the first seven chapters of Leviticus we have the five basic offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no need to experience Christ before you offer Him as these basic offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the drink offering is absolutely dependent upon our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is quite important.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many believers have no understanding of the basic offerings, much less an understanding of the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The reason for this is that they are short of the real experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By the Lord's mercy we in His recovery must experience Christ in a practical, daily way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Daily we should experience Him as our burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, sin offering, and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the beginning we offer Christ only in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But as we progress in our experience of Christ, we eventually discover an offering that is in addition to these basic offerings the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose a certain man has been saved for just one day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He certainly has had no time to have the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if he remains in the proper church life, the saints will help him to realize that he needs to live by Christ, taking Christ as his life in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As he learns to live by Christ, he will gradually realize that Christ is so much to him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The saints will no doubt help him to see that Christ is his burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He will realize that he should be absolutely for God; however, he will find that he is not able to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, Christ is his absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through this experience, Christ will become his burnt offering for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, he will enjoy Christ as his meal offering, as the One who not only satisfies God, but who also feeds and supplies him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then he will daily take Christ as his food, and Christ will nourish him and support him to live in the presence of God that God might be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way he will experience Christ as the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In like manner, he will experience the other basic offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By experiencing Christ in this way, he will eventually become a person filled and saturated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The very Christ who saturates him will be his wine, and the brother himself will be saturated with this wine and actually become one with the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some may wonder what ground we have for saying that Christ is wine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not my word; it is the Lord's word in Matthew 9:17.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this verse the Lord said, "Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord spoke this word in His answer to some disciples of John the Baptist who asked Him why His disciples did not fast Matt 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord wisely answered their question in a marvelous way with two parables.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Firstly, He said, "No one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made" Matt 9:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Secondly, He spoke about not putting new wine into old wineskins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is this new cloth and new wine?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Both the new cloth and the new wine are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The new cloth is Christ as our new, unique, complete, and perfect righteousness for us to be justified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As the new cloth Christ is our righteousness to cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The new wine is Christ as the stirring life, as the life that stirs us up to make us happy and even "crazy."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To be "crazy" is to be drunken.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ as the new cloth covers us outwardly and Christ as the new wine stirs us and makes us "crazy" inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In other words, Christ causes us to be drunken.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All Christians must be "crazy" like this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the summer of 1935 Brother Nee stayed in my home town.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>During this time we had a conference in which we were all "crazy."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brother Nee did not stir us up to be "crazy"; we were "crazy" already.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When he saw how "crazy" we were, he gave us a supplementary message telling us that we all need to be "crazy," beside ourselves 2 Cor 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He said that if any Christian has never been "crazy," then he is not yet up to standard.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He said, "If you are always nice, formal, gentle, and regulated, you are below standard.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You must be crazy' in the Lord like a drunkard."</S>
