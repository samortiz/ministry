   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After twenty-four issues of The Christian had been published, Watchman was burdened to resume the publications of The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Christian, therefore, was discontinued in January 1928.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After six and a half years, in July 1934, publication was again resumed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The following statements explain the reason and purpose for discontinuing The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This excerpt is from Watchman's open letter in the twenty-fourth issue of The Christian published in December 1927:</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After a long period of waiting and praying, I am now clear about the Lord's will concerning The Christian for next year.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I first began publication of this paper, I knew it would not be of a permanent nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At first I intended to publish it only on a trial basis for one year.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Following the first year, I continued its publication for another year.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now two full years have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I began, a few friends asked, "What is your purpose in publishing The Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What do you plan to do with The Present Testimony which you published before?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My answer was, "The goal of The Christian is to lead believers to read The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever I feel the time has come, I will stop publishing The Christian."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was what I said to my friends then.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now the time has come, and The Christian will be discontinued.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This whole year I have been continually before God, contemplating and praying over the future of this paper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Day by day I have become clearer that the message of this paper is now adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is now leading me on to bear another special testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As this instrument has been used in the hand of God, and as He now desires to put it aside, who am I that I should say no?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some friends who learned of my decision felt sorry that The Christian was being discontinued.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Also, humanly speaking, it seems that since this paper is enjoying such a wide circulation, that it is a shame to discontinue it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to my natural thought, I also am reluctant to discontinue The Christian, for I am most delighted with such a work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But God has stepped on the brake, and I must obey with rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In that day you will know that I was obeying God in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I feel deeply that the various testimonies we have printed in The Christian, especially those concerning the outward behavior of believers, are sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we continue our tiring reiteration, it will make The Christian a paper specializing in "leaving the denominations," "baptism by immersion," etc. I thank God that He gave the co-workers and me the same feeling concerning this matter....</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Does this mean that we will cease printing such writings concerning our testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord is leading the believers meeting in Shanghai to publish The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Henceforth, The Present Testimony will be a written testimony of the believers who meet and have fellowship in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
