<h2 class=head1>III. WE HAVE THIS LIFE AND CAN EXPERIENCE IT EVERY DAY</h2><p>Although this life is divine and eternal, it has come to humanity in time. It came in Jesus Christ to be our life. He said in John 10:10b, “I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly.’’ Because of our sins, He had to die for our sins in order to obtain redemption for us. Then in resurrection, He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) to give life to us who believe. From then on, we have this life in us and we may experience this life daily.<h2 class=head2>A. The Experiences of This Life</h2><p>Our first experience of this life is regeneration. When we believe in the Lord through the hearing of the gospel, the life-giving Spirit begets us and regenerates us with this life in our spirit. This is a crucial fact related to us. We must see and not forget this fact. From this point, we have a life which is divine, eternal and indestructible. We may live a Christian life according to all God demands and fulfill God’s purpose, because this life is capable. The soul-life and the sinful flesh may still give us trouble every day, yet this life is able to overcome and express God in us every day all day. We must learn to experience this life every day to cause it to grow in us until maturity.<h2 class=head2>B. The Issues of This Life</h2><p>This life does not come into us merely to be in us. It issues in a Christian life that is godly, expressing all that God is, and is victorious over sin, the world, the flesh, the self, the natural life and individualism. It also bears fruit according to John 15, that is, to dispense this life into others through the preaching of the gospel. Then the church, according to God’s purpose and standard, will be built. Ultimately it will produce the New Jerusalem, the mingling of the processed Triune God and His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed tripartite man. The New Jerusalem will be in life, full of life and expressing life for eternity. Hallelujah!<h2 class=head2>C. The Maintenance of This Life</h2><p>Since this life is so wonderful and crucial to us Christians, we must endeavor to maintain and preserve this life at all cost. We must deal with all the things that hinder us from growing in this life. We also must apply all the life practices such as calling on the Lord, reading the word, praying, pray-reading, singing, fellowshipping, etc. to enjoy this life every day from morning to evening. Then we will be strong to experience this life in our daily life, overcoming all the negative situations in school and at home, thereby becoming proper students and children. We do not need to wait until we grow up or until the Lord returns to experience this life and grow. We may grow by maintaining this life today. Thus God’s eternal purpose, the building of His church, will be fulfilled by us (Eph. 4:16b).<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>What are the three words for life and their meanings?</li><li>What is the difference between “everlasting life’’ and “eternal life’’?</li><li>Why is only the life of God life?</li><li>Find one or two verses for each kind of life.</li><li>Use some verses to show how we may experience and grow in this life today.</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Recovery Version, 1 John 1:2, note 3; John 10:11, note 1; Rom. 5:17, note 1; Heb. 7:16, note 1; 1 Pet. 1:3, note 4.</li><li>The Knowledge of Life, pp. 9-10.</li><li>Life-study of Hebrews, pp. 388-390.</li><li>Life-study of First John, pp. 33-34.</li></ol>
