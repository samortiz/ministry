   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE NINETY-EIGHT THE BOARDS OF THE TABERNACLE 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 26:15-30; 36:20-34; 40:18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we consider the tenons, sockets, rings, and bars, I would like to say a word about the corner boards and also about the total number of boards in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I appreciate the concept that there must be strengthening at the corners of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we pointed out in the foregoing message, a corner is where a turn is made.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever the Lord makes a turn, there is the need for strengthening and reinforcement.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus is not only the foundation of the church; He is also the cornerstone connecting the walls.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He joins the Gentile wall to the Jewish wall.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At Antioch there was a turn toward the Gentile world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, there was a need for Christ to be the cornerstone to embrace the two sections of the church wall, the Jewish wall and the Gentile wall.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At this corner there was the need for strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we read Acts 13 carefully, we shall see that there definitely was a strengthening when the Lord made a turn at Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are told that in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As they were praying and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them v. 2 . These brothers were burdened by the Lord to take the testimony to the Gentile world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be sure, both Barnabas and Saul were corner boards.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were doubled and strengthened in order to become stronger boards for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From 1922 until 1949, the Lord used China as a nursery for the planting of His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in 1949 the Lord took a major turn from the mainland of China to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As one who participated in this turn in a full way, I was put under immense pressure, and I could say that I was thereby condensed and doubled.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I can also testify that in this turn there was the strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the years to come, the Lord will probably make other turns in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Certain saints will be doubled, condensed, and strengthened in order to be the corner boards for such a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There was a total of forty-eight boards in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The number forty-eight can be formed with either four times twelve or six times eight.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I believe that with the tabernacle the correct way to make this number is six times eight.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the record concerning the boards there is no mention of the number twelve, but there is mention of the number six and an indication of the number eight.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The number six refers to man created on the sixth day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This man became fallen and was later redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, six refers to created, fallen, and redeemed human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The number eight is the number of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, six times eight means that, as the standing boards in the tabernacle, the believers have been created, have become fallen, and then have been redeemed and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all have the same history.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We were created, we became fallen, we were redeemed, and now we are in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, we are a redeemed people in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the significance of the number of the boards being forty-eight.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE TENONS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There must be a way for the forty-eight boards of the tabernacle to stand up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For God s building, the boards must be vertical.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They cannot lie flat.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lying flat would be a sign of defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order for the boards to stand upright, there is the need for the tenons, the sockets, the rings, and the bars.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The tenons and the sockets are for standing, whereas the rings and the bars are for uniting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The individual boards of the tabernacle must become a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This requires a uniting power to join them and make them one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The tenons and the sockets are for us individually, but the rings and the bars are for us to be joined together corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 17 says, Two tenons shall be in each board, connected one with the other; thus you shall make for all the boards of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do not know the details concerning the size, the shape, or the material of the tenons.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Hebrew word rendered tenons is difficult to translate.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This word actually means a hand.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, the two tenons are two hands.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The number two here signifies testimony and confirmation for coordination.</S>
