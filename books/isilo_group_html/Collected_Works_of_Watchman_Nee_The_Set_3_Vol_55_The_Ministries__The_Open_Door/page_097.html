Where should we settle? When we came to search out the area, it seemed that our goal should be Zhaobintien. On the third day, we went to Zhaobintien. But the fields there were few and very expensive; furthermore, the people there thought we were lawless refugees and were not willing to let us live there. God cut off the way for us to go to Zhaobintien. Where should we go? To Yangshuchiao? This was twice as close to Yiyang than Zhaobintien. If the goal of our gospel was Yiyang, then we should stay in a place closer to the city. Therefore, after we all prayed together in one accord, we felt that we should settle ourselves in Yangshuchiao. But the people there knew that we would eventually buy land, so they purposely did nothing and said nothing. We guessed that they were probably trying to push up the price of land. We went on in this way for one or two weeks. We began to be a little uneasy. What would we do if we could not buy fields?</p><p>Fortunately, God had showed us His love and power in many ways on the trip, so we dared not give way to anxiety. We just gave this matter to God. Oh! God seems to arrange all kinds of circumstances to win His children's prayer so that He will have a way to accomplish His will. A few days after our prayer, God worked in the environment and caused the people to sell us the fields willingly, which they had wanted to sell to us in the first place. They were actually eager to sell their fields but were afraid that we would not buy them. Within two months, we had bought more than four hundred acres of land at a price that was just within our means. We built our huts on the side of a medium-sized mountain ridge. We moved into our new homes on January 5, 1949. Thus, in the wilderness of those mountains, God's children made their homes, and in places which had not heard voices of praise since the creation of the world (maybe we can say that) there are now the sounds of hymn-singing. We could not build enough huts because there was not enough time, and everyone had to crowd together. Three or four families must live in a small hut. There are no beds, so we pile hay on the floor and sleep there. Oh! the outward suffering (if I can call it that) makes things sweeter on the inside. This rustic life often causes us to go to God!</p><p>Before our migration, we had intended to continue living as individuals. God, however, did not want us to live in this way (this does not apply to everyone in general) because He wants to gain more glory through our living. Therefore, we inwardly felt that we should not continue to live as individuals. The fallen human nature is selfish. If we separated, we would inevitably care for ourselves and develop our own businesses. Perhaps we would have reached a point where we would not have been able to go on. Spontaneously, we formed one large household. God put us into this large household to learn the lesson of loving one another. It is an especially good place to have the flesh dealt with. We used to think that we had lost the flesh, but now we have discovered that we have not lost it, nor have we thoroughly dealt with it. We used to think that we could love the brothers and sisters, but now we find that we still cannot. We used to think that we knew the "self" and that we had experienced something of the lessons of the cross, but now the facts tell us that we are really not that clear. Oh! May God cause us to quickly finish our courses in this school.</p><p>On the other hand, however, because we work, eat, sleep, and live together, we are full of joy and do not feel that the burden is as heavy as it was when we lived as individuals. We rely on God, look to God, and trust in God together. God is the only Head of our household. This loving, almighty Head of the household has performed many miracles of love for His children. One day we did not have rice for lunch. After breakfast, we all prayed to Him, and around 11:00 someone came with seven carts of rice, wanting to trade them for some of our salt. Many villagers have been kidnapped or even murdered, but at the most crucial times, He still protects His household. When we do not have enough money to buy food, He prepares rice that only costs us one or two dollars so that we do not have any lack. When we have a dangerous illness, He answers our cries that we be healed without medicine. Although He did not hear our prayers concerning one sister and took her home, He used this to raise up more of His children to be useful to Him and to come serve Him together with us. There have also been difficulties like storms and rains, which He has resolved for us one by one. Oh! Our God allows us to experience great difficulties in order to test, try, and edify us. We can only prostrate ourselves and worship Him.</p><p>Oh! Praise the Lord for causing us to practice the lessons of loving and serving one another in this large household. May God grant that we would thoroughly root out our selfishness and enter into the state of having all things in common, being free from the distinction of individual identities. To solve the problem of differences in clothing, we preached a message on thorough consecration. Praise the Lord! The brothers and sisters were happy and willing to offer up their extra clothes and cloth. Some only kept the clothes on their backs. May God raise up more brothers and sisters to migrate everywhere for the gospel that God's will may be done on earth.</p><p>Feng He-ren<br />April 3, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: First Faith Farm, Yangshuchiao, Yiyang, Kiangsi province</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_096.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_098.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministries & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 97</div><br></body></html>
