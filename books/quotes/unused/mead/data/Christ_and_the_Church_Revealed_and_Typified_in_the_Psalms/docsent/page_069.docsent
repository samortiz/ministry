   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE EARTH TURNS TO THE LORD THROUGH ZION Psalms 102 to 106 Scripture Reading: Psa 102:12-16, 19-22, 24-27; 104:35b; 105:45b; 106:1, 47-48</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the last few Psalms of Book IV.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A FURTHER REVELATION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Book IV of the Psalms is a short book, and there are just three main points: firstly, how the saints take God as their dwelling place, thus making them practically one with God Psalms 90 to 92 ; secondly, the recovery of God's title over the earth through Christ in the house and city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This second point, though quite simple, is exceedingly strategic.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is nearly the ultimate concept of the whole of the Psalms, and it is the main thought in Book IV.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Book I is mainly for Christ and the house; Book II is mainly for Christ and the city; Book III is mainly for the recovery of the house and the city; and Book IV is mainly for the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is vital that we be impressed with all these main points.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The third point of Book IV is a further revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Book I has something about Christ, Book II has something more about Christ, Book III has something further concerning Christ, and Book IV has still an additional unfolding of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, as we will see, Book V also has something concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have seen Christ already in the first section of Book IV: how He was identified with the saints in taking God as His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have also seen Christ in the second section of Book IV: how He is the King to reign over the entire earth for the recovery of God's title.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is the center: Christ takes God as His dwelling place, and Christ reigns for God over the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now at the end of Book IV, we have these five Psalms, Psalms 102 to 106, revealing something more concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Psalm 102:25-27 is quoted at the end of Hebrews chapter one, which applies all these verses to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, we see that Psalm 102 is also a Psalm concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This Psalm is clearly divided into three sections: the first section, from verse 1 to 11, portrays the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This passage depicts Christ's suffering in a way in which no other chapter in the entire Bible does.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is the afflicted One, forsaken and cast down by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I was a young Christian, verse 7 impressed me deeply: "I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the housetop."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ Himself was continually watching, without sleeping, just as a lonely sparrow on the housetop.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The houses in the holy land have flat roofs, and frequently the people go there to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter was engaged in prayer upon the housetop in Acts chapter ten.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We believe that Christ also was there many times, watching, without sleeping, praying to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This verse shows how Christ behaved in His suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>ZION'S STONES AND HER GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The second section of Psalm 102, verses 12 to 22, tells us how Christ is the Lord who has mercy upon Zion, who has built up Zion, and who is declared in Zion and praised and served in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Psalm begins by telling of Christ's suffering, and then turns suddenly to the house and the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 13 says, "Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favor her, yea, the set time, is come."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do believe that this was a time when the house and the city were in desolation, and the saints desired to see the restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favor the dust thereof" v. 14 . Do not forget that this is poetic expression.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The stones mentioned here are the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And the dust refers to the ground of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The servants of the Lord take pleasure in the members of God's house, and they favor her ground.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 15: "So the nations shall fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth thy glory."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Again, you see the relation between the house, the city, and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the city is in the proper situation before God, then the earth may be gained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is through Zion, through the church, that the nations will turn to the Lord and the kings give glory to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we love the church, when we take pleasure in her stones and in her ground, these things will occur.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The turning of the earth to the Lord depends upon our attitude toward the house of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I say again that this is poetry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must understand what it means to take pleasure in all the stones of Zion and to favor her ground.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not easy for most Christians to understand these words.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I believe that before we came into the local church we could not understand the meaning of favoring the ground of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But today we have the position, and we are in the position to understand this poetry and to have such an experience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We take pleasure in the stones of Zion, and we favor the dust thereof.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are so happy with all the dear ones in the local church, and we are standing upon the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Why do the nations "fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth thy glory"?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The answer is in verse 16: "For the Lord hath built up Zion, he hath appeared in his glory."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Again we see that when the church is built up, the earth will be gained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The nations shall fear the Lord and all the kings give glory to the Lord, for He hath built up Zion and hath appeared in Zion in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For the Lord to take full possession of the earth requires the building up of Zion.</S>
