<P>In this message we want to fellowship concerning the testimony of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS BEING THE SPIRIT<br>OF THE PROPHECY IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION</H2><P>The testimony of Jesus is the spirit&#151;the reality, the substance, the disposition, and the characteristic&#151;of the prophecy in the book of Revelation (Rev. 19:10b). The entire book of Revelation is a prophecy of Jesus, and the reality of this prophecy is the testimony of Jesus. This reality is the spirit. This is like saying that the orange juice is the spirit of the orange. We may also say that the spirit, the reality, of the entire Bible is the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>Revelation has twenty-two chapters. When I was with the Brethren teachers, they spoke much about the prophecies in this book with the two beasts (13:1, 11), seven heads, and ten horns (17:3). They studied the name of Antichrist and the number six hundred sixty-six (13:18). They thought that this was the spirit of the book of Revelation. These things are in the book of Revelation, but they are not the spirit, the reality, the substance, disposition, and characteristic of this book. The spirit of this book is the testimony of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS<br>BEARS TWO DENOTATIONS</H2><P>The phrase the testimony of Jesus bears two denotations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Subjective Denotation&#151;the Testimony<br>by Jesus concerning God</H2><P>First, the testimony of Jesus bears a subjective denotation. This is the testimony by Jesus concerning God (Rev. 1:2; 22:16, 20a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. As the True and Faithful Witness of God</H2><P>This book of Revelation says Jesus is the true and faithful Witness of God (Rev. 1:5a; 3:14b). In His life, His living, and His person, Jesus was absolutely God's Witness, testifying God. His testifying of God is His testimony concerning God. Who is God? What kind of God is He? Nothing in this whole universe can testify for God except a person by the name of Jesus Christ, the God-man, the embodiment of the Godhead (Col. 2:9). This One, as the unique true and faithful Witness, testifies for God. This testifying is the testimony of Jesus in the subjective sense. As the true and faithful Witness of God, He bears testimony concerning God in what God is, in what God did, and in what God would do (John 5:19; 6:38; 7:16, 18). This is the subjective testimony Jesus bears concerning God.</P>
