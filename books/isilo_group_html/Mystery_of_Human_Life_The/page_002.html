MAN HAS GOD&#8217;S IMAGE</h2><p>Please read the following verse:</p><h1 class="scripture" style="font-weight:bold">&#8220;And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness....&#8221;<br />Genesis 1:26a</h1><p class="indent1">God&#8217;s creation of man is different from His creation of all other things. He created man in His own image.<br />A glove is created according to the likeness of a hand with the purpose of containing the hand.<br />Likewise, man was created in the image of God with the purpose of containing God.</p><h2 class="head2" style="text-align:left">2. MAN IS A VESSEL</h2><p>Now read the next verse:</p><h1 class="scripture" style="font-weight:bold">God &#8220;should make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy...even us.&#8221;<br />Romans 9:23-24</h1><p class="indent1">We are vessels of God.<br />God wants to be our content.<br />As bottles are made to contain water, we are made to contain God.</p><p>It is no wonder that knowledge, wealth, pleasure, and accomplishment can never satisfy you, for you were created to contain God!</p><h2 class="head2" style="text-align:left">3. THE PARTS OF MAN</h2><p>Please continue by reading the next verse:</p><h1 class="scripture" style="font-weight:bold">&#8220;May your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete.&#8221;<br />1 Thessalonians 5:23</h1><p>Man is God&#8217;s vessel. The Bible divides this vessel into three parts-the spirit, the soul, and the body. See diagram below:</p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/MystHumanLife/3parts.gif" width="326" height="200" alt="Spirit - Soul - Body" border="0"></div><p>The BODY is simply the physical body, belonging to the physiological level, contacting the things of the material realm, and is the most superficial part.</p><p>The SOUL is the mental faculty, belonging to the psychological level, contacting the things of the mental realm, and is a deeper part.</p><p>The SPIRIT is the deepest part of man, belonging to the spiritual level, and contacts the things of God.</p><p class="indent1">For problems of the body one may see a doctor.<br />For problems of the mind one may visit a psychiatrist.<br />Yet only God can solve the problems of the spirit.</p><h2 class="head2" style="text-align:left">4. GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY</h2><p>God wants to enter into man&#8217;s spirit, to become his content and his satisfaction.</p><p>This is the purpose of human existence! You are not merely created to contain food in your stomach, or to contain knowledge in your mind, but <b>you are created to contain God in your spirit.</b></p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/MystHumanLife/God.gif" width="181" height="300" alt="God" border="0"></div><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Mystery of Human Life &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
