<h2 class=head2>Genuine Tongues Being a Dialect</h2><p>Pentecostal Christianity, reacting to the deadness of fundamental Christianity, cares mainly for the gifts, especially tongue-speaking. I spoke in tongues more than thirty-five years ago, but after carefully studying the Bible concerning this matter, I dropped this practice. By looking into the Bible with a Greek-English interlinear text, I discovered that the word tongue is two words in Greek. It is either glossa, referring to the speaking organ or a dialect, or dialektos, meaning “dialect.” Tongues and dialect are used interchangeably in Acts 2:4, 6, 8, and 11. However, some people speak in tongues by uttering nonsensical syllables or by repeating the same syllables over and over. Since they realize that these sounds are not a real dialect, they say that the tongue they are speaking is an unknown dialect or an angelic dialect. However, even the most simple dialect is composed of more than a few sounds.<p>In 1936 I became very involved with tongue-speaking, but as a student of the Bible I could not get through in my understanding of this matter. At that time I spoke with a certain leading one in the Assembly of God, who came to China from the west coast of the United States. He was over sixty years old and was supposed to be a scholar in Greek and in knowing the Bible. In our conversation, he told me that glossa does not necessarily mean a dialect. I then opened to Acts 2 and showed him that tongues and dialect are used interchangeably. I asked him to reconcile his teaching for me, but he could not. Eventually, he put his hands on my head and said, “Your head is too big.” With that he ended our conversation. That was also the end of my tongue-speaking.<p>In 1963 a new movement of tongue-speaking was very prevailing along the west coast of the United States under the leadership of a certain Episcopalian priest. This movement published a paper in Los Angeles called Trinity. In an editorial on the first page of one issue, the writer said that he had contacted two hundred tongue-speakers. Without exception, all two hundred doubted that their speaking in tongues was genuine. Still, because the writer was one hundred percent for tongue-speaking, he encouraged everyone to speak in tongues and not to doubt. Do you believe that Peter and the others doubted their experience of speaking in tongues on the day of Pentecost?<p>We must see through the subtlety of the enemy. If we ask a linguist to analyze a recording of man-made speaking in tongues, he will verify that it is false. Moreover, after someone speaks in tongues, someone else may interpret it, saying, “My people, time is short; I am coming quickly.” However, in the evening the same tongue may be spoken and interpreted as, “Be on the alert; there will be an earthquake.” The children of God should not be so foolish.<p>In 1963 I was invited to San Diego by a group of people who spoke in tongues. While I was there, one of the leaders turned to another Chinese brother and me and said, “Praise the Lord, God has given me the grace to speak Chinese!” He tried to speak something in Chinese, and then he turned to me to see whether or not I understood it. I said, “Brother, I’m sorry. I did not understand one word you spoke.” Then he began to speak again, uttering some sounds in a different way. Again, he turned to me, and I said, “I still do not understand anything.” He tried a third time, but the other brother and I still could not understand what he uttered. I told him, “I speak Mandarin and this brother speaks Cantonese. Between the two of us, we know the main dialects of Chinese. We cannot speak many of them, but we still can recognize them. However, we cannot understand one word of your speaking.” His was a man-made tongue.<p>Later, in one of the meetings of that congregation, an American woman in her fifties stood up and spoke a short sentence in a so-called tongue. Then a young American-born Chinese of about twenty years of age stood and interpreted her short tongue-speaking with a long interpretation. After the meeting, as a guest in the leader’s home, I asked him if he thought that the interpretation by the young Chinese man was genuine. He said, “No, I do not believe that it was genuine.” Two years later in Waco, Texas I met the young Chinese man who did the interpretation in San Diego. When I asked him about his interpretation of the tongue-speaking, he admitted that it was not a real interpretation. I can tell you many stories like this. I am not speaking something that I do not know. I have passed through these things, and I realize the real situation.<p>I do believe that there are genuine tongues today, but many so-called tongues spoken today are only human-manufactured tongues. In 1964 I was invited to dinner at the home of a brother who held a doctorate in physics. He shared with me his testimony about how he began to speak in tongues. He said that he spoke in tongues by exercising his jaw and turning his tongue a certain way. Then I responded by saying, “Brother, do you believe that on the day of Pentecost Peter turned his jaw a certain way?” After listening to his testimony, I realized that under the Lord’s mercy what I had experienced was much better than this. Because this brother was trained in a certain way by his denomination, he exercised his jaw and turned his tongue to make a strange sound which he call a tongue. However, there is no need to do this. Without doing this we can enjoy the Lord’s grace much more than he did.
