   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO CHRIST HIS PERSON 32</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall see more concerning what Christ is in His person to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>19.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The All-inclusive One with the Unsearchable Riches</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To the believers Christ is the all-inclusive One with the unsearchable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Ephesians 3:8 Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The riches of Christ are what Christ is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As God, He is the Father, the Son, the Spirit, the Lord, the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As man He is the Apostle, the Shepherd, the Forerunner, the Captain of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are countless aspects of the riches of Christ, for He is the reality of every positive thing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, Christ is the real gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without Him, we would drift away.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the One with the true holding power, Christ upholds the entire universe Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because all positive things signify Christ, when He was on earth He could use so many things as illustrations of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Using a door as a picture of Himself, He could say, "I am the door" John 10:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is also the real light, life, breath, water, food, clothing, and dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The riches of Christ also include both human virtues and divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is the real love, patience, and forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Apart from Christ we cannot love, be patient, or forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when we have Christ, we have the uplifted human virtues and also certain of the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As believers, we need to know and experience the unsearchable riches of Christ, which are for the producing of the church as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This takes place through the divine dispensing of Christ into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church is produced not by teaching nor by organizing but by the dispensing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more Christ is dispensed into us, the more life we have, the stronger life we have, the richer life we have, and the more uplifted the church life becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The riches of Christ produce the church through our experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On Christ's side it is a matter of dispensing; on our side it is a matter of experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we experience and enjoy the Christ who is dispensed into us, we become part of the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By absorbing the riches of Christ we become the Body of Christ as His fullness to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the Body of Christ is constituted of the riches of Christ that have been enjoyed and assimilated by us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The unsearchable riches are the fullness of the Godhead Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How all-inclusive and extensive these riches are!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The very fullness of the Godhead has become the unsearchable riches of Christ to be dispensed into us for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is significant that Paul's word concerning the unsearchable riches of Christ is found in the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are to know the real significance of these unsearchable riches, we need to consider the context of the whole book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may regard these riches merely as things such as peace, joy, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, if we touch the depths of Ephesians, we shall see that the unsearchable riches of the all-inclusive Christ are much more profound than joy, peace, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We certainly do not despise these things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, we may consider them too much according to our human understanding and need, not realizing that the unsearchable riches of Christ refer to something much more profound.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot say that joy, peace, and rest are unsearchable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word "unsearchable" in Ephesians 3:8 should cause us to realize that the unsearchable riches of Christ must refer to matters that are profound, far beyond our understanding.</S>
