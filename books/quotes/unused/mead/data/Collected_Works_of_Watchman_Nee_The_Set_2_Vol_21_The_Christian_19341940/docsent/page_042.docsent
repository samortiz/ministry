   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We ought to give heed!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The apostle included himself in this admonition.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do not know who the writer of Hebrews was.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some have said that it was Paul, and others have said that it was Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since it does not tell us who he was, we do not need to say anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God did not tell us his name, and we do not have to guess it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I will not say who wrote this book.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I will not do what the Bible has not done.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us suppose that it was written by the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can see how careful the apostle was.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said we and not you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The danger of drifting could happen to the apostle also.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There was danger to not only the Hebrews or the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the river crossers are included; even the apostle was included in this category.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here we find the Greek word pararrhueo.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This word has two meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first meaning is to leak away, to slip away; the second meaning is to drift away with the current and become lost.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are different translations of this word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some convey the sense of drifting, while others convey the sense of leaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But both meanings are present in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since both meanings are present, we will consider both meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This morning, my intention is to show you both meanings of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is leaking?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here is a pan of water.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose there is a hole in the pan, and you have to bring the pan from one end of the room to the other end and back, or suppose you have to bring the water from the well to the kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You have to run quickly because the water will drip away.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By the time you have the pan in the house, the water will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The apostle said that we should give heed lest we leak away.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that since we have heard so many things concerning the Lord Jesus, we should not allow them to leak away.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In some respects, I am very unhappy about Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you ask them the names of their sons, they can tell you right away.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They never forget the names of their sons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if you ask them what the Bible speaks of, what Matthew 1 or Mark 16 speaks of, they will not be able to remember a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am afraid that many people do not have the slightest idea what John 1 3 is about.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They may remember something while they are listening to a message in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But by the afternoon, they have forgotten many of the things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many people have a good memory about many things, but the things concerning Christ always leak away.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is impossible to talk to them about the things concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Friends, may I say an honest and seemingly unkind word: this proves where our heart is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We know where our door is and where our home is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet many of us are unclear about too many of the crucial matters in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These things have leaked away.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God has often given us the opportunity to hear things about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet much of what we have heard has leaked away.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We cannot deny this fact before God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot deny the fact that we have forgotten many things concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can say our mind is not sharp enough, but it is not a matter of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If there were something wrong with our mind, how could we still eat our meals properly and manage our houses properly?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Why do we not forget about the things of others?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I can accept our negligence of our own affairs or the affairs of others, but I cannot accept our negligence of the things of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have allowed them to leak away.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The problem among Christians today is that they have allowed God's word to slip away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When temptations come, everything of the Lord has leaked away.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a dangerous thing to be leaking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not only my danger; it was the apostle's danger also.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Temptations often come, and we desperately try to find a verse, but we cannot find one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We cannot find our weapon at the crucial hour, because there is leakage.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Why do we never forget the things that our children have asked us about?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why is it that they never leak away from us?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is one reason why so many people fall into the hand of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we do not have any leakage, we can immediately deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We cannot say, "Satan, I know that you are coming to tempt me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>So please wait, and let me go and find a verse."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do this, we will fail immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In His three dealings with Satan, the Lord Jesus did not slip once.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The problem today is that there is the leaking and there is the drifting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We can remember everything except the things of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Friends, I must say an unkind word we preachers often have to speak unkind words .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I have to say that this condition proves that our heart is not on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our heart is on the things of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is why we have forgotten Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If there were no hole, there would be no possibility of any leakage.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I do not know what your holes are.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In order to leak, there must be holes.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Without a hole, there cannot be any leakage.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It may be only a small hole, but as long as there is a hole, there is the leakage.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Without a hole, there would be no possibility of any leakage.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Why is it that many people have allowed the things of Christ to leak away?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The only reason is that they have paid too much attention to their family, their money, their children, their possessions, their business, or their education.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There has to be something to which your heart is attached, which becomes your hole and results in the leakage.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Some may be worse; they may have sins which they have not properly condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A few days ago, a missionary told me that he has met a few Christians who are not very honest and who lie a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is very pitiful that a Christian can lie and be dishonest.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We all have to find out where our hole is.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I do not know what kind of worldly things or sins have caused us to forget about and lose the things of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must find out if we have any holes and if the things of Christ have leaked away.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If there is dishonesty or other transgressions in us, we have to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When the sins are dealt with, the leaks will be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I know a brother who has a poor memory.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If you say two things to him, he will listen to the second and forget about the first.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He easily forgets.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He has been a Christian for six years.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Has his forgetfulness been a hole to him?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Not at all.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He forgets about everything, but he never allows anything concerning Christ to leak away.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If you speak to him about Christ, he remembers it very well.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If you speak to him about the world, he forgets about it right away.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He will tell you that he cannot remember so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I cannot excuse anyone for forgetting about the things concerning Christ, because God's Word does not excuse anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Do not think that a clever person with a good memory will remember every spiritual thing; do not think that they have an edge over the not-so-clever ones.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>There is not such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The wise ones are the same as the foolish ones; both are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>There may be differences in secular things, but there is no difference in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We cannot judge whether or not a person has had any leakage based on his memory.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I can prove to you in many ways that many people with poor memories do not have any leakage, because they are single in following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>You may not have lived in rural communities, and consequently, may not have seen many of these cases.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If you go to a country girl, or an old woman from a village, who does not have much knowledge, she may not be able to tell you much about the world.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>But if you tell her about the Lord, she can understand very well.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I met one Christian who was ninety-seven years old.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The book he wrote had the third largest circulation in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The book with the most circulation is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The second best-read book is The Pilgrim's Progress.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Other than these two books, no other book has been more widely circulated than the book this old man wrote, which is called Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>I met this old man once when he was ninety-seven years old.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>His memory had faded, and many times he could not even recognize his own daughter-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When I went to see him, I greeted him five times, but he could not respond to me.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>By the sixth or seventh time he was able to respond.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>All the worldly things had leaked away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>But the things of the Lord had not leaked away.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>He had not allowed anything that was revealed to him to leak away.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>He kept repeating, "I cannot live without Him, and He cannot live without me."</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>This was the only thing he said: "I cannot live without Him, and He cannot live without me."</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Everything with him was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>I can say that all the gray matter in his brain was practically gone.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>But the things of the Lord had not leaked away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Was not the woman by the well of Sychar able to drink to her satisfaction?</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>That Samaritan woman could fill herself up with the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>But if there had been a hole in her, everything would have been gone from her in two days.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>I must warn you honestly that you must deal with the things that cause the leakages.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Perhaps you are not single enough, or perhaps there is sin in you.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>I must say a word at the risk of offending you: The way we spend our money often exposes our holes.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>We allow ourselves to get by with a torn Bible, but we have the money to buy toy cars for our children.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>This shows the kind of things that we remember and the kind of things that we forget.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>It shows where our heart is.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>O Lord, be merciful to us!</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>What we forget in our heart can be expressed in the things that are without.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>If there is no hole in our heart, there is no possibility of a leakage.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Many people are not concerned about the things of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>I have to ask you to pardon me again for saying these things, but I feel that I have to say them.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Among us, many brothers and sisters are too pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>No matter what subject is brought up, they can easily join in the conversation; they have answers for everything and can carry on any conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>But once you speak of spiritual matters, they immediately become silent, as if this subject is beyond them.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Many people are clever in many things; they are astute and clear in their mind and sharp in their memory.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>But they cannot conduct any conversation on spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>This is a bad sign.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Here are holes!</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>We have allowed everything that we have heard to leak away.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>We have heard so much concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Where have we kept it?</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>May the Lord be merciful to us!</S>
