   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN JERUSALEM, JUDEA, AND SAMARIA</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PETER S COMPANY 8 Scripture Reading: Acts 3:1-26</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 3:1-26 we have Peter s second message to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verses 1 through 10 describe the healing of a lame man, and verses 11 through 26 record the actual message given by Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE HEALING OF A LAME MAN</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 3:1 says, Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have pointed out that in the initiation of God s New Testament economy, the early believers and even the first group of apostles were not clear that God had forsaken Judaism with its practices and facilities, including the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this reason, according to their tradition and habit, they still went to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The early believers were not clear concerning God s New Testament economy with respect to the Judaic temple.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not even the early apostles had a clear vision concerning God s abandonment of the Judaic things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, even after God s pouring out the Spirit upon them on the day of Pentecost to initiate a new dispensation, they still did not separate themselves from the Judaic temple.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the initial stage God tolerated their ignorance in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But this led to a mixture of the church with Judaism, a mixture that was not condemned by the early church in Jerusalem see 21:20-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually the temple was destroyed by Titus with his Roman army in A.D. 70, as prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 23:38 and 24:2.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That destruction cleared up the religious mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Peter and John, who were about to go into the temple, saw a certain man who was lame from his mother s womb, they gazed at him and said, Look at us!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>3:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The man paid attention to them, expecting to receive something from them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But Peter said, Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene walk!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up; and his feet and ankles were instantly made strong vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter did not possess silver and gold, but St. Peter s Cathedral in Rome was constructed with a superabundance of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not have silver and gold, but he had the name, the Person, of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was poor in silver and gold, but he was rich in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Roman Church is filled with gold, but not with the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She is rich in gold but poor in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In speaking to the lame man, Peter told him to walk in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nazarene indicates the One despised by the Jewish leaders John 1:45-46; Acts 22:8; 24:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>PETER S MESSAGE Turning the People s Attention from Miracles</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>to the Person of the Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peter and John did a miracle, and the people paid their attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But in his speaking Peter turned the attention of the people from the miracle to a Person, to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although Peter and John had performed a miracle, Peter did not talk about the miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, he used the miracle as a basis to turn his audience to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He turned the people s attention from the healing to the Healer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Peter s message was based on the miracle of the healing of the lame man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, it was not Peter s burden to talk about divine healing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, his burden was to propagate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was burdened to speak forth Christ, to speak out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Peter s burden was to speak Christ directly into others so they may become Christ s propagation to be His living members in order that Christ may have a Body on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Pentecost is for the propagation of Christ, not for miracles, wonders, signs, and divine healing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All those things are minor.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even though a lame man was healed through Peter and John, Peter s emphasis was not on healing but on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First, Peter said to the lame man, In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene walk!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then in his message he went on to say, By faith in His name, His name has made this man strong, whom you behold and know v. 16 . Therefore, Peter did not preach divine healing or miracles; he preached the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although Peter turned the attention of the people from the healing to the Healer, today Christians who emphasize healing often direct people s attention from the Healer to healing, even a false healing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many of the so-called healings in Pentecostal meetings are not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After the lame man was healed, he stood and walked and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God v. 8 . This was a genuine healing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nevertheless, Peter directed the people to the Healer, to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We also should turn our attention away from healing to the Healer.</S>
