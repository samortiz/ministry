   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNOWING THAT THE FATHER, SON, AND SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ARE ONE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the Bible, we teach that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Isaiah 9:6 says that a Son has been given to us, yet His name is called the everlasting Father, or the eternal Father, or Father of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This matches the Lord s word concerning Himself and the Father recorded in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus said that He, the Son, came in the name of the Father John 5:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord never said of Himself that He was the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But He did say that He was the Son coming in the Father s name.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In chapter fourteen of the Gospel of John the Lord also says that if we see Him, we see the Father v. 9 . Furthermore, in this chapter the Lord says that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So He says in John 10:30 the Father and the Son are one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we confess Him, we also have the Father 1 John 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, He is also the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we have Him dwelling in us, we also have both the Father and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you not have the Lord Jesus in you?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Surely you do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you not also have the Father and the Spirit in you?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You certainly have also both the Father and the Spirit in you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How many, then, do we have within us?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From experience we know that we have only One within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This One who dwells in us is the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE TRIUNE GOD BECOMING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>OUR EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to be impressed with the fact that the anointing is the moving of the Triune God enjoyed and experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The moving of the Triune God within us who becomes our enjoyment and experience is the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The anointing here in chapter two of 1 John refers to our experience of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is this experience that teaches us the things concerning the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John s word concerning the anointing here was written to the young children, to those who are the youngest in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even the youngest believers have experienced the Lord within them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They can testify from their experience that the One who lives in them is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE TASTE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need the proper experience of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From the taste in our experience we know the things concerning the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, how do you know whether sugar tastes sweet or bitter?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The way to know is to taste a little of it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The taste will teach you whether it is bitter or sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a similar way, our experience, our taste, of the Triune God will teach us concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John s intention in 2:18-27 is to warn the young children about the antichrists and their heretical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In these verses John seems to be saying, Do not listen to all these false teachings about the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have a Teacher within you, and this Teacher is the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not give heed to what the antichrists say, but listen to your experience of the Triune God s moving as the anointing within you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Praise the Lord for the experience of the teaching of the anointing concerning the Triune God!</S>
