[3]  THE LAST WEEK OF THE SEVENTY WEEKS Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 1:19; Matt 24:32-44; Luke 21:25-36; Rev 3:10-11; Dan 9:24-27 new translation
[4]  In my study of the Bible in the past, I did not realize as I do today how John the apostle was so one with Daniel the prophet.
[5]  During Daniel's time, the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and the temple and captured the Jews in 606 B.C. About seventy years later, Daniel received the revelation of the seventy weeks cf.
[6]  About A.D. 100, John wrote the book of Revelation, so the time between the writing of Daniel and the book of Revelation is about six hundred years.
[7]  B. The Standing and Angle of Daniel and John
[8]  John was in exile on the island of Patmos Rev 1:9b ; his heart was for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus in participating in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus Rev 1:9 ; and he was in his spirit on the Lord's day, seeking after the Lord and looking to His appearing Rev 1:10 .
[9]  After the sixty-two weeks and before the last week of the seventy weeks, there was an interval, the length of which is not revealed and in which was the destruction of the city of Jerusalem and the sanctuary by the people of the prince the Roman army of Titus in A.D. 70; and the end of it would be with a flood, and there would be war even to the end; the desolations were determined Dan 9:26b . The interval after the sixty-two weeks and before the last week of the seventy weeks is the age of grace and the age of the church.
[10]  THE LAST WEEK OF THE SEVENTY WEEKS A. At the Beginning
[11]  Being the Last Seven Years of the Present Age
[12]  The seven years of the last week will be the last seven years of the present age of the mysteries of God, concerning Messiah Christ , the children of Israel, the believers, and the church.
[13]  The second half of the last week, the last three and a half years of this age, will be the time of the great tribulation Matt 24:21, 15 , beginning from the sixth seal of the seven seals Rev 6:12-17 and ending at the seventh bowl of the seven bowls Rev 16:17-21 , which will be "the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth" Rev 3:10 .
[14]  Before the three and a half years of the great tribulation, the overcomers among the believers will be raptured into Christ's presence parousia in the heavens Rev 12:5-6; 14:1; Luke 21:34-36; Matt 24:36-44 .
[15]  The fact that the universal woman, who symbolizes the majority of the saints, will be nourished for three and a half years in a place on the earth prepared by God for the living saints Rev 12:6, 14 , indicates and proves that the majority of the living saints will be raptured after the fulfillment of the three and a half years of the great tribulation; that should be in the last year of the three and a half years.
[16]  IN SEEKING THE LORD'S APPEARING A. Giving Heed to the Prophetic Word
[17]  We need to take heed to ourselves lest our hearts be weighed down with debauchery and drunkenness and anxieties of life, and that day of the great tribulation come upon us unexpectedly as a snare, as it will come in upon all those who dwell on all the earth; and furthermore, we need to be watchful at every time, beseeching that we may prevail to escape all the things of the great tribulation in the last three and a half years of the last week of the present age and to stand before the Son of Man, Christ Luke 21:34-36 .
[18]  OF THE SEVEN SEALS Scripture Reading: Rev 4:2-3; 5:1-7; 6:1-17; 8:1-2
[19]  Before John, the writer of Revelation, saw the seven seals, he first saw a scene, a view, in the heavens Rev 4:2-3; 5:1-7; 6:1-17; 8:1-2 .
[20]  This scene in heaven was immediately after Christ's ascension into the heavens see Rev 5:6, note 3 Recovery Version .
[21]  Revelation 6:11 says, "And to each of them was given a white robe; and it was said to them that they should rest yet a little while, until the number of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed even as they were should be completed also."
[22]  This supernatural calamity is the initiation of the great tribulation Matt 24:21 , consisting of all the calamities, plagues, and woes from this sixth seal to the last bowl of the seven bowls Rev 16:17-21 .
[23]  Now we come to the positive side of the contents of the seven trumpets, of the seventh seal.
[24]  The kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever Rev 11:15, 17b .
[25]  OF THE SEVEN TRUMPETS Scripture Reading: Rev 8:1-13; 9:1-21; 10:7; 11:15-18; John 5:28-29; Dan 12:2; 1 Cor 15:52; 1 Thes 4:16-17; Rev 14:14-16; 2 Cor 5:10; Rev 19:7-9; 16:13-20; 17:14; 19:11-21; 18:1 19:4; 20:1-15; 21:1 22:5
[26]  In Revelation 8:3, "another Angel" refers to Christ, and "incense" signifies Christ with all His merits, which Christ adds to the prayers of the saints that the saints' prayers may be acceptable to God.
[27]  Revelation 8:13 says, "And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell on the earth because of the remaining sounds of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to trumpet."
[28]  The seventh trumpet comprises the resurrection of the dead saints and their being raptured with the majority of the living saints into Christ's parousia presence in the air 1 Cor 15:52; 1 Thes 4:16-17; Rev 14:14-16 .
[29]  After the destruction of Antichrist, the false prophet, and those who follow them, the devil, Satan, the dragon, the ancient serpent, will be bound and imprisoned in the abyss by an angel for one thousand years Rev 20:1-3 .
[30]  The judgment at the great white throne, after the earth and heaven fled away, is to judge the unbelieving dead with the demons Rev 20:11-15 .
[31]  OF THE SEVEN BOWLS Scripture Reading: Rev 11:18a, 18e; 14:8; 17:1-6, 15-16; 17:11-14; 19:11-21; 16:19b; 18:1 19:5; 20:1-3; 14:6-7, 9-11; Matt 25:31-33, 41-46a; Rev 20:7-10, 12-15; 15:7 16:16; 14:17-20; Isa 63:1-6; 1 Cor 15:52; Rev 16:17-21
[32]  The positive contents are the finishing of the mystery of God, as God announced the good news to His own slaves the prophets Rev 10:7 , the coming of the eternal kingdom of God and of Christ, in which He shall reign forever and ever Rev 11:15-17 , the giving of the reward to the prophets, to the saints, and to the God-fearing people at the judgment seat of Christ Rev 11:18 , the marriage of the Lamb Rev 19:7-9 , the kingdom of a thousand years Rev 20:4-6 , and the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem Rev 21:1 22:5 .
[33]  I. THE NEGATIVE CONTENTS OF THE SEVENTH TRUMPET A. The Wrath of God,
[34]  The negative contents of the seventh trumpet are the coming of God's wrath because the nations were wroth Rev 11:18a .
[35]  After mentioning the fall of religious Babylon, Revelation 14 speaks of the warning against the worship of Antichrist in the great tribulation Rev 14:9-12 , the blessing of the martyrs in the great tribulation Rev 14:13 , the harvest of believers close to the end of the great tribulation Rev 14:14-16 , and the gathering of the grapes the evildoers at the end of the great tribulation Rev 14:17-20 .
[36]  The destruction of those who destroy the earth also includes the burning of those who join the last rebellion of mankind Rev 20:7-9 .
[37]  Revelation 16:2 says, "And the first went and poured out his bowl into the earth; and there came an evil and malignant sore upon the men who have the mark of the beast and worship his image."
[38]  The vision inserted between the sixth and seventh bowls is the gathering for the war at Armageddon Rev 16:13-16 .
[39]  The great earthquake causes the city of Jerusalem and the cities of the nations to fall Rev 16:19a .
[40]  CHAPTER FIVE THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS
[41]  OF THE THREE AND A HALF YEARS Scripture Reading: Rev 12:14; Dan 7:25; 12:7; Rev 11:2; 13:5; 11:3; 12:6; Matt 28:20; 13:39, 40, 49; 24:3; Dan 12:13; Rev 20:11-15; 11:15; Dan 9:24; Rev 3:10; 6:12-17; 7:1-8, 9-17; 8:7-13; 9:1-11; 12:9, 11-12; 9:12-21; 10:1-7; 11:1-13; 20:4-6; 14:14-16; 1 Cor 15:22; 1 Thes 4:16-17; Rev 11:18c; 2 Cor 5:10; Rev 19:5-10; 11:14; 15:1, 7-8; 16:1-16; 17:12-14; 19:11-21; 14:17-20; 16:17-21; 20:1-3; 14:6-7, 9-11; Matt 25:31-33, 41-46; Rev 12:13-17; 13:1-18; 14:8, 12; 15:2-4; Dan 12:11-12; Joel 2:14
[42]  Thus far in our fellowship, we have seen the prophecy of the four "sevens" in the Bible the last seven years of the present age the last week of the seventy weeks , the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls.
[43]  The three and a half years, called "a time, and times, and half a time" in Revelation 12:14 as a quotation from Daniel 7:25 and 12:7, equals forty-two months Rev 11:2; 13:5 or a thousand two hundred and sixty days Rev 11:3; 12:6 .
[44]  The last three and a half years will be for the Lord, on the positive side, to bring in His eternal kingdom and the eternal righteousness Rev 11:15; Dan 9:24 .
[45]  According to the Lord's promise to the overcomers in Revelation 3:10 that the overcomers will be kept out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth the rapture of the overcomers, both the man-child in Revelation 12 and the firstfruit in Revelation 14, must be before the sixth seal, the supernatural calamities on the earth and on the heavens Rev 6:12-17 .
[46]  Joel 2:30-31 firstly has the "blood" of the first and second trumpets, the "fire" of the first, second, and third trumpets Rev 8:7-10 , the "smoke" of the fifth trumpet Rev 9:1-3 , and then the "sun" and "moon" of the sixth seal Rev 6:12 .
[47]  D. The Record of a Great Multitude Standing before God's Throne and before the Lamb
[48]  after the Sixth Seal, Implying That the Rapture of the Believers Should Begin
[49]  The record of a great multitude standing before God's throne and before the Lamb in Revelation 7:9-17, given immediately after the sixth seal, implies that the rapture of the believers should begin before the opening of the sixth seal.
[50]  The first four trumpets, consisting of the four aspects of the intensified supernatural calamities on the earth and on the heavens Rev 8:7-12 , will take place at the very beginning of the three and a half years, as a direct continuation of the sixth seal, the initiation of the supernatural calamities, and will probably all be trumpeted on the same day.
[51]  Christ will come to the air probably before the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet Rev 10:7a , for the purpose of taking full possession of the earth Rev 10:1-7 .
[52]  The city of Jerusalem will be trampled by Antichrist for forty-two months, that is, a thousand two hundred sixty days, during the great tribulation, and the two witnesses of the Lord will prophesy during that time and will be killed by Antichrist and resurrected to be raptured into Christ's parousia presence in the air Rev 11:1-12 .
[53]  Included in the seventh trumpet is the rapture of the two witnesses into Christ's parousia presence in the air Rev 11:12 .
[54]  Revelation 12:6 says that the woman, symbolizing the majority of the saints, will be nourished in a place prepared by God for a thousand two hundred sixty days, or three and a half years.
[55]  The seven bowls are the third woe Rev 11:14 , the last seven plagues to finish the fury of God Rev 15:1 , as God's most severe judgment on men, the main part of the plagues of the seventh trumpet Rev 15:7 16:1 .
[56]  When the fifth bowl is poured out, the kingdom of Antichrist will become darkened Rev 16:10-11 .
[57]  This war will be waged by Antichrist, his false prophet, the ten kings, and their armies Rev 16:13-16 , who will be defeated by Christ and His overcomers Rev 17:12-14; 19:11-21 , in the treading of the great winepress of the fury of God Rev 14:17-20; Isa 63:2-3 .
[58]  The negative side of the seventh trumpet also includes the binding and imprisoning of Satan in the abyss for one thousand years Rev 20:1-3 .
[59]  Following the defeat of Antichrist, Satan will be bound and imprisoned to clear up the rebellious earth that the kingdom of Christ may come Rev 20:4-6 .
[60]  At the very beginning of the three and a half years of the great tribulation, Satan and his angels will be cast to the earth and will persecute "the woman," consisting of the majority of the believers those who remain and have the testimony of Jesus and the Jews who keep the commandments of God , until the end of the great tribulation Rev 12:9, 12-13, 15-17 .
[61]  Antichrist, as the Beast Coming out of the Sea,
[62]  IN THE SCRIPTURES MADE MORE FIRM Scripture Reading: Luke 3:15; John 1:19-25, 45-46; 7:40-42; Matt 2:1-12, 19-23; Luke 2:39; Matt 3:13; Dan 9:24-27; Matt 24:15; Rev 11:2; 13:1-8; 2 Thes 2:3-10; Dan 12:2; John 5:28-29; Rev 20:4, 6, 11-15; 1 Cor 15:20-23, 52; 1 Thes 4:16; Matt 24:39-42; Luke 21:36; Rev 3:10; 12:5; 14:1-5; 1 Thes 4:15-17; Rev 14:14-16; 15:2; Dan 7:7-8; Rev 17:8, 10-11; 16:16; Judg.
[63]  5:19; 2 Kings 23:29; Zech 12:11; Rev 14:18-20; 19:13-15; Isa 63:1-6; Rev 1:7; Matt 24:26-28; Rev 19:19-20; 2 Pet 1:19; Luke 21:34; Rev 2:26, 28
[64]  IN THE OLD TESTAMENT A. The People of Israel Expecting the Coming
[65]  Before the Lord Jesus was born, a number of the children of Israel were expecting to meet their Messiah because they came to know, at least partially, the prophecies of the Old Testament, which spoke of God giving His people a Messiah, the Anointed One.
[66]  Antichrist, as the seventh Caesar of the Roman Empire, will be killed and resurrected with the spirit from the abyss of Nero, the fifth Caesar of the Roman Empire, to be the eighth Caesar of the Roman Empire Rev 17:8, 10-11; 13:3 .
[67]  Revelation 17:8a says, "The beast whom you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go into destruction."
[68]  The war at Armageddon is Christ's treading of the great winepress of the fury of God Rev 14:18-20; 19:13-15 , which will begin from Bozrah the royal city of Edom Isa 63:1-6 and extend to Megiddo, a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia, that is, one hundred eighty-two miles, the city of Jerusalem being in the middle of this distance Rev 14:20 .
[69]  Revelation 19:13 says that the returning Christ is "clothed with a garment dipped in blood."
[70]  The garment of Christ is dipped in blood and becomes red by His treading of the winepress of the fury of God at Bozrah, where the blood will rise "up to bridles of the horses for a thousand six hundred stadia" Rev 14:20 .
[71]  The prophetic word of the Scripture, as the shining lamp to the believers, conveys spiritual light to shine in their darkness not merely knowledge in letters for mental apprehension , guiding them to enter into a bright day, even to pass through the dark night until the day of the Lord's appearing dawns and the morning star rises in their hearts.
[72]  Question: Are the overcomers who have already been raptured to the throne included in the judgment in the air at the judgment seat of Christ?
[73]  Answer: All the believers have to appear before the judgment seat of Christ 2 Cor 5:10 .
