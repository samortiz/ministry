<h1 class="title">EVERYONE DILIGENTLY LEARNING<br />
THE TRUTH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FAILURE OF CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the failure of Christianity over the past two thousand years. This failure lies in the fact that only &ldquo;famous&rdquo; speakers speak in their meetings, and the audience does nothing but listen. This can be compared to a person being required only to listen to famous teachers at school. He listens in elementary school, high school, college, and even in graduate school, but he does not do any work on his own. The end result is that he can do nothing. He may have listened to lectures on chemistry, mathematics, and other subjects, but he has gained nothing and consequently has no usefulness.</p>
<p>Many among us have been saved for a long time and have been meeting regularly. However, not many can clearly speak the truth. Not many can give a clear word on the parts of man, the function of each part, or even the difference between justification and sanctification. Our continual listening to &ldquo;famous&rdquo; speakers has caused us to become loose in our life practices and to lose our pursuit in the truth. The result of our listening to famous speakers is that we do not endeavor to study the truth. We have wasted our time and have gained nothing. This is our failure.</p>
<p>For this reason we are determined to change the system, but this is not easy to accomplish. We have raised up numerous churches during the past fifty years, and we have learned much from our observation and experience. Without a doubt all the saints love the Lord, the church, and the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. By 1984, however, we saw that the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, whether in Taiwan or in America, had become lukewarm. The church in Taipei has decreased in number instead of increasing. In spite of all the faithful labor, there is no result. This is also the situation in all of Christianity. Our practice has been wrong. We should not have allowed the brothers and sisters to always listen to famous speakers. We need to attend classes and study. I hope that the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery would not be Christians who only listen to famous speakers; rather, we would be Christians who attend classes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR EDUCATION</h2>
<p>The best example that proves the success of education is Taiwan. It is difficult to find a society as stable, prosperous, abundant in knowledge, and excellent in manpower as Taiwan. The primary reason for this situation is the availability of education. Many people have received higher education and are able to develop products that can compete in the world market. As a result, many riches have been brought to this country. This accomplishment has caused much admiration among Westerners.</p>
<p>When we built the workers&rsquo; home in 1954, we imported flush toilets from abroad because plumbing equipment in Taiwan was outdated. The flush toilets presently used in Taiwan, however, are more advanced than those in America. Success in education has enabled Taiwan to achieve what it was unable to achieve thirty years ago. Over the past thirty years, the people in Taiwan have become educated, and their knowledge has developed. If this can happen in a nation, it can happen in the church. Everything in Taiwan today is advanced, but everything in the church is still according to the old way. Even though the Lord has blessed us abundantly, we delay Him because we maintain our old ways. It is reasonable for us to maintain our strong points, but to maintain our old practices is a dreadful and serious mistake. Therefore, whether we are young or old, we need to change. First, we need a change in concept, and second, we need a change in practice. We must all start afresh to learn.</p>
<p>The practice in Christianity has unconsciously bound all the saints. This practice requires the saints only to attend a Sunday service and give a monetary offering. Such a practice annuls the function of the saints and edifies only the preachers. We may say that we do not have this practice among us, but the principle of everyone listening to a &ldquo;famous&rdquo; speaker is equivalent to this practice. The brothers and sisters have developed the habit of sitting in the meetings and listening to gifted brothers give messages. This habit annuls the gift we have received from the Lord. We have all been regenerated by the Lord and have His life. This life brings us a gift as our function. This can be compared to a newborn baby who has a complete set of internal organs. Having a complete set of organs does not mean that the baby is fully developed in function. It simply means that the baby has complete organs. As the baby grows, the function of each organ will be manifested. Function is the issue of the growth in life. When a child grows to a certain stage, he will begin to speak, and when he reaches another stage, he can learn to read. This also applies to the gift a person receives when he is regenerated; the function of the gift is manifested through his growth in life.</p>
<p>We are living Christians. Since we have been regenerated and have God&rsquo;s life in us, we should grow in life in order for our function to be manifested. If after two years a child cannot speak, his mother will worry even to the extent of losing her appetite, because she is concerned that the child might be dumb. Our practice in the churches has made people dumb. Many saints in the churches have listened to messages for decades and have become dumb because they do not speak. On the contrary, many young people like to speak, but they do not have any content. Hence, the crucial point is not merely to speak but to speak with content. This depends on education.</p>
