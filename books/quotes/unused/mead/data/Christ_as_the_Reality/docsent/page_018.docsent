   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE SPICES OF THE MEAL OFFERING Scripture Reading: Lev 2:4-16; 6:14-18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is important to see the significance of the spices of the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are always spices in a proper recipe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the meal offering, there are three positive spices and two negative spices.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fine flour is not a spice, but is the main substance and ingredient for preparing the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Added to the fine flour are a number of spices mentioned in Leviticus 2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE OIL</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first spice is the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have mentioned this in the previous chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all know that in typology oil signifies the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I use the word "divine" instead of "holy" because Christians today have many deviant concepts related to the words "Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this chapter I prefer to use divine Spirit, for the divine Spirit is just the divinity of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fine flour signifies the humanity of Jesus, and the oil signifies the divinity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So the oil is the divine spice added to the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jesus is a man, yet He is mingled and anointed with the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The divine Spirit is not only mingled with the humanity of Jesus, but also anoints His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The mingling is deeper than the anointing, but the anointing is more apparent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For instance, in Leviticus 2, the fine flour from the pan must be mingled with the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then it becomes a certain form to be divided into portions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then, after being divided into portions, oil is poured upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"And if thy oblation be a meal offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thou shall part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meal offering" Lev 2:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the mingling, there is still the need of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The mingling takes place within, inwardly, whereas the anointing is accomplished without, outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From His birth, Jesus was mingled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was born of the Holy Spirit; this means that His humanity was mingled already with the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But at the time He was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in the form of a dove Matt 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was not only mingled within with the divine Spirit, but also anointed without with the divine Spirit in the form of a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was not just anointed in an abstract way, but anointed with the Spirit in a definite form, as a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So we see that the oil, as a spice of the meal offering, was mingled with the fine flour and was also used to anoint the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jesus, as our meal offering, was both mingled and anointed with the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE FRANKINCENSE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The second spice in the meal offering is frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In typology, frankincense signifies the fragrance of the resurrection life and nature of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even before He was crucified and resurrected, there was always something so sweet and fragrant in all His behavior and activities.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That was the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the humanity of Jesus, the meal offering, there is the spice of the divine Spirit and the spice of the resurrection life.</S>
