   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church is a very important subject in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church is a central topic from Matthew to Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we read the New Testament carefully, we will see that an important goal of the Holy Spirit, who inspired the writers of the New Testament, is to reveal the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, we must study the New Testament in order to see the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We will briefly look at twenty-two major points and ten golden principles concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>GOD S PLAN FOR THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The church, according to the eternal purpose which He made Eph 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Ephesians specifically speaks of God s plan and heart s desire for the church in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God planned the church before the foundation of the world in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Before anything was created, before the beginning of time, God planned to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, the church is according to His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Any plan that a person makes comes out of his heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is true of God s plan for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>According to the Bible, the church is something that God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This desire did not arise after the creation of the world in time; it was always present in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thus, God planned to have the church according to His eternal heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to our understanding, we regard the church as something in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many think that the church came into being when sinners became Christians; thus, the church is also regarded as something related to our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These concepts are very shortsighted and not according to God s revelation concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In God s New Testament revelation, He clearly and definitely shows that the church comes out of His eternal heart s desire and that the church exists because of His eternal desire and plan.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The church is not an idea or arrangement made by God after the creation of the world, nor does it exist because of man s need.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The church is not temporal, temporary, or accidental.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It did not happen by chance.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The church exists because of God s deep, eternal, and holy plan according to His deep, eternal, and holy desire.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, we should not look at the church from our perspective based on our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In order to properly see the church, we must see it from the perspective of God s eternal desire and according to His eternal plan</S>
