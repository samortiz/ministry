   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE COMING OF ANTICHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, regarding the coming antichrist, Bible teachers have followed different interpretations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For instance, in his reference Bible, Dr. Scofield says that the antichrist will be the second beast in Revelation 13, the beast from the earth: The many antichrists precede and prepare the way for the Antichrist, who is the Beast out of the earth of Rev 13:11-17, and the false prophet of Rev 16:13; 19:20; 20:10.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is the last ecclesiastical head, as the Beast of Rev 13:1-8 is the last civil head.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For purposes of persecution he is permitted to exercise the autocratic power of the emperor-Beast.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In contrast to Scofield s understanding, other Bible teachers say that the first beast of Revelation 13 will be the antichrist and that the second beast will be the false prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But Scofield says that the second beast, the false prophet, will be the antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that Dr. Scofield says that the false prophet will be the antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The New Scofield Reference Bible in its note offers a somewhat different interpretation: Many identify the beast coming up out of the earth as the Antichrist....If the beast coming up out of the earth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>11-17 is the Antichrist, he is the same as the false prophet of 16:13; 19:20; 20:10.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because the word antichrist is never directly applied to him, however, some have considered the term antichrist, defined in the sense against Christ, as applying to the first beast vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1-10 , who is the political ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is clear, therefore, that Bible teachers have different interpretations in the matter of to whom the title antichrist should be applied.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have considered this matter in order to point out that there will not be just one antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I do not think that any Bible teacher would dare to say that only the coming man of lawlessness, the son of destruction, is the antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not be so definite as to teach that there will be only one antichrist and that before the coming of this one there will not be any other antichrists.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But due to traditional teachings, many Christians have the concept that only one person will be the antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Bible teachers often speak about the antichrist, giving the impression that antichrist is a proper noun referring only to one person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, according to John s use of this term in 2:18, 22; 4:3; and 2 John 7, this is a general title, a title referring to a category of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not a unique, proper title referring to one particular person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the title antichrist is different from the title Christ, for there is only one Christ and anyone who claims to be Christ is either a false Christ or an antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we should not use the word antichrist as if it were a proper noun.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regarding this, translators of the Bible hold different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, in his translation Wuest capitalizes antichrist, thus making it a proper noun.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Berkeley version does the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, J. N. Darby does not capitalize this word in his New Translation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, the word antichrist is not capitalized in the King James Version, the American Standard Version, or in the New American Standard Version.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not scriptural to say that there will be only one antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But it is also wrong to say that the man of lawlessness, the son of destruction who exalts himself above all that is called God, is not an antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That person should definitely be regarded as an antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Matthew 24 the false prophets are of one category, and the false Christs are of another category.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Matthew 24:24 the Lord Jesus clearly speaks of both false Christs and false prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in John s Epistles the false prophets are antichrists.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we have pointed out, some Bible teachers say that the first beast in Revelation 13 will be the antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But Scofield and others say that the second beast, the false prophet, will be the antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to Scofield s interpretation, the antichrist is in the same category as the false prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What conclusion should we draw from all these considerations?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Should we regard the false prophets and the antichrists as two different categories?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In a sense, we may understand them as two distinct categories.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, however, the false prophets and the false Christs are all anti- Christ, against Christ, and hence are all antichrists.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the following message we shall consider the principle of antichrist.</S>
