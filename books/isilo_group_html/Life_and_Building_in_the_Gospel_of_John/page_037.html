<p>John the Baptist said, &ldquo;He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God&rdquo; (vv. 33-34). John did not say that the Lord Jesus was the Christ or even that He was a Rabbi; he only spoke of Him as the Son of God. John spoke according to revelation, not religious concepts. The use of titles such as <em>Rabbi, King of Israel,</em> and <em>Messiah</em> all indicate the influence of religious concepts.</p>
<p>John the Baptist was a forerunner, and he spoke according to revelation in the midst of the background of Judaism. The Messiah, the Prophet, or Elijah are not more significant than the Lamb and the dove. Today both Christians and Gentiles pay more attention to religious concepts involving the Messiah, the Prophet, and Elijah than they do to the revelation of the Lord as the Lamb and as the One upon whom the Spirit descends and abides as a dove. On one hand, He is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world; on the other hand, the Spirit abides on Him as a dove so that people may receive the Holy Spirit. This is not a religious concept; it is a revelation of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S WORK DEPENDING UPON<br />
THE LAMB AND THE DOVE</h2>
<p>The Lord as the Word became flesh in order to enter into us as life so that we may receive God, experience God, and enjoy God fully. Moreover, He wants us to enjoy God to the extent that we are mingled with God as one and built up by God as His dwelling place. The fulfillment of this desire depends upon the Lamb and the dove. The religious background and environment of the Messiah, the Prophet, and Elijah do not matter; only the Lamb and the dove matter. The Word, who was in the beginning, became a lowly man, grew up in a despised place, and as the Lamb of God, took away the sin of the world. Furthermore, the dove, signifying the Spirit, is upon Him for the purpose of imparting the Spirit of God to man. As the Lamb of God, He solves man&rsquo;s problem of sin before God. The Lamb has taken away the sin of man before God. As the One who has the dove, the Holy Spirit, He can supply all of the fullness of God to man.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s purpose in this universe is not merely that man would draw near and contact Him but that man would receive Him as grace and reality. God desires to enter into man to be life, to live in man, to mingle Himself with man, and to become one with man. This is God&rsquo;s desire. God created man as a vessel to contain God Himself. However, before God could enter into man, sin entered into man, and man was filled with sins. God&rsquo;s intention that we be filled with grace and reality was hindered by our being filled with vanity and refuse related to our fleshly lusts, covetousness, preferences, and perverseness. These problems had to be solved before God could enter into us.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus came to solve these problems, but He did not come as the Messiah or the Prophet, much less as Elijah; He came as the Lamb of God. According to the righteousness of God, He took away our defilement related to sin and sins. On the cross He solved the problem of sin. When John the Baptist testified, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God&rdquo; (v. 29), he was implying that our relationship with the Lord is not based on His being the Messiah, the Prophet, or Elijah but rather on His being the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world. He came to be the Lamb of God because of our need for redemption. The Lamb of God, not the Messiah, is needed for redemption. Man&rsquo;s problem before God is sin, but the Messiah cannot solve the problem of sin; only the Lamb of God can solve this problem. The Lord came to be the Lamb of God to solve man&rsquo;s problem and to remove the barrier of sin between man and God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Spirit was upon the Lord Jesus as a dove. The Lord has the Holy Spirit, and He even is the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). He is in the Holy Spirit, and He gives the Holy Spirit to man. When the hidden Triune God is manifested among men, He is expressed through the Son. When the Triune God enters into man and mingles Himself with man, He is experienced as the Spirit. The Spirit is the transfiguration of God, and as the Spirit, God enters into man and mingles Himself with man. As the Lamb, He removed man&rsquo;s sin on the negative side, and through Him as the One who has the dove, man can receive God on the positive side. When a person receives Him as the Lamb of God, his sins are taken away before God, and when a person receives Him as the One who has the dove, he can receive God, experience God, and be filled with God as his enjoyment.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life and Building in the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 37</div><br></body></html>
