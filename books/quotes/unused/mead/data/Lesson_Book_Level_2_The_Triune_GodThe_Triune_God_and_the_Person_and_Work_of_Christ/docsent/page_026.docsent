   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE VINE AND THE BRANCHES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 15 the Lord Jesus describes God's economy as a vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 15:1 Jesus says: "I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 15:5 He says, "I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. The Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The vine tree is a picture of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Father is the husbandman farmer .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is the source and originator of this vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was planted by Him and is cultivated and supplied by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is even its soil, its sunshine, and its air.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord said, "I am the vine."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Son is the vine, which is the embodiment of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All that the Father is, has, and does is wrapped up in this vine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later, in John 15:26, the Spirit is revealed as the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We know this Spirit brings all that the Father is and has, and makes it our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit is the sap, the life juice, that flows in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This great vine is the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>An organism is something that is living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All that the Father is is in this organism, embodied in this vine, which is the Second of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Within the vine is the circulating life-flow of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is the Spirit who carries the riches of the Father to sustain the vine and its branches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. The Believers</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But in this picture there is not only the Triune God; we are also a part of this wonderful vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord says, "I am the vine, you are the branches."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The branches of the vine are its body; if you cut off all the branches you would be left with just a bare stem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There would be no body and no branching out.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the same way, the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are the branches of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We live in the vine and the Spirit flows through us, bringing us all the riches of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way we are the expression of the Triune God, the branching out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are vital to Him, for without us He has no way to be fully expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The picture in John 15 shows us what the Body of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is the Triune God and His believers blended into one living organism.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is not an organization; it is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The ultimate intention of the Triune God is that He might be worked into us and mingled with us until He and we become a mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That means God abides in us and we abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>C. Bearing Fruit</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By this abiding, the branches of the vine bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we receive the dispensing of the Triune God into us, we should dispense Him into others to bear them as fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is our responsibility and joy John 15:8, 11, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A vine tree is only good for bearing fruit, and a rich vine should bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No husbandman wants a vine that does not bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The abundant fruit is the husbandman's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Bearing fruit is our occupation and the Father's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We enjoy God in such a rich way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Don't you think that it is right for us to tell our friends so that they may also enjoy this God?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we do not tell our friends about this wonderful Triune God, how can they believe and receive Him?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we speak, we branch out God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since we are His branches, we can branch Him out to reach our friends.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What a privilege!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are not only the receivers of God, but we are also the dispensers of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We work together with God to bring others into the vine, into the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then the Father will get the glory through us.</S>
