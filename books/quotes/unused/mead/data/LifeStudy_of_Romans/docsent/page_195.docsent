   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FIFTY-SEVEN RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE POWER OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that the book of Romans is the gospel of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, in this book another important matter is covered, and that is the matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1:16 and 17 Paul says that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes, because the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we shall see why righteousness is the power of the gospel and why righteousness is necessary in order for God to produce many sons through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOD S RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>FULFILLED BY CHRIST S DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>ON THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In eternity past God predestinated us to be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, although we were the predestinated ones, we became fallen and involved with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This brings in the matter of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we had not fallen, we would not need to be concerned with righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But because we are fallen, God must deal with us according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What should God do with those He has predestinated to become His sons?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some may say that because God loves us, He cannot cast us all into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yes, God loves us, but He hates sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God does not desire to give us up or to cast us into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, He cannot forgive us unless His righteousness has been satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If God would forgive us in a light manner, He would place Himself in a position of being unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a righteous God and a just God, He cannot forgive sinful people without meeting the demands of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order that God might be able to forgive us, Christ, the Son of God, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As 8:3 says, God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By incarnation, the Lord took upon Himself the likeness of the flesh of sin and became identified with sinners in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the sake of God s righteousness, the Lord Jesus was put to death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There, on the cross, He was made sin for us, and God condemned sin in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By dying on our behalf the Lord accomplished redemption and fulfilled all of God s righteous requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now God has the position righteously to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In fact, He not only can forgive us, but, for the sake of His righteousness, He must forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God forgives not primarily because He loves us, but because He is bound by His righteousness to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 3:16 says that because God loved us, He gave His only begotten Son so that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This verse indicates that God saves us because He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, in Ephesians 2:5 and 8 we are told that we are saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The book of Romans, however, reveals that we are saved not by grace nor by love, but by righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Neither love nor grace is a legal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You cannot claim that, according to law, a person is required to love you or to show grace to you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only with those things which are related to righteousness do we have the position to claim something in a legal way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, suppose you are a landlord and I am one of your tenants.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Each month I am required to pay you a certain amount of money as rent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I fail to pay rent for two months, you have the position to righteously claim from me the payment of the rent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On my part, I must pay the rent, not out of love nor out of grace, but out of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am legally obligated to pay the rent.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If I pay it, I am righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if I do not pay it, I am not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In one sense, the Lord Jesus was put to death by the Jews and Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But in another sense, He was put to death by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord was on the cross for six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>During the first three hours, He suffered the persecution of men, who did many evil things to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But during the last three hours, God laid all our sins upon Him, and then He judged Him, punished Him, and put Him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is proved by Isaiah 53.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God put Christ to death because, during the last three hours on the cross, Christ took our place.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through Christ s death, God s righteous requirements were fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, the Lord could utter the words, It is finished John 19:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By saying this, the Lord was indicating that the work of redemption was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As proof of this, the veil in the temple was torn from top to bottom Matt 27:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Furthermore, the entire scene surrounding the place of Christ s death became serene and peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A wealthy man asked for the body of Jesus and buried Him in a tomb John 19:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, with His suffering over, the Lord rested in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The requirements of God s righteousness had been fulfilled by Christ s death, and God was satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Three days later, as proof of this satisfaction, God raised Christ from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, the resurrection of Christ is the proof that God is satisfied with His death on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Before Christ died on the cross, it was still possible for God to change His mind about forgiving us of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He could righteously have cast us all aside.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But after Christ s death on the cross under the judgment of God, God cannot do this.</S>
