   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT 14 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 7:2-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 7:2 and 3 Paul says, Make room for us; we wronged no one, we corrupted no one, we took advantage of no one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do not say this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul s word here reveals his deep, intimate concern for the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This utterance is not merely something ethical, religious, spiritual, or even loving.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is possible to say a word of love and feel love for others, but still not have much concern for them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our love for others must become our concern for them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul had such a concern for the believers at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A mother has not only love for her child; she also has a deep concern.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only a woman with such a concern is qualified to be a proper mother.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A woman may be lacking in education, but if she has a deep concern for her children, she is qualified to be a good mother.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of course, knowledge and ability are helpful, but they are not prerequisites.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The unique prerequisite for being a good mother is concern.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The same principle is true regarding caring for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not adequate for the elders simply to love the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This love must become a deep concern, a concern for all the young ones and weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This concern causes our labor to be fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all need this kind of intimate concern for others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not long ago, when I was working on this chapter, I was wondering what word I could use to describe Paul s feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I realized that Paul s word here is not something that is merely ethical, moral, religious, or spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What he says here is a matter of intimate concern, of deep, tender, affectionate concern for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 2 Paul says, Make room for us, and in verse 3 he declares, You are in our hearts to die together and to live together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These are not ordinary human words.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, they are words from the heavens, words from the heart of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul s longing was that just as he had the Corinthians in his heart, so he would be in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The believers at Corinth were in Paul s heart both to live together and to die together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This surely is a word expressing an intimate concern.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 8 Paul goes on to say, Because even if I caused you sorrow by the letter, I do not regret it, even if I did regret it; because I see that that letter, even if for an hour, caused you sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By the word letter Paul refers to his first Epistle to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His word concerning regret indicates that he was not only bold and frank in rebuking the believers in his first Epistle, but also tender and soft toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The words caused you sorrow in verse 8 show that the apostle s first Epistle to the believers at Corinth was effective in regard to them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A SOFT, TENDER WORD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 8 Paul uses the expression even if three times.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He says even if I caused you sorrow, even if I did regret it, and even if for an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why does Paul keep saying even if ?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to my understanding, if the words even if were removed, Paul s word in this verse would be too hard.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Adding in the phrase even if has the effect of softening his word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, without the use of this phrase Paul in verse 8 would be strongly vindicating himself and arguing on his own behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By adding even if three times, he reduces the impression that he is vindicating himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Married brothers may wish to learn of Paul in order to avoid arguments with their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a brother is talking to his wife, he may find that by inserting the words even if he may soften his word to her and thereby keep from offending her.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, by the phrase even if Paul gives a sweet taste to his words.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul s use of even if in verse 8 may be compared to adding honey to a cup of tea.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just as the taste of tea may be too strong without honey, so Paul s words may have been too strong to receive without the repeated use of even if.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By using this phrase three times, Paul softens his word and sweetens it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As Paul was writing to the Corinthians, all the facts and the arguments were on his side.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Corinthians had no case whatever.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because Paul had won the case, he could easily have written something that would have been very hard for the Corinthians to accept.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, in writing to them he was both wise and tender.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we have an intimate concern, we shall be tender with others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A crude, insensitive person does not have an intimate concern.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a husband does not have a proper concern for his wife, he may be very strict and demanding of her.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But having an intimate concern will cause him to be tender.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once we become tender, our way of speaking will be soft and sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 8 definitely has the element of softness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul says, Even if I caused you sorrow by the letter, I do not regret it, even if I did regret it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is softness here.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But suppose Paul had said, In writing you the first Epistle I did not do anything wrong and I had no regrets about it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Surely that way of speaking would have been offensive.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul, however, did not express himself in such a manner.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He softened his words by adding the phrase even if.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this way Paul expressed his tender feeling for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to be impressed by the fact that Paul s way of speaking in this verse is soft and sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, no matter what he says, he does not cause any offense.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The kind of expression Paul uses in verse 8 does not offend others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Instead of being hard and bitter, it is soft and sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In writing to the Corinthians, Paul did not speak in a hasty manner.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Often when we speak in haste we express anger.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For example, if a sister complains to her husband about something he has done, he may hastily reply, What s wrong with me?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Prove to me that I am mistaken!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This kind of word provokes anger.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is better for a brother not to be hasty in speech in order to calm down the situation with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He needs to speak in a soft, pleasant manner.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the way Paul wrote to the Corinthians in chapter seven.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In this chapter we do not find theology, ethics, or religion.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In a sense, we do not even find spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Without adequate experience, we are not able to describe what is revealed in 2 Corinthians 7.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I have begun to understand this chapter not only through study, but also through experience, even though my experience has been limited.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>From experience I have realized that what Paul is speaking here is not theology or doctrine, ethics or morality, religion or spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He is conveying a deep, tender, and intimate concern for the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>His word is very touching.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Because Paul s expression is tender and filled with intimate concern, it has power and impact.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is able to touch the believers deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Proverbs 25:15 says, A soft tongue breaketh the bone.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Even a hard bone can be broken by a soft word of meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In speaking the truth to the Corinthians and presenting the facts, Paul knew it was difficult for him to avoid condemning the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But his tender concern for them caused him to speak soft words and sweet phrases.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>May we all learn of him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In verse 9 Paul says, Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to God, that in nothing you might suffer loss from us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The repentance mentioned here was the result the apostle sought in writing his first Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The apostle s first Epistle made them sorrowful according to God, not for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This indicates that they have been brought back to God, reconciled to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It seems that in verse 9 Paul has only a small point to make, yet he deliberately lengthens his expression.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This also shows his tenderness, his intimate concern.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In this verse we see that Paul s spirit was soft and that his entire being was filled with sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>You may wonder how we know this.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>By what Paul says in this verse we know that he is a tender person with a softened spirit and a sweet inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>However, he is not political or even polite.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>To be tender, soft, and sweet is different from being polite.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>A person may be very polite, but may not be at all soft or sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>That kind of politeness may be very uncomely.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>On the one hand, someone may be polite; on the other hand, at the same time he may be hard, haughty, and proud.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Paul, on the contrary, was neither polite nor political, which is even worse.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He was tender, soft, and sweet.</S>
