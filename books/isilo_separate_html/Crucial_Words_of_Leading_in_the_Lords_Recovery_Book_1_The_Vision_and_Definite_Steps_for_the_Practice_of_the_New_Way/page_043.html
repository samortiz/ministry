<h1 class="title">THE CHANGING OF THE SYSTEM<br />
IN CONTRAST TO RELIGION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM<br />
THE DEGRADATION OF CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>Christianity has become degraded because it has given up four crucial matters&mdash;Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church&mdash;and has fallen into forms, methods, organizations, and systems, which result in religion. History tells us that before the Western missionaries came to China, there was not the term <em>chiao-hui</em>&mdash;&ldquo;church&rdquo;&mdash;which literally means a religious gathering. It was after the missionaries introduced Christianity to China that there was the need to invent the term <em>chiao-hui</em> to express a religious gathering. After two hundred years this term has been widely accepted and is now even borrowed by other religions, such as certain Buddhist sects, to describe their organizations. This shows that the term <em>church</em> has fallen into the realm of religion. It is on the level of religion. The church as we know it today has actually become a religion.</p>
<p>From the time of the book of Revelation, the Lord has been calling believers throughout the centuries to come out, not from the true church but from the degraded religious system. Revelation chapters 2 and 3 show that even after the church became degraded, the Lord still wanted the believers to remain in the church and be the overcomers. However, chapters 17 and 18 of this book show that the Lord calls the believers to come out, not from the church but from the religious system, the religious gathering, which is the religious organization. Up until today, however, we still have not witnessed a clear deliverance from the influence of that religious organization. This is true even in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We say that we have left religion behind, but we are still somewhat &ldquo;dragging our feet in the mud.&rdquo; We have not completely rid ourselves of it; there is still &ldquo;mud&rdquo; all over us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRODUCING OF RELIGION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Need within Man for God</h2>
<p>The beginning of Genesis shows that when God created man, He created a spirit within him in order that man may contact Him, receive Him, contain Him, and express Him. For this reason, there is always a need within man for God. This need is innate in man; it is created by God, and it spontaneously manifests itself within man. No matter how fallen man becomes, there is still this need within him for God. This is an undeniable fact.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Creation of Culture<br />
Replacing Man&rsquo;s Need for God</h2>
<p>Six thousand years of human history reveal that all people, whether cultured or barbaric, have a desire to worship God. The reason for this is that there is a spirit in man. This can be compared to saying that man needs to eat because he has a stomach, but whether or not he is eating the right food is a different matter. In the same way, we have within us a &ldquo;spiritual stomach,&rdquo; which is our spirit. This spirit creates in us a need for God. Before man fell, he did not have a need for religion because at that time man could come to God, contact Him directly, and enjoy Him as his satisfaction. There was no need for regulations, forms, organizations, or institutions to help him, for the living God was leading and guiding him directly. However, man fell again and again. First, Adam fell and departed from God. Then Cain fell further and was driven from the face of God, losing God&rsquo;s presence forever. Because of the fall, man needed a replacement for God, and religion came into being.</p>
<p>Genesis 4 shows clearly that the descendants of Cain invented human culture to satisfy man&rsquo;s need as a replacement for God. Man had lost God and had fallen away from His face. He was estranged from God and could not meet the deepest need within his being. The only thing he could do was to invent human culture to satisfy his need. We have covered this matter clearly in the <em>Life-study of Genesis</em> (see Message 24, pp. 323-329). In order to satisfy his human needs, man invented all kinds of things in his culture. He invented husbandry, weaponry, and music. Husbandry is for food, which is for sustenance; weaponry is for protection, which is for defense; and music is for entertainment, which is for enjoyment. This is a natural consequence of man&rsquo;s effort to satisfy his fallen needs.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Religion Being the Crystallization<br />
of Human Culture</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s culture was created based on his need. For example, because man was not satisfied with the mule-wagon for transportation, he sought for advancement and invented the automobile. Later he became dissatisfied with the automobile and invented the airplane. Then the airplane did not satisfy him because he wanted to go to the moon; as a result, he invented the rocket. The reason that man invented music and the various musical instruments, such as the drum, the flute, and the stringed instruments, is that he needed entertainment and enjoyment for his soul. After man fell, the earth was cursed, and food production became limited. As a result, men fought with one another. So in order to satisfy his need for safety and protection, he invented weapons, such as the sword and the spear. Eventually, however, man discovered that his greatest need was in his deepest part, his spirit, and this need he could not satisfy. He discovered that he had a need to worship. As a result, he invented religion and began to turn to idol worship.</p>
<p>Today in the twentieth century we live in an age of unprecedented developments in science and culture. Taiwan is an example of this. Everything here is advancing and moving ahead; education is highly emphasized, and technology is advancing. Yet at the same time, idolatry is abounding everywhere. The radio, the television, and all the mass media indicate that religion is welcomed everywhere. This is especially true with Buddhism. As long as there are teachings concerning doing good with the reward of heaven and doing evil with the threat of hell, people will be gullible and swallow it. What we see in America is also difficult to believe. A nation as advanced and highly educated as the United States finds some of its own people pursuing the Eastern religions, dressing themselves in priestly gowns with pony tails and chanting to the sound of Buddhist instruments. If I was in Africa, I would not be so surprised, but I am in Los Angeles. This puzzles me. It seems as if modern man is so hungry that he will eat anything. Because of an unabating need to worship God, man turns to all kinds of &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; to cure his &ldquo;ailments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Religion is something that human culture developed to satisfy human longing. Sixty years ago I read a book entitled <em>The Two Babylons,</em> which speaks of the record in Genesis 11. There man built a tower at Babel which was to reach heaven. Every brick on that tower was engraved with the name of an idol. This shows that at the time of Genesis 11, the entire earth was engaged in idol worship.</p>
<p>This is the reason Joshua told the children of Israel in Joshua 24:2-3, &ldquo;Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt across the River long ago, Terah the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor; and they served other gods. And I took your father Abraham from across the River and brought him throughout all the land of Canaan.&rdquo; While the world was worshipping idols, God called Abraham out from among the idolaters and caused him and his descendants to serve the one true and living God. In the New Testament the Lord Jesus, who is God manifest in the flesh, also called His disciples to follow Him and charged them to disciple all the nations, spreading the gospel of the kingdom to the entire earth to be a testimony to all people. Yet Christianity once again lowered such a salvation from the Lord&rsquo;s standard to the level of a product of human culture. It became a religion, an organization in human culture.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> </body></html>
