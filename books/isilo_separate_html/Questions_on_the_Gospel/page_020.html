Does our salvation have a direct relationship to His keeping of the law?<h2 class=head1>ANSWER</h2><p>Christ did not keep the law for us. What saved us is God&#8217;s righteousness, not Christ&#8217;s righteousness.<p>Christ kept the law in order to be righteous in Himself and to be qualified as the Savior. There is only an indirect relationship between Christ&#8217;s keeping of the law and our salvation.<p>Christ can save us because He received the punishment of the law, which is death, not because He kept the law. What has saved us is Christ&#8217;s death and the righteousness accomplished through His death, not the righteous acts of Christ. The righteous acts of Christ are His own.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
