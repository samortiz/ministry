<h2 class="head2">Being Sanctified</h2>
<p>The primary condition of a priest is one of sanctification (Exo. 29:1). A priest is a sanctified person, a person who has been set apart. If we want to be a priest of God, we must be sanctified.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Enjoying Christ Inwardly</h2>
<p>A priest ate the offerings on the altar, which typify Christ. In other words, the food of a priest is Christ. A priest lives because of Christ and inwardly enjoys Christ. The more a person fulfills his function in the priesthood, the more he can eat of the offerings. Furthermore, the more he eats of the offerings, the more he can fulfill his function. The more we draw near to God as priests, the more we will enjoy Christ. The more we eat the Lord, drink the Lord, and enjoy the Lord, the more we will draw near to God as His priests. A priest who is outside the Holy Place is a hungry priest. A priest who does not participate in the priestly service does not have any food to eat. If we are hungry, it is because we have not drawn near to God as a priest. If we do not contact God, fellowship with God, or live in the presence of God, we will be unable to enjoy Christ as God&rsquo;s offerings. Drawing near to God and enjoying Christ are inseparable.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Putting On Christ</h2>
<p>The priestly garments also typify Christ. The crown of beauty that the priests put on was Christ as their glory; the robe that they wore was Christ as their righteousness. The priestly garments, in terms of their materials, are equivalent to the tabernacle, because the priestly garments were made with fine linen, gold, and blue, purple, and scarlet strands, just like the coverings of the tabernacle (28:8; 25:3-4). The fine linen typifies Christ as our righteousness. Gold signifies Christ as our life and nature. Blue signifies the heavenly condition of Christ manifested in us. Purple signifies the royal condition of Christ manifested in us. Scarlet signifies the efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s redemption manifested in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Coordinated and Built Up</h2>
<p>The garment of the high priest also included precious stones. The first time that the Bible speaks of precious stones is in Genesis. The onyx stone in the river that flowed out of Eden was a precious stone (2:12), and there were two onyx stones engraved in settings of gold on the shoulder pieces of the high priest (Exo. 28:9). There were also twelve precious stones on the breastplate of judgment made of gold (v. 15). The New Jerusalem has these same features (vv. 16-20; Rev. 21:18-20). The foundations of the wall of the holy city, New Jerusalem, are twelve precious stones, and the base of the city is pure gold. This corresponds to the twelve precious stones set on the breastplate worn by the high priest. The gold and precious stones were connected in rows of stones (Exo. 28:17), depicting a picture of coordination and building. The names of the twelve tribes of Israel were inscribed on the precious stones (v. 2), denoting that the twelve tribes of Israel were built up together to be one corporate entity.</p>
<p>The picture of the living of the priests in the Old Testament shows that priests eat Christ, wear Christ, are filled with Christ inwardly, and express Christ outwardly. They are one with Christ in every aspect. Christ is upon them as the fine linen, gold, and precious stones, and they are coordinated and built up in Christ as one entity. Their living is in Christ as the tabernacle because they are one with the tabernacle. The tabernacle is upon them, they are one with the tabernacle, and the tabernacle is one with them. The tabernacle represents the building of God and the dwelling place of God. The building of God and the dwelling place of God depend upon the priesthood, and the people of God, as precious stones, are not scattered and detached; rather, they are built up as one in and through the priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIVING OF THE PRIESTS ISSUING<br />
IN THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Today there must be some who rise up to be priests, enjoying Christ inwardly and expressing Him outwardly. Only in this way can the children of God be coordinated and built up. Only in this way can there be the building of the church as the tabernacle of God, the dwelling place of God. In the New Testament age, the built-up church is a priesthood. If we are not living before God as priests, there will be no priesthood and no building of the church.</p>
<p>We need to see that God is after a group of people who will be a corporate priesthood. Such a group of priests will live before Him and allow Him to saturate them, fill them, and flow through them. It is not enough for a person to individually draw near to God in prayer, because the priesthood is a corporate matter. In today&rsquo;s Christianity, drawing near to God in prayer is regarded only as a personal and individual matter, but the Bible speaks of priests who are formed into a corporate priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5, 9). The more we live before God, enjoying Christ and expressing Christ, the more we will be blended into one with others and coordinated with others in the life of God, the Spirit of God, and the fellowship of God. As we are being transformed into gold, pearls, and precious stones, we will be built up with others because the gold and precious stones on the priestly garments are coordinated together. This coordination brings in the shining of the Urim and the completing of the Thummim. Only then will men understand God&rsquo;s heart and know what God is doing among His people.</p>
<p>When the church fulfills the priesthood in this way and the saints are built up together in the spirit of the fellowship of the priesthood, the church will be full of God&rsquo;s light and God&rsquo;s presence, and God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire will be revealed step by step. I hope that every brother and every sister can see that God&rsquo;s calling in this last age is for everyone to be a priest. May we answer God&rsquo;s call, not just to pursue spirituality and to draw near to God in prayer as individuals but to be in the priesthood that fulfills God&rsquo;s purpose.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
