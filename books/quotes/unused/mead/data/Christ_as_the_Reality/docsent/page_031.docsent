   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Orderly</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Later on in Mark 6, we see something more of the Lord's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When He was feeding the five thousand, He commanded the disciples to make all the people sit down by companies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This was His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If they had not sat down, the disciples would not have been able to distribute the bread to them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus did not tell them to sit down in a loose way, but in a very orderly way: "And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties" Mark 6:39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everything was arranged in order.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do believe that Peter and the other disciples learned in this way how to handle a large number of people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, it was not difficult to handle the three thousand who were saved at Pentecost Acts 2:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They learned from the Lord how to manage such a multitude and how to do things with proper arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To have such an arrangement requires the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE HUMANITY OF JESUS IN JOHN Not Sloppy</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Gospel of John also records something of the Lord's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This Gospel adds something concerning the feeding of the five thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jesus told the disciples to gather the pieces left over that nothing be lost John 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we see a humanity that is so solid.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is nothing sloppy in His behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Most of us would forget about all the fragments, but the Lord was careful not to leave anything in a sloppy way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Limited by Time</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In John 7:6, we see that the Lord was always limited by time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Then Jesus said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All of us, especially the young people, need to learn not to be so free.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Too much freedom indicates lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Freedom must be within the limits of law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not say that our time is always ready.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The humanity of Jesus is not always so.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His humanity does not have so much freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we learn to partake of His humanity, we will see that there is limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Unique</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Something more about the humanity of Jesus is seen in John 7:46.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The chief priests and Pharisees sent certain deputies to capture the Lord, but when they returned they said, "No man ever spoke as this man speaks."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They had never seen a man like Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to be such a man that others would say they have never seen anyone like us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should be unique, because we enjoy such a unique humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Knowing When to Weep</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Lazarus died, we read that Jesus groaned in His spirit and wept John 11:33, 35 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many times I have thought that Jesus could never weep.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But with His humanity, there is a time to weep.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not be so strong that we never weep.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am afraid that if I were to weep in front of you, you would think that I am not strong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a religious concept; sometimes we need to weep.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the real humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Humble</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jesus not only served, but was also willing to wash the feet of His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He "rose from supper and laid aside His garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then He poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded" John 13:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He had such a humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was willing to wash their feet, instead of expecting them to wash His.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How we need this humanity for the church life!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is so clear in these Gospels that Jesus' humanity was the highest humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the real meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>FOOD FOR PRIESTS</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must realize again that the major part of the meal offering was food for the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we are going to have the priest's life, we must take Jesus as our meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is a real shortage of the priesthood today because there is no food for the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Without proper food for the priest, there can be no priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This cannot be just a doctrine among us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need the life of the priesthood, and the life of the priesthood can be sustained only by this kind of food.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not an ordinary diet, but a special, extraordinary diet that requires much labor on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must prepare something of Christ and bring it to the tent of meeting to present to God as a kind of memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The remainder will then be our food, and this food will sustain the life of the priesthood.</S>
