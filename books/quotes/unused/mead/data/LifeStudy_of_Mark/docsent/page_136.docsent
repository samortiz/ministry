   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ARRESTED AND JUDGED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Mark 14:43-52 tells us how the Lord Jesus was arrested.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 49 He said to those who came to seize Him, Daily I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me but that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The God-forsaking and God-offending opposers, afraid of the people who had warmly welcomed the Slave-Savior 11:7-11 and who were gladdened by His speaking 12:37 , dared not arrest Him in the daytime or in a public place like the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, these opposers arrested Him subtly in the deep night 14:1 , as though arresting a robber 14:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Mark 14:53 15:15 describes how the Slave-Savior was judged.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First He was judged by the Jewish leaders representing the Jews 14:53-64 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then He was judged by the Roman government representing the Gentiles 15:1-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mark 14:53 says, And they led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes come together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Slave-Savior was arrested as a robber v. 48 and brought to the slaughter as a lamb Isa 53:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 14:55-60 we see that the Lord Jesus said nothing in answer to those who were falsely testifying against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was silent and answered nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Again the high priest questioned Him and said to Him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? v. 61 . The befuddled high priest of the traditional, God-forsaking and God-forsaken religion called God the Blessed in order to show how much he revered and honored God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although concerning His behavior the Slave-Savior would not answer His faultfinders false accusation, yet concerning His divine Person, His deity, He was not silent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, in verse 62 He answered strongly and definitely, affirming His deity in His humanity by stating that as the Son of Man He will sit at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verses 63 and 64 say, And the high priest, having torn his garments, says, What further need do we have of witnesses?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You heard the blasphemy!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How does it appear to you?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The blind opposers condemned the Slave-Savior for being blasphemous in affirming His deity, not realizing that they themselves were blaspheming God, who was right then the very One whom they were slandering and mocking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 65 says, And some began to spit at Him, and to cover His face, and to beat Him with their fists, and to say to Him, Prophesy!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And the deputies, slapping Him, took Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was the Jews despising and rejecting of the Slave-Savior to the uttermost, as prophesied in Isaiah 53:3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>DELIVERED TO PILATE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Mark 15:1 goes on to say, And immediately in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole Sanhedrin, and having bound Jesus, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Under God s sovereignty, the Slave-Savior was judged not only by the Jewish leaders as a sheep before the shearer Isa 53:7 in 14:53-65, but also by the Roman governor, as a criminal before the accusers 14:64 in 15:1-15.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was judged both by the Jewish leaders and by the Roman governor so that He might die to serve sinners with His life as a ransom 10:45 , not only for the Jews, represented by the Jewish leaders, but also for the Gentiles, represented by the Roman governor.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>SENTENCED TO BE CRUCIFIED</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Mark 15:15 tells us that Pilate, seeking to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them and delivered up Jesus to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This exposed the darkness and injustice of man s politics to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was a fulfillment of the prophecy concerning the Slave-Savior s suffering in Isaiah 53:5 and 8.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Jewish death penalty was by stoning Lev 20:2, 27; 24:14; Deut 13:10; 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Crucifixion was a heathen practice Ezra 6:11 , adopted by the Romans for the execution of slaves and heinous criminals only.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To crucify the Lord Jesus was not only a fulfillment of the Old Testament Deut 21:23; Gal 3:13; Num 21:8-9 , but also a fulfillment of the Lord s own word concerning the mode of His death John 3:14; 8:28; 12:32 , which could not have been fulfilled by stoning.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 14:43 15:15 we have a record of the experience both of the Lord Jesus and of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These experiences were taking place at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While the Lord Jesus was being judged, Peter also was judged.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The fact that the Lord was judged by the Jewish leaders and the Roman governor is a strong sign that He was tested by the entire world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was judged by the Jews according to their law and by the Gentiles according to Roman law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With the Lord Jesus, of course, there was nothing deserving judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Peter, on the contrary, was exposed as being fully wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The account in the Gospel of Mark merges the judgment of the Lord Jesus by the Jews and the Gentiles with the exposure and judgment of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to see that both Peter and the Lord Jesus were crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may say that Peter was ordained and appointed to be our representative.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everything that happened related to the crucifixion of Jesus was a fulfillment of either the types or the prophecies in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have pointed out that, as a fulfillment of the type of the Passover lamb, the Lord Jesus was crucified on the day of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was arrested during the night.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the Jewish calendar, a day begins not in the morning but in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus partook of the Passover feast in the evening of the day of Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that He ate the Passover at the beginning of the day of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then He instituted His supper and went to Gethsemane to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Late in the night the Lord was arrested, brought to the court of the high priest, and judged.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then in the morning He was brought to Pilate.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was early in the morning that the Lord Jesus was sentenced to death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Immediately after He was sentenced, He was taken to Golgotha, and beginning at nine o clock in the morning, He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord s opposers did not give the people an opportunity to do anything against them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The opposers arrested the Lord Jesus secretly, and the Lord cooperated with them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord purposely went to Gethsemane, and Judas knew that He would be there.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, late at night, while the people were sleeping, Judas led a company to Gethsemane to arrest the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In a quick way, without the people knowing anything, the Lord was judged by the Jewish leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then He was judged by Pilate and sentenced to death.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In order to satisfy the crowd, Pilate made a quick decision to crucify the Lord Jesus.</S>
