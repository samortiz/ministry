If we have them already, we do not need to hope for them anymore. When a child's father leaves his home, the child hopes very much to see the father. But when the father returns home, the child is extremely glad. If the mother asks the child, "Do you still hope to see your father?", the child will answer, "I have seen my father already. Why do I still have to hope to see him?" Indeed, if we have obtained something already, we do not need to hope for it anymore. Either the world believes in Jesus and is saved and has eternal life, or it is not saved and is perishing. There is no middle ground between the two things. "Every one who believes into Him...[has] eternal life...he who does not believe has been condemned already" (John 3:16-18). The Bible divides humanity into two classes: those who are saved and those who are perishing. There is not a third class of those who hope to be saved. If you have indeed believed in Jesus Christ as your Savior and have believed in His death on the cross where He bore your sins for you, you are saved already. You do not have to hope to be saved anymore. If some would ask a man who has been rescued out of the water, "What do you want?", would he say, "I hope to get on shore"? Is such an answer sensible? Brothers, if you have believed in the Lord Jesus, you have eternal life already. Why are you still doubting? You have received it already. Why still hope for it? Simply praise the Lord instead!</P><P>There are others, when I ask about the question of salvation, that answer, "While I live on earth today, I indeed trust in the accomplished work of the redemption of the Lord Jesus. But I dare not say whether I am saved or not. I have to wait until I die and go before the Father to be judged as either a goat or a sheep. If He says that I am a sheep, then I will be saved and be most happy. If He says that I am a goat, then I will perish and go to hell in misery."</P><P>Alas, is this future not a pitiful one? Speaking truthfully, if I did not know that I was saved, I would be afraid that I would be unable to take my meal today; and I would not be able to sleep tonight. Thank the Father, for He has accepted us and has given us the eternal life! Do you really believe in the merit of the Lord Jesus' redemption? If we have believed in Him, do we have to wait until we die before we know whether we are saved or perishing? Please look at the word of the Bible. The Lord's own words are the most trustworthy of all.</P><P>"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life" (John 3:16). Is not this verse very clear? "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son." This is what God has done. He has loved and He has given. He has given the Lord Jesus to the world, to die for the world and accomplish salvation on the cross, so that everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus would have eternal life and not perish. If you have believed in the Lord Jesus, you have eternal life already and will no longer perish. John 3:16 is the most recited verse. But unfortunately, many people are not familiar with John 3:16 after all. John 3:16 clearly says that as soon as you believe in the Lord Jesus, you do not perish, but have eternal life. But many believers change John 3:16! If they have believed in the Lord as their Savior but consider that they are not yet saved, they change John 3:16! They change it without knowing about it! They change John 3:16 to something like this:</P><P>"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him will perhaps not perish, and perhaps have eternal life after a month, two months, a year, ten years, a few decades, or after they die."</P><P>Thank God that the Bible is not written this way. The Bible has not put those words there. The Bible links "every one who believes into Him" with "would not perish, but would have eternal life." Whenever we believe in the Lord Jesus and have our sins washed by the blood; at that moment, we do not perish, but have eternal life. "Every one who believes into Him...would have eternal life" (John 3:16), without waiting until they die to have it.</P><P>The parable of the goats and the sheep has been misinterpreted by the church throughout the centuries. It has been applied to the believers. The word "nations" in Matthew 25:32 refers to the Gentiles. God has divided the world into Jews, Greeks, and the church of God (1 Cor. 10:32). The church has nothing to do with the Gentiles anymore. The judgment of the goats and the sheep refers to the judgment of the Gentile nations at the coming of the Lord Jesus with His saints. We the believers will not be judged there.</P><P>Those who have believed in the Lord Jesus will not be judged with respect to salvation and perdition. The Lord Jesus' crucifixion on the cross has borne the judgment of their sins for them. He has taken the punishment of their sins. He has solved the problem of sin for them. Those who have believed in Him have accepted Him as their substitute. He has been judged and has died for them. Of course, they do not need to be judged or to die anymore. "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 8:1). Please read again the words of John 5:24. "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life."</P><P>How sweet are the Lord's words! No one can speak like Him! These clear words are like music to a sinner's ears. Since He said "truly, truly," can they be untrue? Surely they cannot be. The Lord Jesus says that the one who hears and believes "has eternal life." This is a "truly, truly" saying. He says that such a one "does not come into judgment." This, of course, must be "truly, truly" also. He also says that such a one "has passed out of death into life." This also must be "truly, truly." When He says that such a one "has passed," it surely means that it "has passed." When do we use the words "has passed" in our daily life? Does not "has passed" mean that something has already been accomplished and is over? The Lord says that a person who has believed in Him "has passed out of death into life." Why do we say that we have to wait until we die before we can know that we are saved? Brothers, those who have believed in Him have already passed from death into life even in this age. This is truly the gospel! Truly, truly I say unto you, a person who has believed "has passed out of death into life." He who does not believe "has been condemned already" (John 3:18). Both times that the word "has" is used in John 5:24 and 3:18, it refers to something that is decided now.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> </body></html>
