The so-called new way the Lord has shown us in the past four and a half years is a way that is fully revealed in the New Testament
From the second century the lovers of the Lord Jesus and His Word studied the New Testament and as a result saw something but not in full
In every century there have been these lovers of the Lord and lovers of the Word groping to find the right way to serve God
In the five books of Moses God gave a clear record indicating how the priests in the Old Testament should serve
In each century something of human invention, human concept, and human ideas was added to what was discovered in the Bible
At the beginning under Brother Nee's teaching, at least eighty percent of our practice was a copy of the British Brethren
Ten years later Brother Nee began to see more from the Bible which did not justify some of the things of the Brethren practice
Ten years later, in 1948, Brother Nee again stressed these things in his training and in the book Church Affairs
What we have we first received from the Brethren and then from Brother Nee, but we have not yet practiced some of the things which he saw
In Church Affairs, Brother Nee pointed out that the Lord's Day message meeting is following 'the custom of the Nations'
He therefore proposed stopping the Lord's Day morning message meetings to send out all the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel
You may say this is the step of gospel preaching; however, it includes another point-the priesthood of the New Testament gospel
You may say this is something old practiced by the Mormons and the Jehovah Witnesses; however, as far as we are concerned, it is new
The first step is to preach the gospel as the priests of the New Testament gospel by visiting people in their homes
Some have accused my training of being Hagar, the concubine Abraham married, and all the people baptized through door-knocking as Ishmaels
The fourth step is to pursue to prophesy that the church may be built up by the saints as revealed in 1 Corinthians 14
Other denominations are reconsidering their way because a number of their leading ones realize they do not have a way to go on
God placed the apostles, the prophets, the teachers, the helping deacons and the administrating elders in the church
According to 2 Corinthians 3:5, the Apostle Paul said that we are not sufficient of ourselves but that our sufficiency is in the Lord
The Jews even hated Paul and his followers to such an extent that they plotted and conspired to damage Paul and his ministry
Although he himself had never been an elder, yet he set up a model, a pattern, an example for the elders whom he had trained
Whatever he spoke about himself, his expectation was that all the elders would follow his steps and imitate what he had been doing
Third are the trials which come upon us from other people who claim to be for God, and even conspire to undermine the work
Paul was serving the Lord as a slave with all humility and tears because at his time there were others competing with him
At Paul's time the trials came from the Jews who were not atheists, but those who worshipped God, and, in their view, served God
Among us in the past our concept was that the elders only manage the church affairs, make decisions, and give announcements
The main responsibility of the elders is firstly to shepherd, as Peter tells us in his first Epistle, chapter five verse 2
The elders must read to them some profitable verses, give them some definitions, and teach them with the Holy Word
The things of God's New Testament economy, God's eternal plan, and God's plan for the church are absolutely lacking among them
To hear God's economy and receive such a high calling will become a strong comfort and encouragement to the disappointed ones
We in the Lord's recovery are God's overcomers today, fighting for His kingdom and doing something for His interests
Paul charged the elders not only to teach but to shepherd the church of God which God obtained through His own blood
Verse 30 follows, 'And from among you yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after themselves'
Not only will wolves come in from without, but men will rise up from within the church, speaking perverted things
Another word for service is found in verse 11 which says, 'Not slothful in zeal, burning in spirit, serving the Lord as a slave'
According to my experiences over the past fifty years in the church life, all the problems came out of one source- ambition
We would all like to be on the same level as Peter, Paul, or Apollos and not as Timothy whom we consider a learner and not a leader
One very good sister, who was seeking the Lord and serving diligently, did expect to be one of the group leaders
When the names of the new group leaders were announced, and she did not hear her name, she was greatly disappointed
In 2 Corinthians chapter four Paul says For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus sake
Besides Taiwan there were a number of churches, in the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia
In Matthew 23:8 the Lord said, 'But you, do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers'
It is easy for us to think that a deacon or deaconess just serves people like the sisters who prepare the Lord's table
To make the bread and prepare the wine is wonderful and necessary, but that is not something that we could offer to God as a sacrifice
Our kind of chair arranging and vacuuming should be something that issues in some sacrifices for us to offer to God
If we come to arrange the chairs in a pure and humble spirit and others observe, they will sense Christ being ministered to them
Although there are different ways to arrange the chairs, this kind of chair arranging results in a sacrifice offered to God
In 1 Corinthians 12:28 Paul says that God placed some in the church, including the universal church and all the local churches
We must realize that Paul purposely mentioned helps before administrations because there is no thought of rank here
According to the New Testament, Christ must be the first sacrifice offered, then the members of Christ, the corporate Christ
Hatred is typified by leaven while love from the natural life is typified by honey, which ferments into leaven
May all of our services be so pure that they issue in the supply of Christ to others for the building up of the organic Body of Christ
In Romans 16:1 Paul mentioned the name of a particular sister, Phoebe, who was a deaconess of the church at Cenchrea
The first two verses of Romans 16 show us that Paul highly recommended her, because he used the word patroness
According to Roman custom, a patron in the Roman Empire was one who served others and took care of all of their needs
In the United States the young girls do not like to study nursing because the job is too bothersome and time-consuming
Today the immigration service is open to foreign nurses to come to this country because the United States is short of nurses
These church sisters would immediately render some help to take care of their children and carry their grocery bags
By that little service, they touch the hearts of the ladies and are able to obtain their names and telephone numbers
If we only speak a word and do not serve them, it is rather difficult to impart and infuse them with something
It does not refer to our believing, but to the things we believe in, which constitute the full gospel of the New Testament
The mystery of the faith is just the mystery of Christ as the embodiment of God and the mystery of the church as the embodiment of Christ
Our service is not merely to take care of others but has a goal to lead people to reach the mystery of the faith
While we are serving in material things, we should minister the spiritual riches of Christ into the ones whom we serve
Although in this matter there is a big lack in all of the Christian churches, we must promote this kind of service in the Body
Just by arriving fifteen minutes early and standing at the entrance of the meeting hall, we can find someone and speak Christ to them
If we know all of the crucial points of the mystery of the faith, then we will have something to serve and minister to others
Among us over twenty years ago at Elden Hall in Los Angeles there were a number of strong serving ones who carried out many services
Every Saturday the moving crew would move the furniture and household goods of those who had just arrived in Los Angeles
The church in Anaheim has been here for a number of years and the saints have known each other for a long time
Most of them are used to inviting the brothers and sisters whom they have known for years for fellowship and dinner rather than the new ones
All of the sisters and brothers should not always be with their old acquaintances but should go to some new ones more
