   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in His Resurrection, and Being the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible reveals that Christ went to the cross, died, was buried, and rose from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is not only the Giver and Sender of the Spirit, but in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, 2 Corinthians 3:17 tells us that He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>the Beginning and the End</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Revelation, the last book of the Bible, the Lord declared that He is the Alpha and Omega 22:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Alpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To say that Christ is the Alpha and Omega means that He is every letter in the alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is not only the first letter and the last, but He is every letter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, in Revelation 22:13 the Lord continued to declare that He is the First and the Last, and that He is the beginning and the end. This means that He is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is all twenty-two letters of the Greek alphabet, and He is every word composed with this alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, He is every sentence composed with all the words, and, moreover, He is the entire composition composed with all the sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, the entire composition is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Eternal Life</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such an all-inclusive Christ is the eternal life 1 John 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is the eternal life for us and to us that we may experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Mystery of God</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Colossians 2:2 tells us that Christ is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God Himself is a mystery, and this mystery is fully revealed by Christ and in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That Christ is God's mystery indicates that if we desire to know God, we must know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is the definition and explanation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is also the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everything concerning God is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Embodiment of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Colossians 2:9 tells us that in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the fullness of the Godhead refers to the Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The divine Trinity is the fullness of the Godhead, and this fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ, our Redeemer and our Savior, is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As such an all-inclusive One, He is the complete God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to spend much time to enter into the significance of all the foregoing details regarding Christ's Person, until we are fully saturated and immersed in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we shall realize that the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is one God who is embodied in the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we receive Christ, we receive the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we enjoy Christ, we enjoy the Triune God.</S>
