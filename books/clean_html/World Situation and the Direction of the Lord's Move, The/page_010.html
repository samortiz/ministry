<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR<br />
THE SPREADING OF THE DIVINE TRUTHS,<br />
ESPECIALLY TO THE CRUCIAL PARTS<br />
OF THE WORLD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; 24:14; Acts 8:1, 4; Isa. 6:1, 8; Dan. 11:32; 2 Tim. 2:21</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, we saw the need of the spreading of the divine truths for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and restoration. In this chapter we want to see our responsibility for the spreading of the divine truths, especially to the crucial parts of the world. Our intention in going to these parts of the world is to minister Christ.</p>
<p>In chapter one we saw the influential factors of the present situation of the world. The United States takes the lead in finance, politics, and military; Europe cooperates in finance, politics, and military; and the Far East cooperates mainly in finance. We also saw the spreading of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It was initiated in the Far East and is growing there. It has been brought to and rooted in the United States for growth. But in Europe the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has not been properly and adequately initiated. There is a great need for some to go there to fill up the lack.</p>
<p>Our responsibility is to teach the Bible, to teach the truth. The Bible, of course, is the unique Word, spoken by God. God has spoken in the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament and the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. The end of the Bible tells us clearly that no one should add anything to or take anything away from this divine revelation (Rev. 22:18-19). The greatest item in the universe is God Himself, and the second greatest item is God&rsquo;s spoken and written Word.</p>
<p>We have seen that there is also the need of the translation of the Word. Then there is the need for it to be interpreted, expounded, and explained. Following this there is the need of understanding. Then we can speak the word in an interpreted and understood way. This is our commission. The printed ministry among us is full of the interpreted and expounded word according to the proper understanding. The Bible is God&rsquo;s speaking, written by men who spoke from God and were borne by the Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21). The Bible, from the Pentateuch of Moses through the Revelation of the apostle John, took between fifteen hundred and sixteen hundred years to complete. Then this book was read, studied, and investigated by the entire Body of Christ for the past nineteen centuries.</p>
<p>In the previous chapter, we saw that the interpretation of the Bible began in the time of the church fathers. They studied the truth concerning the Divine Trinity and the person of Christ. They saw in the New Testament that Christ was a person with a dual nature. He was conceived in a human virgin, but people called Him Emmanuel, meaning God with us (Matt. 1:23). He possesses both humanity and divinity.</p>
<p>We also pointed out that in the sixteenth century, Martin Luther went against the entire Catholic Church to declare the truth of justification by faith. In the nineteenth century, the Lord raised up the British Brethren to recover many biblical truths. They were the ones whom the Lord used to open up the truth concerning the assurance of salvation. <em>Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment</em> by George Cutting was a famous booklet published by them on this subject. In the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s move in China, we proclaimed this truth so that it could be recovered in a full way.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago no one in the United States spoke clearly about God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s dispensing, the principle of the Body of Christ, and the practicality of the church life on the genuine ground of oneness with the local churches as the local expressions of the Body of Christ. The Lord opened up these truths to us. Eventually, the Lord showed us the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of the church. Although the New Jerusalem occupies only the last two chapters of the Bible, we have published many messages concerning it.</p>
<p>From the time of the church fathers, the study of the holy Word has gone on and on throughout the centuries. The church fathers found out that the title for God in Genesis 1, <em>Elohim,</em> is plural in number. In verse 26 the one God said, &ldquo;Let us make man in our image.&rdquo; The one God uses the pronouns <em>us</em> and <em>our</em> when referring to Himself. Eventually, the church fathers used the term <em>triune</em> to describe how God is three-one. They began the study of the Word with the truth concerning God at the beginning of the Bible. Now we have come to the end of the Bible with the truth concerning the New Jerusalem. The first item of the Bible is God, and the last item is the New Jerusalem. God Himself is the beginning, the source, of the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem is the enlargement, expansion, and increase of God. The New Jerusalem is a corporate entity, the mingling of God with His redeemed, transformed, and glorified people. With the opening up of the truth concerning the New Jerusalem, the Bible has now been interpreted in a consummated way.</p>
<p>We owe so much to many teachers of the Bible who have gone before us, and today we are standing on their shoulders. I consider the notes we have published in the Recovery Version as the aggregate of the proper understanding of the New Testament. We are really blessed to be living in these latter days. We have received the aggregate understanding of the Bible because we are standing on the shoulders of many who have gone before us. Today we understand the Bible better than Martin Luther and J. N. Darby because we have inherited the truth they saw, and by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we are standing on their shoulders and have gone on to see more. The Bible was spoken by God in the holy writings, translated by many scholars, and interpreted by the Body of Christ throughout the centuries. Today the proper understanding of the Bible has been collected in our writings in order for us to study, learn, and spread the divine truths.</p>
