GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH,<br />
REFERRING TO BOTH CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>First Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.&rdquo; Most Christian teachers mistakenly think that this verse refers only to Christ. However, Christ&rsquo;s ascension, His being taken up in glory, preceded His being preached among the nations and believed on in the world. Therefore, since &ldquo;taken up in glory&rdquo; is the last item in this verse, it must refer not only to the ascension of Christ but also to the rapture of the church. This is a strong proof that this verse refers not only to Christ but also to the church. Yes, Christ is the manifestation of God in the flesh, but today the church is also the manifestation of God in the flesh. We are still in the flesh, but when we meet together in the spirit, God is manifested among us. The manifestation of God in the flesh is godliness. Godliness is simply God manifested in us.</p>
<p>We must take care of godliness, especially in a time of the church&rsquo;s degradation. Various differing concepts have recently crept into some churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The saints in certain localities argue about attending movies and sporting events. Some of the disputing ones say, &ldquo;If you say, &lsquo;Do not go to movies or sporting events,&rsquo; you are legal. If you say, &lsquo;You must come to the Sunday morning meeting,&rsquo; you are religious.&rdquo; They claim that they are liberated from all legalities and bondage. If the Spirit inspires them, they go to the meeting; if not, they do not go. If we try to argue with them, we will fall into their snare and be clouded because they are skillful in arguing.</p>
<p>I will give a simple illustration that will put those who argue in this way to shame. Suppose on Sunday morning I do not feel inspired by God to go to the meeting, and I decide to play basketball instead. If a brother sees me, he will not see godliness. We should not care for what is right or wrong, legal or illegal, religious or unreligious. We should care only for godliness. By playing basketball only once on a Sunday morning, I would lose any power to speak the word of God. If I come to speak to the saints Sunday evening after playing basketball Sunday morning, my speaking will be without impact. All the saints will wonder, &ldquo;Is this a man of God?&rdquo; I will give another illustration. If the saints see me entering a movie theater, they will not be edified, regardless of the kind of movie it is. Therefore, this is not godliness. We should care not for any opinions or concepts but only for godliness, God manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>Some saints have said, &ldquo;To drink alcohol is all right. Do not be so legal. You need to be liberated from legalities and drink. We do not drink strong drinks; we drink only beer. Let us all go to a bar and drink beer.&rdquo; Some even say, &ldquo;We enjoy a happy church life by drinking beer together.&rdquo; This illustrates that we must not exercise our mentality to consider whether things are legal, illegal, liberated, or bound. If we exercise our mind, we will become lost in a forest. We simply need to consider whether doing something is godliness, the manifestation of God in the flesh. If we discern matters in this way, we will immediately be clear that we should not go to a bar, play basketball on Sunday morning, or go to a movie theater. It does not matter if we say, &ldquo;I am not going to see evil movies; I am going to see the best educational movies.&rdquo; Using the label of &ldquo;educational&rdquo; does not mean much. As long as we enter a theater, people will have a bad impression of us. We need to avoid even the appearance of evil. Even if we are going to see a movie about Jesus, simply going to a theater has the appearance of evil. We are here for the manifestation of God in the flesh, that is, for godliness. I would not do anything or go to any place that gives people an impression that is not the manifestation of God in the flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HEALTHY WORDS AND HEALTHY TEACHING</h2>
<p>Finally, the Epistles to Timothy mention healthy words and healthy teaching four times (1 Tim. 1:10; 6:3; 2 Tim. 1:13; 4:3). In the church life we must discern whether the speaking is healthy or killing, damaging, or poisoning. If we practice this, we will not be misled by eloquence or by enticing words. Regardless of how eloquent the speaking is or how enticing the words are, if the teaching and the words are not healthy, we must reject them. If the words and teaching are healthy, they will minister life to our being. We may not have much knowledge, but we all have a taste. We know what is sweet and what is bitter. We must take care of the healthy words and healthy teaching. We should not measure or discern any speaking according to eloquence. We may easily be deceived by eloquent words (Rom. 16:18; 1 Cor. 2:4; Col. 2:4). We should care not for eloquence but for healthiness. We must always ask ourselves, &ldquo;Is this word healthy?&rdquo; We should take in only healthy words and healthy teaching.</p>
<p>In summary, the Epistles to Timothy reveal that we need to take care of four major items&mdash;God&rsquo;s economy, the truth, godliness, and healthy words and healthy teaching. We should not care for different teachings, doctrines, disputations, arguments, concepts, or eloquence. If we care for these things, we will be misled. Rather, we need to simply take care of the four basic, solid items of God&rsquo;s economy, the truth, godliness, and healthy words and healthy teaching.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_026.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Principles for the Proper Church Life &nbsp; pg 27</div><br></body></html>
