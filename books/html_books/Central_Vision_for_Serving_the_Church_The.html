<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>From mid-August to mid-September 1975, Brother Witness Lee spoke numerous messages in conferences, trainings, and fellowship meetings in Taiwan. The conferences and training messages have been published as <em>Living in the Spirit, Living with the Lord, The Testimony of Jesus Christ&mdash;the Church in Revelation, </em>and<em> The Revelation of the Mystery.</em> The messages in this book, given in Taipei on August 19 through 26, 1975, contain fellowship with co-workers and elders from the Far East.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">REVELATION IN SPIRIT BEING NEEDED FOR SERVICE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PAUL&rsquo;S ZEALOUS SERVICE TO GOD<br />
BEING IN OPPOSITION TO GOD</h2>
<p>Paul was not a Gentile; he did not worship idols or commit gross sins. He grew up in a God-seeking environment, and he was a God-seeker. He says, &ldquo;I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race&rdquo; (Gal. 1:14). Paul was more advanced, pious, zealous, and God-seeking than many of his contemporaries. He was so strong in his seeking of God that he was considered blameless in regard to the righteousness that is in the law (Phil. 3:6). According to morality and human culture, he was faultless. Paul did a top religious work in the top religious environment. However, according to 1 Timothy 1:13, Paul acknowledged that he had opposed God to the uttermost, being a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insulting person. Even the idolatrous and grossly sinning Gentiles did not oppose God as much as Paul did. He opposed not only God but also the church, which Christ gave Himself up for by shedding His blood (Gal. 1:13, 23; Eph. 5:25).</p>
<p>Although Paul&rsquo;s zealousness and earnestness in serving God were unparalleled, he opposed God to the uttermost. In Acts 22:3 Paul said that he &ldquo;trained at the feet of Gamaliel, according to the strictness of the law of our fathers.&rdquo; <em>Trained</em> in Greek means &ldquo;educated.&rdquo; Paul was born, raised, and educated in a God-seeking and God-serving environment. The names of idols were not in his mouth, and he committed no offenses or crimes with his hands. Everything he did was for God. Were it not for the light that shined on him from God, no one would be able to believe that such a one could be an opposer of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POSSIBILITY OF REPEATING PAUL&rsquo;S MISTAKES</h2>
<p>It is possible for us to repeat Paul&rsquo;s mistakes. We have been trained for many years in the church, and we serve more zealously than most Christians. Not only do we regard ourselves in this way, but even others have such a regard for us. Our situation is just like that of Paul, who was praised by his contemporaries. Certainly the priests and elders praised the young Paul, who was so promising, resolute, and able. The priests and elders surely were pleased that he was able to do so much. Nevertheless, Paul did not know that he was in darkness. Although we may be able to boast of our many years of training, our love for God, our service to God, and our absoluteness for God, we may be no different than Paul. Before he was saved, Paul thought that his persecution of the church and the things that he did contrary to the name of Jesus were part of his zealous service to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATAN USING MAN&rsquo;S PIETY AND ZEAL<br />
TO DESTROY GOD&rsquo;S MOVE</h2>
<p>Satan was the source of Paul&rsquo;s zealous service. When we say this, some religionists will argue that Satan does not want man to be zealous for God. No one questions Satan&rsquo;s influence on a person who indulges in going to theaters and nightclubs. But if a person zealously attends meetings, serves God, and is an elder in the church, no one would dare speak of this activity as being from Satan. However, the Bible indicates that it is possible to zealously serve God under Satan&rsquo;s influence.</p>
<p>In John 16:2 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;They will put you out of the synagogues; but an hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God.&rdquo; Although serving God may not be motivated by Satan, killing always comes from Satan. However, in this verse the Lord Jesus connected serving God with killing. Satan can motivate people, who believe that they are serving God, to kill. In other words, Satan can delude people into thinking that killing is a service to God.</p>
<p>According to the revelation of the Bible, our body, our flesh, is still under the authority of Satan. Therefore, no matter how pious or zealous we are, our piety or zeal may be of Satan. There is nothing that Satan cannot use. Satan can use the piety and zeal of the most pious and zealous person. Saul of Tarsus was used by Satan to the uttermost. Saul did not steal or commit fornication, and he kept the law to the extent that he was considered blameless in regard to the righteousness that is in the law. Nevertheless, he was used by Satan to the uttermost to destroy God&rsquo;s move.</p>
<p>God became flesh in the man Jesus to accomplish His heart&rsquo;s desire (John 1:14). Yet Paul served God zealously and did many things contrary to the name of Jesus in order to overthrow this name (Acts 26:9). Paul wanted to eliminate the name of Jesus. This shows the extent to which he was deluded by Satan. We should not think that we can never be deluded. We may feel that we love God and that we are for the church, but our zeal for the church can be used by Satan in his efforts to destroy the church. In Paul&rsquo;s zealous service, he did many things contrary to the name of Jesus in order to overthrow His name, and he persecuted the church to the extent that he bound and delivered men and women to prison (8:3; 22:4). He even punished the believers in the synagogues (26:11), casting a vote against them when they were being done away with (v. 10).</p><h2 class="head1">SATAN USING BOTH GOOD AND EVIL<br />
TO DAMAGE GOD&rsquo;S MOVE</h2>
<p>In the same principle, our service to God can be used as an instrument of Satan to destroy God&rsquo;s move. We are not indifferent Christians who do not love or serve God; we all love and serve God zealously. However, we must bring our love for God, our service to God, and our being for the church to the Lord to see whether or not we are fulfilling His heart&rsquo;s desire or opposing it. We should never judge according to good or evil, thinking that good things are good and that only evil things are evil. When Satan is involved, there is no difference between good and evil because he mixes good and evil together, and he brings this mixture of good and evil into the service to God. We should not think that Satan cannot use us because we do not lose our temper or play mah-jongg or because we have given our life to the church and bear some responsibility. Satan is still walking about (1 Pet. 5:8); he has not yet been bound. According to the revelation of the Bible, Satan can still come into God&rsquo;s presence in the third heaven to accuse God&rsquo;s people (Job 1:6-12; 2:1-6). He will not be cast down from heaven to the earth until Revelation 12, and he is temporarily bound and cast into the abyss only in chapter 20. Only when he has been bound will Satan be unable to use our love for the Lord to damage God&rsquo;s move. Since Satan is still working today, we should not believe that he cannot use something that is good.</p>
<p>If some among us esteem ourselves highly, we should not be so confident. A good number of saints may say that they love the Lord so much and have been faithful to the Lord for so long that they would never deviate or fall into Satan&rsquo;s hand. Please do not say this! The more certainty we have concerning our condition, the more likely we are to fall into Satan&rsquo;s hand. We should not judge our condition according to a standard of good and evil because even the best things can be used by Satan to become the most evil things. Saul of Tarsus thought that he was serving God to the uttermost, but he had no realization that his service to God was in complete opposition to God. From the time of Adam, perhaps no one has opposed God as much as Saul, even though he was not focused on evil things. Even though his service was focused on good things, he still opposed God to the uttermost. He kept the law, he was zealous, and he served God, and yet his good service was used by Satan and turned into something quite evil. If we boast in our love for the brothers, Satan can use our love against God&rsquo;s interests. Even if we are truly for the Lord, Satan can use this to oppose the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BRINGING OUR TRUE CONDITION BEFORE THE LORD</h2>
<p>We must bring our true condition before the Lord. Some of us have been elders for over two decades and bear many responsibilities in the church; others have been co-workers for over two decades and have shared in the Lord&rsquo;s work. We must bring our condition before the Lord. Satan is exceedingly subtle and pervasive; he can infiltrate even our piety and prayers. A brother may regard himself as being skillful in prayer, and even if others are not praying, he will pray by himself. It is easy to see Satan&rsquo;s infiltration and frustration when there is a lack of prayer, but it is harder to see his frustration when we pray. Often what we see is not nearly as fearful as what we cannot see. An undiagnosed disease is often more dangerous than a known disease. People do not think that Satan can infiltrate and frustrate our prayers; instead, they can see his involvement only in our idle words and gossip. It is easy to think that we cannot be touched by Satan when we pray alone in a room, but little do we realize that we are quite susceptible to Satan&rsquo;s schemes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEARING FRUIT<br />
BEING A RESULT OF SATAN&rsquo;S SCHEMES</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus said that a tree is known by its fruit (Matt. 7:17-18). A good tree produces good fruit, and a corrupt tree produces bad fruit. A fruitless tree is the same as a dead tree. The New Testament even speaks of a fruitless tree being in danger of being cut down (Luke 13:6-7), because without fruit a tree is useless and as good as dead. Many of us are fruitless trees. Some pray much but have no fruit. Others are quite pious but have no fruit. The number of people meeting in the church in Taipei today is less than a decade ago. There are always births and deaths in a country, but a country will decline in population over a period of only a decade if there are fewer births than deaths. We have preached the gospel and baptized many people in the past decade, but where are they? I do not believe that they have all died; instead, they have not become remaining fruit. If the number of people meeting in a district is not growing, and the brothers and sisters there are not quite dead nor fully alive, then our service to God is being used by Satan. Outwardly, the brothers and sisters may be breaking bread, remembering the Lord, and worshipping the Father, but actually, Satan has gained some ground. Having no fruit is a result of Satan&rsquo;s schemes.</p>
<p>Going to movies is clearly something of Satan&rsquo;s doing, but it is not so easy to see that Satan has influence over a person who breaks bread at the Lord&rsquo;s table and who is responsible for passing the bread and the cup. However, if death is manifested over a long period of time, we can conclude that Satan is in our service even though our service is not outwardly evil. In the Bible death is even more defiling than evil, and our barrenness is an indication of death. Our lack of fruit is an indication of death.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei&rsquo;s lack of increase in the past decade shows that it is dead, that it has been cheated by Satan. How else could a church have no increase after a decade? A physically and psychologically healthy couple will have at least a few lively children after being married for ten years. But look at the condition of the saints in the church in Taipei. If we say that we are dead, there may be a little life, but if we say that we are living, there is not much life. To the church in Sardis the Lord said, &ldquo;You have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead&rdquo; (Rev. 3:1). Everything in Sardis was near the point of death (v. 2). This is the condition of the church today; it is living in name but weak to the point of death. Such a condition proves that Satan has influence in the church. We can be serving in name only, while actually opposing God, and our service for the church may actually be holding back the church. This is Satan&rsquo;s scheme. </p><h2 class="head1">HAVING EVERYTHING BUT THE REVELATION</h2>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s zealous service to God was actually in opposition to God and according to Satan&rsquo;s instigation. Some local churches are waning like the setting sun. Only a person without revelation could boast of his prayer and of his love for the Lord in such a situation. Such boasting is an indication that his zeal may actually be in opposition to God. Before Paul encountered the great light on the road to Damascus, he had knowledge, religion, tradition, training, and zeal but no revelation.</p>
<p">According to my observation, the brothers and sisters are in a worrisome condition. Our condition is at least ninety percent the same as Paul&rsquo;s, if not a hundred percent. We have everything but revelation. At a recent bread-breaking meeting, I realized that the brothers have inherited a set way of doing things and that we have picked up some additional ways over the years, including calling on the name of the Lord, pray-reading, and even pray-singing. However, I did not hear a single prayer filled with the flavor of revelation; there were only the same old expressions. Although things were one way a decade ago and may be another way today, there is still no revelation.</p>
<p>First Samuel 3:1-3 says, &ldquo;The boy Samuel ministered to Jehovah before Eli. Now the word of Jehovah was rare in those days; visions were not widespread. And at that time Eli lay in his place, and his eyesight had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see. And the lamp of God had not yet gone out. And Samuel lay in the temple of Jehovah, where the Ark of God was.&rdquo; <em>Rare</em> in verse 1 means &ldquo;costly&rdquo; in Hebrew. Some English versions render this word as &ldquo;precious.&rdquo; Something is precious when it is rare. Gold would not be precious if it were found everywhere; gold is valuable only because it is rare. The word of Jehovah was precious because the word of Jehovah was rare. The condition of the meeting that I attended was somewhat like the time of Eli. I heard doctrine but no word of the Lord; I heard set prayers but no words of revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAUL BEING UNABLE TO SEE<br />
AND NEEDING THE HELP OF OTHERS<br />
BECAUSE OF THE LORD&rsquo;S SHINING</h2>
<p>When Paul served in darkness, he was very confident and felt that he was quite correct. He was full of self-confidence. Only a person who is in darkness is certain of himself. Paul was full of self-confidence until a great light came upon him on his way to Damascus (Acts 9:3). When God&rsquo;s light flashed around him, the one who was clear about everything became blind and could see nothing (v. 8).</p>
<p>In Acts 22:11 Paul said, &ldquo;I could not see because of the glory of that light.&rdquo; Although he formerly knew the way, took the lead, and led others, he became confused when the Lord&rsquo;s light shined upon him. He had no sense of direction, and he needed the help of others. Hence, in verse 11 he said, &ldquo;I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus.&rdquo; It is a great blessing to have a sense of our need to be led by others; it proves that we have light. The only thing that matters is having revelation and light. Being zealous in our love for the Lord or being an elder or a co-worker does not matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD APPEARING TO PAUL TO IMPART REVELATION</h2>
<p>Paul spoke of the Lord appearing to him when he defended himself before King Agrippa (26:16). Formerly, Paul knew much doctrine, but he did not know God. The Lord appeared to him in order to shine on him. The Lord came to him in the shining of the light. At that time, he was filled with knowledge, but he had no light. The Lord&rsquo;s shining showed Paul that his knowledge was being used by Satan. Paul was blinded and confused by the light, but in this blinding, he received revelation. Often we receive light and revelation when we sense that we cannot see things so clearly in our service. However, we can also be in utter darkness if we think that we know everything, that we can lead others, and that we are superior to others.</p>
<p>In the great light the Lord said to Paul, &ldquo;I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a minister and a witness both of the things in which you have seen Me and of the things in which I will appear to you; delivering you from...the Gentiles, to whom I send you, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God&rdquo; (vv. 16-18). Paul testified to King Agrippa that &ldquo;nothing apart from the things which both the prophets and Moses have said would take place, that the Christ would suffer and that He, being the first to rise from the dead, would announce light both to the people and to the Gentiles&rdquo; (vv. 22-23). Paul testified as one who had been shined upon and received revelation.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEING LIGHT AND RECEIVING REVELATION<br />
DEPENDING ON THE LORD&rsquo;S MERCY</h2>
<p>Whether we see light and receive revelation depends on the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. Paul did not seek revelation or pray for light from heaven. He was headed in a different direction when the light came. I am not encouraging you to take a different direction. I only want you to know that seeing light and receiving revelation are fully dependent upon the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. Revelation depends on mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts&rdquo; (2 Cor. 4:6). God&rsquo;s shining is related to His mercy, not to our prayer. He will have mercy on whomever He wills to have mercy (Rom. 9:15, 18). Satan was able to use Paul, but God is able to say to Satan, &ldquo;Even though you have been using this man for decades, I will have mercy on him; I will choose him.&rdquo; Shining and revelation depend on the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. He will have mercy on whomever He will have mercy, and He will shine on whomever He will shine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NO LONGER LIVING ACCORDING TO<br />
TRADITION OR KNOWLEDGE</h2>
<p>This does not mean that Paul no longer had any veils, but the New Testament certainly shows that he learned some serious lessons and no longer dared to serve according to tradition, knowledge, or his own opinion. From his Epistles we can see that he lived in the spirit after being shined upon by the Lord. Paul did not want tradition, knowledge, or his opinion; rather, he was a person in the spirit. In Ephesians 3:5 Paul says that he received revelation from God in spirit. God revealed the mystery of the gospel, the mystery of Christ, and the mystery of the church to him in his spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LACK OF LIGHT AND REVELATION<br />
BEING A RESULT OF LEAVING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We need revelation, light, the opening of our eyes, and the turning from darkness to light. I have a deep sense that the churches in the Far East lack revelation. Yes, there are doctrines. Yes, there are practices. But there is a lack of the spirit and a lack of revelation. Consequently, darkness is falling upon the churches. We are where we are today because we have strayed from the spirit. Once we leave the spirit, we fall into set ways according to what we previously learned. It is easy to follow a learned way, but without our spirit there will be no revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Laziness Being a Problem in Our Natural Disposition</h2>
<p>Laziness is a problem in the natural disposition of fallen human beings. I am certain that if Saul had been a lazy person who slept all day, God would never have shined on him. God shined on him in the midst of his diligent opposition to God. D. L. Moody was a powerful evangelist who led many to salvation, but he said, &ldquo;I have never heard of a lazy man being converted.&rdquo; It is difficult for lazy persons to be saved. This is not because God has no desire to save them, but because they are too lazy to receive His salvation.</p>
<p>Some local churches lose revelation and are without light because of laziness. Other local churches are blessed by God because they are not loose or lazy. In the United States some churches begin the bread-breaking meeting at 7:30 P.M., but many brothers and sisters arrive at a quarter to seven and begin to praise. Some even come at six o&rsquo;clock to arrange and neatly line up the chairs. This shows that they take these matters seriously.</p>
<p>I am speaking of practical matters only to point out their relationship to our heart. If the responsible brothers, who take the lead to break bread, do not dress neatly and do not even button their shirts properly, how can we believe that there is any light in the church there? The brothers and sisters should do things in the church in a proper manner. If some practical things cannot be done properly, then they should not be done at all. A loose person should not take the lead in a church, and the meetings should not be entrusted to such a one. If a bread-breaking meeting begins at 7:30, the seats should be ready before 6:30. The serving ones should take care of the number and the arrangement of the chairs for the convenience of the saints.</p>
<p>In January 1950 Brother Nee went from mainland China to Hong Kong and brought in a revival there. However, since he could not stay in Hong Kong, he asked me to come to Hong Kong to see him. The morning after I arrived, he took me to the elders and co-workers&rsquo; service meeting. There he publicly stated that he wanted me to arrange the matters of service in the church in Hong Kong, including the service of the co-workers, elders, and deacons. I then began to arrange the elders&rsquo; office and the business office and to lead the elders and the deacons in their service. I began by considering the furnishings of the meeting hall and found that many things were old and worn out. It seemed as if the saints&rsquo; homes were furnished better than the meeting hall. The paintings on the meeting hall walls were worn and dusty. The organ was in such poor condition that no one would have taken it if it were left on the street. The doorbell of the meeting hall was not electric; it had only a crude lead string. When someone pulled the string, clanging sounds would go off inside the meeting hall. All the saints had electric doorbells at home, but the doorbell of the meeting hall was made of string. These furnishings were unfit for a city like Hong Kong. I spoke to the brothers and sisters and said that if the condition of the meeting hall was a reflection of our service, we might as well close the meeting hall, go home, and sleep. I am thankful to the Lord that the brothers and sisters had the grace to take this fellowship, and the appearance of the meeting hall changed the next day. This happened on February 20, 1950.</p>
<p>My point is not that we would focus on physical things but that we would take our participation in our service to God seriously. We should offer up not only ourselves but also our lives. If we pray for &ldquo;rain from heaven,&rdquo; we should also prepare vessels to hold the rain. If we do not prepare vessels, everything will leak away when the rain comes. The brothers and sisters have become loose after many years in the church life. Once looseness comes in, however, the blessing will be lost, and only problems will arise. Once there is looseness, restraint is cast off. Proverbs 29:18 says, &ldquo;Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint.&rdquo; People who are lazy cast off restraint; they become loose and incapable of doing anything. From what I hear now, some places are in an unrestrained and shameful condition. When there is no vision or light, people become loose and unrestrained, and they fall into all kinds of corrupt situations. Casting off restraint is an indication that there is no light.</p>
<p>Our idle words and gossip are shameful, and they cause us to lose light and revelation. If, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we are willing to restrain ourselves and live in the spirit, we will receive revelation every day. Revelation is not in our mind but in our spirit. Since the Lord is in our spirit, we must be in our spirit in order to receive revelation.</p><h2 class="head2">Strong Personality and Natural Ability<br />
Closing the Door to Revelation</h2>
<p>Some people have a very strong personality. A person who has a strong personality will not do something unless he is given responsibility for it. Such persons are naturally able and are capable of exerting influence with their strong personality. If the church is placed into their hands, the door for revelation often is closed. If the leading ones are open to the Lord, they and the saints will receive light and revelation. If, however, the leading ones are not open, the saints will not receive revelation even if they have a heart. A flock always follows the head sheep; the head sheep determines how the other sheep follow. Once the leading ones go astray, it is difficult for the flock not to go astray as well. This will stop the shining of light. Some leading ones have a natural ability to work things out; however, the church is the Body, and the Body depends upon the coordination of the members. Even if we are able to work things out, everything does not have to be decided by us. We must look to the Lord&rsquo;s mercy that our strong personality would be subdued. Otherwise, we will close the door to revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Social Skills and Diplomacy<br />
Closing the Door to Revelation</h2>
<p>Other people bring their social skills and diplomacy into the church; they cultivate friendships, develop relationships, and connect with one another. This also closes the door to revelation, and it has no place in the church. There should be healthy fellowship in the church but not social connections or acceptance of others based on social approval. It is a shame for social skills to be utilized in the church. We should sustain one another, but a social &ldquo;endorsement&rdquo; of others is a shame.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RETURNING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>These conditions are present in the church because of our natural humanity. Their presence, however, also indicates that we have strayed from our spirit. For this we need to accept the cross, but more accurately, we need to return to our spirit. If we &ldquo;accept the cross&rdquo; without returning to our spirit, our acceptance is merely an expression of human cultivation. When we return to our spirit, there is no ground for our self. In other words, our flesh, our human affections, and our old ways are terminated when we return to our spirit.</p>
<p>Our problem today is that we lack the spirit, and because we lack the spirit, we lack revelation. If we are not in our spirit, we will bring our knowledge and old ways into the church. A wax figure is not a human being, because there is no life in it. Life is the most important matter. A loud and fast prayer is not an indication that our spirit has been released. Instead, the release of our spirit depends upon whether we are in our spirit. People who have a strong personality and who are skillful in exercising diplomacy often do not release much of the spirit in their prayers in the meetings. In fact, those who exercise diplomacy often do not pray, and when they do pray, it often comes from the mind.</p>
<p>Being in the spirit is not something that can be feigned, imitated, or hidden. When the church is truly in the spirit, the Spirit is manifested in a clear way, and it is quite exposing. The Spirit exposes us when we open our mouth as well as when we shut it. The Spirit exposes us when we move as well as when we are still. In contrast, a fleshly person is still fleshly whether or not he loses his temper. As long as we are not in our spirit, our fleshly nature is manifest. A loose person manifests a loose nature, an able person manifests his ability, and a diplomatic person manifests his ability to connect with and win over people. However, once we return to our spirit, none of these things have any ground. We should never value a person&rsquo;s outward performance. It may be useful in society, but it is useless in the church. We need to be genuine and to be in our spirit in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">POSITION-SEEKING IN THE CHURCH BEING IN DARKNESS</h2>
<p>Years ago I did not know or believe that people would seek for position in the church. Over the years, however, I have discovered that such a desire is always present in us. For example, if a sister is asked to serve as a deaconess, another sister will complain that she was not asked as well. In the brothers&rsquo; fellowship concerning the appointment of elders, there are often ones who say, &ldquo;It will not be good if we make this brother an elder but not that brother.&rdquo; Such a thought is quite low. If this is truly the case, then neither brother should be an elder. Anyone who talks about position is not qualified to be an elder.</p>
<p>I went to Shanghai for the first time in October 1933, and I was a guest in Brother Nee&rsquo;s home for four months. Then the Lord led me to move my whole family to Shanghai to labor with Brother Nee. There were many things that I did not know related to the church in Shanghai, but Brother Nee still made me responsible for speaking in the meetings. At that time, there was a very active and aggressive brother who appeared to love the Lord very much. One afternoon this brother came and asked me if he could speak from the podium in the afternoon meeting, so I gave him an opportunity to speak. When Brother Nee learned about this, he spoke a serious word to me concerning not letting this brother give any messages. Later, I learned that this brother had had a desire to be an elder from the time that he came into the church life.</p>
<p>Brother Nee said that whoever wants to an elder should not be an elder. Brother Nee practiced this, and he would not let this brother be an elder. He was very strict in this matter. When I went to Shanghai in 1948, this brother was still not an elder. At the end of 1948, he started another meeting in his home and hired a freelance preacher. The freelance preacher later wrote a book attacking Brother Nee. If we have a hidden desire for position in the church, we will be in darkness and not have any light or revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REPENTING TO THE LORD FOR NOT LIVING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Because of these negative conditions, we have no light and revelation. Whether we are co-workers or elders, we must be subdued before the Lord and must humble ourselves when we gather together from our various localities. These negative conditions should not be present in the church. We must be in our spirit in the church. There is no place for us in the church apart from being in our spirit. If we are not in our spirit, we are finished in the church. No amount of human striving and struggling will produce favorable results. Being in spirit is the only way in the church. Eloquence, thoughtfulness, and knowledge are useless. Only being in the spirit is useful in the church. Once we return to our spirit, there will be an Amen in the spirit of all the saints.</p>
<p>If we know how to speak but have no spirit, the more we speak, the more the saints will be quiet, and the more we move, the less the saints will say Amen. As long as we neglect the spirit, the light will fade like the setting sun, like a dying lamp. The elders have paid much attention to administration, methods, and arrangements but not to the spirit or to supplying the saints in the spirit. In principle, this is the same with the brothers and sisters. The speaking from the podium is not focused on the spirit, the meetings are not focused on the spirit, and our prayers are not focused on the spirit. Instead, we are focused on diplomacy, practices, knowledge, and being clever. Our spirit is lacking in function, and there is little light.</p>
<p>If the Spirit does not get through, the Lord will not be present, and if the Lord is not present, we have nothing. We have no light, no life, and no revelation because we have no spirit. It is not enough for us to hate sin; we must hate not being in our spirit. Man sins, falls, casts off restraint, and maneuvers for position because he is not in the spirit. Once man returns to the spirit, he no longer strives for position, and he even tires of position and considers it a hindrance to his living in the spirit.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would not only repent for our sins but also for not living in our spirit. Not living in our spirit is a great offense to the Lord. If we are not in our spirit, we will not have revelation or light, the church will not have increase, and the work will produce only problems. We must hate that we care only for our self and our convenience and not for our spirit. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEARING FRUIT BY SERVING IN THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE ACCORDING TO MAN<br />
VERSUS THE REVELATION OF GOD</h2>
<p>In Galatians 1:11 Paul says, &ldquo;I make known to you, brothers, concerning the gospel announced by me, that it is not according to man.&rdquo; <em>According to man</em> shows that we can announce the gospel according to the will of man. In verse 12 he says, &ldquo;Neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation by Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This shows that the will of man is versus the revelation of God. It is possible to announce the gospel according to the will of man and contrary to the revelation of God.</p>
<p>In verse 13 Paul says, &ldquo;You have heard of my manner of life formerly in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it.&rdquo; As an orthodox religion, Judaism teaches man to worship God and to carry out God&rsquo;s will. However, Saul of Tarsus&rsquo;s zealous service in this God-worshipping and God-serving religion actually contradicted God&rsquo;s will. In his service he persecuted and ravaged the church that God had established. It is God&rsquo;s will to gain the church, but Saul persecuted and ravaged the church. This should be a warning to not be too confident concerning our service in the church. It is possible for our zealous service to contradict God&rsquo;s will. Although Saul of Tarsus persecuted and ravaged the church to the point of killing Christians, his persecution and ravaging were really the work of Satan. It is possible for Satan to use a person&rsquo;s zealous service even in an orthodox religion. Thus, we should not think that Satan can never be involved in our service. Such confidence brings in self-deception. If Saul of Tarsus could be deceived, we can be deceived.</p>
<p>In verse 14 Paul says, &ldquo;I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more abundantly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers.&rdquo; Perhaps no one was more diligent than Saul of Tarsus, because he advanced beyond many contemporaries in his race. If others woke up at 5:30 in the morning to worship God, he probably woke up at 3:30. He was not slothful in his zeal for Judaism, but Satan used his diligence. Although slothfulness is an indication that a person is not in the spirit, diligence is not necessarily an indication that a person is in the spirit. It is possible for both a slothful person and a diligent person to not be in the spirit. We should never just condemn slothfulness while justifying diligence, because a person&rsquo;s diligence is not necessarily associated with being in the spirit. Saul served God diligently in an orthodox religion and advanced beyond all others, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of his fathers. Since zealousness requires diligence, a person who lacks diligence will not be zealous. However, it is possible for such zeal and diligence to be apart from God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>In Acts 26:9-11 Paul said, &ldquo;I thought to myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene, which also I did in Jerusalem; and I both shut up many of the saints in prison when I had received authority from the chief priests and cast a vote against them when they were being done away with. And in all the synagogues I punished them often and tried to compel them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged at them, I persecuted them even as far as foreign cities.&rdquo; Saul was very diligent in doing things contrary to the name of Jesus, and he often persecuted the saints exceedingly. Although he was more diligent than others, his diligence was not in the spirit. We must condemn this kind of diligence in the same way that we condemn slothfulness. Although some local churches suffer loss because of the slothfulness of the responsible ones, other churches are damaged by their natural diligence.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE DEPENDING ON SEEING THE LORD<br />
IN HIS APPEARING</h2>
<p>We need to consider how to touch God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire without damaging the church. In verse 16 the Lord said to Paul, &ldquo;Rise up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a minister and a witness both of the things in which you have seen Me and of the things in which I will appear to you.&rdquo; This indicates that Paul&rsquo;s service did not depend on slothfulness or on diligence but on the things he had seen concerning the Lord, that is, the knowledge of Christ he received through the Lord&rsquo;s appearing. It is possible for a person to receive a vision of many things but not necessarily of the things concerning Christ. Thus, the Lord appeared to Paul and said that He would appear to him again so that Paul might see the things concerning Him. The things in which He would appear to Paul were the things concerning the church. On his way to Damascus, Paul gained knowledge of Christ, and then the Lord gradually revealed the church to him.</p>
<p>In verses 17 and 18 the Lord spoke to Paul and said that He was sending him to the Gentiles &ldquo;to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God.&rdquo; Saul thought his eyes were open, but once a great light flashed around him from heaven, his blindness was exposed. Before the light flashed around him, he thought his eyes were opened because he was taking the lead to serve God. Once the light came, however, he was blinded and had to be led by the hand by others (9:8). Formerly, he led others; now others led him. His inner eyes were not opened until he was blinded outwardly. Hence, when the Lord told him that he was being sent to open the eyes of others and to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, he understood.</p>
<p>Like many zealous Jews, Saul of Tarsus was in darkness. The Jews thought that they were living in the light and that they were guides to the blind and teachers of babes (Rom. 2:19-20), but they were actually in darkness. Therefore, when the Lord spoke to Saul of Tarsus concerning opening the eyes of the Gentiles to &ldquo;turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God&rdquo; (Acts 26:18), this was a strong indication that Saul&rsquo;s service was related to Satan&rsquo;s scheme. Saul persecuted the church and was zealous for religion and the law, but he was fully under the authority of Satan. Those who are under the authority of Satan are blind and in darkness. Like other Jews, Saul worshipped in the temple, and he supported the priestly service of offering sacrifices, burning incense, lighting the lamps, and presenting the bread of the Presence. However, he served God without knowing that he was blind, in darkness, and under the authority of Satan. Hence, before the Lord sent Saul to the Gentiles, He sent him to His people for help.</p>
<p>A person may receive revelation without vision. In Acts 26:19 Paul testified to King Agrippa, saying, &ldquo;I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.&rdquo; On his way to Damascus, Paul received not only revelation but also a vision &ldquo;that the Christ would suffer and that He, being the first to rise from the dead, would announce light both to the people and to the Gentiles&rdquo; (v. 23). <em>The people</em> refers to the Jews who worshipped God, not to Gentiles. The Jews who worshipped God in the temple needed to receive light. The gospel was preached to the Jews first and then announced to the Gentiles.</p><h2 class="head1">WORK NEEDING TO PRODUCE FRUIT</h2>
<p>We need to come into the Lord&rsquo;s presence, consider and look to the Lord, and let Him shine upon us anew. We may have fallen into the same condition as the Jewish people. They worshipped God in the temple according to the law of Moses, and we serve in the church according to what we have been taught over the years. We should never think that it is impossible for us to fall into darkness, blindness, and the authority of Satan, as the Jews did. Just as they fell into darkness under the authority of Satan, we can fall and perhaps fall even further.</p>
<p>Every tree is known by its fruit (Matt. 12:33; Luke 6:44); this is an ironclad law in the Bible. Whether our service is good or bad is not determined by the words that we speak but by the fruit that we bear. In order to have proper fruit, we must be in the spirit. The fruit in the churches in the Far East is not convincing evidence that the saints are living in the spirit. I do not say this to condemn others or the church but to remind us of our need to examine ourselves. If we are living in the spirit, where is our fruit? A grain of wheat that falls into the ground and dies bears much fruit (John 12:24). If we say that we are grains of wheat and that we have fallen into the ground and died, where is the issue of our death? If we are the same as those who have no experience of death and bear no fruit, have we truly died? If a grain of wheat bears no fruit, is it any better than a grain of sand? It is useless to debate about the reasons for our fruitlessness; even bandits have reasons for being bandits. We cannot rely just upon words; we must check to see if there is any fruit.</p>
<p>If we have been co-workers or elders for many years but do not have any fruit, we need no further proof of our lack. The fruitlessness of others is not the concern. If we have no fruit ourselves, our work is meaningless. If the Lord came to settle accounts with us today, He would not look at whether we are right about certain things but of whether we have fruit. The churches in the Far East should have a strong ability to beget many children. If the elders, co-workers, and responsible brothers have no children, we will lose a generation over the next ten years. As co-workers who have been working for so many years, we need to ask ourselves who will carry on the work? Where is our next generation? If the co-workers and elders do not produce a new generation, the consequences will be worrisome.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE NEEDING TO BE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Following Methods</h2>
<p>A responsible brother once promoted the matter of rising up at 5:30 in the morning for morning watch, but his promotion yielded no fruit, because he was promoting only human diligence. Being diligent, however, is not the same as being spiritual. Although it is difficult to know whether something is spiritual, it is easier to know whether something is not spiritual. Although few saints can give a clear definition of spirituality, everyone knows whether the promotion of a certain practice in the church is spiritual, especially when the promotion is not in the spirit. Diligence and faithfulness are valuable in every human circumstance but not necessarily in the spiritual realm. Spirituality is related to the release of the spirit. A brother should never stir up people to simply rise up at 5:30 in the morning. For the sake of the saints, it would be better if he slept more. This would be his salvation. Although it would be good if slothful ones would rise earlier, it would be better if this brother would rise later. The more he promoted rising early in the meeting, the more he deadened the meeting. His good intentions produced the opposite effect, and it was easier for the saints to receive a supply of life when he did not speak.</p>
<p>Whenever we are given an opportunity, we look for methods. In 1968 the churches in the Far East began to imitate the churches in America by being loud, but soon there was no spirit or even a taste for this. Just as being quiet is not necessarily a matter in the spirit, neither is being loud necessarily a matter in the spirit. I have no desire that we become a &ldquo;loud church&rdquo; or a &ldquo;quiet church&rdquo; but rather a &ldquo;living-in-the-spirit church.&rdquo; The spirit is living and spontaneous, causes no confusion, and does not necessarily forbid a particular practice. Whatever is of the spirit causes people to touch the spirit; whatever is not of the spirit damages the church. There are no set church practices. I deeply feel that the churches in the Far East have grown accustomed to a living that looks for and follows methods while neglecting the matter of living in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being Too Confident</h2>
<p>I hope that we will examine ourselves under the Lord&rsquo;s light. According to our present situation, almost all the co-workers and elders need a &ldquo;surgical operation.&rdquo; We are like a couple who has been married for thirty years but has no children; our lack of fruit must be due to some &ldquo;illness.&rdquo; Truthfully, I have no way of knowing the details of our various situations; I can only point out that we have no fruit. We need to go before the Lord and examine our situation to determine the reason for our lack of fruit. The elders especially need to do this. Some elders have no fruit because they trust only themselves. A person who does not trust others has too much confidence in his own meticulous considerations and actions. Although he may derive some human benefit from his conduct, there is nothing spiritual about his conduct because it comes entirely from his good self. We must be in spirit in order to produce fruit. Our meticulous considerations cannot produce fruit, and the &ldquo;fruit&rdquo; that it can produce is not needed in the church.</p>
<p>Although the elders need to be broken and to pass through the dealing of the cross, this subject seems to have become old. When I speak on the breaking and the dealing of the cross today, there is not much response. The best speaker on the breaking of the cross was Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis, whom the Lord raised up fifty years ago. Many saints throughout America have her books in their homes, but these books are practically useless. It is hard to find anyone who has read her books and experienced being genuinely broken. People may hear a message, but they have no ear for it. This does not mean that the truth of the breaking of the cross is not the truth. Although this truth is still the truth, the emphasis in this age is not on the breaking of the cross. Truth is needed according to the age. Therefore, it is not enough for me to speak only on the breaking of the cross. Every businessman knows that items that were highly sought after fifty years ago may be undesirable today, even to antique dealers. The truth is always the truth, but we must pay attention to the need of the age.</p><h2 class="head2">The Spirit Needing to Be Released to Supply Others</h2>
<p>Thus, I have no desire to exhort the elders merely to accept the dealing and breaking of the cross; rather, I must speak of our need to live in the spirit, not in our knowledge, consideration, or views. This is the age of our spirit. Based on my recent experience of speaking, I have found that no subject draws the attention of people more than the spirit; people respond only to speaking related to living in the spirit. When I speak of living in the spirit, I am referring to our spirit, not the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>When we are in our spirit, we will be open to others and willing to let them serve. Whether they are able to carry out the responsibilities related to their service is up to the Lord. I believe that at least eighty out of a hundred saints will be able to carry out the responsibilities that are placed in their hands. We should not think that things will be taken care of properly only if they are in our hands. Even if only eighty percent can carry out certain responsibilities, we will still have a worthwhile outcome. However, if everything remains in our hands and we have no &ldquo;apprentices,&rdquo; there will be no subsequent generation. We must learn to live in the spirit, and we should release our spirit to supply those who are bearing responsibility.</p>
<p>The focus of the church is not on doing things well but on releasing the spirit and supplying life. Hence, we should not place too much trust in our insights and ways; we also should not linger in teachings from the past. It was right to speak on the teaching of the anointing twenty-five years ago, but we need to be up to date. Although Edison invented the electric light bulb, there has been much improvement in electric light bulbs. We must not stay in the past; we must go forward. What we once called the anointing, we now know as the Spirit. We must know the Spirit more and live in our spirit more.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living in the Spirit and Not Holding On to Authority</h2>
<p>Some elders hold on to authority and exercise authority over everything, even to the point that morning watch must be in their homes. Although they may not be holding on to authority intentionally, this is the actual situation. Holding on to authority can easily produce &ldquo;power struggles.&rdquo; I really do not like to use this term, and it is a shame if such a thing occurs in the church. Nevertheless, some elders think that since they are the leading ones, the ones with the most function, everything should be under their authority. This is not a situation in the spirit; instead, it is a killing situation, and there is no release of the spirit. Every elder should forget about authority and live in the spirit. Once the elders live in the spirit, there are no problems related to holding on to authority.</p>
<p>Some may say that Paul speaks of the elders taking the lead (1 Tim. 5:17). However, when the Lord Jesus spoke to His disciples in the Gospels about authority, He said, &ldquo;You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave; just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve&rdquo; (Matt. 20:25-28). Furthermore, He said, &ldquo;You call Me the Teacher and the Lord, and you say rightly, for I am. If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&rsquo;s feet&rdquo; (John 13:13-14). The Lord did not regard the exercise of authority as a matter of being great and first but rather as a matter of serving others and washing others&rsquo; feet. When we live in the spirit, authority is not a consideration, and we are willing to wash our brothers&rsquo; feet and let others be higher.</p>
<p>However, if we regard being lower as being better than higher, we may not necessarily be in the spirit either. When I say this, some may respond that they do not know what to do. People often say to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you say that something is good today, but you say something different three days later. You speak on this and then on that; we do not know what to do.&rdquo; I reply, &ldquo;Exactly. I do not want to tell you what to do. Your desire to do things is too rigid.&rdquo; Rather than trying to determine what to do or not to do, we should turn to our spirit. We need to train the saints to turn to the spirit.</p>
<p>A brother once came to me and accused the elders of being domineering, overbearing, and controlling. I responded, saying, &ldquo;You are more overbearing than the elders because you want to overthrow them. They were appointed to be elders, but your overbearing attitude toward them shows that you are a &lsquo;self-appointed elder.&rsquo;&rdquo; In contrast to this, some elders speak of their desire to be humble and to resign from the eldership so that the more capable ones can function. In reality this is an even more severe case of being in the flesh rather than in the spirit. When I say this, they do not know what to do because when they labor diligently, people say that they are overbearing, but when they consider resigning, I say that they are in the flesh. Being overbearing or resigning is not the issue; living in the spirit is all that matters. This is the most difficult truth to understand in the Bible. If we live in the spirit, we are right even if we show anger, but if we do not live in our spirit, we are wrong even if we show love. Being angry or being loving does not matter; living in the spirit is all that matters. We are not a social group that needs to focus on condemning the assertion of authority; we should focus on learning to live in the spirit. An elder&rsquo;s assertion of authority only proves that he is not living in the spirit; if he lives in the spirit more, he will assert less and less authority.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Willing to Perfect Others and Not Being Jealous</h2>
<p>An elder who was a businessman in America once warned me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you must be careful. If you teach the American brothers all these points about the eldership, they may begin to ignore you.&rdquo; His words exposed that he was fully in the flesh. He had only a mental understanding of the church. It was no wonder that he was lacking in life and had not borne any fruit in the church. He thought that the way to maintain control of the eldership was to not teach anyone the &ldquo;secrets&rdquo; of being an elder. Although I said nothing, I knew he was finished. An elder should never be afraid of people rejecting him after they have been perfected by him. If an elder holds on to such a thought, he is finished. Many do not have fruit because of such a thought. Once this thought is present, a person is absolutely in the flesh. If we are in the spirit, we will not care for position. If the Lord wants us to be an elder, we will be an elder, but if we scheme to hold on to a position by not perfecting the brothers, we are not in the spirit. When we are not in the spirit, we have no fruit. We should yearn for others to be more capable and better.</p>
<p>Jealousy is also a problem when a person is not in the spirit. Sometimes when elders work on a matter together, one of them has a desire to do everything, and there is jealousy when another elder is given responsibility. No one is without jealousy; consequently, we must learn to live in the spirit. The result of every arrangement is in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. No matter what the result is, we should be concerned only with whether or not we are living in the spirit. If all the elders are living in the spirit, their leading will produce fruit. Fruit is produced only when we are in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Removing Subjective, Preconceived Notions and<br />
the Tendency to Hold On to Old Things</h2>
<p>We also are subjective and tend to hold on to old things. We think that what was done in the past should never be changed. However, according to the Bible and the history of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, God never stays with things that are old. In Genesis God&rsquo;s work among men progressively advanced. In the first generation Adam was shown the way of salvation (3:21). In the second generation Abel presented offerings for fellowship with God (4:4). In the third generation Enosh began to call on the name of the Lord (v. 26). In the seventh generation Enoch walked with God (5:22), and in the tenth generation Noah received revelation from God concerning the building of the ark (6:13-16). God&rsquo;s work in man advances with every generation.</p>
<p>Some say that we are speaking about things today that Brother Nee never spoke of when he was alive. Such criticism is inevitable because, since the time of Brother Nee&rsquo;s imprisonment in 1952, the Lord has indeed given us new light. We should realize, however, that Brother Nee gained new understandings of the truth while he was ministering. For example, his book <em>The Assembly Life,</em> which was published in 1934, was edited from a Bible study that he had with co-workers in January 1934. In this book he said that there are no apostles today and that no one could appoint elders. He spoke of &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; apostles who appointed &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; elders and of the various local assemblies as being &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; churches.</p>
<p>Three years later in 1937, Brother Nee saw further light and released messages on the line of Antioch at a co-workers&rsquo; meeting in Hankow. Those messages are compiled in the book <em>The Normal Christian Church Life,</em> in which Brother Nee boldly said that there are apostles today and that an apostle is one who is sent by God to establish churches and appoint elders. He also said that the various local assemblies on the proper ground are churches. In less than three years his understanding had changed completely.</p>
<p>Another example of change involved the matter of sisters functioning in the meetings. When I was in Shanghai in 1933, Brother Nee felt that it was a great loss for the sisters to not be able to open their mouths in the meetings. We were under the influence of the Brethren, and the sisters could not open their mouths to testify or even pray in the meetings. They could only attend the meetings and sing along with the brothers. Brother Nee, however, studied the Scriptures, and he eventually felt that the sisters should be allowed to pray in the meetings. However, some brothers, who were influenced by the Brethren, did not approve.</p>
<p>One day Brother Nee said to me, &ldquo;Witness, when the sisters do not open their mouths in the meeting, the meeting is like a half-paralyzed body.&rdquo; At that time the brothers and sisters sat completely apart from each other. Therefore, all the prayers came from the brothers&rsquo; side, while the sisters&rsquo; side remained silent. The meeting truly resembled a half-paralyzed body. Because I was influenced by the Brethren and even by northern Chinese concepts, I felt that women should not stand out in the meetings. Only after Brother Nee spent much time to pray, wait, and fellowship did it become acceptable for the sisters to pray in the meetings and then only barely. Even then the sisters could not stand up to speak; they could only pray in the meetings. If the sisters wanted to speak, they had to speak in a separate meeting of just sisters.</p>
<p>Ruth Lee and Peace Wang were two very gifted sisters among us. Whenever they spoke, people were touched, and everyone loved their fellowship. Sister Lee and Sister Wang helped many people in various places, and even the brothers desired to hear their supplying fellowship. Consequently, there was soon another change. The sisters were encouraged to open their mouth to speak in the meetings, but they could not give messages or speak with a teaching tone; they could only give personal testimonies. The brothers were separated from the sisters by a folding screen so that the brothers could sit behind the screen and listen to the sisters.</p>
<p>There were also changes in the work. For example, when we visited the churches in the Fukien and Kwangtung Provinces in 1948, Brother Nee fellowshipped on the line of Jerusalem. When he spoke on the line of Antioch in 1937, he wanted the co-workers to spread to different places. Once a church was established in a locality, he charged the co-workers to go to another place. Eleven years later, however, when he spoke on the line of Jerusalem, he wanted the co-workers to stay. There have been numerous changes even among us.</p>
<p>The revelation of the Bible is always advancing; this is the case in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Gospel of John speaks of the Lord Jesus as a Lamb (1:29), whereas Revelation speaks of Him as a Lion (5:5). In the Gospels the Lord Jesus has two eyes, but in Revelation He is revealed as having seven eyes that are like a flame of fire (5:6; 1:14). The Lord is living; He is still working today, and His work and leading are progressive. It is the same with the history of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Beginning with Luther&rsquo;s recovery of justification by faith, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has advanced; no two ages are the same. If we preached only justification by faith today, we would be quite outdated.</p>
<p>If we are still meeting according to the way that we met thirty-five years ago&mdash;gathering in the Lord&rsquo;s name, calling a hymn after everyone arrives, having some prayer, remembering the Lord, giving thanks for the bread and the cup, and then worshipping the Father&mdash;and every part of our meeting is according to ritual, the saints will lose interest because the meetings are not up to date. There was once a co-worker who opposed pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord. He was determined to continue to preach as he had always preached. Eventually, however, his way was rejected and he left. Then the saints began to call on the name of the Lord, and everyone was released. Pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord are part of the flow in this age, and a flow cannot be stopped when it comes. The co-workers and elders should not be subjective. Neither should they stay with the old things or follow a crowd blindly; they should learn to live in the spirit. The spirit will spontaneously lead us to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name and pray-read His Word. Today some elders are not up to date, and others are neither solid nor stable, because they are following only in a casual way.</p><h2 class="head2">Establishing an Atmosphere of Living in the Spirit</h2>
<p>We should all exercise to live in the spirit. Before the bread-breaking meeting, every co-worker, elder, and responsible one should be burdened in spirit to prepare for the meeting. If these serving ones are prepared and live in the spirit, the spirit of all the saints will be living when they arrive at the meeting, and the meeting will not be poor or fall into rituals and routines. Regrettably, we often do not live in the spirit, and we are unprepared for the meeting. If we are indifferent when we arrive at the meeting, we will be able to meet only according to a prescribed order and in formality. Once there is a prescribed order, we are not in the spirit, and once there is formality, there are regulations. This is the reason that the meetings are empty and weak in various localities. It is easy to follow a prescribed order and to be in formality because people do not need to exercise their spirit in order to sit and listen to a message. After two or three such meetings, however, everyone will be &ldquo;deflated,&rdquo; and they will not want to return.</p>
<p>The ones serving in the church must establish an atmosphere of living in the spirit so that everyone is encouraged to live in the spirit. If there is a bread-breaking meeting and our spirit is on the alert, our spirit will be uplifted in the meeting, and there will be a response in others&rsquo; spirit. Then the meetings will be a rich outlet for the Lord. Without the exercise of the spirit, the meetings will become like bean dregs in plain water, and our numbers will decline over time. People will not be attracted if they cannot touch spiritual things in a meeting. However, if all the serving ones are strong and alert in spirit and if they are serious rather than indifferent, the new ones, young ones, and weak ones will touch spiritual reality when they come to the meeting, and they will be drawn to return. Only in this way can we bear fruit. Regrettably, our condition is often routine and old, and we do not use our spirit enough to contact the Lord and to have spiritual transactions with Him. Such a condition is not attractive to people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Entering into the Spirit of the Ministry<br />
to Have a Goal and a Direction in the Work</h2>
<p>In principle, there are not many ministries that can be used by the Lord as a source of supply in each age. This is because a ministry is like a trumpet. If there are too many ministries, there will be too many uncertain sounds, which makes it difficult for people to take the way of the church. Therefore, the Lord may not necessarily raise up many ministries simultaneously to be a source of supply.</p>
<p>Whoever is not used by the Lord as a source of supply for the ministry should receive the supply that is available so that he may supply others. However, such a one must still use his spirit to enter into the spirit of the ministry. Regrettably, ministers of the word in various localities have not generally entered into the spirit of the supplying ministry in their release of messages; that is, they have not entered into the flow of the ministry. Thus, their supply of the word has no direction or goal; it is like a ship drifting without a compass. In helping a local church, the co-workers should be in the flow and the spirit of the ministry to follow the direction of the compass. They should be like a ship that has set sail from Keelung to Hong Kong; everyone should know where the ship is going. The co-workers, however, seem to speak as they wish. They say one thing today and another thing tomorrow, and they are indifferent about whether or not there is fruit, despite working for a month, a few months, or even a few years. The churches being helped are also indifferent. Thus, it is difficult to bear fruit in such a situation.</p>
<p>The co-workers must spend more time living in the spirit to enter into the spirit of the ministry and the flow of the ministry. If our spirit is strong, our work will not be aimless. The cause of our illness is our not being in the spirit. According to doctors, a weak constitution is caused by malnutrition. But once there is proper nutrition, the germs in us are killed. If we are not in the spirit, we will have many &ldquo;infections&rdquo; that bring in weakness, but as soon as we begin to live in the spirit, our illnesses will go away. For example, everyone is selfish, and as long as we do not live in our spirit, we will care only for ourselves. However, as soon as we are in the spirit, we are delivered from such a selfish realm. I hope that we will go before the Lord and let Him expose our true condition so that He may have mercy on us and save us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

BEING NEEDED FOR SERVICE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE VISION<br />
IN WORKING FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>When Paul met the Lord on his way to Damascus, the Lord said to him, &ldquo;I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a minister and a witness both of the things in which you have seen Me and of the things in which I will appear to you&rdquo; (Acts 26:16). Two &ldquo;things&rdquo; are mentioned in this verse: the things in which Paul had seen the Lord and the things in which the Lord was to appear to Paul. It is not easy to see the content of these two &ldquo;things&rdquo; from reading Acts alone. In Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, however, it is easier to see that the things in which he had seen Christ are related to Christ Himself and that the things in which the Lord would later appear to him are related to the church. Paul&rsquo;s main testimony was of Christ and the church.</p>
<p>In Colossians we see the things of Christ, and in Ephesians we see the things of the church. In Colossians 2:2 Paul speaks of &ldquo;the mystery of God, Christ.&rdquo; The things concerning Christ are related to the mystery of God. God is a mystery, and no one can know or understand Him. Although God is a mystery, Christ is the story of this mystery. Christ is God&rsquo;s story; God&rsquo;s details are revealed through Christ. This is the reason that Colossians speaks of Christ as the mystery of God. In Ephesians 3:4-6 Paul speaks of the church as &ldquo;the mystery of Christ.&rdquo; The story and details of God are revealed through Christ, and the story and details of Christ are revealed through the church. Hence, these two books reveal two mysteries&mdash;the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ. The mystery of God is Christ; the mystery of Christ is the church. We have spoken of these mysteries for more than twenty years here in Taiwan, and we have published numerous messages related to them in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> magazine.</p>
<p>However, I must mention something. Although we have been speaking on these matters for many years, it seems as if the co-workers&rsquo; messages and work and the results of their work are not related to the speaking of the ministry concerning Christ and the church. The messages of the ministry and the work of the co-workers seem to be unconnected and even far removed from each other. This shows that we have not entered into the vision of the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ; this vision does not control our work. Although we have heard messages and read books related to these two mysteries, our actual work is quite removed from the central vision of Christ and the church. We must bow our heads to admit that we have not entered into this vision even though we have heard these terms. This vision does not control us.</p>
<p>Christians are in a pitiful condition because for centuries they have not let the Lord bring them into this vision. The speaking in the denominations today shows that Christians are far removed from this vision in their actual living. They do not even know how to speak of this vision in a clear and definite way. Any speaking related to Christ and the church is mixed with human, cultural, moral, and religious concepts. Although this is the condition of Christianity today, we are not completely removed from this condition either. In our messages we still combine verses and excerpts from the ministry books with our cultural, moral, and religious concepts. Those who speak among us do not have a clear sky, and those who hear do not have a strong discernment. Consequently, everyone is unclear about this vision. The work of the co-workers is equally unclear; it is as if blue is not blue, green is not green, black is not black, and white is not white. There are no clear boundaries. Such a mixed and unclear condition makes it difficult for God to bless us; this is the reason that we do not have much fruit in various localities.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A GOAL IN WORKING FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>According to the situation in all the local churches, we need to be thoroughly trained. Training can be likened to a doctor speaking to his patient. It is the responsibility of a doctor to speak truthful words, not pleasing words; however, truthful words are often bitter and hard to take. We need to be calm and ask ourselves before the Lord about the testimony of the churches in Southeast Asia. There have been churches in Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand for three to four decades, but no one can say that he is satisfied with the number of saints and the number of churches. We should bow our heads and admit that our vision is not clear or strong. Speaking more accurately, we are lacking in vision. Likewise, we do not have a strong vision in our work; therefore, we do not have much fruit.</p>
<p>According to our God-created human nature, every man has an inclination and a desire to accomplish something. Regardless of one&rsquo;s profession, everyone has a goal. Even bandits have a goal. Having a vision and a goal is essential to achieving anything. It is difficult for others to regard an unaccomplished person with much seriousness. Man was created by God, and in his created human nature, there is an inclination to pursue toward a goal. Our work, however, is like a rudderless ship that is in the hands of captains who do not have a compass; consequently, we are drifting. This is a true portrayal of our work. Our work has no goal, and our messages have no set direction; we speak as we please on one thing today and on another thing next week. In the end neither the leading ones nor the saints know where we are going. Truthfully, this is a deplorable situation.</p>
<p>Recently, some saints from the churches in Manila, Singapore, and Hong Kong visited a district for the bread-breaking meeting. As soon as the bread and the cup were passed, a responsible brother stood up and said, &ldquo;I thank and praise the Lord for the brothers visiting today. Let us hear some fellowship from them.&rdquo; As soon as he said this, the ship was handed over to others. This shows that the responsible brother was steering the ship without a compass. During a recent Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting, a responsible brother saw me and said, &ldquo;Thank the Lord, Brother Lee is here today; we have hope.&rdquo; I responded, saying, &ldquo;I will not speak. You are steering the ship here and doing a good job. If you hand the ship over to me just because I am here, there will be no direction.&rdquo; Sometimes we hand the ship over to others, and we do not even know when they have run it aground. This damages the purpose of the meeting and accomplishes nothing. A directionless meeting can be likened to hot and sour soup that is neither hot nor sour. Who would want such a tasteless soup? The believers who come to such a meeting will feel cheated and will never come back again. If our meetings accomplish nothing and have no goal, no vision, no revelation, and no spirit, people will have no desire to come back.</p>
<p>The co-workers must prostrate themselves before the Lord and endeavor to accomplish something definite. The New Jerusalem has a wall that is one hundred forty-four cubits high (Rev. 21:17); it has definite boundaries and specifications. Yet we have created an atmosphere of indifference toward our messages, our work, and our meetings. Even more grievous, some co-workers are defiled by sin, yet they feel nothing. Others sin again and again, yet they are not dealt with properly. Such co-workers should leave, and the other co-workers should be rebuked for being indifferent to sin. This is not a proper condition.</p>
<p>During a recent service meeting of the church in Taipei, a brother from another locality sat in the back of the room and stood up to speak three times. It was a meeting for the brothers and sisters from the various districts in Taipei, but this brother joined the meeting and openly expressed his opinions. This was a grave mistake that shows that we do not take the church and the Lord&rsquo;s work seriously. How can we expect the Lord&rsquo;s blessing in such a condition? The Lord&rsquo;s blessings are like rain. Although rain comes from heaven, there must be the proper vessels to receive it. If our special service meetings are not proper, there is little doubt that our work and our meetings will be lacking in definite accomplishments. Many of us have consecrated ourselves to serve full time, even abandoning our futures, but we are actually forsaking our consecration when we work without a vision and a goal.</p>
<p>We must see that the mystery of God is Christ and that the mystery of Christ is the church. We have been speaking about the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ for many years. However, I have not seen the co-workers in the Far East take the vision of the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ seriously. If I give a message in the United States, the brothers and sisters will focus on it for a long time, but it seems as if there is an indifferent attitude here. It is as if we can take it or leave it. God&rsquo;s blessing depends on our cooperation, and the extent of our cooperation determines the extent of God&rsquo;s blessing. If we have an indifferent attitude toward God&rsquo;s blessings, we will not succeed in anything we do. Everything we do must matter and must yield results.</p>
<p>We need to pray that the Lord would grant us to see the vision of the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ. The mystery of God is the story of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Christ, the Son, is also the Father and the Spirit (Isa. 9:6; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). As the source, God is the Father. As the expression, God is the Son, and as the realization, application, and entering into man, God is the Spirit. Christ is the mystery of God; He is everything&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;to work Himself as the mystical One, the wonderful One, and the rich One into us. The focus of our work must be to go to the churches and to work this matter into the brothers and sisters so that they may see that the Triune God wants to work Himself into us. We must speak this regardless of our capability so that the brothers and sisters in every locality can see that the Triune God&mdash;the Father as the source, the Son as the expression, and the Spirit as the realization&mdash;wants to work Himself into us. We must give messages on this topic every week for a whole year. Furthermore, we must speak livingly and thoroughly until the saints are touched inwardly. After we speak on the mystery of God, we must speak on the mystery of Christ, the church. We need to speak message after message about the human spirit being a vessel to contact God, to contain God, to digest God, and out from which God can spread into every part of our being. We should list all the verses on the human spirit in the New Testament and focus on them verse by verse, speaking continually for a year or two until the saints are ushered into the spirit. The brothers in Hong Kong have done this to some extent over the years, but strictly speaking, I have not seen co-workers elsewhere who are speaking and doing the same thing.</p>
<p>In our work, giving messages is like teaching in school, but we are grossly unprepared. When it is &ldquo;class time,&rdquo; we do not know whether we are teaching literature, history, or geography. I do not know what people have learned over the years from meeting with us. In such a condition, how can our work be blessed? How can seeking ones come? The condition of the co-workers and our overall situation is one of indifference. Forgive me for saying this, but our condition in principle is the same as that of Christianity. We lift up the banner of Jesus Christ, but we are wholly indifferent and do not know what we are doing. The co-workers, the elders, and even the responsible ones in the districts are indifferent; everyone is indifferent.</p>
<p>There was once a brother named John Sung who, from the standpoint of the truth, did not preach the gospel so accurately. However, he had one goal&mdash;to speak until people repented, until people were convicted in their conscience and confessed even with tears and much weeping. He would speak twice a day for two hours each time to impart a sense of sin into people so that they would repent. His messages were actually not fully according to the truth, but he had a goal and a direction. Hence, he was fruitful.</p>
<p>In Philippians 3:14 Paul says, &ldquo;I pursue toward the goal.&rdquo; This indicates that Paul had a vision. In verses 5 and 6 Paul describes himself as being &ldquo;of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless.&rdquo; At one time Paul was more religious than all the other religionists. Nevertheless, he counted all these things as loss so that he could pursue toward the goal of living Christ. If we look at the entire Epistle to the Philippians, we will see that Paul&rsquo;s goal was the Christ who lives in us. Paul also warned the Philippians to &ldquo;beware of the dogs,&rdquo; who were injecting them with their religious poison (v. 2). These &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; were in contrast to &ldquo;the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh&rdquo; (v. 3). We must never be caught by any religion; we must regard religion as refuse (v. 8). Paul regarded all the religionists as biting dogs; we must fear them and beware of them, on the one hand, and pursue Christ, on the other hand. If we apply this principle to ourselves, we may discover that the routine things we do in our service may have been affected by religion. For example, even though we may have a morning watch, we may not be in Christ. We must beware of religion because it is possible that even we can become &ldquo;religious dogs.&rdquo; We must thus flee from our religion. Only a vision can truly touch other people&rsquo;s feelings; religious or natural messages mean nothing.</p>
<p>If we see the vision, we will be delivered from our natural views and understandings even in our reading of the Bible. I was recently at a bread-breaking meeting where a sister fellowshipped about 1 John 3:1, which says, &ldquo;Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God.&rdquo; When she spoke of the Father&rsquo;s love, her speaking was based on a natural understanding. She understood the literal significance of the verse but not its inner revelation. The verse indeed says that God loves us and that we should be called children of God, but the emphasis is on God&rsquo;s being in us today as our life, our fellowship, and our anointing. His nature has become our nature, His fellowship of life has become our fellowship of life, and He is the inward anointing that is constantly anointing us. It is easy to read the Bible literally, but it is another matter to see the deeper points. When, for example, the Lord Jesus referred to God as &ldquo;the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob&rdquo; (Mark 12:26), He was talking to the Sadducees about resurrection. Although the word <em>resurrection</em> is not used in this verse, the Lord used the name <em>the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob</em> to reveal the matter of resurrection. This is vision.</p>
<p>Our meetings and our work in the church are not weighty, because of our lack of vision. If a school is run in a weighty manner, good students will come. If we rely only on zeal, we will produce something that is lacking in vision, light, and revelation, and people will not remain. This is our problem.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A DISCIPLINED CHARACTER<br />
IN WORKING FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>Although some brothers have seen some revelation, their looseness damages their speaking. For example, a brother once said, &ldquo;After the breath of life was breathed into man in Genesis 2:7, man received God&rsquo;s element, God&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; His speaking was about life, but it was loose and not according to the truth. When God breathed into man the breath of life, man did not receive God&rsquo;s element, God&rsquo;s life; instead, he became only a living soul. Thus, he still needed to be put in front of the tree of life to take in God as life (vv. 7-9). We must be careful and not speak about things concerning which we do not have the full assurance. In order to be an expert in anything, we must be disciplined and focused. Once we are loose, there are no standards or guidelines. Whether in our work or in our reading of the Bible, many of us are quite loose because we start but never finish. This is sufficient proof of our looseness in the Lord&rsquo;s work and in our leading the church. In order to release the Lord&rsquo;s word with proper utterance, we must be focused and disciplined.</p>
<p>Many people have a problem related to looseness and a lack of focus, but we should not serve the Lord in such a way. When we release the truth, there must be an introduction and a conclusion. If we are loose, we will speak in a light way. In order to release the truth, however, we must be serious. We must address every matter seriously, even our own personal matters. If some co-workers are working in Thailand for three years, they should either not mention the mystery of God at all or take it so seriously that all the saints in Thailand would know the mystery of God. Even though we have all heard and seen a little of the vision that God has given us throughout the ages, we have not taken it seriously. As a result, we can do only a little here and a little there in our work.</p>
<p><em>The Ministry of the Word</em> began to be published in 1951, three years after we arrived in Taiwan. In the twenty-plus years since then, more suppliers of the word should have been raised up. But after more than twenty years, we do not see many who can supply the word that the Lord has given to us. God is the source of the supply of the word, and we should enter into the supply that He has provided. In my work in mainland China, I was very much aware that the supply of the word was not with me but with Brother Nee. I gave myself fully to be in the supply of his ministry. Today we should immerse ourselves in the supply of the word; if we do, there will be no lack.</p>
<p>The churches in the United States serve the saints by bringing them into this supply of the word. When some of the local leading ones felt that they had something, I did not compel them to receive from this supply. I am not afraid of letting people compare the goods, even though I realize that some do not have an &ldquo;eye&rdquo; for the goods. After several years of doing things themselves, the eyes of these brothers were opened, and they acknowledged their need. This is a strength of the American saints&mdash;they are very straightforward. Once they see a lack, they are willing to receive from others. Once they saw that others had gold and that they themselves had only brass, they dropped their things and followed absolutely. This is part of their character. The character of the Chinese is not as strict, and it tolerates procrastination. This is harmful.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we believe that the Lord is not without hope today. We must prostrate ourselves before the Lord and have a thorough turn in order for the Lord&rsquo;s vision to become our goal. We need to devote ourselves to this vision and cling to it as a matter of life and death. This will be a source of hope among us. If we are not disciplined in this way, I absolutely believe that the Lord will not have a way to go on with us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING AND FOLLOWING THE VISION CLOSELY</h2>
<p>We must worship the Lord for one thing: According to our observation of history and the condition of Christianity today, we can say that God has revealed His intention to us. Hence, we have indeed received a vision. I was saved at a very young age, and I pursued much and tried my best to buy spiritual books to read. I was familiar with all the famous Christian figures in the East and in the West. However, when I compared these books with the messages that the Lord was releasing through Brother Nee, I saw clearly what was superior and what was inferior. A comparison of goods is never a problem unless a person is unable to recognize the superior quality of the goods. When I read Brother Nee&rsquo;s messages, I firmly believed that the Lord&rsquo;s way and the Lord&rsquo;s vision were with him. From that day I resolved to follow the Lord according to what I saw, and to this day I have no regrets.</p>
<p>When the Lord brought me overseas, I still had hope that others could be raised up to speak of this vision. However, more than twenty years have passed, and no other ministry of the word has been raised up by the Lord in the East or in the West. In the United Kingdom there was once a considerable release of spiritual riches, but its present cannot compare with its past. In the United States the content of many so-called Christian magazines is quite mixed. Therefore, we can only bow and worship God for His vision among us. As a result of this, once the Lord&rsquo;s testimony reached the United States, it attracted many people; among these are brothers and sisters who were pastors, missionaries, and seminary graduates.</p>
<p>Recently, a pair of sibling brothers began to meet with us. The older brother was a traveling preacher, and the younger brother accompanied him as the choir leader. During one of their travels, they invited an American preacher to speak, and this preacher spoke entirely from the book <em>The Economy of God.</em> This preacher openly acknowledged that his speaking was based on this book. When the two brothers took him to the airport, the preacher gave them <em>The Economy of God</em> and <em>The All-inclusive Christ.</em> The brothers took the books home, read them, and realized that the preacher&rsquo;s speaking was truly taken from these books. Shortly thereafter, the two brothers began to meet with us, even though the preacher did not take this way. When these two brothers later shared their testimony with the preacher, he said that this ministry was the highest ministry on the earth.</p>
<p>This shows that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not a matter of doctrine but of vision. Today there is no book in Christianity that speaks clearly concerning the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ. It is a great mercy that the Lord has shown us so much. Consequently, we must not take for granted what the Lord has shown us of Christ being the mystery of God and the church being the mystery of Christ. These two mysteries are the story of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. I hope that we would spend considerable time and energy to pursue and pray about this matter in order to know Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ. We must open our spirit and enter into this vision. The Lord is not after holiness, spirituality, or victory. The Lord wants to bring us into this vision so that we may see that the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is the all-inclusive Spirit who has entered into us to be our everything. We are the mystery of Christ, the church, because He is in us. The all-inclusive Spirit is mingled with our human spirit; hence, we must live in this Spirit.</p>
<p>The history of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the history of the church, involves two spirits&mdash;the divine Spirit and the human spirit&mdash;being mingled as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). The all-inclusive divine Spirit has been mingled with our human spirit. Never in history has this vision been revealed so clearly. Although the saints among us seemingly understand this, they do not care much for it. It is as if they have been given a treasure but are willing to put it aside in a corner while they care for other things in their living and work. We have neglected this treasure, and thus, we have lost the goal and the blessing.</p>
<p>The burden of this chapter is to call us to return to this treasure. Nothing is more precious than this treasure. I am not boasting, but for over fifty years I have been studying in this field. I have studied and handled truths concerning holiness, sanctification, and the bearing of the cross. These are not wrong, but they are not up to date. The matter of the all-inclusive Spirit was not so clear thirty years ago. If we neglect the Spirit today and go back to care for sanctification, victory, spirituality, and the cross, we are going backward. We must see that the Spirit, this treasure, as revealed by God to us in His word, is all-inclusive. By living in this Spirit, there is sanctification; by living in this Spirit, there is victory; by living in this Spirit, there is the cross. If we are in the Spirit, even our flesh is dealt with; everything is supplied by living in the Spirit.</p>
<p>The brothers in the Far East should have paid attention to this ten years ago, but they did not, and the blessing has been leaking away. Even though they have begun to pay more attention in the recent years through the influence of the American brothers, it is still not enough. The elders and co-workers should treasure this vision, enter into this vision, and live in this vision so that the riches may flow out of them to others.</p>
<p>I pray for this and hope that our eyes would be opened to see that throughout the ages God has desired to work the mystery of the Triune God into us. This mystery can be expressed with one word&mdash;<em>Spirit.</em> The all-inclusive Spirit is the totality of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Within this Spirit there is redemption, divinity, humanity, sanctification, and all the spiritual riches. Paul says that he was charged &ldquo;to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel&rdquo; (Eph. 3:8). These riches are the all-inclusive Spirit. This Spirit has entered into our spirit, regenerated our spirit, and lives in our spirit to be our life and person in order to transform our whole being. We must live in this Spirit.</p>
<p>We must see that the all-inclusive Spirit is in our spirit to be everything to us; therefore, we must live in this Spirit. We should not merely release our spirit loudly but also see this vision and live in it. Even if we have seen this vision, it is easy for us to become loose and careless. It is possible to see something but not be focused and disciplined. We do not need to discuss whether our methods are right or wrong; rather, we must focus on seeing this Spirit and letting Him be real in our experience. We must speak this in every message and live in it. Then we will have results.</p>
<p>A so-called co-worker among us once condemned me severely. He said that I was keeping the churches in the Far East in my &ldquo;controlling hands.&rdquo; But I must ask the responsible brothers from the various localities, &ldquo;What have I controlled?&rdquo; The ministry is not a matter of control but of vision. The vision is in this ministry; the church is blessed when it follows this vision, and there is no blessing when it does not follow this vision. The real question is not even related to the matter of control; it is a matter of whether we are willing to follow the vision that the Lord has shown us. We must follow the vision. Rather than following any person, we must ask where the vision is, and then we should follow it.</p>
<p>Our God is living and true (1 Thes. 1:9), and He is working. Since He must be speaking today, would He give different directions through two or three people simultaneously? I do not believe that God would be so foolish. The Bible shows that God&rsquo;s direction came through Moses and later through David. Even in the New Testament, God&rsquo;s direction was according to the vision given to Paul. God does not speak different things through different people at the same time; this would be chaotic. Furthermore, the world has become smaller. With the convenience of transportation and advanced communications, it is easy for something to spread from one place to another. The churches in America are blessed because the more the brothers in the various localities move forward, the more open and the brighter their eyes become. Hence, they are resolved to follow this vision. They firmly believe that this is the only way, the only vision, and they take care of it in a serious, disciplined, and careful manner in order to receive the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>We all know our situation here. There was a turmoil more than ten years ago, but the situation is stable now. We know the way and the vision, but we are loose and unfocused. We lack discipline and focus, and we are somewhat indifferent. We must all see this vision, and we must be focused after seeing the vision. If we are focused like the churches in America, the blessing will come.</p>
<p>During our first fifteen years on the island of Taiwan, the elders and co-workers moved forward in one accord. The condition then was the same as it is in America today. In fact, it was even higher. However, the Lord&rsquo;s testimony has been in the United States for only a little more than a decade, and there are now approximately six thousand who are taking this way. Of this number, one to two thousand are functioning and absolute for this way. They firmly believe in this way, and they are serious about taking this way. Their family life and personal life are for this way. Even though the opposers here have left, and the situation has become more stable in recent years, those who have remained seem to be looser. It is as if we have reached the bottom and cannot go any lower.</p>
<p>It is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to show us our need to be more focused and disciplined in relation to Christ being the mystery of God and the church being the mystery of Christ. These two mysteries are two sides of one mystery, which is altogether related to our mingled spirit. The mingling of the divine Spirit with our human spirit is the mystery. We must live in this spirit. Furthermore, we must be focused in our service, in our meetings, and even more, in our church life. May the Lord bless us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">SEEING THE MYSTERY<br />
OF GOD AND CHRIST IN THE BIBLE<br />
TO WORSHIP AND SERVE IN SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD THROUGH PRAY-READING</h2>
<p>No matter how often we have read the Bible, certain things are not easy for us to understand, because they are incompatible with our concepts&mdash;our natural thoughts, cultural influence, and religious notions. The things in the Bible that seem to match our concepts are easy for us to receive, because our concepts are a part of us. In other words, instead of receiving the Bible into us, we often apply our concepts to the Bible. In order for us to understand the thought of the Bible, we need to pray-read.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING A VISION OF THE MYSTERY IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>We need to see a vision of the mystery of God and Christ in the Bible. The Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is a great mystery. This mysterious God is the Father, the Son, the Spirit, Christ, the Holy Spirit, life, light, holiness, and righteousness. He is whatever we need. Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / ...And His name will be called / Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father, / Prince of Peace.&rdquo; In this verse there are at least six titles: <em>child, Son, Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father,</em> and <em>Prince of Peace.</em></p>
<p>What is revealed in the Bible concerning the riches of God&rsquo;s being is unspeakable. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us,...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; Verse 18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; In verse 29 the Word who became flesh is also spoken of as the Lamb of God, and in verse 32 the Spirit, who descended upon Him, is signified by a dove. In John 1 God is the Word becoming flesh, He is grace and reality, He is the Father, He is the only begotten Son in the bosom of the Father, and He is the Lamb with the dove, that is, the Holy Spirit. Chapter 1 reveals the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Our God is too mysterious.</p>
<p>This mysterious God desires to work Himself into us. In the bread-breaking meeting most saints like to call hymn #136 in the Chinese hymnal. This is a good hymn, but it speaks of the grace of God in a superficial way. It can be compared to the rind of the watermelon. When we buy a watermelon, we eat the flesh, not the rind. Many Christians enjoy God in a superficial way; it is as if they are eating the rind of a watermelon, not the flesh. The hymns that we select show the extent to which we are in our natural concepts or in the vision of the mysterious God.</p>
<p>When we compiled the hymnal, we did consider this matter of the &ldquo;rind&rdquo; and the &ldquo;flesh.&rdquo; Since a watermelon must have both rind and flesh, we kept the &ldquo;rind&rdquo; hymns. However, we must learn to eat the &ldquo;flesh,&rdquo; because the essence and nutrients are in the flesh. We must not eat only the rind. The saints seldom call hymns on experiencing Christ as life, such as <em>Hymns,</em> #841 and #501, or hymns on Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit, such as #450 in the Chinese hymnal and <em>Hymns,</em> #612. Some may not even know the tune to these hymns. We do not call these hymns, because we lack a vision of the treasure within these hymns. These hymns are on the riches of Christ who, as the all-inclusive Spirit, is in us to be our supply. Regrettably, the brothers and sisters do not know how to appreciate these hymns. They prefer to sing &ldquo;rind&rdquo; hymns.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING THE DEEPER THINGS IN THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<p>God created all things in the universe with two sides, an outside and an inside. The human body has skin on the outside and flesh and blood on the inside. Health problems that are related to the skin and flesh are not as serious as problems related to the blood. When we consider a person as a whole, his body is his outer person, and his spirit is his inner person. We often tell believers to turn to the spirit and to live God out from the spirit. These actions involve our inner person, not our outer person. This is revealed in the Word of God. The Chinese Confucian classics also have a concept related to the inner person. &ldquo;The Great Learning&rdquo; in <em>The Book of Rites</em> says, &ldquo;The way of great learning is to develop the bright virtue.&rdquo; The ancient Chinese sages discovered that there is a bright virtue within man, which is part of the innate human nature created by God. Metaphysicists hold different interpretations of this bright virtue, but it is generally considered to be man&rsquo;s conscience. Consequently, the development of the bright virtue focuses on the inner development of the conscience, rather than on outward improvement.</p>
<p>Metaphysicist Wang Yang-ming of the Ming Dynasty said that self-cultivation must start from the root, which is man&rsquo;s innate knowledge of good and innate ability to do good. A person who tries to improve himself outwardly is like a tree without roots or like water without a fountainhead; he will eventually dry up. The innate knowledge of good and the innate ability to do good refer to the bright virtue, which is man&rsquo;s conscience. The ancient sages, however, knew only about man&rsquo;s God-created conscience, but the Triune God has entered into our regenerated spirit. This surpasses the bright virtue, the innate knowledge of good, and the innate ability to do good. The latter are related to man&rsquo;s God-created human nature, which is good, but God has not been added to these components of our human nature. The Chinese sages and metaphysicists discovered that man&rsquo;s problem is inward, not outward. However, they did not see that God could enter into man&rsquo;s spirit through regeneration.</p>
<p>Many teachings in Christianity are quite shallow and do not have much depth. For example, Christians usually emphasize only a few verses in the Gospel of John, such as, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep&rdquo; (1:29; 3:16; 10:11). These verses speak of God&rsquo;s redemption and love, but they are still the &ldquo;skin.&rdquo; The Gospel of John speaks of deeper things. For example, the word <em>in</em> is often used in this Gospel (4:14; 6:56; 10:38; 14:17). This is very significant. This Gospel concerns God who was in the beginning but whom man could not know because God dwelt in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16; John 1:1, 4; 8:12). Nevertheless, He became flesh through incarnation and was manifested among men (1:14). He was seen, known, and touched by men. Then in resurrection He became the Spirit of reality in order to enter into and abide <em>in</em> man (14:17).</p>
<p>In his first Epistle, John says, &ldquo;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life (and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us)&rdquo; (1:1-2). These verses say that God is not only the Lamb of God; He is also the eternal life that has been reported to us. The Lamb is outward; the eternal life is inward. At the end of the book of Revelation the Lamb is on the throne, out from which proceeds a river of water of life (22:1). This verse speaks of two sides&mdash;the Lamb without and life within. However, many Christians see, contact, and touch only the Lamb, without knowing anything of life. Christian parents tell their children that the Lord Jesus is the Lamb of God, but rarely do they bring their children to see that the Lord Jesus is also God flowing out to be man&rsquo;s life. Many believers see the side of the Lamb but not the side of life. Even if they hear a word concerning life, they are not touched.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEING THAT THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
WANTS TO ENTER INTO OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We need to be burdened and even pray with fasting. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, let me see this vision. Let me see that You, as the mysterious Triune God, have entered into my spirit to be my life. May this vision capture me and control my thoughts, affections, living, walk, and prayers. Lord, I do not want to eat the rind without eating the flesh of the watermelon. I want to eat the flesh and offer people the flesh.&rdquo; Our common problem is that we see the rind but not the flesh; hence, we do not eat the flesh. Therefore, we need to ask the Lord to show us a vision.</p>
<p>Some dissenters called themselves visionaries and spoke of seeing a vision, but in fact they did not see the central vision that the Lord has given to us. They did not see His desire to enter into our spirit and be our life. They did not see this, nor were they willing to follow this. Instead, they said that they had received &ldquo;firsthand goods,&rdquo; not &ldquo;secondhand goods.&rdquo; Such a statement is deceitful. Those who receive light directly from the Bible are not receiving firsthand goods. They can receive only secondhand goods because only the apostles received firsthand goods. Whether we have firsthand goods or secondhand goods, as long as they are &ldquo;gold&rdquo; or &ldquo;diamonds,&rdquo; people will want them. If the firsthand goods are dung, people will not want them even if they are free. We should not be concerned about how many &ldquo;hands&rdquo; the goods have passed through; if the content is genuine &ldquo;gold&rdquo; or &ldquo;diamonds,&rdquo; everyone will treasure them. What the Lord has revealed to us is the best treasure in the universe, whether or not it is firsthand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO EXPERIENCE<br />
THE WORDS OF THE BIBLE IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We will now spend some time on the &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo; in 1 John. Chapter 1 begins, saying, &ldquo;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life&rdquo; (v. 1). The Lord is the Word of life that &ldquo;was from the beginning&rdquo; and was manifested to be seen and touched by men. According to verses 27 and 28 of chapter 2, the Lord is in us as the anointing: &ldquo;The anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things...and even as it has taught you, abide in Him...Abide in Him, so that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming.&rdquo; Verse 27 says that the Lord as the anointing abides in us and we in Him, but verse 28 speaks of His coming, implying that we must await His manifestation and coming. This seems to be a contradiction. If He abides in us, why do we have to await His coming? This shows that we cannot comprehend the Bible with our natural mind; we need experience in our spirit.</p>
<p>Although the Bible contains doctrines, it focuses on life and on the experience of this life. We cannot understand the Bible merely as a matter of doctrine. Even though 1 John 2:27-28 seems to be contradictory, it is a reality in our experience. The Lord is wonderful. On the one hand, He is coming; on the other hand, He has been here for a long time. In other words, He is coming again, yet He is in our spirit. He is truly mysterious. On the one hand, He is abiding in us to be our life and anointing, and we experience His indwelling, but on the other hand, we are abiding in Him until He comes.</p>
<p>In our study of the Bible and in the messages we give, we stress experience. As a result, some who stress doctrines oppose us. I read in a book that Martin Luther emphasized the truth concerning justification by faith to such an extent that he neglected the inner life. He even criticized his contemporaries who emphasized the inner life. Both John Calvin and Kaspar Schwenckfeld were theologians and contemporaries of one another. Schwenckfeld focused on life and wrote about the tree of life, the New Jerusalem, and the spirit, but Calvin considered Schwenckfeld to be demon-possessed. This comforted me and caused me to realize that when we focus on the experience of life, it is easy to be accused of having contradicting doctrines.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR REGENERATED SPIRIT<br />
OVERCOMING SIN, THE WORLD, AND THE EVIL ONE</h2>
<p>First John 3:6 says, &ldquo;Everyone who abides in Him does not sin.&rdquo; If we abide in the Lord, we do not sin. Sin is an indication that we are not abiding in the Lord. Hence, if we still need the dealing of the cross, we are not abiding in the Lord. If we are abiding in the Lord, we will not need the dealing of the cross. One morning while I was praying with several brothers, we realized that the dealing of the cross is related to the altar, which is in the outer court. If we continually focus on the dealing of the cross, we are going in circles around the altar in the outer court. While we need the experience of the altar in the outer court, we must advance and enter into the Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies is our spirit. When we enter into our spirit, we no longer go in circles in the outer court. In other words, when we sin, we are not living in our spirit, because when we live in our spirit, we do not sin. Everyone who lives in the Holy of Holies does not sin and does not need the dealing of the cross, for he is in his mingled spirit, which transcends all things. First John 3:6 says that everyone who abides in the Lord does not sin. Sinning proves that a person is not abiding in the Lord. Verse 9 says, &ldquo;Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin, because His seed abides in him.&rdquo; The words <em>His seed</em> refer to God and also to Christ. We do not sin because His seed has been sown into our spirit.</p>
<p>First John 4:13 says, &ldquo;In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit.&rdquo; We know that we abide in the Lord because He has given us the Holy Spirit, who is in us to be one with us. In chapter 5, verse 4 says, &ldquo;Everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world.&rdquo; <em>Everything that has been begotten of God</em> refers to our regenerated spirit. Our spirit has been begotten of God and, therefore, overcomes the world. In the whole universe only our spirit can overcome the world and sin. Verse 18 says, &ldquo;We know that everyone who is begotten of God does not sin.&rdquo; For many years I could not understand this word. On the one hand, I confessed that I had been begotten of God, but on the other hand, my experience seemed to contradict this verse, because I still was sinful. Then I saw 1 John 5:4, which says that &ldquo;everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world.&rdquo; John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; The human spirit that has been begotten of the Spirit has been begotten of God. Our regenerated spirit can overcome the world and does not sin.</p>
<p>Our flesh likes to sin. First John 2:16 says that the components of the world&mdash;the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life&mdash;are in us. However, we have a regenerated spirit that has been begotten of God. Our regenerated spirit cannot sin, and it overcomes the world. Verse 18 of chapter 5 also says, &ldquo;He who has been begotten of God keeps himself.&rdquo; This means that a believer who has a regenerated spirit, which has been begotten of God, can keep himself from living in sin. The part of our being that has been begotten of God is our spirit. This part is able to keep and protect us.</p>
<p>Verse 19 says, &ldquo;We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the evil one.&rdquo; The whole world, which includes all people and all things, is in the evil one. Only that which has been begotten of God is not in the evil one. Department stores, movie theaters, and dance clubs are in the evil one. Furthermore, our flesh, natural thoughts, religious concepts, and service that comes out of our natural zeal are also in the evil one. There is only one thing in the whole universe that is not under the manipulation of the evil one&mdash;our regenerated spirit. Although we belong to God and we are saints, we are only partially holy, because only our regenerated spirit is holy. Everything else is under the manipulation of Satan. God is in our spirit to be our life so that we may overcome. Verse 20 says, &ldquo;This is the true God and eternal life.&rdquo; This is a matter in our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR WORSHIP AND SERVICE TO GOD BEING IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The true God is no longer only in the heavens. He has entered into our spirit. Anything apart from the true God is an idol. Hence, verse 21 says, &ldquo;Guard yourselves from idols.&rdquo; We should never think that idols are limited to objects in temples. Our natural zeal for the Lord is an idol that replaces the true God. Our natural selection of hymns, our natural service, and our lack of the exercise of our spirit are idols. Only that which is out of our regenerated spirit is the true God.</p>
<p>Many years ago I did not understand why 1 John 5:21 suddenly says, &ldquo;Little children, guard yourselves from idols.&rdquo; These words seem to be a disconnected thought. I later understood that anything not done in our regenerated spirit is an idol. The apostle John admonished us to flee idols, that is, to flee everything that is not from our spirit. It is right to desire to be meek, broad, humble, and long-suffering, but do these virtues originate from our regenerated spirit? If they originate from our regenerated spirit, they are of the true God; if they do not, they are idols.</p>
<p>May we all see this vision. God wants to work Himself into us to be our life, and He wants to live in oneness with us in our spirit. He does not want us to do things for Him, nor does He care for other things. He is concerned only with whether we are living in oneness with Him in our spirit. We need to see this vision and let this vision control us. Our prayer, our speaking, our testimony, and our Bible reading must come out of this vision to speak forth this vision. If we truly see this vision, we will know what is of our natural zeal and whether our worship, singing, and prayers are routine.</p>
<p>The Jews built the temple in Jerusalem according to God&rsquo;s instruction. In front of the temple there was an altar. The priests wore priestly robes and served according to the Scriptures. They offered up sacrifices at the altar and entered into the Holy Place to burn incense and light the lamps. Their worship of God was orthodox, but God came to be among men. He was born in a manger, traveled to Egypt, and returned to Nazareth (Luke 2:16; Matt. 2:13-15, 19-23). After being hidden for thirty years, He began to preach in Judea. He even reclined at a table in the house of Simon the leper in Bethany, along with Martha, Mary, and Lazarus (John 12:1-3; Mark 14:3; Matt. 26:6-7). Although this house in Bethany was humble, God was there with the disciples. Although the Jewish priests were in the temple offering sacrifices, worshipping God, lighting the lamps, and burning the incense in their priestly robes according to the Scriptures, God was not there. If we have insight, we will see that the true God, the eternal life, was in that humble house, while there were &ldquo;idols&rdquo; in the temple (1 John 5:19-21). At that time, even the temple, the priests in their priestly robes, the sacrifices, the incense-burning, and the lighting of the lamps were in the evil one.</p>
<p>We should not be concerned that the Lord Jesus is in a &ldquo;humble house,&rdquo; but we need to consider whether we are serving religiously in &ldquo;the temple.&rdquo; We may think that we are worshipping God but have little realization that we are actually under the authority of darkness and worshipping idols. The true God, the eternal life, is in our spirit. We need to sit at His feet and have intimate fellowship with Him in our spirit. God was not in the routine worship in the temple. The items related to the temple, including the priests in their priestly robes and the routine burning of incense and lighting of lamps had fallen into the hands of Satan; they had become &ldquo;idols.&rdquo; Therefore, the apostle John said, &ldquo;Guard yourselves from idols.&rdquo; If we have a vision, we will understand that Judaism had become degraded. The Jewish synagogues were originally for worshipping God, but Revelation 2:9 says, &ldquo;Those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.&rdquo; Not only has Judaism become degraded, but even Catholicism and Protestantism have become degraded. Hence, we must be careful not to become a &ldquo;synagogue of Satan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anything that is not of the Spirit of God is under the authority of Satan. Religion teaches people to worship God without God; therefore, it belongs to the synagogue of Satan. If our breaking of bread is a ritual that does not have the Lord&rsquo;s presence and is not in our spirit, we are worshipping idols, not the true God. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit&rdquo; (John 4:24). The Lord is not in rituals; He is in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). This is the vision that we need. We need to prostrate ourselves before the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me. Without Your mercy, I am blind and cannot see.&rdquo; Without the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we are like Saul of Tarsus on the way to Damascus. We may think that we are zealously serving God, but in fact, we may be under the authority of Satan and in the realm of idols. An idol is anything that is an outward form and is without the Lord. We have the Lord only when we are in spirit. Having an outward form without the spirit is to have an idol, a religion. If we do not have a vision, we are worshipping idols and are not serving God. We may teach others about holiness, victory, and bearing the cross, but if we are not in spirit, we will not lead others to be in spirit. We need to turn to our spirit and dive into our spirit so that the true God may operate in our spirit. Only then can we say that our worship and service are according to the true God and eternal life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CENTRAL VISION FOR SERVING THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 1:19-21; 2:12-13, 16; 3:7-8, 12-15; 4:12-13</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING AND WALKING IN ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Triune God is the Spirit who lives in our spirit today, and we are one spirit with Him. Hence, we must live and walk by the Spirit in our spirit. Although this matter is quite mysterious, it is very simple; it is so simple that even an elementary-school student can understand it. Therefore, our problem is not related to hearing and understanding this matter but rather to not giving heed to this matter and practicing it. This is a thick veil to us.</p>
<p>We are veiled by thoughts of how to carry out the things that we have heard. I do not have a method of how to practice this, because the Bible does not give us methods. A baby knows how to cry and breathe as soon as he is born. A doctor, nurse, or mother does not need to present a method to the baby, saying, &ldquo;You have two lips, a throat, and lungs. You must learn to breathe and cry.&rdquo; As long as a baby is alive, he will breathe and cry; there is no need for instruction.</p>
<p>Since we have heard many messages concerning this mystery, we should simply live in the spirit. According to my observation, however, we are still living according to our natural habits. In our daily living we are not accustomed to living in the spirit, nor are we accustomed to living one with the Lord. The Lord is not merely outside of us in the heavens; He is in us so that we may live by Him. Since we confess that the Lord Jesus lives in us, we should not ignore Him in our daily living. Even when someone just visits us, we need to spend time with him and talk to him. Wives often seek a divorce because their husbands are away from home for long periods of time or because their husbands ignore them even when they are home. This is very hard on a wife. The best husband works eight hours a day to support his family and then immediately goes home to be with his wife. Such a husband lives by his wife. On the other hand, if a wife is not at home much of the time or ignores her husband, caring only for her life, the husband will have regrets. The best wife accompanies her husband and cares for his needs. When her husband is about to leave for work, for example, she prepares a lunch and walks with him to the door. She also greets him when he comes home. Such a couple will not have thoughts of divorce, because the husband and wife are one in their living and walk together.</p>
<p>We have given many messages on this mystery; we cannot say that we have not heard it or seen it. We have heard the messages, but we have not given heed to them. We are still focused on our own things. This is our condition. Many of the leading ones in the churches in the United States were seminary students, pastors, and preachers who came out of Christianity. They touched many denominations and sects before they began to meet with us. They did not turn easily, but once they turned, they turned absolutely. They dropped their old ways, abandoning them completely. Before taking this way, some had to confer with their family, but they did this according to the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Some had a wife who did not agree and who was reluctant to follow. Nevertheless, the brothers were peaceful within and determined to take this way. Now their wives know that this way is right, and they have inwardly turned in a full way. These couples no longer want anything from the past; they follow in an absolute way. When a message is released, they practice it immediately, and we quickly see fruit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR VEILS</h2>
<p>The situation in the Far East is not like this. We nod and take notes as we listen to the messages, but the messages do not remain in our being. Our prayers and meetings are old and routine because we have four thick veils that keep us from living by the Lord. The first veil is our disposition. Everyone has a particular disposition that causes many problems. The second veil is our culture. The Shanghainese and the Shandongnese each have their unique culture. The Chinese, Japanese, and Americans also have their particular culture. The third veil is the teaching that we received after our salvation. On the one hand, teachings help us, but on the other hand, teachings hurt us. For example, I studied English for almost sixty years, and my English teacher was a great help to me. Without his teaching, I would not know English. However, his Chinese accent has hurt my speaking. Even now, I speak with a similar accent. I have seventeen or eighteen grandchildren, and they all speak like native English speakers. My grandson can even correct my English. Similarly, it is very difficult for a person with the Foochow dialect to speak Mandarin. In regard to the teachings in Catholicism, we cannot say that they have not helped anyone, but this &ldquo;help&rdquo; has brought in much harm as well. This is true of the teachings in Protestantism and even of some of our former teachings. On the one hand, the teaching that we received after our salvation was positive, but we have also been hurt because we are unwilling to change and advance. The fourth veil is personal experience. If we do not pursue or love the Lord, we will not be veiled by our experience, because we will have no experience. However, as soon as we begin to love the Lord and pursue Him, our past experiences can become a present problem, even a veil. We all have these four veils; hence, it is difficult to receive the truth of this mystery.</p>
<p>Recently, when two brothers from a local church came to fellowship with me about their problems, I could tell from their conversation that they were not living in the spirit. One wanted to reason with me, and the other wanted to justify his actions. Those who live by the Lord do not reason or vindicate themselves; they simply live by the Lord. If we dwell on the past when we gather together, including on how we have been mistreated, we are not living in the spirit. We should live in the spirit. When we are in the spirit, we are the new man. The things of the past are the things of the old man, and there is no benefit from talking about them. We should not talk about things that occurred in the past. We should live by Christ, because the Lord is one with us. We can live and walk in Him. When we are about to speak, we should ask the Lord what He is speaking. If He has nothing to say, we should not speak. He is living in us today, and we can live one with Him.</p>
<p>When I fellowshipped with these two brothers, I knew that they had not received the content of the messages on living by Christ. One wanted to continue to reason, and the other wanted to justify himself. I said to the first brother, &ldquo;You may win the argument,&rdquo; and to the other I said, &ldquo;You may be justified.&rdquo; To both of them, however, I said, &ldquo;But even if all the angels in the universe were on your side and would vouch for you, it would mean nothing. Without the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, nothing that I say will matter, because you will still be in your reasonings and self-justification when you leave. You need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to see that you have not been living by Christ.&rdquo; I encouraged them to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I have been crucified and buried, and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. I do not want to consider things in the past in order to determine who is right or wrong. Whether or not others approve of me, I want only to live by You because You are in me. Thank You that there is no place for murmurings or reasonings because You are not murmuring and reasoning, and I am one with You.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not go dancing because it is wrong to go dancing but because I live by the Lord Jesus. He is not going, so neither am I. I do not lose my temper because it is wrong to lose one&rsquo;s temper but because I live by the Lord. He is my life, and I live by Him. I do not lose my temper because He does not lose His temper. Furthermore, I open my mouth in the meeting because the Lord Jesus is opening His mouth to pray and praise. Such a living is extremely simple. The Lord Jesus is not old or routine. We must drop our habits. Our disposition, culture, and past experiences have been buried; today the Lord Jesus is living in us. We live by Him and are one with Him. We do not need to consider whether we can overcome, whether we are right, or whether we can improve; none of this should be our concern. The Lord Jesus lives in us, and we live by Him. Furthermore, we do not need to focus on dealing with ourselves or on learning lessons related to being broken. We do not even need to understand what is of our spirit and what is of our soul. We do not need to worry about these things, we simply need to live by the Lord. Our problem is that we are carrying around too much &ldquo;baggage&rdquo; from the past, and the leading brothers are only looking for improved methods. We should forget about methods and simply live by the Lord.</p>
<p>I hope we will genuinely experience the Lord living in us. We should live by the Lord from the start of our day. We should do what the Lord is doing. When this is our focus, we can spontaneously pray and share in a meeting. We do not need to focus on whether we are loud or quiet. Such considerations are based on our natural man and our habits. Living in the spirit is very spontaneous. Actually, everything related to the human life is quite spontaneous, including breathing, drinking, and eating. We should not let our habits direct us. If we truly receive this word and live by it, we will have no desire to argue about anything, because Christ will be living in us.</p>
<p>We must live by the spirit. If a brother listens to a message but still goes home and argues with his wife, this is a proof that he did not hear the message. If he truly heard, he would not argue. However, it would not be he who is not arguing, it would be Christ, the One living in him, who is not arguing. Satan is very clever; he wants to keep us from living by Christ and instead living by ourselves. First John 5:21 speaks of guarding ourselves from idols. The word <em>idols</em> refers to everything that replaces the true God, including our disposition, culture, doctrines, and past experiences. Everything that replaces the Lord is an idol. The leading in the past few years in the churches has been on the line of living by Christ. The co-workers and responsible brothers may have seen a little, but they still want to try new tricks. Consequently, the churches have missed this leading on the central line.</p><h2 class="head1">SERVING THE CHURCH ACCORDING TO<br />
THE CENTRAL VISION OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Whether the condition of the church has been high or low over the past twenty years, we have always been on a central line. For example, in recent years we have stressed that we must not rely on doctrine and knowledge and that, instead, we should turn to our spirit. However, there has been a lack in our experience of turning to the spirit because there has been a lack of response from the co-workers. This procrastination has brought us close to the point of death. We should not be concerned whether the goods are &ldquo;firsthand&rdquo; or &ldquo;secondhand,&rdquo; as long as they contain the riches. We do not need new tricks in our speaking. Even if we could come up with something &ldquo;new,&rdquo; what would be the benefit? The church, as the new man, is produced only with Christ as life; hence, to live by Christ is our true need.</p>
<p>What is the benefit of speaking different messages? There is an abundant source of supply in the ministry of the Word for the saints to gain Christ, enjoy Christ, and experience Christ. In Philippians 3 Paul says that he pursued but that he dared not say he had already obtained (vv. 12, 14). He counted all things as refuse in order to gain Christ (v. 8). We must see the vision of Christ and take Him as our center in our work and living. We are not just dealing with doctrines but living by Christ in our daily living. This is what God desires. Our problem is that we have not entered into such a living, despite what we have seen and heard. Being able to lead others based only on our past godly accomplishments shows that we have not entered into the central vision of God. We must see the central vision of God, which is to enjoy Christ, to live by Him, and to take Him as our goal in our living and service.</p>
<p>Many of the co-workers, who have served in various places for many years, still do not know this vision or how to carry out this vision. Using tricks in our messages is of no use. Rather, we need to know and study the vision that we have been given. Christ and the church are the central vision. If we explore it thoroughly, enjoy its riches, and experience it deeply, we will be on the right track. None of us are qualified to say that we have explored this matter fully, because we have not entered practically into what we have seen. For this reason, we must endeavor to enter into what we have seen and then take a further step to see even more. We must know the basic matters and then advance. If we are studying mathematics, for example, we first must know basic arithmetic, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division before we can advance. Preachers throughout the history of Christianity have not been able to produce anything of much value because they did not see or follow the central vision in the Bible, the vision of Christ and the church. If we see this vision and work according to it, something of value will be produced. However, if we do not see it or are not willing to practice it, nothing of value will be produced no matter how much we &ldquo;sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others can be excused if they have not seen or heard the vision, but we cannot be excused. The riches of the Lord are here for us to enjoy. If I were leading the church in Taipei, I could lead the saints for a year just on the matter of singing hymns. I would spend an entire week on <em>Hymns,</em> #499, which says, &ldquo;Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace! / The Christ who&rsquo;s all within me lives,&rdquo; until the saints know that both Christ and life are in them. The hymns cannot be exhausted by singing them or by speaking of them in a light way; they are too rich. Furthermore, we also can speak concerning Christ and life from the Bible.</p>
<p>We should not depend on tricks in serving the church; such tricks are irrelevant because they cannot satisfy people&rsquo;s hunger or quench their thirst. We must speak continually concerning Christ, life, the Spirit, and the church; we must express this burden from the beginning to the end of the year. It may be that not every saint will want to pursue the real thing, but at least half will be attracted to these riches. We do not need to give messages that do not matter in order to accommodate those who do not care; if we do this, we will only gain people who do not care. If we want to gain people who care, we must give messages that matter, messages that show the meaning of life, that is, Christ, life, the Spirit, and the church. If we speak of these things in a thorough way, we will attract some weighty people into the church life. Our center and goal are Christ and the church, but our work and testimony in the churches today have lost this center and goal. We cannot let this condition continue; otherwise, we will become even more desolate.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO WALK BY THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Things from the past, whether right or wrong, are part of the old man and are the issue of not living in the spirit, not living by Christ. From this point forward we must live by Christ and not talk about the past. After believing in the Lord, our unique sin is to not live by the Lord. We need to confess this sin, saying, &ldquo;Lord, from morning to evening I do not live by You, I do not speak by You, I do not pray-read by You, and I do not even meet by You. Lord, forgive me for living in myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one can learn in a quick way; if we want to learn, we must be serious and practice. A child does not learn to walk by learning teachings; instead, he practices to walk and learns by walking. Since we have seen this vision, we must get up and walk. If we see that Christ is living in us, we must live by Christ from morning to evening. If we do not live by the Lord, we must confess and say, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. I loved people today but not by You; I prayed today but not by You. Lord, forgive me.&rdquo; Actually, if we are willing to learn, we will be able to walk tomorrow and walk even better the next day. It is regrettable that we have not yet learned to walk by living in the spirit.</p>
<p>We must practice this and forget about everything old. We must say, &ldquo;Praise and thank the Lord! In my living, it is no longer I who live. It is my gracious Lord, the all-inclusive Spirit, who is living in my spirit, and I am living one with Him.&rdquo; It is simple to live one with the Lord, but it often seems difficult because we are unwilling to drop our routines. Christ is new every day, and as long as we live by Him and not by our routines, we will grow in life, the church life will be blessed, and others will be helped.</p>
<p>We do not need to engage in idle words, murmurings, or reasonings. We should just live by the Lord. The Lord Jesus never spoke idle words based on reasonings; He did not blame others, engage in power struggles, or rely upon diplomacy. Such a Christ is our center. While there are many teachings in the Bible, such as teachings on holiness, the cross, victory, and spirituality, a singular pursuit of these teachings proves that we are not living in the spirit. If we are truly living in the spirit, we have everything that we need.</p>
<p>The Holy of Holies in the Old Testament typifies our spirit. The altar and the laver in the outer court point to our need of dealing and cleansing, and the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar in the Holy Place were tended to by the priests. God&rsquo;s presence, however, was in the Holy of Holies, and to enter into the Holy of Holies was to be one with God. The central mystery in the New Testament is the Holy of Holies, and Paul&rsquo;s ministry brings us into the reality of the Holy of Holies. In Galatians 5:24 Paul says, &ldquo;They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.&rdquo; Then, in the following verse, he mentions a crucial point, saying, &ldquo;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit&rdquo; (v. 25). In Romans 6:6 Paul mentions a similar point, saying, &ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him.&rdquo; Based on this fact, Paul says that every Christian should reckon himself to be &ldquo;dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (v. 11). We need to confess this fact: Since we are in Christ, we have been crucified with Him. Thus, according to the fact, we are dead. In Romans 8:4 Paul addresses our practical living, speaking of the righteous requirement of the law being fulfilled in us, &ldquo;who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit.&rdquo; This is a word according to the central vision. In Ephesians Paul does not speak about reckoning ourselves as dead but, instead, of the Father strengthening us with power through His Spirit into our inner man so that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God (3:16-17, 19). This is the positive expression of Christ being in us.</p>
<p>Although messages related to these points have been shared, the messages have been ignored. This indicates that we have left the Holy of Holies and gone back to the outer court. We should stay in the Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies has equal dimensions related to its breadth, length, and height (Exo. 26:2-8; 1 Kings 6:20). According to the revelation of the Bible, the New Jerusalem is an enlargement of the Holy of Holies, because the dimensions of its breadth, length, and height are the same (Rev. 21:16, 22). Today the church is the Holy of Holies, and our spirit is the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies there is only God. When we have God, we have His presence, and when we live in the Lord and abide in the Lord, we are delivered from the world and the self.</p>
<p>We must see that the church needs &ldquo;meals&rdquo; that actually benefit the saints. Children grow gradually by receiving nutrients through their daily meals. The church is not like a candy store that provides only sweet-tasting things. The church is like a family that relies upon healthy, nutritious food day after day. The church does not need eloquent messages, and those who can only speak eloquent messages ruin the church. In contrast, some who can only stammer through their speaking can supply the Christ whom they have experienced. The church does not need slogans based on eloquence, doctrines, or even Bible knowledge. The church is the Body of Christ, and the Body needs food; the church is the new man, and the new man needs nutritious food.</p>
<p>Christ is our life, and the church is our living. Christ is the all-inclusive Spirit living in our spirit, and our spirit is the Holy of Holies. We must live in the spirit and help the saints to live in the spirit. Then we will be the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, the Lord&rsquo;s bride. The Lord has not come back because He has not gained what He is after. Revelation 19:7 says, &ldquo;His wife has made herself ready.&rdquo; The Lord will come back when His wife is ready.</p><h2 class="head1">FLEEING FROM ROUTINE AND BEING RENEWED</h2>
<p>After we have seen the central vision, we must practice to live in it. Since the Lord is in us, our living must be one with Him. We must flee our routine, disposition, culture, religious knowledge, and godly accomplishments. In Hebrews 6:18 the apostle speaks of fleeing for refuge because Satan goes to great lengths to keep us from living one with the Lord, and he can use anything, even the Bible, our spiritual gifts, and our life experiences, to keep us from living one with the Lord. We should be those who flee from our routine and disposition and from our formal prayers, godly spiritual experiences, and scholarly accomplishments. We must flee and not let Satan use these things to hold us back. We may not be able to immediately distance ourselves from these things, but it does not matter. The only thing that matters is seeing the vision and determining to take this way. If we do this, we will flee from the old things in our being little by little until they are no longer a part of our living.</p>
<p>Brother Watchman Nee once said, &ldquo;The discovery of God&rsquo;s truth is progressive; the more it advances, the more complete it becomes&rdquo; (<em>God&rsquo;s Overcomers,</em> p. 138). Because there is a progressive discovery of God&rsquo;s truth, &ldquo;changes&rdquo; are not shameful, and it is only natural that we would change. When we see more, we will change yet again. The extent to which we see the many revelations in the Bible is the extent to which we will change. The more we see, the more we will live by Christ and the more we will change. The way among us is a way of change, but there are no set forms or regulations. In taking the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today, our ground cannot change and our fundamental beliefs cannot change, but the way forward will change. The more we see, the more we will change and go forward. We cannot adhere to the old, but neither should we rely on new tricks. We should not be limited by anything that we have come to know or experience; rather, we should live and walk by the Lord in our spirit in order to receive His moment-by-moment leading.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIPPING WITH OTHERS TO FLEE INDIVIDUALITY</h2>
<p>In addition, we should fellowship with one another in order to go on together, never depending on any one person. In the co-workers&rsquo; meeting I have noticed that there is not much fellowship in spirit, but there is much talk related to right and wrong. This results in a great loss of blessing. If we do not fellowship with one another in our living, in our work for the Lord, and in our supplying of the church, we are making a grave mistake. If the saints cannot fellowship with one another, they will be defeated, even devoured, by Satan. In order for us to escape Satan&rsquo;s devouring, we must fellowship. We cannot live and work without fellowship. There must be fellowship for the leading of the church. The ones bearing the yoke together must have fellowship. The Lord&rsquo;s testimony in the West is under the blessing because the saints, regardless of how long they have been saved, have no desire for anything old, and they have opened their spirits to fellowship.</p>
<p>In the church in Los Angeles no one knows what will happen tomorrow, but there is fellowship every day. Through fellowship many new things have been opened up. We must have fellowship. If those who are serving here cannot get through in this matter, we will have problems. Everyone who is involved in the coordination of the service should be in the fellowship. Any lack of fellowship is an indication that we have fallen into Satan&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>According to my observation, there has been more accusation and condemnation than fellowship among the co-workers here. Nevertheless, we are polite and do not make a scene even though we are divided from one another. As a result, there is a subtle condemning attitude among us, and this prevents us from having fellowship in spirit with one another. Instead, we are rigid in our ways, and we act according to our own view and will. Thus, there is no blessing from the Lord. No matter how much an individual can do, everything depends on the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. A farmer can till, water, and prune, but the growth of his crops depends on whether God sends the rain and protects them from natural disasters. If God does not send rain and protect the crops, what can a farmer do? No matter how much we can do, everything depends on the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. Thus, we should serve and fellowship together in order to have the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no opinion when I am with the saints in the church in Los Angeles. There are many different views, but everyone is in fellowship in order to touch the sense in the spirit. We have no opinion about how the Lord should lead or about His ultimate direction. No one knows what will happen when we gather for fellowship. When the Lord moves in our fellowship, we simply follow, and there is much blessing. He sends the rain and covers us, and sweet fruit is produced. If we do not fellowship, we will suffer loss from a &ldquo;plague of locusts&rdquo; that will eat up our work and leave us with little result.</p><h2 class="head1">FOLLOWING THE CENTRAL LINE CLOSELY</h2>
<p>There is only one central vision in the Bible. When I took part in the Lord&rsquo;s work in China, I never gave my own messages; I followed Brother Nee. Even though I learned many things after my salvation and I could have said much concerning biblical types and prophecies, I saw the central vision that the Lord had shown Brother Nee. From that point forward, I did not speak anything different from Brother Nee even if I saw something. Even if I had tried, I could not have thought of a new trick or new way to lead the churches other than Brother Nee&rsquo;s way. We have only one Bible, and there is only one central vision in the Bible. Furthermore, God has only one purpose, one way, in the universe. I followed Brother Nee because he did not deviate from this central vision. Today I have an absolute assurance related to our way. Even some brothers in the United States, who felt that they could do things by themselves, eventually saw this vision and began to take this way.</p>
<p>I am not afraid of letting people compare our goods; I am only afraid of people not having an eye for the goods. If we have gold, but someone else has only brass, it is foolish for him to insist that brass is better. A wise person will drop the brass and take the gold. The saints who have entered into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States have an eye for the goods. They want only what is real and genuine. We must see that there is only one Bible, one mystery, one purpose, and one way. We cannot say that God has not given us a clear vision. We have many books and messages; we are rich indeed. If we set these things aside and look for something new, we will find only &ldquo;fig leaves&rdquo; that cannot satisfy our hunger, quench our thirst, or cover our nakedness (cf. Gen. 3:7). This will only waste our time and be a disservice to ourselves and others. Eventually, we will still need to turn and be under this vision.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPENDING TIME TO ENTER INTO THE LORD&rsquo;S RICHES</h2>
<p>Since we have so many truths and have published so many messages, the co-workers should fellowship with the elders in every locality and pray and pursue these messages together. By spending time to work the content of these messages into us and by leading the churches according to this content, the churches in every locality will be able to take this vision as their way and goal.</p>
<p>Educational programs throughout the world are developing in comparable ways. After a century of experience, a practical system of education has been discovered. Today everyone learns by passing through an elementary, high school, and college program. In different countries the system of learning is quite similar because there is no system superior to this. Though countries may be different, their system of educational progression and their educational content are similar. Thus, it is possible for one to graduate from a high school in Taiwan and study at a university in the United States. In both developed and underdeveloped countries, there is a consistency in their educational programs. In order to bring the church into the Lord&rsquo;s desire so that the Lord can accomplish His purpose, we must be consistent and faithful to the truth of the central mystery that the Lord has entrusted to us. Even if food is cooked differently, the ingredients must be the same. Beef can be cooked in different ways, but we still must eat beef. If we have beef, we should not prepare the bark and roots of a tree as food. This will result in death due to malnutrition. We should feed the saints healthy food, such as beef, bread, rice, vegetables, and fruit.</p>
<p>I hope that the co-workers will see that we must lead the church according to the Lord&rsquo;s desire. The Lord has had mercy on us for many years by clearly showing us the central line of His desire. Thus, the elders and co-workers must come together to study the Bible and our books little by little to supply the saints. New tricks are useless. We must provide beef, bread, rice, vegetables, and fruit every day of the year so that the saints may have healthy meals. Once the church is richly supplied and well nourished, every &ldquo;germ&rdquo; will be killed, and the church will be strong.</p>
<p>I hope that the co-workers and the elders accept this fellowship and go on steadfastly and practically. Not only have we been giving these messages for nearly fifty years; we have published almost all of them in books. Hence, we must spend the time to enter into them in order to know our way. If we can only speak the words of these messages, they will be of little use. We must be the first ones to enter into the practicality of these words by living according to them and by releasing the riches in them through fellowship. This will supply the church by dispensing the riches into the saints.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">ENTERING THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 4:7-16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">REST, THE SPIRIT, THE HIGH PRIEST,<br />
AND THE THRONE OF GRACE</h2>
<p>Several matters are mentioned in Hebrews 4:7-16. The first matter is rest: &ldquo;There remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God&rdquo; (v. 9). The second matter is the spirit: &ldquo;The word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit&rdquo; (v. 12). The third matter is the High Priest: &ldquo;Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God&rdquo; (v. 14). The fourth matter is the throne of grace: &ldquo;Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace&rdquo; (v. 16). This portion of the Word reveals rest, the spirit, the High Priest, and the throne of grace.</p>
<p>These four matters are related, but if we do not understand how they are related, it will be hard to understand this portion of the Word. There are few believers in Christianity who understand this portion, most of whom divide this portion into three or four separate sections: the Sabbath rest, the dividing of the soul and the spirit, the High Priest, and the throne of grace. The believers who are more advanced connect the High Priest to the throne of grace. Strictly speaking, however, there is a relationship not only between the High Priest and the throne of grace. All four items&mdash;rest, the spirit, the High Priest, and the throne of grace&mdash;are related.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Rest Remaining for God&rsquo;s People<br />
Being in Their Spirit</h2>
<p>This portion of the Word reveals that the rest remaining for God&rsquo;s people is in our spirit. If we do not know how to enter into our spirit, it will be hard for us to know how to enter into rest. Ever since I was saved, I began to study the Bible seriously; however, at that time I was very much under the influence of Brethren teaching. The Brethren, using the way of prophecy, interpreted the rest as the millennial kingdom. They said that the millennial kingdom is the rest that God prepared for His people and that we must be diligent to enter into it. If we read only verse 9, we will think that their exposition seems to be correct. However, if we continue on to verse 12, we will sense that this interpretation does not connect verse 9 with verse 12, which says, &ldquo;The word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&rdquo; Why does Paul speak of rest in verse 9 and in verse 12 of the living and operative word of God? What is the purpose of verse 12? If we break out of the influence of traditional Christianity, we will understand that the rest in verse 9 must be in our spirit.</p>
<p>Verse 9 says that there is a rest remaining for God&rsquo;s people. Verse 10 says that to enter into this rest is to rest from our works. If we are still struggling, we do not have rest. Verse 11 says that we should be diligent to enter into God&rsquo;s rest. Then verse 12 says that the word of God is living and that it can divide our soul from our spirit. When we read these verses sequentially, we must admit that the rest in verse 9 refers to the spirit in verse 12.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Word of God Being Able to Pierce<br />
Even to the Dividing of Soul and Spirit<br />
to Expose Our Real Situation</h2>
<p>Verse 13 is difficult to understand. Verse 12 says that God&rsquo;s word is living and able to divide the soul and the spirit, and verse 13 says that all things are manifest before the Lord, being naked and laid bare. How do we connect verses 12 and 13? Verse 13 indicates that God is able to see man&rsquo;s inward condition. First Samuel 16:7 says, &ldquo;Man looks on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looks on the heart.&rdquo; In the New Testament age, God does not look merely on our heart; He looks on our spirit.</p>
<p>None of us is naked or laid bare before others, because they can see only our outward appearance; they cannot see the condition of our spirit. In contrast, God can see into our being. He sees our outward appearance, the thoughts and intentions of our heart, and also our spirit, which is surrounded by and hidden in our soul (Heb. 4:12). In the book of Hebrews Paul did not speak of man from the human point of view; rather, he spoke from God&rsquo;s view. God&rsquo;s view is sharper than any x-ray; His eyes can penetrate into our spirit. God desires to show us where we are, that is, whether we are living in the flesh or in the soul and whether we are living in the thoughts and intentions of our heart or in our spirit. He shines into us so that we may have a clear view of our condition.</p>
<p>We often are not clear concerning our condition. After attending a few meetings and hearing some messages, some people think that they have seen a vision and that their condition has changed. It is not until God&rsquo;s light shines on them, however, that they realize that their &ldquo;change&rdquo; is superficial and not from their spirit. Although we are not naked and laid bare before one another, we are naked and laid bare before the Lord. Verse 12 says that the word of God is living and operative and able to pierce our being even to the deepest part, our spirit. God&rsquo;s word represents God; hence, it can pierce and divide our inward parts to expose our real situation. We cannot hide before God; rather, we are naked and laid bare before Him.</p><h2 class="head2">Turning to Our Spirit to Touch God&rsquo;s Throne of Grace<br />
and to Meet Our High Priest</h2>
<p>Verse 14 says, &ldquo;Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God.&rdquo; The beginning of this verse uses the conjunctive adverb <em>therefore,</em> showing that verse 14 is a continuation of the preceding verses. Verse 16 says, &ldquo;Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace.&rdquo; This verse also uses the conjunctive adverb <em>therefore,</em> indicating that it is a continuation of the preceding verses. According to verse 14, our High Priest has passed through the heavens. How can we contact a high priest who is high above in heaven when we are still on the earth? Verse 16 says that we should come forward to the throne of grace. <em>The throne of grace</em> refers to God&rsquo;s throne in heaven. In order to contact Christ as our High Priest, we must come forward to the throne of grace; when we come forward to the throne of grace, we will surely meet Him. However, since both our High Priest and the throne of God are in heaven, how can we go there? It seems as though verse 16 is not related to the preceding verses.</p>
<p>However, our spirit is not only the place that God prepared as a rest for His people; it is also connected to heaven. Our spirit and heaven are connected. Hence, when we turn to our spirit, we enter into and enjoy the rest that God has prepared for His people. At the same time, we also come to God&rsquo;s throne of grace to meet our High Priest.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Spirit Being the Gate of Heaven</h2>
<p>Our spirit is &ldquo;the gate of heaven&rdquo; in Genesis 28:17. Verses 17 through 19 say, &ldquo;This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob...called the name of that place Bethel.&rdquo; Bethel, God&rsquo;s house, is the gate of heaven. Ephesians 2:22 says that God&rsquo;s dwelling place is in our spirit. In other words, our spirit is Bethel; it is God&rsquo;s house, His habitation.</p>
<p>Genesis 28:12 says, &ldquo;There was a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.&rdquo; At Bethel there was a ladder that reached to heaven. For this reason, Bethel was called the gate of heaven. In John 1:51 the Lord identified Himself as the ladder reaching to heaven: &ldquo;You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&rdquo; On the one hand, the Lord Jesus is in heaven, but on the other hand, He is in our spirit. As a ladder, He reaches heaven at one end and our spirit at the other end. Through Him our spirit and heaven are connected. Now our spirit is the gate of heaven.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Enjoying Rest by Turning to Our Spirit<br />
to Enjoy the Care of Christ as the High Priest<br />
and the Supply of the Throne of Grace</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus Christ, our High Priest, and the throne of grace are in heaven. At the throne of grace there is mercy and grace for timely help (Heb. 4:16). When we receive mercy from God and find grace to meet our timely need, we have rest. We experience this rest when we turn to our spirit, because our spirit is connected to heaven. Furthermore, Christ our High Priest is touched with the feeling of our weaknesses and supplies all our needs. He takes care of all our needs.</p>
<p>The throne of grace is the source of our supply. This throne is the throne of God and of the Lamb in Revelation 22:1. Out from this throne there proceeds a river of water of life, bright as crystal. The tree of life grows on this side and on that side of the river of water of life, supplying life as food (v. 2). We receive mercy and find grace so that we may have the supply of life. As a result, we enjoy rest.</p>
<p>The rest that remains for God&rsquo;s people is in our spirit. Furthermore, our spirit is connected to heaven. Hence, Christ cares for us as our High Priest, and God&rsquo;s throne of grace supplies us in our spirit. In our spirit we receive mercy, find grace, and enjoy the timely supply. This is our rest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR SPIRIT BEING THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:19 says, &ldquo;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus.&rdquo; The Holy of Holies is our spirit. We can say this because this verse says that we have boldness to enter the Holy of Holies. Bible expositors agree that the Holy of Holies is the third heaven. But if the Holy of Holies is the third heaven, how can we enter it? The Holy of Holies in this verse refers to our spirit. When we are in our spirit, we are in the Holy of Holies. Our spirit is connected to heaven; hence, when we are in our spirit, we are in heaven.</p><h2 class="head2">The Veil Being Rent That We May Enter<br />
into the Holy of Holies</h2>
<p>Verse 20 says, &#8220;Which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh.&#8221; In the Old Testament there was a veil that separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies (Exo. 26:33). According to John 1:14, the Lord Jesus as the Word became flesh. In the verses in Hebrews and John <em>flesh</em> refers to humanity. Hebrews 10:20 speaks of the veil of His flesh. This means that we are the veil. The Holy of Holies is our spirit, but there is a barrier, our fallen humanity, that separates us from our spirit. Our fallen humanity is the thickest veil, and it separates us from God. Hence, our flesh must be rent. This is portrayed by the veil in the temple being split from top to bottom when the Lord died on the cross (Matt. 27:51).</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:21 says, &#8220;Having a great Priest over the house of God.&#8221; This great Priest is in our spirit, the Holy of Holies. When we consider chapters 4 and 10, we can see that our spirit today is the Holy of Holies. Furthermore, our being is the veil that must be rent. There is rest in the Holy of Holies, in our spirit. The Lord is our High Priest bearing our case in the Holy of Holies. Furthermore, the throne of grace that supplies us and gives us rest is also in the Holy of Holies. However, in our experience it is easy for us to remain in the outer court or to enter into the Holy Place, but it is not easy to enter into the Holy of Holies. This is because there is a veil between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. This veil is our flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Going within the Veil</h2>
<p>Verses 18 and 19 in chapter 6 say, &#8220;We who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us, which we have as an anchor of the soul, both secure and firm and which enters within the veil.&#8221; The phrase <em>fled for refuge</em> in the original language means to flee intensively. The word <em>fled</em> is also used in Acts 14:6, which speaks of Paul and Barnabas fleeing to the cities of Lystra and Derbe in Lycaonia. Paul and Barnabas fled because a hostile attempt was made by some in Iconium to treat them outrageously and to stone them (v. 5). When the apostles became aware of this, they fled to Lycaonia. Hebrews 6:19 speaks of the anchor of our soul. Our spirit does not need an anchor because our spirit does not drift; however, our soul needs an anchor because it is always drifting. Our soul is our person, and our person tends to drift. Hence, our soul needs an anchor. Verses 18 and 19 say that the hope set before us is a secure and firm anchor of our soul and that it enters within the veil. The Holy of Holies, which is in the third heaven, is also our spirit, which is within the veil.</p>
<p>Verse 20 says, &#8220;Where the Forerunner, Jesus, has entered for us, having become forever a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek.&#8221; The Lord Jesus has entered within the veil. The Holy of Holies, the third heaven, and our spirit are related and connected. When the Lord Jesus ascended, He entered the Holy of Holies. He is now in the third heaven as well as in our spirit. Hence, the third heaven and our spirit are connected. They are also within the veil. The place &#8220;within the veil&#8221; refers to the third heaven and to our spirit. The anchor of our soul is connected to the third heaven and also to our spirit. If we do not enter into our spirit, we will be like a boat drifting on the sea without an anchor. We must connect the anchor of our soul to our spirit, the third heaven, and then we will be secure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THREE SECTIONS OF THE TEMPLE<br />
CORRESPONDING TO THE THREE PARTS OF MAN</h2>
<p>The three parts of man-the body, the soul, and the spirit-correspond to the three sections of the holy temple-the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. We are God&#8217;s temple (1 Cor. 3:16-17). There are three sections in the temple, and we have three parts. The three sections in the temple correspond to our three parts. Our body corresponds to the outer court, our soul corresponds to the Holy Place, and our spirit corresponds to the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>In order to contact God, we must pass through the outer court and enter into the Holy Place, and we must pass through the Holy Place and enter into the Holy of Holies in order to see God face to face. The altar of burnt offering and the laver are in the outer court. The table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar are in the Holy Place. Only the Ark, which typifies Christ, is in the Holy of Holies. The table of the bread of the Presence typifies Christ as our life, the golden lampstand typifies Christ as our light, and the golden incense altar typifies Christ as the sweet incense for our acceptance by God. Only the Ark in the Holy of Holies typifies Christ&#8217;s person. In the Holy of Holies we are in God&#8217;s presence, and there is only Christ.</p>
<p>We should ask ourselves whether our experience relates to the outer court, the Holy Place, or the Holy of Holies. Dealing with the flesh, bearing the cross, and receiving the dealing of the cross are experiences of the outer court, because the altar of burnt offering typifies the cross. The offering at the altar of burnt offering and the washing in the laver are for us to enter into the Holy Place and from there, the Holy of Holies. It is right to experience the cross in the outer court, but this experience is for entering into the Holy Place. Once we focus on the cross, however, we tend to remain there and are unwilling to leave; we are unwilling to enter into the Holy Place and then the Holy of Holies. Those who have experienced the cross must examine whether or not they have entered into the spirit. If we have not entered into our spirit, even though we have been experiencing the cross for several years, there is a problem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISRAELITES LEAVING EGYPT AND<br />
ENTERING INTO CANAAN TYPIFYING<br />
THE THREE STAGES OF GOD&#8217;S SALVATION</h2>
<p>The picture of the Israelites leaving Egypt and entering into Canaan signifies the three stages of God&#8217;s salvation, which also correspond to the three parts of the temple. The people of Israel left Egypt, passed through the wilderness, and entered into Canaan. Entering into Canaan was the last part of their journey. Egypt signifies the outer court, the wilderness signifies the Holy Place, and the good land of Canaan signifies the Holy of Holies. The manna that the Israelites ate in the wilderness represents the bread of the Presence in the Holy Place. In the Holy Place there was the bread of the Presence, and in the wilderness there was manna. The believers who concentrate on the dealing of the cross remain at the altar of burnt offering. This is equivalent to remaining in the outer court. Some believers concentrate on pursuing holiness. They may enjoy Christ as manna every day, but they are merely in the wilderness, that is, in their soul. These believers have not entered into the Holy of Holies, into the good land of Canaan.</p>
<p>The Israelites entered into Canaan only after crossing the Jordan River, where their flesh was buried. Crossing the Jordan is equivalent to passing through the veil of our flesh, that is, to burying the flesh, to having the flesh rent. Once we cross the Jordan, we enter into Canaan. In other words, once we pass through the rent veil of our flesh, we enter into our spirit. In Canaan the children of Israel had the fullest and topmost enjoyment of the land. This signifies our enjoyment of God&#8217;s salvation. Leaving Egypt was a part of God&#8217;s salvation, and passing through the wilderness was also a part of God&#8217;s salvation. However, God&#8217;s complete salvation could be experienced only after the Israelites entered Canaan.</p>
<p>We must be clear concerning what it means to wander in the wilderness. Wandering in the wilderness is to wander in our soul, that is, to wander in our mind, emotion, and will. Although we may enjoy Christ while we wander in our soul, we are still in our soul, not in Canaan. Hence, we have not obtained the fullest enjoyment of God&#8217;s salvation. We must be those who come forward and enter into Canaan, which signifies the Holy of Holies, that is, into our spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING IN THE SPIRIT AND LIVING BY THE LORD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL APPLICATION</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we spoke of entering into the Holy of Holies. In this chapter we will continue to fellowship concerning some practical applications. Some of my words may not be pleasant, but they illustrate our actual situation. This can be likened to a doctor presenting an unpleasant but factual diagnosis to one of his patients.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeing Only the Shortages of Others<br />
Being a Most Dangerous Situation</h2>
<p>When we come together for a meeting, I am afraid that many have not entered into their spirit in a real way; the majority remain in their mind, their soul. If there are one hundred saints in a meeting, ninety-five may apply the message to others, not to themselves. Anyone who listens to a message in this way is not in spirit. Our spirit is the Holy of Holies, and in the Holy of Holies there is only God. There were many people in the outer court, such as those who were slaughtering bulls and sheep. There were fewer people in the Holy Place, such as those who were burning incense, taking care of the lampstand, and setting out the bread of the Presence. However, in the Holy of Holies there was only God.</p>
<p>It is dangerous for our eyes to be focused on others. This gives Satan much ground in us. Although this problem varies in degrees, we all have this problem. It is easy to focus on the shortages of others as if they were the only ones in need of correction. When other saints look at us, however, they feel that we also are in need of adjustment. If we listen to messages and apply them only to others, we are actually in the soul, no matter how much we think that we are in the spirit. I am deeply concerned that many of us listen to messages in order to apply them to others. If we truly listen to the messages and receive them in the spirit, we will not criticize others. Our criticism of others shows that we have fallen into the realm of right and wrong. Even if our heart is good, and we have good motives related to others, to the Lord, and to His testimony, we can fall into the realm of right and wrong. The most dangerous thing in our spiritual pursuit is to focus on the shortages of others but be unwilling to look at ourselves.</p>
<p>A reluctance to look at ourselves is an issue of self-delusion and self-deception. If we think that we have seen something that others have not seen, we can be deeply concerned about them to the point of many prayers and tears. This, however, is a sign, a proof, that we are self-deluded and self-deceived. It also means that we have not truly seen the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Those Who Live in the Spirit<br />
Seeing Only the Lord, Not Others</h2>
<p>A person who truly lives in the spirit sees only the Lord when he enters into the Holy of Holies. There are no windows in the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies there is no communication with the outside world; there is only the Lord. The saints in a local church will not be supplied if our prayers are based on our perceptions of their shortages. This kind of prayer will not supply the saints or the local churches. If the elders in the church in Taipei ignore their own shortages and pray only for the shortages of others, there will be no benefit. The elders in the church in Taipei should pray for themselves first. If we pray only for others based on their shortages, we are not in the spirit. For example, if we &ldquo;see&rdquo; that another brother is in the flesh, our prayers will focus on him. However, this brother may be praying for us in the same way. If we look only at others, we are not in the spirit, and the Lord will not listen to our prayers.</p>
<p>Rather than looking at others, it is better to pray for ourselves first. The elders in the church in Taipei should pray for themselves first. The elders should pray until they are in the divine stream. Then others will jump into the stream spontaneously, and there will be no need to pray for others. If, however, the elders focus only on others, praying, &ldquo;O Lord, this one is not in the stream, and that one is not in his spirit,&rdquo; they will not be in the stream, no matter what they think. I hope that the elders and co-workers would enter into rest and cease from their labor, even their labor of praying for others. For forty years I have noticed this problem: As soon as a person receives a little grace, Satan immediately encourages him to use this experience of grace as a yardstick for measuring others.</p>
<p>Recently, the elders in the church in Taipei invited the leading brothers in Southeast Asia to participate in a training. I have no feeling either way about this, but I hope that the elders would forget about others and truly care for the church in Taipei. When the church in Taipei enters into the spirit, other localities will enter into the spirit as well. This principle can be applied to all the localities. We do not need to be &ldquo;high priests,&rdquo; who are focused on the &ldquo;care&rdquo; of others. As long as we take care of being in the spirit, this is good enough. If we are in the spirit, others will know, because our spirits are connected. During these years in America, we have not intentionally focused on caring for other churches. We have not had the thought of looking at or praying for the condition of the church in Taipei. If we are in the outer court, we will always regard the condition of others as pitiful. Only those who are in the outer court &ldquo;see&rdquo; the condition of others so clearly. If we are in the Holy of Holies, we see only the Lord Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">WORKING OUT OUR OWN SALVATION AND<br />
BEING DELIVERED FROM MURMURINGS AND REASONINGS</h2>
<p>Philippians 2:12-13 says, &#8220;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.&#8221; In this verse <em>salvation</em> does not refer to the salvation that delivers us from God&#8217;s condemnation and the lake of fire. It refers to being saved daily so that we can be delivered from various situations in our daily living. Verse 14 continues, &#8220;Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.&#8221; For many years I did not understand why verse 14 was written in this way. Verses 12 and 13 speak of something very big, but verse 14 speaks of something quite small. With experience I began to understand that <em>salvation</em> in verse 12 refers to being delivered from murmurings and reasonings. In the original language, <em>murmurings</em> means &#8220;mutterings&#8221; or &#8220;grumblings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although we have heard many messages, we have not been delivered from our murmurings. To murmur is to complain about others. I believe that many of us murmur continuously. If we truly lived in the spirit, our ears would be deaf, our eyes would be blind, and our mouth would be silent. We would not be able to hear, see, or speak; we would only live before the Lord. This would eliminate unnecessary speaking, including criticism and even our prayers of concern, and our spirit would be like a river flowing out to supply others. Our so-called concerns and prayers prove that we are still in the soul, and our criticism of others is a proof that we are not in the spirit. We are not in the spirit even if there is some basis for our criticism. We are even less in the spirit when there is no basis for our criticism. When we are in the spirit, we know nothing and have nothing to say, even though we have a divine view and understanding of a particular matter. This is our condition when we are in the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>Our problem is that we do not realize that genuine spirituality, genuine salvation, is God Himself. When we are murmuring and reasoning about different things in our mind, we are altogether captured by Satan. Whereas he causes us to sin and love the world before we are saved, he also causes us to murmur about others as soon as we touch the Lord.</p>
<p>We cannot cause a seed to grow by studying it; rather, we need to plant the seed in soil in order for it to grow. We have heard many messages about our spirit, but how many of us are living in our spirit? It seems as if we are only studying the spirit. If we were really in our spirit, we would not be going around in circles in our mind. Rather than being in the wilderness, we would be in Canaan and in the Holy of Holies, enjoying the Lord&#8217;s presence. Furthermore, rivers of living water would be flowing out from us, and we would be a supply to others. Thus, there would be no concerns related to others and no need for prayers. I hope that the responsible brothers in all the localities would not stay in their mind, because we cannot bring the saints into a deeper experience of salvation using only our mind. Instead, our spirit must be strong enough to touch the spirit of the saints; then they will experience salvation. We cannot touch others with gospel preaching that is merely eloquent and logical. Although this may touch their mind, salvation depends upon their human spirit being touched by the divine Spirit.</p>
<p>When saints ask me for advice, I usually respond, &#8220;Do not do anything. No method can help you. God is Spirit. You should simply contact Him. You do not need a method; rather, you need to touch Him.&#8221; Some people may respond, saying, &#8220;If this is the case, I do not need to go to a meeting or listen to a message.&#8221; Even if this were true, we would still need to turn to our spirit. We have all fallen into Satan&#8217;s snare; that is, we have fallen into our mind. For this reason Paul tells us to flee into the refuge of our spirit (Heb. 6:18). We all need to flee. Those who think that they have entered into the spirit are the ones who are most in need of fleeing into the spirit. Such ones are self-deluded and self-deceived.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING NO OPINION<br />
WHEN WE LIVE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The real indication of whether we are living in the spirit is not our proclamations, but whether we express our opinions. If we have no opinions when we visit a locality, it is possible that we may be in our spirit at least forty percent of the time. If, however, we have opinions, we are not in the spirit, and we can even quarrel with one another. There are different manifestations of quarreling. For example, two people can disagree to the point of physically fighting with each other, causing bodily injury and involving the police and courts of law. Quarreling, however, can be manifested without any outward manifestation of disagreement. Rather than fighting, two brothers can simply ignore one another. Regardless of how quarreling is manifested, those who quarrel with others are in the mind.</p>
<p>Because of different opinions, it is very difficult for brothers in various places to not quarrel with one another. Some may express their opinion in a refined manner, and others may express theirs in a rough manner. Some may be fleshly and emotional, and others are more peaceful and calm. In any case, everyone is in the mind. May the Lord have mercy on us. When we enter into the spirit, our words and opinions disappear. When young people are married, there is always some quarreling. Incessant quarreling, however, is always an issue of having many opinions.</p>
<p>When a person lives in the spirit, he will not have any opinion. Having no opinion, that is, having nothing to say, is a strong proof that a person is living in his spirit. It would be a miracle if a dumb person begins to speak, but it is an even greater miracle when a believer does not speak his opinion. A believer who can refrain from speaking his opinion is a person who is living in his spirit. In contrast, a believer who always expresses his opinion is living in his soul.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FOCUS OF GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION<br />
BEING THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT FOR US TO LIVE BY HIM</h2>
<p>This is not an easy message to receive, because Christians are always encouraged to pray for others. When we pray for others, however, there often is a strong element of ourselves in our prayers. Furthermore, when we are zealous, there often is a strong element of ourselves in our zeal. Even when we love the Lord and care for the church, there often is a strong element of ourselves in our love and care. We may do many things, but we still do them in ourselves. Although we may awake from a state of spiritual stupor, there may be no difference in our condition; that is, when we are in a stupor, we are in ourselves, and when we are awake, we are still in ourselves. God&rsquo;s salvation is not a matter of whether we are in a stupor or whether we are active. God&rsquo;s salvation is a matter of living by Him in the spirit.</p>
<p>If we live by Him, we will discover that He does not talk much, nor does He have the same &ldquo;concerns&rdquo; that we have for others. He even does not see the defects of others or pray for them as much as we do. Often we are more zealous than the Lord. Once, when the elders in Manila wrote and told me of a great need, I did not feel that their cry for help was according to the Lord&rsquo;s urging. This is not too much to say, because the only thing that matters is living by the Lord. When we write a letter, for example, we must check to see whether our urge to write the letter is from the Lord. We need to be delivered by the Lord; God&rsquo;s salvation is for us to live by Him.</p>
<p>When we do not live by the tree of life, we are living by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Living by the tree of life does not mean that we should not pray for others or that we should pray for others. Nor does it mean that we should not care for others or that we should care for others. Living by the tree of life means to live by the Lord. According to our experience, when we live by the Lord, we do not have many opinions, our concern for others is not based on seeing their shortages, and we are not anxious. One of Satan&rsquo;s tactics is to cause us to be anxious by stirring up our feelings.</p>
<p>A person who lives in the spirit is calm, poised, and not anxious; he is not anxious for himself or for others. He knows how to take the Lord as his life and how to live by the Lord. Since the Lord knows every situation, there is no reason to be anxious. A person who really lives in the spirit will often say, &ldquo;O Lord, this is Your business. I do not need to be anxious about it. Everything is in Your hand.&rdquo; This is the attitude of a believer who lives in his spirit. To live in the spirit is to live by the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM THE MIND<br />
AND TOUCHING THE SPIRIT IN A SIMPLE WAY</h2>
<p>Some people are very good at being a Christian; they are cautious and proper, but they do not know how to touch their spirit. Every spiritual matter that they encounter is a matter of calculation; that is, they do everything according to a formula. As a result, they are completely in their mind and do not touch their spirit.</p>
<p>We do not need to calculate and follow formulas; we need to practice touching our spirit in a simple way. By calling upon the Lord&rsquo;s name, we can be delivered from our mind. If we called on the Lord&rsquo;s name for three hours, we would be delivered from our mind and would enter into our spirit. If we called upon the Lord&rsquo;s name, we would be saved from our mind because genuine prayer is in the spirit. Without turning from our mind to our spirit, it is not possible to pray for more than a short period of time. We may be able to use our mind to study the Bible, but we will not touch spiritual things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FORGETTING PAST EXPERIENCES<br />
AND FLEEING INTO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Many of us have been elders and co-workers for many years, but we still do not know how to touch our spirit. Instead, our spirituality is quite rational and formulaic. This is our problem. We should count the things that were gains to us as loss, suffer the loss of all things, and count them as refuse (Phil. 3:7-8). We should flee from our past experiences into the spirit. Our past experiences can keep us from living in our spirit today. Even though we may have been in our spirit yesterday, we may not be in our spirit today. If we try to apply spiritual experiences from our past to our living today, it will not be profitable. We must let go of past experiences and care only for living in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOING NOTHING EXCEPT LIVING BY THE LORD</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s salvation is for us to live by Him. He lives, and we also live. The Lord lives in us, but ninety percent of the time we live out our own works. Our sanctification, pursuit, quietness, and calling are just our works. The Lord has imparted Himself into us; He does not want us to do anything other than live by Him. Hence, we should simply live by Him.</p>
<p>When we get up in the morning, we should live by Him. For example, we may be diligent to practice morning watch, but if we do not touch our spirit, our practice will be out of ourselves. Our morning watch should come out of the Lord, not out of ourselves. When we see the vision of the Lord living in us, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, I give myself to You. I want to let You live, and I also want to live by You.&rdquo; Nevertheless, it is easy to return to our old ways. When we arrive at a meeting, for example, our habit of giving a message may influence us to speak more than we should. Hence, we need to be reminded that the Lord is living in us, and we should yield to the Lord in order to live by Him. We should not remain in our old ways.</p>
<p>Our God is the living Spirit who lives in our spirit. Living by Him and walking according to the spirit are our only need. If we rely upon set ways and practices, we will think that our need is to find new methods, especially when we sense the oldness of our current habits. Rather than finding another way, we simply need to live by the Lord. We do not need to consider how to pray, because He will lead us to pray when we are in our spirit. The more we pray in spirit, the better it will be, and rivers of living water will flow spontaneously from us. The Lord is living in us. Hence, we do not need methods. The Christian life is not a work; it is a living. The Lord lives in us. When He prays, we pray, and when He lives, we live.</p><h2 class="head1">STOPPING OURSELVES, NOT CRITICIZING OTHERS,<br />
AND CARING ONLY FOR LIVING BY THE LORD</h2>
<p>People in so-called religion do many things for the Lord, but they do not live by the Lord. The Lord does not want us to be religious or to work and do things for Him. He does not want even our good behavior. None of these things means anything to Him. The basic revelation in the Bible is that our Lord is the Spirit who lives in our spirit and He desires that we would live by Him. Hence, the only thing that counts is living by the Lord.</p>
<p>In every local church there must be some who live by the Lord. If an elder lives by the Lord, all the saints will be influenced, and their spirits will be open. Satan is very subtle. Although we can touch our spirit, it is easy for Satan to influence our thoughts so that we consider and criticize others. This is often the source of our &ldquo;prayers&rdquo; for others. Such &ldquo;prayers&rdquo; do not come from our spirit but from our mind. We should simply live in the spirit and let the Lord take care of other matters. While it is not easy to stop ourselves and not criticize others, the Lord wants us to stop ourselves, to not criticize others, and to not consider others&rsquo; situations. The Bible speaks of numerous things, but the central and consummate revelation is that the God of all creation is in our spirit, and we can live by Him. At the end of the Bible, there is a city, the New Jerusalem. In this city God is life, and this city lives by God and lives out God.</p>
<p>Satan uses religion to usurp us. The religious concepts of Catholicism, Protestantism, and the various denominations influence many. Those who pursue spirituality also have concepts, even concepts concerning the breaking of the cross. Satan&rsquo;s way is to turn us from our spirit to methods based on our concepts. However, the Lord is in our spirit; therefore, we must live in our spirit. Living in our spirit is our way, our deliverance, and our true rest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL REVELATION OF THE BIBLE<br />
BEING TO LIVE IN THE SPIRIT AND TO LIVE BY THE LORD</h2>
<p>If we live in our spirit, we will not talk about many things. If we do not live in our spirit, however, we will be influenced by many things. When we are in our spirit, there is no need to consider or discuss other things. When we follow the spirit, the church life is good and pleasant. When the Lord is living in us and we are living in the Lord, there is no need for our plans and considerations. According to the Bible, our only focus should be on living by Him as the Spirit. When a couple lives in the spirit, there are no problems. Even if one spouse wants to quarrel with the other, there will be no problem as long as one spouse is living in the spirit. Living in the spirit solves every problem.</p>
<p>Our past experiences may be good; however, if we try to apply them in the same way today, they can cause us to not live in the spirit. As soon as we try to apply them in an old way, we will suffer loss. Satan is very subtle; he &ldquo;planted&rdquo; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in man so that man would not live by the spirit as the tree of life. In this way man&rsquo;s living deviates from the focus of God&rsquo;s revelation. God&rsquo;s revelation is that He, as the Triune God, is our Creator, Redeemer, and Savior, and as the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;He is the all-inclusive Spirit to be life in our spirit so that we can live by Him.</p>
<p>The New Testament speaks of our being in our spirit and of our living by the spirit. Since we receive life in the spirit, we must walk in the spirit and do everything according to the spirit. The Lord must open our eyes to see the revelation in the Bible. We may have heard many traditional doctrines, but we need to see a revelation related to life in our spirit. We need to see the revelation in 1 Corinthians 15:45, which says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; Many people know about the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, but they neglect the matter of the last Adam becoming a life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>When Christians greet one another, they often say, &ldquo;The Lord be with you.&rdquo; However, they do not know what the key is to the Lord&rsquo;s being with them. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; This refers to the Lord being in our spirit. The Bible has sixty-six books and contains many points, but what is the focus? For example, the Bible speaks of our experience of the cross, but this does not mean that we should be focused only on the cross or the altar for eternity. The only thing that God desires for us to do eternally is to live by Him. The altar is for us to live by the Lord, and the experience of the cross is for us to live by the Lord. The altar and the cross are for entering into the Holy of Holies; hence, it is not enough to focus on the altar but fail to see and to enter into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Today we have a simple way; that is, we need only to receive the all-inclusive Spirit. The altar of burnt offering, the laver, the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar are all in this Spirit. When we receive the all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit, we are in the Holy of Holies. Strictly speaking, we do not pass through the altar of burnt offering by ourselves; we pass through in the Lord. Furthermore, we are not crucified on the cross by ourselves; we are crucified in the Lord. All the Lord&rsquo;s experiences of becoming flesh, of passing through the cross, of shedding His precious blood, and of accomplishing redemption are in this Spirit. Furthermore, He was buried, and He resurrected from the dead. He is the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar. He is everything. Today He is the all-inclusive Spirit, and as the all-inclusive Spirit, everything is in Him in order to be received by us.</p>
<p>Some people received help and experienced the altar of burnt offering and the golden incense altar in the past. However, when we call them to come forward to the Holy of Holies, they pay attention only to the incense altar. Our experiences at the altar of burnt offering and at the table of the bread of the Presence are for us to enter into the Holy of Holies. Surprisingly, after experiencing these things, some people still have not entered into the Holy of Holies. In other words, they still have not entered into the spirit. All these items&mdash;the altar of burnt offering, the laver, the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar&mdash;are included in the all-inclusive Spirit. Our need today is to enter into the Holy of Holies and to enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>We should simply return to the riches in our spirit. We should not wander in our mind. Even when we give a message, we should not be in our mind; we should simply be in the spirit and speak the word from our spirit. This is the need of the churches today. The co-workers should not speak the same old things in their service to the churches; the churches do not need the old practices. The churches need what can only come from the spirit, genuinely and directly. When we fully look to the Lord and simply live in our spirit by the Spirit, we will be fresh, living, and rich. We should stop the wandering in our mind and simply live in the spirit by the Spirit. This is what the Lord desires.</p></body></html>
