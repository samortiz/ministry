   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 6 DAY 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matt 18:20 For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rev 1:10 I was in spirit on the Lord's Day</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Meeting Life</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hebrews 10:25 says, "Not abandoning our own assembling together."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>151 One characteristic of the life of God we believers have received is to flock together, to meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible says that we are not only the Lord's sheep, but even more, His flock Acts 20:28; 1 Pet 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>152 Our Christian life is not like the life of a butterfly, which does well on its own; our life is like the sheep's life, requiring that we flock together and live a meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consequently, we need to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The meetings are crucial to us, and we should not forsake them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>153</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The basic principle of the meetings of the church is that the meetings are a gathering of the believers by the Lord into His name Matt 18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In gathering us together in His name, the Lord rescues us from all kinds of worldly and earthly distractions and occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We especially need to be brought out of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For every church meeting we need the Lord to bring us out of everything other than Himself and to gather us together into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>154</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Seven Categories of Gathering</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the New Testament, there are only seven kinds of gatherings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These categories include the gathering for the Lord's table the bread-breaking meeting Matt 26:26-30; Luke 22:19-20; Acts 20:7a; 1 Cor 11:20, 23-26; 10:16-17, 21 , the gathering for prayer Matt 18:19-20; Acts 1:14; 4:31; 12:5, 12 , the gathering for edification by exercising the spiritual gifts 1 Cor 14:26-32 , the gathering for reading the Word of God Acts 15:30-31; Col 4:16 , the gathering for listening to messages Acts 20:7b , the gathering for preaching the gospel 2:14, 40-41; 5:42 , and the gathering for fellowship regarding God's move 14:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>155 Consecrating the First Day of the Week to the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord has purposely set aside one day out of the week and has called it the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>156 We need to say a little word here about the difference between the Lord's Day and Sunday.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sunday is a heathen, idolatrous term adopted by Catholicism and maintained by our tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, it is idolatrous to say a day belongs to the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible refers to this day as the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Revelation 1:10 calls this day "the Lord's Day."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today the whole world takes Sunday not mainly for worship but for pleasures, for sports, and for all kinds of entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is more evil than idol worship, but this tide has flooded many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We, however, should consider the first day of the week as a day for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>157 The Bible emphasizes three things that we should do on the first day of the week: First, we should exult and rejoice, because it is the day of the Lord's resurrection, the day Jehovah has made Psa 118:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, we should gather together to break bread in remembrance of the Lord Acts 20:7a; 1 Cor 11:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Third, according to 1 Corinthians 16:1-2 , on the first day of every week, every one should offer to the Lord according to his income.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On one hand, we remember how the Lord gave Himself for us, and on the other hand, we also have to give to the Lord on this day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Offering material goods to the Lord on His day is something that we should start practicing the moment we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should tell the Lord, "Lord, You have given to me richly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lord, I bring to You what I have gained and offer it to You."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You have to fix the amount that you will set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you have much, you should offer more.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you have less, you can offer less.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This day is not our day; this day is the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This time is not ours; this time is the Lord's. We hope that new brothers and sisters will pay attention to the Lord's Day from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Consecrate the first day of the week to the Lord and say to Him, "This is Your day."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do this, we will see God's blessing being showered abundantly upon the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>158</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
