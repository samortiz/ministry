   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEANS OF OUR DAILY SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall see that we may have constant, daily salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and the inward operation of the indwelling God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Salvation requires power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that a certain power is necessary to afford us a constant salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s means for the accomplishment of this salvation are unspeakably great.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Philippians, the means are two: the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and the inward operation of the indwelling God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Daily and even hourly we may be saved by these two means.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Please notice that the means of our daily salvation are not the bountiful supply of the Spirit of God and the operation of the visiting God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and the inward operation of the indwelling God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The God who saves us is not one who merely visits us; He is the One who indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, Paul could say that his circumstances would turn out to him for salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the other hand, he charged the saints to work out their own salvation according to the inward operation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, the bountiful supply of the Spirit and the inward operation of the indwelling God are the two means whereby we are saved in a practical way day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>AN ORGANIC UNION WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we believed in Christ, an organic union took place between us and the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have actually been joined to the Triune God, united with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By believing in Christ we were born of God, and God was born into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This divine birth makes the organic union possible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We were born of God when the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, came into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This transaction took place at the time we believed in the Lord Jesus, even though we probably did not realize it and were not conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Having come into our spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit remains there with His bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE CONTENTS OF THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY Divinity</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to see what the bountiful supply of the Spirit includes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, the bountiful supply includes the divine Person with the divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, the bountiful supply includes divinity, and divinity includes the divine life, nature, being, and person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In other words, it is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the bountiful supply we have God with His life, nature, being, and person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The bountiful supply also includes an uplifted humanity, a humanity with a proper life, living, nature, and person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Within Him there are both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, when He was on earth, He lived as God and also as man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All that the Lord passed through in thirty-three and a half years of life on earth is now in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, divinity and humanity, including the human living of the Lord Jesus, are in the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the cross the Lord Jesus died a wonderful death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The all-inclusive death of Christ dealt with every negative thing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By His death all sinful things were terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This wonderful death is also included in the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ s resurrection and ascension are included as well.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now in the bountiful supply of the Spirit we have Christ s divinity, humanity, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
