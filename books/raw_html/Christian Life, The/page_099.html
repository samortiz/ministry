<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Death of Christ<br>in the Compound Spirit</H2><P>We should not forget that His death is included in the all-inclusive, compound Spirit. The Holy Spirit today is a compound Spirit, typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25. This compound Spirit has God as the base, typified by one hin of olive oil. This oil is compounded with four spices&#151;myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. These spices typify the elements of Christ's death and resurrection. Furthermore, the number four typifies the created man. Thus, the Spirit, typified by the ointment, is a compound of God and man. The God-man, Jesus, has been compounded together with the elements of His death and resurrection.</P><P>In this compound Spirit, there is the death of Christ, and the death of Christ is active. Within today's antibiotics there is some element that is very active to kill the germs. In like manner, within this compound Spirit as a big dose, there is the element of Christ's death which is active in killing all the negative things within us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Killing of Christ's Death<br>through Our Environment</H2><P>Second Corinthians 4:10 indicates that the death of Christ kills us. The apostle Paul always was under the killing of Christ's death. According to history and according to the biblical record, Paul became an apostle bearing the burden to spread God's economy through the preaching of the gospel. He was always under people's persecution. A number of people were trying to kill him. He was continually under the persecution of the Jews, the Gentiles, and the Judaizers. This is why Paul said that he died daily (1 Cor. 15:31). Daily he risked death, faced death, and died to self (2 Cor. 11:23; 4:11; 1:8-9; Rom. 8:36). He was bearing about in his body the killing of Jesus so that the life of Jesus could be manifested in him.</P><P>In such a one who was daily under the killing of Jesus, people saw Christ. For him to live was Christ, and to live Christ is to magnify Christ (Phil. 1:20-21a). Even when he was in a Roman prison, he did not want to be put to shame. To be put to shame, to shame the Lord, would mean that people could not see Christ in him. But Paul was not put to shame. Even when he was in prison, people saw Christ in him. The manifested Christ is the life which comes out of the killing of Christ. This is what it means to live and walk under the crucifixion of Christ.</P><P>We need to live Christ under the crucifixion of Christ, under the killing of Jesus' death. Some may feel that since they are not the apostle Paul and are not under the kind of persecution which he experienced, they do not experience this killing. However, all of us are under this killing to a certain extent. The Lord may want us to do something which is against our will. When we follow the Lord against our will, this is a killing.</P>
