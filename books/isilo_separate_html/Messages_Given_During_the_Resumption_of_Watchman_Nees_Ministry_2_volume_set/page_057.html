In this meeting, we hope to discuss the problems we face in the way of life. On the one hand, we do not want to be loose; on the other hand, we do not want to be restricted. We will only talk about problems related to the way of life. Anything apart from the way of life will not be discussed here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LEADING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br>AND THE PROVISION IN THE ENVIRONMENT</H2><P>Question: I know that as long as I have the peace within, I can proceed with what I want to do. But do I also have to wait for the proper provision in the environment?</P><P>Brother Lee answered: Terms such as "provision in the environment" and the "leading of the Holy Spirit" have all been used in a loose way in Christianity. For this reason, we do not like to use these terms. Those who truly know God will not question about provisions in the environment. If there is a leading within them to do something, they can ignore all favorable or unfavorable environments. Sometimes a favorable environment will turn out to be a frustration to God's work. In the Bible, you find very few cases of people getting clear about God's will through going along with environmental provisions. The most important thing is the heart, and not the environment. God's leadings for Christians are all in the spirit. If a person is right before the Lord, almost everything he does is right.</P><P>From Paul's life we can see that his environments were mostly contradicting ones. In Acts 16, we see that he wanted to go to a certain place, but the Holy Spirit forbade him to do so. In his spirit he realized that it was God's forbidding. He did not act according to the provision in the environment, but according to the leading of the Holy Spirit. Do not think that God's leading will direct us to success. He is not for our being successful or failing. The main thing He is doing is to testify of Himself.</P><P>Sometimes we do not have to be too clear about anything. When we are too clear, we may end up being wrong. There was a brother who told me once that he had prayed and was clear that God wanted him to go home and give his wife a good beating. This kind of leading is not reliable.</P><P>The relationship between the leading of the Holy Spirit and the provision in the environment can be illustrated by the riding of a bicycle. On the one hand, we need to tread the pedal. On the other hand, we need the brake. We need to aggressively follow the leading of the Holy Spirit, but at the same time we also need to accept the limitations in the environment.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> </body></html>
