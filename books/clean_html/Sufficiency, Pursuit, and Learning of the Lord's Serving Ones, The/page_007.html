<h2 class="head1">GENUINE GROWTH IN LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Man Longing<br />
for a Transcendent Life</h2>
<p>Many Christians want to live in heaven, but in His wisdom God did not create man and then put him in heaven. In His wisdom God ordained that man should live on earth. Everyone who lives on the earth must endure innumerable problems. Even those who receive grace to serve God sometimes feel that life on earth is miserable. This feeling, however, does not come from our spirit. We may feel miserable simply because we are hot or sick. Although these conditions seem like small and insignificant matters, they are according to God&rsquo;s wisdom and His plan.</p>
<p>God created man and placed man on the earth so that man would live a normal and proper life. For the past two thousand years of church history, Christians have had a longing in their hearts to live a life that is transcendent, that is, a life without troubles or distractions, so that they could pursue and fellowship with God. Christians have longed to touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence when they pray and to receive light when they read the Bible. Christians have desired to be effective when they preach the gospel, that is, to touch people&rsquo;s hearts and bring them to tears. However, God does not seem to respond to these desires.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Two Schools in Church History<br />
That Pursued a Transcendent Life</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Monastics&mdash;Living in Seclusion</h2>
<p>There have been two groups of believers who have tried to live a transcendent life, but neither group has been successful. The first group, the monastics, was composed of believers who felt that the world with its affairs was a source of trouble. So, like the religions of the East, they forsook their families and lived a secluded life far from others. They had a simple lifestyle and were freed from the mundane affairs of human life. They testified that they had God&rsquo;s presence, but they did not gain a large following.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Mystics&mdash;Touching the Inner Man</h2>
<p>The second group, the mystics, is more recent in church history. The mystics were not ascetics. Ascetics left the world and lived in seclusion, but the mystics endeavored to turn away from outward things to touch the inner man.</p>
<p>Their practice met not only a spiritual need but also a psychological need that is common to all mankind. A Chinese scholar once said that all the literature related to Buddhism could be summarized with the words <em>from the heart,</em> meaning that Buddhism develops human virtues.</p>
<p>Confucian scholars say that a person who does not cultivate his virtues is like a tree without roots or a river with no source. The cultivation promoted by Confucian scholars stresses what is in the heart. Hence, seeking what is within man does not belong exclusively to spiritual Christians. It reflects a need that is common to man.</p>
<p>The mystics were prevalent for a time because other Christian groups were focusing on outward things and had become materialistic. Large chapels and cathedrals stress outward practices. Since the believers were not satisfied, the mystics were brought forth. This kind of inner pursuit, however, is not completely spiritual, because the heart is composed mainly of the mind, emotion, and will, along with the conscience in the spirit. Even Buddhists and Confucian philosophers practice a form of psychological cultivation. This principle was present among the mystics. Hence, the pursuit of the mystics was not entirely spiritual; it also involved a certain amount of psychological pursuit. Nevertheless, with the background of materialistic Christianity, the mystics became quite prevalent.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Balanced Living<br />
in the Environment Arranged by God</h2>
<p>Monasticism and mysticism were popular for a period of time, but later they provided a negative contrast to the proper Christian life. Orthodox Christians are not monks who try to escape the mundane affairs of human life in order to live an ascetic life in seclusion. Orthodox Christians do not give up the responsibilities of human life. Rather, they live a normal human life in the environment that has been arranged by God. They do not drop their responsibilities nor leave their families, wives, husbands, and children. They learn to live in human society with proper occupations. However, they also have the presence of God. Orthodox Christians grow in the divine life and develop humanly.</p>
<p>It is good to be freed from every encumbrance, and it is good to focus on fellowshipping with the Lord, not outward activities. However, God did not arrange for us to be separated from our human responsibilities. God is balanced, and He puts us in different environments so that we may be balanced.</p>
