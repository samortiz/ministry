   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE TRADITIONAL SIGNS IN JOHN FIVE 1 Scripture Reading: John 5:1-47</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The more we consider the signs in the Gospel of John, the more we realize that this book is a word spoken by the Lord concerning divine mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do not believe that the natural mentality is capable of writing such a book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall begin to consider the signs in chapter five of John.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter there are at least eleven signs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A CONDENSATION OF THE UNIVERSAL STORY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's economy is to gain a dwelling place for Himself by Christ and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is both the means and the element used by God to produce His dwelling place for the carrying out of His divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the unique story in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We truly praise God for the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Next to the Triune God Himself, the most wonderful matter in the universe is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that as we spend more time studying the Bible, we shall become fully convinced that no other book can compare with it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible is the book.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only this book deserves to be called the book.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No other book reveals things from eternity past to eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, only in the Bible can we see God's economy, the unique story in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The divine story, which is a mystery, is God's economy to fulfill the desire of His heart to obtain a dwelling place for Himself by Christ as the means and with Christ as the element.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order for Christ to be the means and the element for God's dwelling place, He must be the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we see this, eventually we shall realize that the tabernacle and all the offerings are the structure of this universal mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we may say that the real contents of the Bible are the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The sixty-six books of the Bible are, in a very real sense, condensed into one book, and this book is the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, in the Gospel of John we have the condensation of the universal story of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should never regard John's Gospel as shallow or elementary.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The language of this Gospel may be simple, but its contents are profound.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more I study the writings of John, the more I realize how profound, deep, divine, wonderful, and mysterious they are.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In our Life-study of the Scriptures we have completed all the New Testament books with the exception of Mark, Luke, Acts, and James.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Recovery Version of each book contains an outline of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The best outline is that of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Consider the portion of the outline of the Gospel of John that covers chapter five: The need of the impotent life's enlivening 5:1-47 The inadequacy of religion's law-keeping and the sufficiency of the Son's life-giving vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>1-9 Religion's opposition to life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>10-16 The Son equal with the Father in giving life and executing judgment vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>17-30 The Son's fourfold testimony vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>31-47 1 The testimony of John the Baptist vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>32-35 2 The testimony of the Son's work v. 36 3 The testimony of the Father vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>37-38 4 The testimony of the Scriptures vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>39-47</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The language used in this section of the outline is quite simple.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, it is not easy to explain what the different terms in the outline mean because they point to matters in this chapter that are profound and mysterious.</S>
