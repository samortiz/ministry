   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EVERY CHURCH A POLICE STATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND EVERY SAINT A POLICEMAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, because we did not have the pillar of truth, evil things were allowed to creep in. It seemed that there were no police stations and no policemen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because there was no safeguard of the truth, thieves had an opportunity to steal and to cheat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we realize that every local church must be a police station and that every saint must be a policeman.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If during the past four and a half years the churches had been police stations and the saints had been policemen, there would have been no way for the thieves to enter in.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many have been reluctant to act as policemen for fear they might cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose a robber comes into a bank.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand, he steals the money, but on the other hand, he claims to be one with the bank and to be for the bank.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Certainly the bank manager should call the police.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if he does not call the police for fear of causing turmoil, the robber will steal everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If someone claims to be for the ministry and yet goes about stealing and deceiving, we need to fulfill our function as policemen by checking him out according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But because we have been short of the truth and short in the practice of the truth, we have not done so.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have paid a big price to learn that we are short of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yes, the foundation of life has been laid, but the pillar of the truth has not yet been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, I am burdened to give a number of messages on the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have both the foundation of life and the pillar of the truth, no evil thing or evil person will be able to creep into the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead, all such ones and such things will be examined according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose a number of brothers come from other places to a certain locality to deal with the situation in the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Any saint who knows the truth and who practices the truth should rise up and say, Stop!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What right do you brothers have to come here and carry on like this?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Who gave you this authority?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you claim that Brother Lee has sent you, I ll call him on the telephone to find out if that is true.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And if it is, I ll rebuke him for not acting according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have received his ministry for years, but I will not receive it this time if it is not according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if the Apostle Paul were to speak against the truth of the New Testament, we should reject him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must be faithful to practice the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we see evil deeds but do not function as policemen, then we are not practicing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For the Lord s recovery, we must have not only life, but also truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all need to be impressed with the absolute importance of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First Timothy 2:4 says, Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the full knowledge of the truth Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>. God desires all men to have two things: salvation and a full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the past we took care of salvation, but we neglected the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Notice that, according to the Greek, this verse does not say that men should come simply to the knowledge of the truth, but to the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The last part of 1 Timothy 4:3 speaks of them which believe and fully know the truth Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>. Here we see believing, which refers to salvation, and fully knowing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To have the full knowledge of the truth is to fully know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To know the truth in this way is a safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>DEPRIVED OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1 Timothy 6:5 Paul says, Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and deprived of the truth Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>. Those whose minds are corrupted are deprived, destitute, of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They do not care for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some have actually said that the later they sleep in the morning, the more spiritual they are.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This kind of statement could only be uttered by one who is destitute of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Others have said that the best way to have a solid time on Sunday morning is to sleep late.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some have even told the young people that since they cannot conquer their flesh, they should let it do whatever it desires.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Anyone who can accept such statements is short of the knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Someone has even said that we should care only for the Spirit, not for principles.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How subtle!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Anyone who knows the truth realizes that this means to accept only the Spirit and to reject the Bible, for all the principles are derived from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is very dangerous to have only the Spirit, but not the principles of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps you have heard some say that they would drink my spirit, but not take my word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the saints in the Lord s recovery had the full knowledge of the truth, they would never accept this kind of word, a word that is an utter falsehood spoken by those deprived of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>During the last few years, there has been a dreadful shortage among us of the practice of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we all had practiced the truth, certain sayings and practices would have been questioned a long time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to learn the truth; we must not be a people destitute of the truth.</S>
