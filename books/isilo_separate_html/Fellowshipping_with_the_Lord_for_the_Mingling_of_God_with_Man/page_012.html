<h1 class="title">LEARNING TO FELLOWSHIP</h1>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will see how to live in fellowship with God. The goal of redemption is for God to work Himself into man so that the divine nature is mingled as one with the human nature and that the human nature is mingled as one with the divine nature. To be spiritual does not mean that the human nature is annulled and replaced by the divine nature. Rather, to be spiritual is to have the divine nature mingled with the human nature so that the human nature is transformed and uplifted. The human nature that we received from birth was merely created, but with the addition of the uncreated divine life and nature of God, it is transformed.</p>
<p>The first step of God&rsquo;s work is to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life. When we are saved, we receive the life of God. This life is actually God Himself. Furthermore, God enters into man as the Spirit. Therefore, when God enters into man, the Spirit enters into man, because the Spirit is God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing That God Is Spirit</h2>
<p>In order to fellowship with God, we must know that God is Spirit (John 4:24). If we do not know that God dwells in us as the Spirit, we cannot fellowship with Him in every place. God is Spirit; hence, we can fellowship with Him at any time and in any place. The Lord Jesus said to the Samaritan woman that the place to worship the Father was neither in Jerusalem nor in Samaria (v. 21). God is Spirit; He transcends every geographic location. The Spirit can be likened to air. He can be contacted anywhere, and we can fellowship with Him at any time. Just as God is not limited by time or space, our fellowship with Him is not limited by time or space. We can contact the Spirit in any place, at any time, and in any environment. First John 3:24 says, &ldquo;In this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.&rdquo; God gave us the Spirit so that we could fellowship with Him at any time, in any place, and under any circumstance.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit and the Divine Life</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s nature is Spirit, and His content is life. The life of God contains many rich items, such as holiness, love, light, goodness, righteousness, meekness, and humility. As God&rsquo;s nature, the Spirit is omnipresent. As God&rsquo;s content, the divine life is all-inclusive. Not only can we fellowship with God at any time and in any place, but in this fellowship we can contact the content of God, including all His attributes.</p>
<p>What is the relationship between the Spirit and life? Does the Spirit include life, or does life include the Spirit? Does the Spirit issue in life, or does life issue in the Spirit? Is the Spirit primary and life secondary, or is life primary and the Spirit secondary? The Spirit includes life, and the Spirit issues in life; hence, the Spirit is primary. The Spirit is a person. When we fellowship with God, we touch the Spirit, the nature of God&rsquo;s person. Furthermore, the Spirit is omnipresent. We contact the Spirit in our fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fellowship Depending on Touching Life</h2>
<p>Air is a good analogy of the omnipresence of the Spirit. However, air does not have personality or life. Just as we can breathe air anywhere, we can contact the Spirit anywhere. The Spirit is a divine person. Furthermore, when we touch the Spirit, we touch life, because the Spirit is life. With such a realization, it is easy to fellowship with God. Whenever and wherever we desire to fellowship with God, we need only to contact the Spirit, because God is Spirit. When we touch the Spirit, we touch the divine life, and this life will operate in us. This life will cause us to love others and to be humble, meek, patient, righteous, and forgiving, because these virtues are contained in the divine life.</p>
<p>The more we fellowship with God, the deeper the divine life will operate in us. We cannot determine to love, to be patient, or to be humble. Our love, patience, and humility must be produced by the operation of the divine life in us when we fellowship with God. It is not that we determine to love or to be humble but that He is our love and our humility. Through the operation of the divine life, the divine attributes increase within us. After fellowshipping with God just once in the morning, a brother will not have perfect love or perfect patience. However, each time he fellowships with God, the divine love and the divine patience will increase within him. As he continuously contacts the Spirit, the divine life will operate within him until he expresses divine love and divine patience spontaneously. The branches of a tree constantly receive the supply from the roots. As the life sap flows within the branches, they will bloom and bear fruit spontaneously. The visible fruit is the overflow of the hidden life of the tree. Galatians 5:22-23 speaks of the nine Christian virtues. These virtues are the fruit of the Spirit; they are not the issue of human effort. When the Spirit works within us, the divine life is infused into us until we overflow with the fruit of the Spirit. Hence, fellowship is the key to every Christian experience. If we learn the lesson of fellowship, we will gradually enter into every spiritual experience.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
