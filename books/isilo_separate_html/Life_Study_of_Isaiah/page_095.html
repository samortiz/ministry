Speaking Insulting Words<br>about Trusting in Jehovah for Deliverance</H2><P>Rab-shakeh stood and cried out with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, "Listen to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria: Thus says the king, Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, because he is not able to deliver you; neither let Hezekiah cause you to trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria....Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their land out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?" (36:13-15, 20). Then Hezekiah's servants came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of Rab-shakeh (v. 22b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Hezekiah's Seeking after Jehovah</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Hezekiah Tearing His Clothes<br>and Covering Himself with Sackcloth</H2><P>When Hezekiah heard of the situation, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah (37:1). This indicates that he was a godly person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Sending Eliakim, Shebna, and the Elders<br>of the Priests to Isaiah the Prophet</H2><P>Hezekiah sent Eliakim, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, who had clothed themselves in sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet (37:2). They said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of affliction, rebuke, and contempt, because children have come to the point of birth and there is not enough strength to bring them forth. It may be that Jehovah your God will hear the words of Rab-shakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria sent to reproach the living God, and Jehovah your God will reprove the words which He has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant which is left" (vv. 3-4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Words of Isaiah<br>to the Servants of King Hezekiah</H2><P>In 37:6 and 7 we have Isaiah's words to the servants of King Hezekiah who had come to him. Isaiah said, "Thus you shall say to your master, Thus says Jehovah, Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. Behold, I will put a spirit in him, so that he will hear a report and return to his land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land."</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_094.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_096.html">Next</a> </body></html>
