   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brothers and sisters, do remember that God allows us to go through all sorts of distresses for this very reason, that we may know Him as the God of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He constantly leads us into death, because only in death can we experience resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible speaks of two creations, the old and the new.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The divine nature does not indwell the old creation and that is why it has become old.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Where God is there is always newness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Jerusalem above is called "New Jerusalem" because it is full of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first creation, even though it is the creation of the living God, has no divine content; but what the God of resurrection raises from the dead has a divine as well as a human content.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It combines created and uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first creation, though brought into being by God Himself, is by God Himself suffered to pass into death that it may emerge in resurrection as a creation of dual nature, i.e., combining the natures of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This principle has to be applied to us personally and to all our relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is possible for fellow-workers, who love one another and work together harmoniously, to imagine that their mutual love and their cooperation is a spiritual thing; and others too may regard it as such.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet it may simply be a human relationship without any divine content.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But one day the hand of God falls upon it, and the cooperation comes to an end. For some indefinable reason those fellow-workers can no longer get on together.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are distressed about it and pray and yearn for a restoration of their former harmony; but the more they pray, the more it evades them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then one day, when they have really died to their old experience, they find themselves in a new relation not just a oneness of human nature, but a oneness that is both human and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Though the old creation has come into being by the mighty hand of the living God, He Himself does not reside within it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is created by Him and it displays His might, but it does not display His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How can the old creation be transformed into the new?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By the incoming of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But how can His incoming be secured?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the point at which a major difficulty arises.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The old nature must be shattered to make way for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers and sisters, everything in your life must pass the supreme test of death to make a way for the God of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you only know the living God, your knowledge will be too objective.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God will be God; you will be you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You need to know the God of resurrection; and it is only through death that He can cleave a way for Himself into your life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Prior to my coming here, I visited a large textile factory in Manila.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There I watched a process whereby certain materials were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But after the perfect fabric had been created I saw a second process take place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That perfect fabric was plunged into a bath of dye where it lost all its beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was a sorry sight.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But it was in that state that the dye permeated the fabric and a new element was added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So it is with the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It must pass through a devastating process if it is to be permeated by the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I was deeply impressed as I stood in that factory watching the two processes and comparing the fabrics that emerged from the first and the second.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They were not different fabrics really, but some of them, passing through a state that temporarily destroyed their loveliness, had a new and permanent beauty imparted to them.</S>
