<P>Verse 4:"But He answered." The Lord's answer was completely opposite to Satan's proposal. Satan was on one line, but the Lord changed to another line to deal with him.</P><P>"It is written." This is one of the principles of warfare. When temptation comes, it is true that our withstanding enables us to hold our position and causes the devil to flee (James 4:7). However, most of the time, this will only bring about a deadlock. But if we declare the word of God, the devil will flee. The word of God is the sword of the Spirit (Eph. 6:17). When we wield it, we gain the victory. However, it is also important to have faith. The word of God may be likened to the verdict handed down by the Supreme Court. This shows that before the Lord went into the wilderness, God had already given Him the word. God had said that He could get through, so He could get through.</P><P>Verses 5-7:Satan, who still would not let go of the matter of "the Son of God," also quoted the Scriptures. The first time it was the Lord who quoted the Scriptures to deal with Satan. The second time it was Satan who quoted the Scriptures, and the Lord refuted him by quoting the Scriptures again. The Bible should not be quoted in a careless way. What the Lord is showing here was that the first time He Himself quoted the Scriptures because God had given the word. But the second time, since God had not given the word, if He had cast Himself down, He would have tempted God. To have faith is to do according to what God has said; to tempt God is to decide to do something when God has not said it. Faith has only one principle: God has said it and I believe it.</P><P>Concerning the word "again" (v. 7), we should remember that in seeking God's will, if we receive just one verse and cannot back it up with another verse, we may be in danger.</P><P>Verses 8-10: Satan was willing to give up all the kingdoms of the world and their glory, but he was not willing to give up the worship from men. In this age Satan is the ruler of this world. In his entire life Satan's aim is to receive worship from men by hiding behind numerous idols and religions. Many idols have spirits because Satan is behind them. Satan's intention is to rob God of the worship from men. Therefore, the Scriptures say that God is a jealous God. It is written, " You took up...the star of your gods that you made for yourselves. / Thus I will bring you into captivity" (Amos 5:26-27).</P><P>John 4:23 says, "The Father also seeks such to worship Him." The Greek word rendered "seeks" is emphatic. The Father has to seek for worshippers because Satan is trying to rob God of the worship from men. David said that he would not take up the names of other gods upon his lips (Psa. 16:4).</P><P>In Old Testament times, those who had in them a spirit of the dead or a familiar spirit would be stoned to death (Lev. 20:27). Even if the wife of a man's bosom should entice him secretly, saying, "Let us go and serve other gods," she would be stoned to death. Furthermore, the first one to cast the stone on her would be her husband (Deut. 13:6, 9-10).</P><P>The Lord rebuked the tempter three times with the word of God. The first two times He did not point out that the tempter was Satan. However, the third time, because the tempter was attempting to rob God of worship, the Lord pointed out that he was Satan. The Lord also quoted the Scriptures, saying, " You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve" (Matt. 4:10; Deut. 6:13). The Lord is coming soon. We should reject any attempts to rob God of His worship.</P><P>Verse 11:"Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him." Every saint has the ministering of angels (Heb. 1:14). While we are being tempted, angels are standing by our side. We should pray God to send His angels to encamp around us and protect us.</P><P>Verse 12-17:Although John was put into prison, the Lord continued the message preached by John (v. 17). Although the first one who preached the message concerning the kingdom of the heavens was imprisoned, the nature of his message was not changed.</P><P>Verses 18-22:Peter was called when he was casting a net; John was called when he was mending nets. Eventually, what Peter did every time was a work of net-casting, and what John did every time was a work of net-mending. Peter cast a net first on the Jews and then on the Gentiles. Among the four Gospels, John's Gospel was written the latest. At that time, the Lord was no longer seen by men, but John brought men back to the source. When John wrote his Epistles, modernism had come into existence. Therefore, John led people to know the One who is from the beginning. The church had degraded, so John came to mend the nets. If the church had not degraded during the apostolic age, we would not have known how to take care of the situation when the church became defeated. Therefore, the Lord allowed the church to become defeated in the apostolic age so that John could come to mend the net and people would know how to take care of the situation. It seems that a person's condition at the time of his salvation more or less determines his work later on.</P><P>Verses 23-25: What the Lord preached was none other than the gospel of the kingdom. This is the same as the gospel of grace (Acts 20:32). However, the kingdom of the heavens has a specific emphasis. All who follow the Lord must be fishers of men. If a person is saved yet has never led another person to the Lord, he is not following the Lord. The Lord said, "I will make you fishers of men" (Matt. 4:19).</P><P>After Jesus healed many sick people, great crowds came to follow Him. Today if our spiritual diseases are healed by the Lord, many will come to follow Him.</P>
