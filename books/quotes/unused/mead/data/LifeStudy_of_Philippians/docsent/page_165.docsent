   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A REALIZATION AND A RESOLUTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We cannot deny that we have received revelation from the Lord concerning the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Only God s revelation can cause us to have this mind, the unique mind, the mind which was in Paul and in many who love the Lord Jesus and seek Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a mind not to pursue a work or a movement, but to pursue a life which is absolutely out of the old creation and in God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the unique mind in Philippians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This mind involves both a realization and a resolution to pursue toward the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The practice of religion and ethics is altogether different from the realization of God s goal and the resolution to pursue it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To have this mind is to have a mind to pursue Christ in His resurrection that we may live Him as the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all need such a mind, such a realization and resolution, that we may pursue toward this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>GOVERNED BY THE UNIQUE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>TO HAVE THE UNIQUE WALK</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we have the unique mind, we shall also have the unique walk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As human beings, we are under the control of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is the mind which directs the walk, not the walk that directs the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What we think governs what we say and do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, our thinking directs and controls our entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the reason we need to be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have been falsely and slanderously accused of mind-bending.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We by no means practice mind-bending, but we do promote the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our mind needs to be renewed in order to have a proper realization and resolution.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then our Christian walk will be directed by a mind which has been renewed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Greek word rendered walk in verse 16 is not the ordinary word for walk, but the word found also, for example, in Galatians 5:25.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is a very particular word, the verbal form of the noun element.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At least one translation renders the Greek here as to observe the elements.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Greek word, stoicheo, derived from steicho, means to walk orderly, to march in military rank, to keep step.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To walk in this way is to walk in a certain lane or path.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a walk which is regulated like that of soldiers marching in cadence, who walk at the same time and in the same rhythm.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some may wonder how it is possible for saints with different degrees of experience to walk in the same steps or in cadence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How, for example, can a brother with over fifty years experience in the Lord walk in the same steps as one who has recently been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not think that such a walk is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The way of teaching in the Bible is different from that practiced in the worldly educational system.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In schools there are different textbooks for students of different ages.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As Christians, however, we have the Bible as our unique textbook.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Both for those who, spiritually speaking, are in kindergarten and for those who are in graduate school, the Bible is our only textbook.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 15 Paul refers to as many as are full-grown.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This implies that some believers are more mature than others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But in verse 16 Paul goes on to say, Only this, whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us walk.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The words whereunto we have attained indicate that all the saints, regardless of their degree of maturity, are included.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all must walk by the same rule.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even the very youngest of the saints should walk the same path as those who are very mature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Concerning this, God s mind is higher than ours.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all should have this mind and walk the same path.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually we all shall be governed by the revelation of the unique mind and the unique walk.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then spontaneously we shall say, Lord Jesus, I love You in a way I have never loved You before.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Lord, in Your presence I resolve to pursue You as the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I want everything in my life to be out of the old creation and in God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we see this revelation and have this resolution, we shall have the unique walk controlled and directed by the unique mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>WALKING BY THE RULE OF THE NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Galatians 6:15 and 16 indicate that this unique walk is a walk by the rule of the new creation: For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To walk by the rule of the new creation is to walk by the rule of the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we walk by this rule, we shall be the true Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The name Israel means a prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We become a prince of God by having the unique mind which directs us to take the way of the unique walk, that is, to pursue toward the goal of the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today the Lord desires to have a group of people pursuing this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May we all see the crucial importance of the unique mind directing the unique walk, and may we all pursue toward the unique goal Christ as the out-resurrection.</S>
