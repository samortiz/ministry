   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRAINING OF THE FULL-TIMERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The training of the young full-timers is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whatever we do, we should not be that confident or contented.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We still need to hold an attitude that we are learning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We like to be improved and adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I hope that the brothers who have the burden to take care of the training of the young full-timers do it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I told the saints in Taiwan from the very beginning that we were in the lab.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We needed to try things to see what would happen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I did not have the confidence that anything was absolutely right or would really work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If it did not work, we should change and improve.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thank the Lord that most of the things we raised up did work so well.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I hope that you brothers would take the same kind of attitude and have the same kind of spirit to do the trainings of the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Learning How to Contact the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The next very crucial thing we have to train the full-timers in is that they must learn how to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every day they must have a proper time to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone must have a private time to pray to the Lord, to have a direct, private, personal contact with the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our contact we should not pray for so many things, but we need to open to Him to be enlightened, exposed, and judged.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to exhort them to have some direct dealing with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the way for them to grow up in life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Getting into the Word</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must also help them get into the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The best reference books for the young ones to study are the Recovery Version with the notes and the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If they still have time, they can get into the cross references.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they use this material, they will get into the proper knowledge of God s New Testament revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must train the saints to get into this material to have themselves equipped with the proper understanding of God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Building Up Their Character</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One basic thing we like to train our young people in is their character.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have a little book with thirty aspects of human character.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is worthwhile to train them in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I consider this as something basic.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One morning in Taipei I dropped in on the full-timers for about one hour, charging them to build up their character.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They were wondering what I meant.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then I began to point out specific things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One brother s necktie was the wrong color, and the way he put it on was wrong and loose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I told them to look at the way they combed their hair, the way their shoes were not shined, and the color of socks they put on.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I told them that not wearing a necktie was a sign of their bad character.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whatever such a person says to others will not be regarded.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a bank every teller is required to dress quite well because he is representing the bank in his contact with the public.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the young ones who go out are properly dressed with a proper haircut and are very polite, neat, and straight, they are the right persons.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The listeners respect this kind of person and regard him regardless of what he says.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whatever he says, they want to listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Another person may wear a blue shirt with a very strange necktie that does not match in color.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His tie distracts people s eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When he talks to them, they have no heart to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They would only be distracted to look at the tie he is wearing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This becomes a big embarrassment to his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The full-timers in Taipei were convinced by this fellowship and everyone looked much better the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They all even improved the combing of their hair.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some began to comb their hair in a good way but later their old character came back.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I told the saints that if they did not build up their character, they could never read the Bible properly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A loose person in character could never understand the Bible in the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Fleeing Youthful Lusts</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We also have to warn them strictly and strongly to not be alone with a member of the opposite sex.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Their contact should only be for the work or other necessary purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They must be very careful and we must warn them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have seen a number of young people who had a good beginning get snared by their youthful lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The unrestrained contact between the males and females in this present age is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is an abomination in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The great amount of fornication in the United States frustrates the Lord s blessing this country.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For one young male to stay in a room with another female is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To travel together is also against the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We even prohibit the young trainees from giving a ride to someone their age of the opposite sex.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then they will be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The four items above are the basic things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Of course, they also need some fellowship on how to trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I do not feel that it so necessary to fellowship with them concerning how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The simple way for the full-timers to take is to learn how to present the printed pages of the ministry and to speak them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you want to train them in the skill of teaching and preaching, teach them how to use these printed pages.</S>
