   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OBTAINING VERSUS ATTAINING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The problem with God's children is that they realize God's demand on Abraham, but they do not see the way to meet this demand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After God's children see His goal, they think that they should do something to attain the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They do not realize that the Christian life, the overcoming life of freedom and sanctification, is obtained and not attained.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The principle of Isaac is that everything is received.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Salvation is something that the Lord Jesus has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once we receive it, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Salvation does not involve a race to climb up the heavenly ladder, in which there is no assurance until one has struggled tortuously to the top rung.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Salvation is not acquired in heaven; rather, God sends it to us from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The same is true with victory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do not have to strive for victory day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not overcome our sins by possessing an extraordinarily strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Just as salvation is received, victory is received.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no need to do anything by ourselves; all that we have to do is receive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once we see and receive, we can say, "Lord, I thank and praise You because I have received all in Christ!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second Peter 1:4 is a very precious verse: "Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not know how many Christians have noticed the words "having escaped."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How wonderful these words are!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Christians say, "I wish I could escape."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But God says, "Having escaped."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He does not ask us to escape, nor did He say that He will work to the extent that we can escape.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He says, "Having escaped!"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Having escaped means that the escaping is done.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All that we have to do is receive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The meaning of Isaac is that God does the work and we receive the work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not crave, pursue, or hope over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, we sit down and reap the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no need for us to worry about anything, because we are the sons and we are already "in."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since we are the sons, we are also the heirs and are qualified to inherit the possession of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since we are Isaac, we can enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is all God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>WORKING AND ENJOYING</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, what do many Christians do?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They try to force themselves to do what they cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are things that they do not want to do, but they realize that God wants them to do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, they force themselves to do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Or they want to do something, and they know that God does not want them to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, they force themselves not to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are Christians by their "doings"!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not Isaac, because there is no enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The proper way is to do things by the life that God has given us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This life spontaneously does what God wants us to do; it does not force us to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the same time, this life turns away from things that God does not want us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a result, we do not have to force ourselves to turn away from certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can turn away from them spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether we do certain things or do not do certain things, everything is spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is no need to force ourselves to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God has a provision, and we should put ourselves under this provision.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is being an Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When Abraham was about to offer up Isaac to God, Isaac only asked one question: "Where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This was his only question.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But his father answered, "God will provide himself."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the characteristic of Isaac; his characteristic is to enjoy God's provision.</S>
