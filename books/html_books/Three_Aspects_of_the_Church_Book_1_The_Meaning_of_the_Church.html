<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p> This book is composed of messages concerning the meaning of the church given by Brother Witness Lee during a training on service in Taipei, Taiwan in 1956. The general subject of this training was &ldquo;The Three Aspects of the Church.&rdquo; The first aspect is the meaning of the church; the second, thecourse of the church; and the third, the organization of the church. The messages given in this training were compiled into three books, according to the three aforementioned aspects; these books are entitled: <em>The Meaning of the Church,</em> <em>The Course of the Church,</em> and <em>The Organization of the Church.</em></p>

<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH BEING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S PLAN IN ETERNITY</h1>
<h2 class="head1">AN EXPLANATION OF<br />
THE TRAINING REGULATIONS</h2>
<p>We need to have some explanation regarding this training. First, I hope that we can all be adjusted in our feeling. Every time we come together, it seems as if we are coming to a meeting, but during this training we must all be clear that we are coming for a class, not a meeting. Even in our prayers we should not say that this is a meeting. We need to consider our meeting hall as a classroom. We are not coming here to meet but to attend class. Even when we sing, praise, and worship God, we should not have the feeling that this is a meeting; rather, we should realize that this is a class.</p>
<p>Second, we did not expect that so many would participate. There are approximately three hundred seventy saints, which is nearly double the number that we expected. All those who have enrolled, especially the ones from Taipei, were recommended by the church. Moreover, some saints repeatedly entreated us for permission to come; as a result, there is now a large number of brothers and sisters participating. Nevertheless, there are some who have not been saved for a sufficient period of time and some who are a bit too old. We are afraid that they may not be able to keep up.</p>
<p>In the training the trainees need to listen in class, take notes, do their homework, take the tests, and practice. Of these requirements, the elderly saints may be able to fulfill the first only with much effort. In regard to the second requirement, we expect the trainees to take notes of at least seven hundred to one thousand words per class. I am afraid that many elderly saints may not be able to do this. The third requirement is to do the homework. The trainees must spend three hours in the afternoon, putting everything aside to concentrate on the homework. The fourth requirement is that the trainees must take the tests. For this they will need to memorize all the teaching materials and be able to apply them. The fifth requirement is that they must practice and exercise. Sometimes the trainees will be required to stand up and speak in front of the class, and sometimes they will speak in the church meetings according to our arrangement.</p>
<p>The last four items may be quite difficult for the elderly saints. Yet because we respect their portion and function in the church, it is difficult to reject them. Even though spiritual matters are not based upon knowledge or a certain level of education, this training will deal with spiritual matters in the way of education. Since this is a matter of education, there is a requirement for a certain level of education. Thus, we originally hoped that all the participants would be at least high school graduates; nevertheless, in this training there are many who have not attained to the high school level. We treasure the spiritual condition of these saints before the Lord and their desperateness for the Lord. If we reject them, we will not feel right; moreover, we are fearful of interfering with the Lord&rsquo;s work in them and hurting their feeling toward the Lord. For this reason we are allowing them to participate. We are fellowshipping regarding all these matters because we desire that everyone would understand the real situation. As a result, we hope that everyone attending this training will be more serious, pursue the Lord to a greater degree, and have more prayer before the Lord.</p>
<p>We require everyone attending the classes to take notes. This, of course, excludes the few elderly co-workers who have been invited to come as guests and not as trainees. They may or may not take notes as they wish. The rest of the brothers and sisters, who have been given permission to attend the training, must take notes of at least seven hundred words per class. The notes must have clear headings, and every word of each outline must be copied in the notes. They can take notes of the lectures, based on their understanding. Furthermore, we need to assign people to check everyone&rsquo;s notes. There should be one note-checker for every five or ten trainees.</p>
<p>During the training some will live in the dormitory, and some will commute. All those who live in the dormitory must do their homework from 3:00 to 5:30 P.M. This is mandatory. If anyone violates this regulation, we will ask him not to come to class the next day. Also, during this period of time, the trainees will not be allowed to receive visitors. We have particularly charged those given responsibility for the dormitory to turn away all visitors. We have prepared a desk for each of the trainees who live in the dormitory. They must use the two and a half hours in the afternoon to do homework, either studying their notes from the morning session or organizing their notes. They must learn to apply and memorize what they have heard in order to prepare for the next day&rsquo;s testing.</p>
<p>The testing will be carried out in the following manner: Today&rsquo;s classes will be tested tomorrow; every class will be tested once. After the trainees finish the first morning session, they will need to do the homework in the afternoon, and then they will be tested the next morning. They not only must be serious; they must also practice and exercise. They must exercise in the class. Sometimes we will ask a trainee to speak to the class concerning what was heard the previous day, and sometimes we will arrange for a brother to speak in a particular church meeting. This is a practical training and exercise.</p>
<p>Moreover, everyone must strictly abide by the rules and regulations of the training. First, if a trainee is a few minutes late to class, he will be considered tardy; after being tardy three times, he will be dropped automatically from the class. Second, being absent and being tardy are both violations of the regulations. If a trainee has something important to do and cannot make the class, he must ask for a formal leave of absence. Third, if a trainee fails the testing three times, we will ask that he please drop the class voluntarily. Every trainee must be absolutely obedient. If a trainee is disobedient even one time, we ask that he please drop the class. For example, if a trainee is called to be tested, and he is shy and asks to be tested the next time, this is being disobedient. Regardless of whether or not he knows the answer, when a trainee is called on for a test, he must take it. Fourth, the trainees in this training can be divided into three groups. The first group is made up of those who came from other cities and who have received hospitality. These brothers and sisters will have free time only on the Lord&rsquo;s Day afternoons; they may use this time to buy things, visit friends, or do other things. For the rest of the six and a half days, they must stay in the dormitory. During the training no one is allowed to speak of anything other than spiritual matters. We should not discuss things such as international, financial, political, or personal affairs. Only spiritual fellowship and pursuit are allowed. Everyone has paid a great price to come to this training. Most of us have given up our jobs, temporarily left our families, and spent time and money to come. Hence, we want to make the most of every moment in order to obtain a good result. I hope that the brothers and sisters will cooperate by not wasting any time.</p>
<p>The second group consists of those who are serving full-time in the church in Taipei. I hope that they can also do the homework from 3:00 to 5:30 P.M. For the rest of the time, because they are serving in different places, they may freely serve, but they cannot do other things. The third group consists of those who live in the workers&rsquo; home. Some of them are serving in the Taiwan Gospel Book Room, and some are local working saints who need to go to work after the training classes. I hope all of them can spend at least two hours on the homework every day. They can decide what time they will use for this.</p>
<p>I think we need some explanation regarding the seating arrangement. The brothers and sisters who attend every class have been seated at the front. Those who attend some of the courses will be seated in the back. However, there are a few exceptions. The life-study training in the evening is open to all the saints, but the trainees should sit in their assigned seats because it is still a class. For the rest of the brothers and sisters it is simply a meeting; thus, they can sit in seats without numbers. Since we are attending a class, we should sit in our assigned seats. Moreover, the outlines for the life-study training will be printed and distributed as a help to get into the messages. Nevertheless, the outlines cannot replace our notes. The trainees must still take notes.</p>
<p>In addition, the brothers and sisters from out of town are not permitted to leave freely during the eight weeks of this training. All those who need to leave must first submit a letter and obtain permission. Only those who fulfill one of the following qualifications may leave: First, if a trainee is summoned by his locality to go back and serve, we will consider and see if that locality truly has a desperate need. Second, some of the saints who are from out of town have asked for leave from their jobs for three days per week and need to go back to work for the remainder of the week. We are sympathetic toward this kind of situation and have decided to allow these brothers and sisters to go back. These two groups of brothers and sisters can leave after the evening class on Thursday. But they must be in their seats before eight o&rsquo;clock on Tuesday morning; otherwise, they will be considered tardy.</p>
<p>In this training there will be three sessions every morning from Tuesday to Thursday; this will result in nine sessions per week, totaling seventy-two sessions over a period of eight weeks. In addition, we may also have classes on Friday during the final week; thus, we may have as many as seventy-five sessions. However, in these seventy-some sessions we will cover only one topic: the church, the Body of Christ. The content of the life-study training in the evening will cover the five books in the Old Testament that we did not finish last year. This will include Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. These five books were written in Hebrew in a poetic style; thus, the Bible expositors call them the books of poetry. They belong to a special category. I hope that we will spend much time to study these five books during the next eight weeks. We must familiarize ourselves with the main ideas of these books. If we do not, I am afraid that we may not be able to keep up with the class.</p><h2 class="head1">THE THREE ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Our three daily sessions will cover the church in respect to three different aspects. The first aspect concerns the spiritual aspects of the church, that is, the meaning of the church. The second aspect is the course of the church, the journey of the church, which is similar to church history. The third aspect concerns the organization of the church. Hence, these three lines include the spiritual meaning of the church, its course, and its organization.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORIGIN OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Mystery Hidden in God Who Created All Things</h2>
<p>The first spiritual aspect of the church relates to the origin of the church. From where did the church come? When did it come into being? Ephesians 3:9-11 and 1:4-6 are two important portions of the Word related to these questions. Ephesians 3:9-11 says, &ldquo;To enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout the ages, since eternity past, a mystery has been hidden in God, who created all things. The Greek word for <em>eternity</em> in this verse is related to <em>eternal</em> as in &ldquo;eternal life&rdquo; (John 3:16). This mystery has been hidden from eternity past in God who created &ldquo;all things.&rdquo; Ephesians 3:9 speaks of &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; and &ldquo;economy.&rdquo; The word <em>economy</em> is rendered as &ldquo;dispensation&rdquo; in the Chinese Union Version. &ldquo;Dispensation&rdquo; is a general translation that can also be rendered as &ldquo;management&rdquo; or &ldquo;administration.&rdquo; Here we use a better translation, &ldquo;economy,&rdquo; which denotes an arrangement, management, plan, and dispensation. This mystery is God&rsquo;s dispensation, God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making Known the Wisdom of God<br />
through the Church</h2>
<p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church.&rdquo; The wisdom of God is made known through the church. First Corinthians 1:30 says, &ldquo;Christ...became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; Here <em>wisdom</em> is a general term that is all-inclusive. In other words, a person&rsquo;s wisdom includes everything that a person is. In the same way, God&rsquo;s wisdom includes all that God is. Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; Verse 3 says, &ldquo;In whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.&rdquo; If we put these two verses together, we will see that wisdom is not something simple but something inclusive. The mystery, this economy, is the wisdom of God, that is, all that God is, and it is expressed through the church so that the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies may know and see the wisdom of God.</p>
<p>The fact that the rulers and the authorities are in the heavenlies may cause us to consider them to be angels. However, if we read Ephesians 1, 2, and 6, we will realize that the rulers and the authorities refer to Satan and his messengers, that is, to the rebellious angels. Satan and his subordinates were originally angels who ruled and reigned for God. The dispensation of the mystery is to manifest the wisdom of God, all that God is, to the angels, especially to the rebellious ones, in order to put them to shame.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Being<br />
the Plan That God Made in Eternity</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:9-11 speaks first of the economy, then of the mystery, and then of the purpose, the plan, that God made. God&rsquo;s plan, that is, His purpose, is eternal; hence, it is called &ldquo;the eternal purpose.&rdquo; In verse 11, according to the Greek, <em>eternal</em> is an adjective modifying the word <em>purpose</em>. <em>Eternal</em> here has two meanings. First, in relation to time, God&rsquo;s purpose, His plan, is eternal; it is ever-existing, without beginning or end. This means that the church was in eternity past and is for eternity future. The plan is in eternity past, and the goal of the plan is for eternity future. Second, in relation to nature, God&rsquo;s plan is eternal, uncreated, and unchanging. Eternity is the nature of God. Eternity is not merely a matter of time but also a matter of nature. In other words, being eternal refers not only to time but also to nature.</p>
<p>For example, if we temporarily stay in a certain place, it is a matter not only of time but also of nature. Everything that is created is temporary. The nature of a creature is that of being temporary, whereas the nature of the Creator is eternal. These are two different natures. The eternal nature has a particular significance; that is, it is uncreated. For something to be uncreated means that it is without beginning or end, self-existing, ever-existing, and unchanging. Therefore, the fact that this plan is eternal means that it is eternal not only in time but also in nature.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:4-6 says, &ldquo;Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love, predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved.&rdquo; There are three main points in these verses: first, God&rsquo;s choosing; second, God&rsquo;s predestinating; and third, our being made holy, receiving the sonship, and being to Himself. The third point can be considered the goal of God&rsquo;s choosing and predestinating.</p>
<p>Verses 8 through 11 say, &ldquo;Which He caused to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence, making known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself, unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him; in whom also we were designated as an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of His will.&rdquo; Chapter 1 speaks of God&rsquo;s choosing and predestinating; it also speaks of the goal of God&rsquo;s choosing and predestinating, which is for us to be made holy, to receive the sonship, and to be to Himself. All these points originate from His plan, His economy.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1 and 3 show that the origin of the church is God&rsquo;s eternal plan. The church did not come into being by accident but was planned by God in eternity. We should not think that the Lord saved us and gathered us together to be the church because we sinned. This thought is too low and originates from a human perspective. From God&rsquo;s perspective, in eternity, before man even sinned, He planned for the church. The church is the center of all things; the church was planned by God in eternity.</p>
<p>The church is eternal both in terms of time and nature; it is not something accidental, temporal, or coincidental. The church was planned in eternity, long before the creation of the world, before we sinned, before we were born, before we were created, and even before all creatures were created. In other words, the church was a matter in eternity before the ages. If it were not for the purpose of obtaining the church, God would not have needed the creation. God created all things in order to obtain the church. Ephesians shows this point clearly. Then in Revelation 21 and 22, the New Jerusalem speaks further regarding God&rsquo;s intention. The New Jerusalem is the church that God desires to obtain. Hence, the origin of the church is the plan that God formed in eternity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>The origin of the church is God&rsquo;s eternal plan. The church did not come into existence by coincidence. Neither did the church come into being simply because a group of sinners were saved by God and gathered together. Instead, the church was planned by God in eternity before the creation of the world. Everyone learning to take God&rsquo;s way must be clear regarding this matter. Many times our concept regarding the church is too natural and lacking in revelation. We think that when a group of sinners in the world is saved by God from perdition and gathers together to meet, to worship God, and to serve God, these sinners become the church. This thought is altogether according to our human concept.</p>
<p>We must see the church from a divine, heavenly, and eternal perspective. In eternity past God planned to have the church, whether or not we sinned. Those who know the Bible know that God created the universe to gain the church; the church is the center of all things. If God did not intend to gain the church, He would not have created the universe and all things. The creation of all things was for the church. All God&rsquo;s plans and all His intentions are to gain the church.</p>
<p>In Revelation 21 and 22, after God completes all His work, the new heavens and new earth are the boundary, the new creation is the means, and the New Jerusalem is the new center. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate expression of the church. This clearly shows that God created the universe in order to produce the church. Hence, the church was planned by God in eternity.</p>
<p>We can illustrate God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church with the following few points.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Economy of God</h2>
<p>The word <em>economy</em> can be translated as &ldquo;management&rdquo; or &ldquo;dispensation.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church is God&rsquo;s economy or, we may say, God&rsquo;s management. This is the economy that is spoken of in Ephesians 1:10 and 3:9. Most English versions translate this word as &ldquo;administration,&rdquo; but some translate it as &ldquo;economy,&rdquo; and others as &ldquo;dispensation.&rdquo; The best translation is &ldquo;economy,&rdquo; meaning that God manages something for a particular purpose of administration, management, and arrangement. This means that before the creation of all things, God had a plan in Himself to manage a certain thing. This economy has a dispensation, an arrangement, and an administrative management. Those who have entered into the Word with some depth can touch this thought in God.</p>
<p>In an economy there are three main factors: the resource, the energy, and the means. In God&rsquo;s eternal plan He Himself carries out the work. In other words, God carries out His economy with Himself as the resource, His power as the energy, and His wisdom as the means. In eternity God&rsquo;s plan, God&rsquo;s dispensation, to obtain the church involved using Himself as the resource, His power as the energy, and His wisdom as the means. These three crucial factors in God&rsquo;s economy are revealed clearly in the book of Ephesians.</p>
<h2 class="head3">God Himself</h2>
<p>First, in eternity when God planned the church, He intended to carry out His plan Himself, that is, to use Himself as the resource. If the Ministry of Economic Affairs intends to operate a hydroelectric plant, it must have certain resources. The ability of the hydroelectric plant to operate depends upon these resources. God in His plan desires to obtain the church, and the resource that He uses is Himself. Thus, Ephesians 1:23 says that the church is &ldquo;His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all,&rdquo; and 3:19 says, &ldquo;That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; In addition, Colossians 2:9-10 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you have been made full in Him.&rdquo; These verses show that God uses Himself as the resource to produce the church, that is, to make the church full. God uses all His fullness as the resource to carry out His plan for the church, that is, as the material to build up the church.</p><h2 class="head3">The Power of God</h2>
<p>Second, God not only uses Himself as the resource to produce the church, but He also uses His power as the energy. Ephesians 1:19 says, &ldquo;What is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength.&rdquo; Verse 20 tells us that this power is the power that God used to raise Christ from the dead. Ephesians 3:20 says, &ldquo;To Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us.&rdquo; This power is not merely the power of creation but also the power of resurrection. The power of resurrection encompasses and transcends the power of creation. According to the Scriptures God is the One who calls the things not being as being and gives life to the dead (Rom. 4:17). To call the things not being as being involves His creation, and to give life to the dead involves His resurrection. Both involve power; however, the power of creation is included in the power of resurrection. When we speak of the power of resurrection, we are speaking of a power that includes all the power of God. God takes the power of resurrection as the energy for the carrying out of His economy related to the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Wisdom of God</h2>
<p>Third, in order for God to produce the church, He needs not only the resource (the material) and the energy (the power) but also a means. This is similar to building a house; we need materials, energy, and means. The means by which God carries out His economy related to the church is His wisdom. Ephesians 3:10 says, &ldquo;In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church.&rdquo; In addition, Colossians 2:3 says, &ldquo;In whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.&rdquo; These verses show that God uses His wisdom to produce the church.</p>
<p>In summary, in carrying out His economy for the church, God uses Himself as the resource, His power and might as the energy, and His wisdom as the means. First Corinthians 1:24 says, &ldquo;Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.&rdquo; If we know God&rsquo;s economy, our speaking regarding Ephesians and Colossians would not be the same. The Greek word for <em>economy</em> is used three times in Ephesians. In 3:2 the apostle Paul mentions the &ldquo;stewardship of the grace of God&rdquo; which had been given to him. The word <em>stewardship</em> is the same as <em>economy</em> in Greek. God&rsquo;s establishing of the apostle Paul as a steward was part of the economy of His grace. Hence, this Greek word is used three times in Ephesians, and each of these instances points to the economy related to the church. God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s plan for the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Eternal</h2>
<p>The church was in God&rsquo;s plan in eternity, before the creation of the world and all things, before the beginning of time. In eternity past God had such a plan. Ephesians 3:11 calls this plan His eternal purpose, His eternal plan. This plan was made not only in eternity but also for eternity. For us human beings there are an eternity past and an eternity future. God&rsquo;s plan was made in eternity past, and it is for eternity future. In other words, in eternity past God drew a blueprint of the church just as if He were drawing the blueprint of a house. Now in time, God is building His church according to this blueprint. This is the period of building. The completion of the building will be in the New Jerusalem. In eternity future this building will be finished.</p>
<p>A heavenly pattern existed in eternity past, but God is carrying out His building work in time. Before He began building, God first prepared the materials. In God&rsquo;s building there are two procedures: the first is the preparation of the material; the second is the actual building work. The materials are first prepared, and then God begins the building. God&rsquo;s creation, in which He called the things not being as being, is related to the preparation of the materials. His giving life to the dead is related to His building work. Hence, God is first manifested as the God of creation and then as the God of resurrection. This is the God in whom Abraham believed. The God in whom Abraham believed is the One who called the things not being as being and who gives life to the dead. To call the things not being as being is God&rsquo;s creation, and to give life to the dead is His building. In time, God first created, and then He carried out the work of death and resurrection. God prepares the materials and then builds. (See the diagram below.)</p>
<p>Having been created by God, we are all materials for the building of the church. However, if there was only creation without resurrection, there would be materials but no building. Only when the materials pass through death and resurrection can God&rsquo;s building come into existence. Hence, the amount we experience death and resurrection equals the amount of God&rsquo;s building. If we never pass through death and resurrection, we will remain as natural materials that have not been built into the church as the spiritual house. For us to be built into the church as the spiritual house, we must pass through death and resurrection.</p>
<p>A person who is a descendant of Adam, who has not believed in the Lord, has been created by God but is absolutely not part of the church. He is merely a piece of building material. If at any time he passes through death and resurrection, the uncreated element of God will be mingled with his created element, and he will become a part of the church. Based on this principle, we can infer that even though we have been saved, we still have many natural things in us that belong to Adam, things we were born with that have not passed through death and resurrection. In other words, these natural things are raw materials that have not been built up. We will be built up as the church only when death and resurrection gain more ground in us through an increase in our experience of the cross and in our knowledge of resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0736330127_02.jpg" alt="" width="383" height="137" /></p>
<p>In eternity past God planned the blueprint for the church, and in eternity future God will gain the church as a spiritual house. In time two steps are needed for God to fulfill His eternal plan: creation and redemption. Redemption includes both death and resurrection. According to its literal meaning, redemption does not include death and resurrection; however, according to spiritual fact, the main points of redemption are death and resurrection. In creation, God created the first creation; in redemption, God accomplished the second creation. As a result of Satan&rsquo;s corruption, the first creation became what the Bible calls the old creation; through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, the second creation became what the Bible calls the new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15).</p>
<p>The old creation is in Adam, and the new creation is in Christ. The old creation in Adam is natural, and the new creation in Christ is spiritual. When what is natural becomes spiritual, God&rsquo;s building is completed. The old heavens and old earth are the universe in the old creation; the new heavens and new earth are the universe in the new creation. When the new heavens and the new earth appear, everything of the old creation will become new. At that time everything that is natural will have become spiritual. The new universe will have the New Jerusalem as its center. The New Jerusalem is the eternal building that God in His eternal plan desires to build, and it is the ultimate manifestation of the church. Hence, God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church existed in eternity past and is for eternity future.</p><h2 class="head2">Being out of God Himself</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:9 shows that the church was purposed in God in eternity according to the good pleasure of His will. Hence, this plan is out of God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being according to the Good Pleasure of God&rsquo;s Will</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1 tells us that this plan, this arrangement, is according to the good pleasure of His will. This chapter tells us of God&rsquo;s desire. Just as man has a desire for pleasant things, God too has a desire. Based on His desire He has a purpose, and this purpose has become His will. His purpose is His will according to His good pleasure. God&rsquo;s plan is out of the good pleasure of His will. Hence, the church makes God happy; it is very much in God&rsquo;s heart and what God has planned for Himself.</p>
<p>The Chinese have bridal chambers for their weddings. A bridal chamber is a new house that is used for a wedding. A father prepares many wonderful things for his son in the bridal chamber. We may ask, &ldquo;Why does a father need to prepare a bridal chamber for his son?&rdquo; The father would say that it is because he is obtaining a wife for his son. The entire universe can be compared to a large bridal chamber. All things make up the furnishings of this chamber. God desires to obtain a wife for His Son; this wife is the church. Hence, the church is what pleases God the most. This is not merely a matter of God&rsquo;s love but of His taste. God delights in the church and has a special love for the church.</p>
<p>We should never think that God had no interest in man until He saw that man had sinned and become fallen, at which time He was moved with compassion and set up a way for salvation in order to save men and gather them together as the church. If this were the case, the church would be too low. Rather, the church is something exceedingly great and profound; it is what pleases God the most. Before all things were created, God had a good pleasure in Himself and purposed to have the church. This purpose became the good pleasure of His will. Based on this will, He made a blueprint, a plan for the building of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being in Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1 tells us that God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church is in Christ. Being in Christ is a great matter.</p>
<h2 class="head3">God Appointing Christ<br />
for the Fulfillment of His Plan</h2>
<p>The Lord has two particular titles: one is <em>the Son of God,</em> and the other is <em>Christ.</em> In Matthew 16:16 Peter answered the Lord Jesus, saying, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo; In Luke 2:11, when the angel announced the good news, he said, &ldquo;Today a Savior has been born to you in David&rsquo;s city, who is Christ the Lord.&rdquo; In addition, John 20:31 says, &ldquo;That you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>The Son of God</em> refers to the Lord&rsquo;s person, and <em>Christ</em> speaks of His commission, His work. The Lord Jesus was the Son of God, and He was appointed by God to be the Christ. In God there is no element of time, but if we put eternal things into time, one might say that the Lord was the Son of God in eternity and that He was appointed to be the Christ before the foundation of the world. The Greek word for <em>Christ</em> is <em>Christo,</em> an equivalent of <em>Messiah</em> in Hebrew. <em>Messiah</em> means &ldquo;anointed One.&rdquo; Christ is the anointed One. In principle, when God intends that someone work for Him, He anoints him. The priests, kings, and prophets in the Old Testament were anointed by God before they were used to accomplish His purpose. The word <em>Christ</em> means that God appointed His Son to accomplish His plan. In other words, God appointed His Son to be the anointed One in His plan. God has a plan, and this plan depends upon His Son for its accomplishment. Hence, the Son of God was anointed to be the Christ.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1 does not say that God&rsquo;s plan was made <em>in the Son of God,</em> but rather that it was made <em>in Christ.</em> What is the distinction between the Son of God and Christ? Or we may ask: When did the Son of God begin to exist, and when did Christ begin to exist? As God, the Son of God existed in eternity and is without beginning or end, but Christ came into being after God made His plan for the church.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament there are three groups of people who worked for God and required the anointing of God. They were the priests, kings, and prophets. David was the only one who possessed all three statuses at the same time; nevertheless, they were not very apparent in him. In contrast, it is apparent that the Lord possesses all three statuses at the same time for the purpose of fulfilling God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Jehovah has anointed Me&rdquo; (cf. Isa. 61:1; Luke 4:18). This creates a difficult theological question regarding when God anointed His Son. In man&rsquo;s eyes God anointed the Lord Jesus after His baptism, but Hebrews 1:2 tells us that God appointed His Son to be the Heir of all things. Prior to His being appointed to be the Heir of all things, He was always the Son of God. At a certain point in eternity God had a good pleasure, and based on His good pleasure, He had a will. According to His will, He made a plan to obtain the church. At this point, He appointed His Son to fulfill His plan. From that moment, the Son of God became God&rsquo;s anointed One. This is the first significance of God&rsquo;s plan being made in Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">God&rsquo;s Eternal Plan Being for Christ</h2>
<p>Moreover, God&rsquo;s plan for the church is altogether for His Son (Col. 1:16; John 3:35; Heb. 1:2). God not only intends that His Son accomplish this plan, but He also desires that His Son inherit this plan. Whatever His plan accomplishes is for His Son. The church is the Body of Christ, and this Body is for Christ. God desires that Christ would have a Body.</p>
<p>In typology, God is typified by Abraham, His Son is typified by Isaac, and the church is typified by Rebekah. All of Abraham&rsquo;s plans were for his son Isaac. In the same way, God&rsquo;s entire plan, God&rsquo;s arrangement, is for Christ. Hence, this plan was made in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Everything Being Christ</h2>
<p>Third, everything is Christ. The expression <em>in Christ</em> does not imply only that Christ is the One who accomplishes and inherits God&rsquo;s plan but also that everything in this plan is Christ. When the kingdom comes, we will be able to see Christ in many things and matters in the kingdom. In the new heaven and new earth there will be nothing that is not Christ. Christ will not merely be expressed; He will be everything. Even today, whenever we fellowship with a saint who is deep in the Lord, we sense that he has Christ in him and that coming to him is the same as coming to Christ.</p>
<p>A day will come when all things will be Christ. No matter what we touch, we will sense Christ. In that day all things will be headed up. Today people in the world have no way to be united, because they lack Christ. Things are not in harmony, because they lack Christ. We must wait for the day when God has worked Christ into all things and when all things are Christ; only then will all things be in harmony.</p>
<p>Today people in Christianity speak of oneness, but they are not one. Even if there is some oneness among them, it is merely outward. Genuine oneness is in Christ because oneness is simply Christ Himself. When we are in ourselves, we are not one and can never be one. However, when we live in Christ and when we give Christ the way and the ground in us through the cross, the result is oneness among us. This oneness is simply Christ. Hence, God&rsquo;s plan in Christ has a deep significance; that is, God intends to work Christ into all things.</p>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;Since God Himself is the resource, His power is the energy, and His wisdom is the means, in God&rsquo;s economy where is God?&rdquo; Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; First Corinthians 1:24 tells us that Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. In the economy of God&rsquo;s eternal plan God Himself is the resource, God&rsquo;s power is the energy, and God&rsquo;s wisdom is the means; moreover, Christ is God Himself, God&rsquo;s power, and God&rsquo;s wisdom. Hence, after God made this plan, He appointed His Son to be the anointed One, the Christ. His Son is the Christ, the One who accomplishes His plan, inherits His plan, and is everything in His plan. Thus, everything in this plan is full of Christ and wholly Christ. Every item and even every moment are Christ Himself.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church is the economy of God. It is eternal, out of God Himself, according to the good pleasure of God&rsquo;s will, and in Christ; moreover, it causes us to obtain the sonship, become holy, and be to Himself (Eph. 1:4-5). The last three items include: obtaining the sonship, becoming holy, and being to Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">For Our Obtaining the Sonship, Becoming Holy,<br />
and Being to Himself</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Obtaining the Sonship</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:4-5 contains three crucial phrases: <em>unto sonship, to be holy,</em> and <em>to Himself.</em> In the phrase <em>unto sonship,</em> we tend to focus on the <em>&#150;ship;</em> however, in Greek the emphasis is first on being sons and then on the suffix <em>&#150;ship.</em></p>
<p>According to the meaning of the Greek, God in His plan ordained that we would be His sons; then, having ordained us to be His sons, He ordained us to inherit all that He is. Being His sons is an inward matter related to life in which the life of God enters into us. Inheriting all that He is, is an outward matter related to inheritance in which we enter into all that He is. On the one hand, God wants His life to enter into us, and on the other hand, He wants us to enter into all that He is. When a person inherits everything from his father, it means that he enters into everything that his father has outwardly. Whatever circumstances the father has are the circumstances into which the inheritor enters; where the father is, the inheritor will be also. Hence, the word <em>sonship</em> has two aspects in the original language: on one hand, God&rsquo;s life enters into the church, and on the other hand, the church enters into all that God is.</p>
<p>At this time, the church is on the earth and has not yet entered into all that God is. This means that this is not the time of the church&rsquo;s inheritance. God&rsquo;s life has entered into the church, and we are God&rsquo;s sons; however, our becoming God&rsquo;s heirs and inheriting all that God is will be manifested in the future. In the future, especially when the New Jerusalem appears, we will see the church wholly enter into all that God is, and the church will inherit all that God is. In other words, at that time God will not only be in the church, but the church will obtain all that God is.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan is to obtain a group of people who will become His sons and obtain the sonship. When the Bible speaks of sons, it has two meanings: one is related to life, and the other is related to inheritance. Life enables us to be sons, yet even though we have life, we may not be able to inherit. This is similar to the case of Jacob and Esau, who both had their father&rsquo;s life, yet Esau did not inherit his father&rsquo;s possessions. God, in His plan, desires to have a group of people who become His sons with His life, and He wants them to obtain the sonship, that is, to inherit all that He is. The church possesses God&rsquo;s life in full, and in His life God has fully given Himself to the church. Moreover, God desires that in the future the church would inherit all that He is. According to the aspect of life, it is God&rsquo;s life that enters into us; according to the aspect of inheritance, it is the church that enters into all that God is.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Adam is already dead, but on the other hand, Adam is not dead, because he has given his life to us. Today Adam is still on the earth. Adam is everywhere. Adam has given himself in his life to his descendants. All the descendants of Adam have the life of Adam. They are a group of people to whom Adam has given himself in his life. In like manner, God has given Himself in His life to His sons. This is what it means for a group of people to be God&rsquo;s sons in His plan. We must worship God because God in His life has given Himself to us, and we have received His Son. Those who receive His Son are born of Him, and they have been given the authority to become children of God (John 1:12). We have been born of God. The word <em>born</em> is deep in its significance. For us to be born of God means that God&rsquo;s life, which is God Himself, has been given to us.</p>
<p>God in His eternal plan predestinated us unto sonship, which means that He has determined to give Himself to us in His life. Nevertheless, this is only the beginning. Romans 8:14 says, &ldquo;As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&rdquo; Then verse 17 begins, &ldquo;If children, heirs also.&rdquo; Being sons is a matter of life, and being heirs is a matter of inheritance. The utterance &ldquo;if children, heirs also...joint heirs with Christ&rdquo; means that we inherit God and all the things of God in Christ. What a glorious fact!</p>
<p>Verse 17 continues, &ldquo;If indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.&rdquo; Being glorified is to inherit. We are joint heirs with Christ to inherit all things. This is quite glorious! Today people in the world see us as &ldquo;the scum of all things&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:13), but in that day we will enter into glory with Christ. In that day both He and we will inherit all things. When we are manifested, people will exclaim, &ldquo;These Christians are the heirs of all things!&rdquo; This is sonship.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:5 says, &ldquo;Predestinating us unto sonship.&rdquo; In God&rsquo;s plan we are truly predestinated to be His sons and to obtain the sonship. Being sons is a matter of life; obtaining the sonship is a matter of inheritance. Life enables us to receive God Himself; inheritance enables us to receive all that God is. When the son came home in Luke 15, the father first went out to meet his son, and then all that the father had became the son&rsquo;s. This is what God has determined in His eternal plan. Since this determination was determined beforehand, it is referred to as predestination.</p><h2 class="head3">Becoming Holy</h2>
<p>In the Chinese Union Version, the expression <em>to be holy</em> in Ephesians 1:4 is translated &ldquo;to be holy and clean.&rdquo; Most people in Christianity have the concept that holiness is cleanness. But the meaning of the word <em>holy</em> in the original languages of the Bible, both in the Hebrew of the Old Testament and in the Greek of the New Testament, focuses more on the aspect of being holy than on being clean or pure. The Chinese translators of the Bible, for the sake of convenience, added the character for <em>clean</em> to the character for <em>holy</em> to coin a new expression <em>holy and clean.</em> Strictly speaking, the character for <em>clean</em> should be replaced by the character for <em>separated.</em> The phrase <em>holy and separated</em> is closer to the original meaning of <em>holiness</em> because holiness does not have the sense of cleanness but of separation. A person who is holy is not merely clean but also separated. Because of the presence of the word <em>clean</em> in the Chinese Union Version, people according to their natural concept think of cleanness when they hear of being &ldquo;holy and clean.&rdquo; This is an inaccurate expression. We should use <em>holy and separated</em> rather than <em>holy and clean.</em></p>
<p>God Himself is holy. He is absolutely holy and distinct from everything else. God&rsquo;s heart is love, and God&rsquo;s nature is holy. God&rsquo;s nature is related to His essence. Just as the nature of a wooden table is wood and the nature of an iron rod is iron, so also God&rsquo;s nature is holiness. To be holy is to be different and distinct from everything else. Holiness is not only different from filthiness, but it is also different from cleanness. Being holy is not merely different from being evil, but it is also different from being good. For instance, the nature of gold is distinct from any other thing; it is distinct from the filthy things in us, and it is also distinct from the cleanest thing in us. It is distinct from the evil things, as well as from the best thing. The word <em>holiness</em> is used altogether in terms of the nature of God. The Bible always uses pure gold to represent God&rsquo;s nature because gold is different in essence from that of all other created things and is distinct from everything else. Thus, the distinct nature of gold symbolizes God&rsquo;s holy nature. Hence, holiness refers to God Himself, God&rsquo;s nature. For us to become holy involves the following two points.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Its First Significance&mdash;<em>Being Separated unto God</h2>
<p>God in His eternal plan desires the church to be made holy, to be sanctified, to be separated. In a shallow sense, this means that the church is to be separated unto God. In the Old Testament whenever the word <em>holy</em> is mentioned, it bears the meaning of being separated unto God. For example, tens of thousands of oxen and lambs were in the hands of the secular people and were used by them. Then one day an ox or a lamb would be brought into the tabernacle of God and put on the altar of God; the ox or lamb would then become separated and sanctified unto God. In God&rsquo;s plan He wants the church to be holy, meaning that He wants to separate the church from all the created things unto Himself. This superficial aspect is the first meaning of being made holy.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Its Second Significance&mdash;Being Mingled with God</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2 and 3 show that there is a deeper significance to being made holy, that is, God desires to be mingled with man. God desires that men of clay would be changed into pure gold. Whatever is made of clay is common; however, whatever is made of gold is holy. We were once of clay and thus common, but God desires to make us pure gold, to make us holy. Genesis 2 illustrates this thought. God created man out of clay and placed this man of clay in front of the tree of life. From the tree of life flowed a river in which there was an abundance of pure gold. This implies that God desires to transform a man of clay into pure gold by means of His life. In Revelation 21 we see a city of pure gold&mdash;the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is a city made entirely of pure gold, while its wall is of precious stones, and its gates are pearls. The city proper is pure gold, and the street in the city is also pure gold. This indicates that when God&rsquo;s work is complete, the entire church will be pure gold, that is, it will be completely holy. At that time we will know that the entire church has been transformed from clay into gold; in other words, the entire church will be entirely transformed with the element of God into the element of God.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that the sanctification recorded in Genesis is completed in Revelation. The &ldquo;treasure in earthen vessels&rdquo; in 2 Corinthians 4:7 refers to the process that is carried out between Genesis and Revelation. We, the created earthen vessels, are gradually being transformed in nature, and eventually, we will fully become the treasure, the gold. It is not enough for us merely to be distinct from other people. We still must ask ourselves how much we have been transformed inwardly. The significance of sanctification is not merely that we have been separated outwardly and that we serve God; rather, it is that God lives in us and is transforming us. Sanctification is the result of God transforming us through His life in us. This is the sanctification that takes place in our living, a practical sanctification, an inward sanctification, and a complete sanctification.</p>
<p>Hence, the first significance of sanctification is to be separated unto God, and the second significance is to be mingled with God to become the image of God. However, this is not merely a doctrine that is applied spiritually; instead, it is a reality. It begins with separation and is completed with a change in nature; this is an inward transformation of life (2 Cor. 3:18). In terms of separation, we are all sanctified, but in terms of a change in our nature, our &ldquo;flavor of clay&rdquo; is still strong. For example, a brother may be well behaved, pure in actions, and impeccable in his dealings with others, but when we contact him, we sense a flavor of clay and commonness in him. His humility, meekness, considerateness towards others, and blamelessness are earthly, human, and full of the flavor of commonness. Secular people may praise this kind of person, but those who have a spiritual nose can smell that he is altogether of clay, not proper or holy.</p>
<p>We may not be able to easily find good points in another brother. We may find it difficult to say that he is humble or meek, but when we contact him, we sense that he has the flavor of God, and we sense the presence of God. This person is different from other people. He is not ordinary but extraordinary. This kind of condition is holiness. This person has been mingled with God. The degree to which a person has been mingled with God is the degree to which he has been sanctified. When we contact a person who knows God and allows God to work in him, we can sense the flavor of God even though we may not be able to speak with certainty of his good points. Nevertheless, there is something special in him. We cannot say whether it is humility, meekness, or another virtue; however, we touch and sense God in him. This is to be holy, and this is God Himself.</p>
<p>The church must attain to the goal of sanctification in God&rsquo;s plan. One day the church will be extraordinary and distinct from all other things in the entire universe; the church will be pure gold. The New Jerusalem is also called the holy city (Rev. 21:2), because the city is built up through the transformation work of God, and its inward element is God Himself. Such a condition is sanctification; in the New Jerusalem there is no flavor of clay. If we have this vision, we will see that today in Christianity too many things have been brought in that are of clay, are common, and are not of God. The church is holy and cannot be mingled with anything common. For this reason, all our conduct, work, administration, and leading in the church must not be carried out with worldly methods. The church is holy, not common. The church is not a pile of clay bricks but a transformed city of pure gold.</p><h2 class="head3">Being to Himself</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:5 says that God predestinated us &ldquo;to Himself.&rdquo; The preposition <em>to</em> in the original Greek may also be rendered <em>into,</em> as in Romans 6:3, &ldquo;baptized into His death.&rdquo; Ephesians 1 indicates that in His plan God first desires that the church have His life, become His sons, and become His heirs to inherit His possessions. Second, He desires that the church be made holy and be fully mingled with Him. Third, He desires that the church be to Himself. The church becomes the sons of God by receiving God&rsquo;s life, obtaining God&rsquo;s sonship, becoming God&rsquo;s heirs, and inheriting God&rsquo;s possessions. The church becomes holy by being sanctified and transformed, by having God mingled with the church and by the church being transformed from clay to gold.</p>
<p>In the process of being made holy there is an inward progress advancing deeper layer by layer. Each layer is progressively deeper than the other. The consummate step is to enter into God and be fully joined to Him. Today we are still in the process of be joined to God. The central thought of the Bible is that God and man are to be fully mingled as one. This mingling of God and man is the church. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being transformed into the same image as the Lord, from glory to glory. This shows that God mingles Himself with us in order that we may fully possess His nature. Our &ldquo;clay&rdquo; will become &ldquo;gold,&rdquo; and then we will be to God, that is, fully brought into God Himself.</p>
<p>Romans 6:3 says that &ldquo;all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death.&rdquo; Everyone who has been baptized has been brought to Christ, that is, into Christ Himself. Ephesians 1 shows that in God&rsquo;s original plan, He determined that the church would reach the point at which it would completely be to God, that is, brought into God Himself. In other words, it would be completely mingled with God. To be holy is for God to be mingled with us; to be brought into God is for us to be mingled with Him. At the end of Revelation, when the holy city New Jerusalem appears, God will be in the church and the church will be in God. God and His redeemed will no longer be separated. At that time God and His redeemed people will not merely be together; they will be one. They will have the same nature and the same glory; they will be completely one.</p>
<p>God has determined in His eternal plan that the church would obtain the sonship, be made holy, and be brought into Him so that the church will be completely one with Him. This is not merely a doctrine; all of us have had some experience of this in the process of our salvation. Although we have not yet fully inherited God&rsquo;s possession, we do have a deep sense in our spirit that we are heirs of God. We have the life of God within us, and we have all had some experience of being made holy. Many times we have a deep feeling that we are in God, yet at other times it seems that we have come out of God. These experiences prove that being mingled into oneness with God is a real and practical matter.</p>
<p>Since God desires that the church have the sonship, be holy, and be to Him, He chose and predestinated the church. These two points require explanation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Choosing</h2>
<p>We may think that God&rsquo;s choosing is an individual matter; however, the Bible shows that choosing is not an individual matter but a corporate one. Strictly speaking, God has not chosen any individual; rather, God has chosen the church. Some people may ask, &ldquo;Did God not choose Abraham as an individual?&rdquo; If we read the Bible carefully, we will realize that when God chose Abraham, He chose him and his descendants. God chose the children of Israel. When the children of Israel left Egypt, it was not that one person left one day and another left the next day. From God&rsquo;s perspective, the children of Israel as a whole kept the Feast of the Passover, crossed the Red Sea, and were saved at the same time. In the same way, from God&rsquo;s point of view the church was chosen and redeemed corporately. It is true that there is a difference in the dates of our individual salvation. God saves one person today and another tomorrow. Throughout the past two thousand years God has been saving people continuously and unceasingly. We were all saved one by one; however, with God there is no element of time. According to God&rsquo;s perspective, He chose and redeemed us all at the same time.</p>
<p>Both Ephesians 1:4 and 1 Peter 1:2 speak of choosing. If we read these two books, we will be clear that choosing is not an individual matter but a corporate matter related to the church. God in His eternal plan chose the church. Choosing means that a particular item is selected from among many items. In His eternal plan God chose the church from among all the things that He had created. The church was chosen by God from among all things. God created not only the church but also all things. Among all the created things God chose a portion, that is, the church. This choosing did not occur after the creation of all things. God is not like us. We can only see if something is good and choose accordingly after we finish making it. God&rsquo;s choosing began before the creation of all things. Before the creation of the universe, in eternity, God chose the church according to His predestination and foreknowledge. This is the meaning of God&rsquo;s choosing in the book of Ephesians.</p><h2 class="head4">Predestinating</h2>
<p>After choosing, God predestinated. As soon as He chose, He predestinated. John Nelson Darby translated this word as &ldquo;marked out.&rdquo; Once something is marked out, it is determined. For example, we could go to a furniture store and see that there are many cabinets, tables, and chairs. If I were to choose three cabinets, four tables, and five chairs, I would sign my name upon them. My signature would mark them out, and once they were marked out, their future would be determined. In eternity God chose the church, which means He marked out the church. We should not think that we were aimlessly wandering around, not knowing what was going on, and then we simply believed in Jesus. No, the church was chosen by God. He marked us out in eternity, and none of us can escape from His hand. We often think that God&rsquo;s grace came to us because we suffered many blows and hardships and were thus open to receive Jesus as our Savior. We do not realize that God marked us out. The church was marked out in eternity. The reason that we believe in the Lord and follow Him is not the result of ourselves or the result of anything controlled by us; rather, it is due to God, and it is controlled by Him. Every one of us is a part of what God has chosen and marked out.</p>
<h2 class="head2">That the Multifarious Wisdom of God<br />
Would Be Made Known to Satan and His Angels</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s eternal plan, as far as He is concerned, He desires to be fully mingled with man; however, God cannot forget that He has an enemy in the universe. Hence, another purpose in His eternal plan is to make known the multifarious wisdom of God to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies (mainly to Satan and his angels) through the church (Eph. 3:10). Satan thinks that he is clever, but his best schemes only provide God with the best opportunities to manifest His wisdom. God manifests His wisdom in this great universe not only through Satan but even through small men, such as Job. In the book of Job, Satan tried to do things to Job with his tactics and schemes, but Satan&rsquo;s cleverness simply gave God the opportunity to manifest His wisdom through Job.</p>
<p>If we want to know God&rsquo;s wisdom, we need to begin with God&rsquo;s creation. When we preach the gospel to people, they always like to ask: &ldquo;Why is there a devil in the universe? Since God is almighty, and He loves man, why did He not eliminate the devil?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why did God create the tree of the knowledge of good and evil?&rdquo; According to their reasoning, man fell because of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; therefore, if God had not created the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, there would not have been any problems. They also ask, &ldquo;Since God loves the world, why does He allow all the natural disasters and man-made calamities to occur? God causes man to suffer so much on the earth; can His love bear this?&rdquo; The only answer to all these questions is that God is different from man. If God&rsquo;s thought were the same as man&rsquo;s, God would not be able to manifest His wisdom.</p>
<p>The story of the universe can be compared to a drama, which has a very touching, rich, and complicated storyline. The story of the universe manifests the multifarious wisdom of God. God can be likened to a person composing a play involving the plot in many twists. A good play has a rich plot that can touch people&rsquo;s feelings and express the author&rsquo;s thoughts. The New Testament clearly says, &ldquo;We have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:9). The saved ones are likened to those in a universal spectacle or a drama. Therefore, we can say that in the universe, the item that best manifests the multifarious wisdom of God is the church.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s creation is marvelous. Consider the example of our human body. Many people who study medicine know that the construction of the human body is truly special. In the arrangement of the parts of our face, we have eyebrows above our eyes so that the rain and sweat cannot flow into our eyes. This is wonderful. Even though this is only a small item in God&rsquo;s creation, it is sufficient to manifest God&rsquo;s wisdom. God&rsquo;s wisdom is manifested not only in His creation but also in His redemption. After God created man, He brought man into the garden of Eden and placed him in front of the two trees. Man was seduced by Satan to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and thus he fell. Sin entered into man, causing him to be guilty of sin before God and also to have the element of death within him. From Satan&rsquo;s perspective, this was clever because it seemed that he had ruined the creation of God to the extent that God would not have a way to fix it.</p>
<p>God, however, became incarnated as a man. Before the incarnation, Satan never could have guessed the extent of God&rsquo;s wisdom. God in His wisdom and power accomplished a wonderful redemption. When the Lord Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Satan tried his best to kill Him; in the end he crucified the Lord Jesus. This, however, simply provided God with the opportunity to destroy Satan and to deal with everything that Satan had done in man. Man&rsquo;s record of sin, the authority of sin, and the death that was brought in by sin were all dealt with by the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross. This was something that Satan never expected. Moreover, he certainly could never have imagined that the Lord Jesus would be resurrected.</p>
<p>The Lord was raised on the third day after His death. Satan then tried his best to nullify the fact of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. He caused men to bribe the soldiers to say that Jesus&rsquo; body was stolen, not resurrected (Matt. 28:12-15). However, no matter how much Satan tried to nullify it, resurrection is a fact. Once the Lord resurrected, He brought man out of the realm of death and imparted His life into man. Once His life enters man, there is a change in man; man now belongs to God. We who have God&rsquo;s life have become the Body of Christ. One day the Body will become the New Jerusalem. At that time, Satan&rsquo;s mouth will be shut up completely.</p>
<p>God manifests His wisdom through these things. All these acts are not accomplished in individuals but in the church. Moreover, the law was also brought in because of Satan. Satan worked behind the scenes with the children of Israel, and this forced God to give them the law. The law separated the Jewish believers from the Gentile believers. Ephesians 2 shows how God in His wisdom broke down the middle wall of partition and brought the Gentile believers into the Body, causing them and the Jewish believers to be one Body in Christ (vv. 14-16). Chapter 3 says that God&rsquo;s wisdom is manifested through this Body. Hence, every single item related to the church shows God&rsquo;s wisdom. The church is especially for the manifestation of God&rsquo;s wisdom; the church is the embodiment of God&rsquo;s wisdom.</p>
<p>Ephesians and Colossians show that God&rsquo;s wisdom includes all that God is. God&rsquo;s wisdom is realized through God Himself and His power. If God&rsquo;s wisdom did not have God Himself as the resource and God&rsquo;s power as the energy, all God&rsquo;s plans would be in vain, and God&rsquo;s wisdom would not be manifested. The reason God&rsquo;s wisdom can be realized is that God Himself is the resource and God&rsquo;s power is the energy. The Bible shows that God&rsquo;s wisdom includes all that God is, and all that God is, is embodied in Christ. God also causes Christ to become wisdom to us (1 Cor. 1:30). It pleases God to make known His multifarious wisdom through the church to Satan and his angels; the multifarious wisdom of God is the church.</p>
<p>When the situation of the church before God is normal and spiritual, the wisdom of God is made manifest to man, and man can see the solution, the way, the power, and what humanity is lacking. What humanity lacks is not related to knowledge or talent but is a matter related to God. There are many people in the world who are knowledgeable and talented, but the knowledge and talent of man cannot match what the church possesses. Man does not have the wisdom of God. When knowledgeable and talented people contact the church, they say with reverence that there is something unique about the church people who worship God and belong to Him. This &ldquo;uniqueness&rdquo; is God Himself.</p>
<p>God is the wisdom of the church. When the church lives before God, it manifests many wonderful stories to man; these stories are the wisdom of God. This wisdom is God Himself, and this wisdom is something that the world lacks. However, when the church in a locality loses her nature and heavenly position, none of God&rsquo;s wisdom can be manifested. A church that is up to the standard enables man to see God&rsquo;s wisdom, that is, to see God Himself, even though the ultimate day of glory has not yet come. Throughout the past two thousand years, Satan has tried to destroy the church, but in every age God has manifested His wisdom through the church. When Paul wrote the book of Ephesians, he truly saw the vision of God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE HEADING UP OF ALL THINGS</h1>
<h2 class="head2">Heading Up All Things</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan for the church is not only to mingle Himself with man and to make known to Satan and his angels the multifarious wisdom of God but also to head up all things in the heavens and on the earth in Christ His Son. Ephesians 1 has two wonderful statements. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;To head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; Then verse 22 says, &ldquo;He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.&rdquo; Christ is the Head of the church, and He is the Head over all things to the church.</p>
<p>Christ is the Head, the preeminent One, not only over the church but also over all things. He is the Head over all things to the church. Christ being the Head over all things is absolutely related to the church. Whether Christ can be the Head over all things, whether all things can be subjected to the authority of Christ, and whether all things can be headed up in Christ completely depend upon whether or not the church exists, has been produced, and has grown up. When the church exists, God is able to subject all things to the authority of Christ. By means of the church, Christ is able to be the Head over all things.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Three Purposes in God&rsquo;s Plan for the Church</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s plan for the church, He has three main purposes: first, for the church to obtain the sonship, to be holy, and to be to Himself; second, that the church would make known the multifarious wisdom of God to Satan and his angels; and third, that through the church He would head up all things. In order for us to obtain the sonship, He first causes us to receive His life, and then He works Himself into us. Eventually, He causes us to inherit all that He is so that we might fully enter into Him. To be holy is to be first separated and sanctified unto Him and then changed in nature inwardly to become the same as God. In other words, we who are made of clay become men of gold through sanctification and a change in nature.</p>
<p>Sanctification in the Bible begins with separation and ends with a change in nature. When we were saved, God separated us from the descendants of Adam, but this separation was only the beginning. From that time, God&rsquo;s life in us began to transform us. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being transformed into the image of the Lord. Our being transformed is carried out by the Lord&rsquo;s life, which is inwardly transforming us every day. This is the meaning of being changed in nature. At the beginning of Genesis 2, the one who stood before God was a man of clay. At that time God was God, and man was man. Even though man was standing before God, God had not yet entered into man. Since God is continuously changing the nature of man inwardly, by the end of the book of Revelation God will be mingled with man and man will become &ldquo;gold.&rdquo; At that time, there will no longer be the nature of clay in man; rather, in nature he will be &ldquo;gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The process that takes place from Genesis to Revelation can be described as the stage of the &ldquo;treasure in earthen vessels,&rdquo; as spoken of in 2 Corinthians 4:7. In this stage there is both the treasure and the vessel. When man has Christ as the treasure in him, even though outwardly he is a vessel of clay, inwardly he possesses a &ldquo;golden&rdquo; life. Thus, upon receiving the Lord, man begins to be transformed inwardly until he is raptured. At that time the Lord will have completely transformed the visible body of clay into His glorious image. At that time man will be fully sanctified, and the city that will be manifested will be called the holy city. Sanctification begins with separation and ends with a change in nature.</p>
<p>What we speak of here is not based merely upon doctrines but also upon our spiritual experience. After we were saved, we were different from our colleagues, classmates, and neighbors; however, this was only the beginning. From this point onward, we must pay attention to our walk and behavior. Is there a change in our living and our inner nature? Are we living on our own, or are we living in the mingling with God? Our colleagues go to the movies, and we come to the meetings, but is our going to the meetings sanctification? We serve in the church, but who is serving, and does our service issue from God&rsquo;s transformation of us? We need to consider these matters. If there is no inward transformation, even our preaching will be at most an outward sanctification. We should ask, &ldquo;Is my preaching only from myself, or is it from the Spirit of God through His transforming work in me?&rdquo; Being completely sanctified is not a matter of avoiding worldly things but rather a matter of whether we are doing something related to God by ourselves or by God&rsquo;s transforming work within us.</p>
<p>It is the same with our reading of the Bible. When we read the Bible, we need to ask ourselves whether we are reading with only our mind or whether we are reading by the transformation of the Spirit of God within us. If we are reading only with our mind, our reading is merely an outward sanctification without an inward change in nature. Hence, after we are saved, we should not be a &ldquo;single&rdquo; person, but a &ldquo;dual&rdquo; person; that is, we must be ones who live by two natures&mdash;divinity and humanity. This means that when we speak, it should not be us alone who are speaking but the Lord who is speaking in us through His mingling with us. When we read the Bible, we should not be reading it by ourselves but by the Lord who is reading in us through His mingling with us. When we visit the brothers and sisters, it should not be us alone who are speaking but the Lord who is speaking through us to the brothers and sisters by clothing us with Himself outwardly and transforming us inwardly. After the conversation, we should be able to sense that the Lord has transformed us a little more. This is practical sanctification, a sanctification in living, an inward sanctification, and a complete sanctification. Eventually, in the New Jerusalem our nature will be completely changed. We will not only be separated from all things, but we will also no longer have any of our nature of clay. In contrast, we will be full of the nature of gold and completely changed in nature.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s first purpose in His plan for the church is to work Himself into man and to work man into Himself so that God and man can be completely mingled together. This not only solves God&rsquo;s problem, but it also solves the church&rsquo;s problem. When a couple gets married, for example, both of their problems are solved. As long as a single man does not have a woman to match him, he feels restless. Similarly, as long as a single woman does not have a man to match her, she feels restless. When a single man marries a single woman, a wonderful marriage is accomplished. The man gives himself to the woman, and the woman gives herself to the man. In this way both their problems are solved. Marriage is a type of God entering into man and of man entering into God; the two become joined as one.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2 God spoke on behalf of Adam, saying, &ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone&rdquo; (v. 18). God also spoke this word on behalf of Himself. In the universe it is not good for God to be alone. God needs a counterpart, and this counterpart is the church chosen and created in Him. The church is God&rsquo;s counterpart. If God were not joined to the church, God would be alone, and this would not be good. Only when God is joined to the church will He have rest. In the same way, as far as the church is concerned, her problem will not be solved if she is not joined to God. Hence, God&rsquo;s first purpose for the church is to solve His problem and the problem of the church. Revelation 21:3 says, &ldquo;The tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them.&rdquo; On that day God will be satisfied, and man will be satisfied; God&rsquo;s problem will be solved, and man&rsquo;s problem will be solved.</p>
<p>Second, God&rsquo;s purpose for the church is to deal with Satan, who is the rebellious force in the universe. God must shame Satan through the church so that Satan&rsquo;s mouth will be shut and so that he will see the multifarious wisdom of God. Third, the purpose of God for the church is to solve the problems of the universe and to head up all things. The solution to all problems&mdash;the problem of God, the problem of man, the problem of Satan, and the problem of the universe&mdash;depends upon the church. Hence, the church is the unique means for God to deal with these problems. Without the church, God&rsquo;s problem, man&rsquo;s problem, Satan&rsquo;s problem, and the problem of the universe will not be solved. The solution to all these problems depends upon the church.</p><h2 class="head3">The Oneness in Creation and the Oneness<br />
in the Restoration of the Universe</h2>
<p>We need to see how God can head up all things through the church. In order to see this, we must first see the oneness of the universe. The universe is basically one. Everything of the universe depends on oneness. The system of the universe is one, the source of the universe is one, and the center of the universe is also one. If we ask experts in science, astronomy, geology, chemistry, biology, and physics, they will tell us that everything related to the universe depends on oneness. This is because the universe depends on God, and God is one. There is oneness in the creation of the universe, and in this oneness there is no confusion.</p>
<p>One day, however, a rebellion occurred, and from that day, the universe was no longer one. There was something else in the universe, and this brought confusion into the universe. The universe became chaotic because there was a rebel in the universe who desired to be the head. He wanted to have a high position and to sit on the throne. He exalted himself, aspiring to have the same rank as God, and thus disrupted the order of the universe. However, God cannot allow such confusion to continue; therefore, He will restore all things and head up all things.</p>
<p>The original oneness in creation was ruined by Satan and needs to be restored. The restoration is carried out through the redemption of God. In the oneness of creation, there was only the power of God, not the nature of God. Now in the restoration of oneness, that is, in redemption, there is not only the power of God but also the nature of God. The oneness of creation is natural, but the oneness of redemption is of resurrection. Satan brought the oneness of God&rsquo;s creation into death, but through redemption God brought this oneness into resurrection. God came to restore the oneness of creation, which was altered by death, through the oneness of resurrection.</p>
<p>On the one hand, God restored this oneness, and on the other hand, He added an additional component into this oneness&mdash;the life of God. When God used His creating power to create the universe, all things were in harmony, not in chaos. However, Satan&rsquo;s rebellion ruined this oneness and brought this oneness into death so that the entire universe was brought into confusion. Therefore, God came to restore oneness not by His power and handiwork but by His life, His resurrection life. When this life enters into the believers, they become the church.</p>
<p>John 10:29-30 says, &ldquo;My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand. I and the Father are one.&rdquo; Here God&rsquo;s hand is mentioned. Verses 27 through 28 say, &ldquo;My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give to them eternal life.&rdquo; Here God&rsquo;s eternal life is mentioned. Verse 16 says, &ldquo;I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must lead them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one Shepherd.&rdquo; Here oneness is mentioned. Formerly, the Jews and the Gentiles could not be blended together, but now they have become one flock in the Father&rsquo;s life and in the Father&rsquo;s hand. This oneness is centered on life. We are one not merely because God holds us and places us together but because His life is within us, making us one.</p>
<p>First John 1:3 says, &ldquo;That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us.&rdquo; Once this life is reported to us, it causes us to be one and to have fellowship with one another. The oneness in redemption, in addition to the element of the oneness in creation, has the element of the life of God. The oneness in creation is under God&rsquo;s mighty hand; the oneness in redemption, however, begins with the life of God, though it also has the hand of God outwardly.</p>
<p>Because Satan injected the element of death into man, man has been damaged, has become impure, and is in total disorder. We were redeemed out of this disorderly situation when God&rsquo;s life entered into us. Even though we are saved, we are still in disorder; therefore, we need God to work in us so that we will no longer be in disorder but will be restored to the oneness of creation. This restoration is not only by God&rsquo;s power but also by God&rsquo;s life. Satan ruined the oneness of creation by death, and God is restoring this oneness by life. Satan put death into all the creatures; now God is restoring all these things by life. Hence, where there is death, there is disorder; where there is life, there is oneness.</p>
<p>Revelation 22:1 reveals that the New Jerusalem is a city in which there is a street of pure gold and a river of water of life that proceeds out of the unique throne of God. From the picture of the New Jerusalem, we see that everything is one in the New Jerusalem. Everything related to the oneness of the New Jerusalem speaks of the golden nature of God and the flowing of God&rsquo;s life. In the New Jerusalem there is only one nature and one life. Consequently, in the New Jerusalem there is only one street and one river of water of life. This city is the ultimate issue of God&rsquo;s work of recovery by life. This recovery begins with the church. First, God put His life into the church. Then the more this life functions and flows in the church, the more the oneness is recovered in the church. The more this life functions to change the nature in the church, the more the oneness of the church is manifested.</p>
<p>According to our feeling, there are many disorderly people, things, and matters in the church, but we must not rearrange them with our human hand, and it is useless for us to exhort the saints merely with words. Rather, we must allow God&rsquo;s life to have a clear way to accomplish a transformation work in the church. The church is transformed little by little, and the more the church is transformed, the more the situation of oneness is manifested. People in Christianity like to speak of unity, but the unity of which they speak is not the genuine oneness, the oneness of the church. The oneness of the church is manifested only in God&rsquo;s life. If we do not allow God&rsquo;s life to transform us, we will never experience oneness. We may be polite, and we may be humble, but this is not oneness. We may be somewhat meek, and we may be somewhat forbearing, but this is not oneness. The oneness in the church issues out from the life of God. When God grows in His life, the result is the oneness of resurrection in the church. Such oneness is not the natural oneness of creation but the oneness of life in resurrection.</p>
<p>It is correct to say that the oneness of resurrection is God&rsquo;s life. At the same time, it is also correct to say that this oneness is fellowship. Fellowship is the oneness. We can have fellowship and oneness only to the extent that we allow God&rsquo;s life in us to transform us. Moreover, we should never forget that where the oneness is, there the Head is also. Oneness can never be separated from the Head. Where there is oneness, there is the Head; where there is no oneness, there is no Head. Whenever there are many heads, there is no oneness, and their headship is not genuine. Therefore, whenever we live in the divine life, there is oneness and fellowship in us and in our midst. At such a time, the Head is among us.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 says that God is heading up all things in Christ. This is too great a verse, yet in our experience we are still able to touch, at least in part, the matter of God heading up all things. The heading up of all things in Christ is a recovery of life, a recovery of nature. Satan put death into all creatures, but the recovery work of God puts His life into His creatures. Satan&rsquo;s death damaged the oneness of God&rsquo;s creation, but God&rsquo;s life recovers the oneness of resurrection. Where there is no life of God, there is death. Death is the absence of oneness. However, the presence of God&rsquo;s life is resurrection. Resurrection equals oneness. Therefore, where God&rsquo;s life is, there is the oneness.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S WORK TO RECOVER<br />
THE ONENESS IN THE UNIVERSE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Ephesians 1:10, 22; 4:13</h1>
<h2 class="head3">Satan Damaging the Oneness of God&rsquo;s Creation through Death</h2>
<p>The oneness of God&rsquo;s creation was damaged by Satan. Satan damaged the element of oneness by introducing death into all creation. Death had three spiritual consequences. First, it severed the Creator&rsquo;s relationship with the creation; second, it caused the creation to lose its original function with respect to the Creator; and third, it caused the creation to be corrupted and abandoned. Nevertheless, God is now recovering us with His life so that we may be joined to Him. He is recovering our function toward God, and He is recovering God&rsquo;s life, which is indestructible, incorruptible, and unchangeable.</p>
<p>When all things were separated from God, the oneness of God&rsquo;s creation was lost. The center of the universe is God Himself. Hence, the oneness of the universe is also God Himself. Once the created universe lost God and its relationship with God was severed, it lost its center. Colossians 1:20 says, &ldquo;Having made peace through the blood of His cross.&rdquo; Peace in this verse does not merely refer to sinners being reconciled to God but also to a restoration of the relationship between the universe and God, in which there is no separation from God. Through the blood of Christ, God and the universe are in one accord and in harmony. This harmony is the great oneness of the universe. However, when Satan introduced death into the universe, the universe was separated from God, and the one accord and the oneness were lost. Thus, there is not full harmony. Wars being fought among the nations and people killing one another demonstrate the lack of harmony and oneness among men. Even the fact that mosquitoes bite people shows that there is no oneness in the universe. The universe has lost its oneness because it has been separated from God, the source of oneness. Peace and harmony can be found only in God.</p>
<p>The disharmony in the universe will continue until the restoration of all things, that is, until the coming of the millennial kingdom. Romans 8:19 says that the creation is anxiously watching, eagerly awaiting the revelation of the sons of God. The revelation of the sons of God will occur when the sons of God reach maturity. In the restoration of all things, vipers will not hurt people, and lions will not bite or harm people. This is the condition of the kingdom as depicted in Isaiah 11:6-8: &ldquo;The wolf will dwell with the lamb; / And the leopard will lie down with the kid, / And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; / ...The nursing child will play by the cobra&rsquo;s hole, / And upon the viper&rsquo;s den / The weaned child will stretch his hand.&rdquo; On that day all things in the universe will be in harmony. Men will not war any longer, and all the weapons of war will be changed in their nature (2:4). Furthermore, at that time &ldquo;the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, / And the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days&rdquo; (30:26). The Jews and the Gentiles will minister to the one God and be in complete harmony (56:6). Isaiah presents a thorough description of the harmonious situation that will occur upon the restoration of all things in the future. God is working continuously until the day when all matters, things, men, and God will be in one accord.</p>
<p>The situation in the restoration and the issue produced from death are totally contrary. When death entered, all things lost the oneness and entered into darkness. If we do not have light in a meeting, we will fall into darkness and confusion. Death brings in darkness, and darkness brings in confusion. If there is a condition of confusion among the brothers and sisters, we know that they are in darkness and lack life. On the contrary, life brings in light, and light brings in oneness. In the restoration of all things, everything will be in the light, and all things will be in harmony with one another. At that time, &ldquo;They will not harm nor destroy / In all My holy mountain, / For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah, / As water covers the sea&rdquo; (11:9). Harmony results from the knowledge of Jehovah. The knowledge of Jehovah is light. Today, however, in the universe there is no harmony, because all things have been separated from their Creator and have fallen into death.</p><h2 class="head3">God Recovering the Oneness by Life</h2>
<p>The oneness in God&rsquo;s creation is according to His power. By His power God caused all things to function in a normal relationship with Him. Because of their relationship and function toward God under the power of His creation, all things were in harmony and the universe was one. Then Satan rebelled and brought death into the universe. Once rebellion and death entered all things, the oneness was lost, and all things entered into a state of discord. Today people disobey God, and those who are in lower positions disobey and even oppose those who are above them. Although God upholds all things by His power, the oneness has been broken; therefore, God must come in to recover the oneness by His life, not by His power.</p>
<p>God begins this work of recovery in the church. By His life He is recovering oneness in the church, and He will eventually recover oneness among all things. Formerly, we were dead in offenses and sins, alienated from the life of God, and were enemies of God, but God&rsquo;s mercy reached us (Eph. 2:1-4). Through the redemption of the cross and through our believing, God forgave us of our sins and imparted His life into us. Once God&rsquo;s life entered into us, we were joined to Him, not only recovering our relationship with God as our Creator but also entering into union with Him in His life. Thus, our function toward God, for which we were created, has been recovered. This function enables us to rule for God, to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose, to fulfill God&rsquo;s will, and to live out God Himself. The corruption that was brought in through death is altogether swallowed up by life. There is now complete harmony and one accord in our relationship with God. This is the oneness God desires to recover.</p>
<p>In our experience, whether or not we arrive at the oneness that God desires, depends upon our arriving at the full knowledge of the Son of God. Ephesians 4:13 says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; For us to arrive at the oneness is for us to arrive at the full-grown Christ and to allow the fullness of Christ to be manifested among us. Whenever we are short of Christ, we are short of the oneness, and whenever we lack the element of Christ, we are in disharmony. Life brings in light; and light, which is the knowledge of the Son of God, issues in harmony and oneness.</p>
<p>Today is not the time for God to deal with all things; rather, now is the time for God to deal with the church. God must deal with the church; otherwise, there will be no way for all things to become one. God&rsquo;s dealing begins with the church as the firstfruits among all things. In order to carry out His complete work of restoration, He must first carry out His work of recovering the oneness of the church. This is the work of recovery, and it is carried out by God&rsquo;s life, not by God&rsquo;s methods, power, or acts; it is altogether a matter of life.</p>
<p>The condition of oneness expressed through the church, depends upon the degree to which the church possesses God&rsquo;s life in Christ. Oneness does not come from talking but from growth. If we do not allow God&rsquo;s life to grow in us, no matter how much we desire to be one with the brothers and sisters, we will not be able to be one. The only way to recover the oneness of the church is by life. This oneness is in the fellowship. Our fellowship is not based on having the same mind or sharing the same view; rather, it is altogether based on life. The fellowship is life.</p>
<p>Satan brought death into all things, causing all things to be separated from God. However, God has come into us as life, causing us to be joined to Him. Whenever we touch life, we enter into God more deeply and are one with those in life. Hence, when life comes in, it brings in oneness. Oneness is simply life. Where there is life, there is oneness, and where there is oneness, there is the Head. When life comes, the Head also comes; when the Head comes, oneness comes as well. If we do not have much experience of being in life, we will not have much experience of being under the authority of the Head. All things not under the Head are in discord and death.</p><h2 class="head3">The Sequence of God&rsquo;s Recovery<br />
of the Oneness</h2>
<p>God must first work in the church until the church is full of life inwardly and is entirely subject to the Head. Then the church will be one and will arrive at the oneness (v. 13). After God has worked thoroughly in the church, the restoration of all things will begin. God&rsquo;s work begins with the church and then spreads outward, passing through the church to all things. The church arrives at the oneness through the church&rsquo;s arriving at the full knowledge of the Son of God. All things will be enlightened by the light that shines out through the oneness of the church, all will know Jehovah in the light of the oneness of the church (cf. Isa. 11:9), and all will be brought under the Head to arrive at the oneness.</p>
<p>Acts 3:21 speaks of the &ldquo;restoration of all things,&rdquo; and Romans 8:21-22 says, &ldquo;In hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now.&rdquo; These two verses indicate that the restoration of all things will occur when the children of God enjoy the freedom of glory, that is, when God has completed His work in the church. Through the completion of His work in the church, God will bring the church completely into glory so that she may be delivered from the old creation and fully enter into the new creation. At that time, the church will be completely in oneness without any discord, fully in glory, and entirely God&rsquo;s new creation. All things will be in life, oneness, and glory.</p>
<p>The creation is anxiously watching and eagerly awaiting the coming of the day of the manifestation of the sons of God. God, however, seems to be saying to the creation, &ldquo;You must first wait until I have thoroughly completed my work in the church, and then I will work in you.&rdquo; James 1:18 says that God&rsquo;s purpose is that &ldquo;we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.&rdquo; To be the firstfruits is an inward matter related to life. The church is the firstfruits because God&rsquo;s life reaches and works in the believers in order that they may be the first to mature. The issue of this maturity is the church arriving at the one accord, the oneness. Wherever God&rsquo;s life flows, death is swallowed up. The opposite of life is death. Only life can swallow up death. God&rsquo;s life entering into us can be compared to an injection that first operates in us and then in others, causing us to be the firstfruits in life among all things. Once we fully mature and enter into glory, God will carry out the restoration of all things.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s life works to head up all things. This heading up is practical in our experience. In the church service, at times different opinions may arise, all may insist on their own view, and some may be subjective. This indicates that we are not headed up. However, once God&rsquo;s life comes into a situation, light shines, grace comes, and in the light we condemn ourselves. We not only stop arguing, but the disharmony in us also vanishes. In the end the church receives a great supply. Not only are the serving ones brought into harmony, but under this shining all the brothers and sisters will arrive at the oneness.</p>
<p>If those serving in coordination are not willing to receive the Lord&rsquo;s shining, but instead receive Satan&rsquo;s death, the entire church will be in darkness. As a result, the brothers and sisters will speak different things, and the church will be in chaos, having neither the Head nor the oneness. This means that darkness and the devil are reigning and that lies have been enthroned. We must have a clear vision that life comes from the Head. Once life comes, light is produced; once light functions, men are brought into oneness and headed up.</p>
<p>In Revelation 22, when the New Jerusalem is manifested, the throne of God is in its midst, and from the throne of God proceeds a river of water of life with the tree of life along both sides of the river. The river of water of life with the tree of life is winding in the New Jerusalem. This river is a sign of the water of life operating in us. All that is expressed in the New Jerusalem comes from the life within us. In the New Jerusalem the throne of God is the center, there is no discord, and everything is in oneness. The city is a ripened fruit. In chapter 21 we see that God placed the city in the center of the new universe so that the nations might walk by its light (v. 24). Without the city, the nations would be in darkness. Being in darkness is equivalent to being in death. Darkness is always a sign of death; moreover, being in death is to be void of oneness.</p>
<p>When the nations walk by the light of the New Jerusalem, all things are one in the light of the city. Isaiah 2:5 says, &ldquo;House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah,&rdquo; and 11:9 says, &ldquo;The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah.&rdquo; The knowledge of Jehovah is light, and light brings everyone into oneness.</p>
<p>If the brothers and sisters are not in one accord, not in oneness, and not headed up in the workers&rsquo; homes, death will be there. The meaning of death is to be severed from Christ and from the authority of God and to fall into darkness. If a brother has life operating in him, is under the throne of God, and has the river of life with the water of life and the tree of life continually flowing in him, he will be nourished and shining. He will be subject to the authority of God and will not have any discord with God. He will be as the New Jerusalem, which is of pure gold without any mixture, he will be absolutely one with God, and he will be full of Christ. As a result of this brother&rsquo;s presence in the workers&rsquo; home, the light of life will shine forth and enlighten the entire home, enabling others to walk by his light. The light of life from within him will dispel the darkness in the workers&rsquo; home, and the power of life within him will swallow up any death. Even if the brothers have opinions and are fleshly, and the sisters are not in harmony because of their tempers, this one brother&rsquo;s presence will be as the shining of the New Jerusalem and will eliminate all the quarrels and disharmony. The flesh will not be able to operate, and tempers will not flare up. As a result of his shining, the entire workers&rsquo; home will walk in the light. Darkness will be dispelled, and death will be swallowed up. Everyone will be in one accord and headed up. This is how God works to produce firstfruits in the workers&rsquo; home and to bring the entire home into the light.</p>
<p>Today all things are in darkness, death, and discord, but God has chosen the church from among all things, set the church apart, and infused His life into the church. Today this life is flowing in the church, bringing God&rsquo;s authority, that is, the throne of God, into the church. When life has completely finished its work in the church, the church will be the New Jerusalem. God&rsquo;s light will then shine forth through the New Jerusalem, bringing all things into the light. At that time darkness will be dispelled and death will have no place. Revelation 21:24 says, &ldquo;The nations will walk by its light.&rdquo; The life of God is in the church and shines forth from the church. Eventually, all things will walk by the light of life which the church has received; however, the universe itself will not receive the life of God. Today in the church, the condition of some brothers and sisters may be compared to the center of the new universe, the New Jerusalem, which shines forth the life of God, but the condition of others may be compared to the surrounding nations, which receive the shining and influence of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>When the life of the Head is fully manifested in the church, all things will be headed up (Eph. 1:10). When God completely finishes His work in the church, it will be the New Jerusalem, a transparent city. All the gold in the New Jerusalem is transparent, transmitting the effulgence of God, so that by its light all things may arrive at the oneness. The light effaces death in all things and heads up all things. The city diffuses the light, shining upon the nations, and the glory of the nations is brought back to the city (Rev. 21:24). Hence, the carrying out of God&rsquo;s purpose in heading up all things depends entirely upon the church.</p>
<p>We should not believe those who say that the Lord Jesus will come tomorrow and rapture us. For the past one hundred years, many people have said repeatedly that the Lord is coming and that we will be raptured. We do believe in the Lord&rsquo;s coming and in the rapture, but the crucial point is that the church is not yet mature. We do not need to preach the truth regarding rapture and the Lord&rsquo;s coming, but we do need to preach the truth regarding the believers&rsquo; need to be mature in life. Today the church is still very immature. The harvest has not yet ripened and is not ready for the Lord to reap. Hence, all things cannot yet be restored. I encourage those who study prophecies to put the prophecies aside and to focus on maturing in life. Everything hinges on whether or not God&rsquo;s children mature in life.</p>
<p>The fullness of the times spoken of in Ephesians 1:10 is not something we can discover through calculation but is something that can be attained only when the church reaches maturity. If the church does not mature for another thousand years, the fullness of the times will take another thousand years to be fulfilled. Hence, every one of us in the church are responsible for allowing the Lord to work and shine in us and to be diffused through us. If those who serve together in the church cannot be headed up, we should not expect the entire universe to be headed up. This would be impossible. For us to be mature in life, we must let the cross break us, provide God the opportunity to deal with us, and allow Christ&rsquo;s life to have the ground in us. Only when Christ is able to diffuse Himself out through us are we mature. In that day the nations and all things will walk by our light and be brought under the authority of God through our shining. At that time, all things will be headed up in Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<h1 class="title">CHRIST RECOVERING THE ONENESS<br />
BY LIFE THROUGH THE CHURCH<br />
AND FOR THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:22; Heb. 2:8-10</h1>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 reveals that God is heading up all things in Christ. God is accomplishing the heading up of all things by His life and through the church. His life is working and operating in the church to the extent that it will shine forth from the church as light to all things; all the nations will walk by its light (Rev. 21:24), and all things will be headed up in the light.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Satan Damaging the Oneness by Death,<br />
and Christ Recovering the Oneness by Life</h2>
<p>Satan damaged the oneness in creation by death. When death came in, it brought in darkness, and darkness brought all things into confusion. In contrast, God&rsquo;s recovery is through Christ&rsquo;s life. Life brings in light, and light brings all things into oneness. The following is a simple chart showing the damage caused by Satan and the recovery carried out by Christ:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0736330127_06.gif" width="326" height="45" alt="" /></p>
<p>All things are in confusion because Satan brought in death, and death brought all things into darkness; hence, the oneness in creation was damaged. Death carries out a passive work of separation, causing all things to be alienated from God as the center; whereas, darkness carries out an active work of confusion, bringing all things into a chaotic situation. When darkness enters, it causes all things to lose their proper direction and stray from the proper way. For a person to move about on the earth, the way, or road, he takes is important, and even the order of a city is reflected mainly in its roads. However, if there is no light in a city at night, people will not be able to see the roads clearly, and cars might hit electric poles and pedestrians. Hence, the lights in a city maintain the order, harmony, and oneness.</p>
<p>Darkness causes all things to reverse their order and to lose their proper position. When darkness comes, it causes man to lose his position and bearings. For example, if there were no light in our meeting hall, we would need to grope about in the darkness in order to find our seats. However, we are able to sit in an orderly way because the meeting hall has light. Darkness prevents matters from being carried out according to the proper arrangement and order. As long as a person, matter, or thing is in darkness, it is in a state of confusion. The principle is the same in the church. In order for all things to be in oneness rather than confusion, all persons and all matters, whether great or small, need to be headed up under the same administration. Oneness is brought in through light. Without light, all people, matters, and things lose their order and are in chaos.</p>
<p>The principle that life brings in light and light brings in oneness is consistent. We must not receive this merely as a doctrine. We must allow Christ&rsquo;s life to operate in the church to the extent that it shines forth from the church to all things so that all things may be headed up in the light. If the saints are not in oneness when they gather together, it indicates that there is no light among them and that they are in darkness. Death brings in darkness, and the issue of darkness is confusion. In our service, if we do not have a clear and definite way and if our position is not accurate and proper, then darkness, the shadow of death, is still within us. The confusion brought in by darkness can vary in degree. We may be eighty-five percent in light and fifteen percent in darkness, but even with so much light, there is still the shadow of the factor of death.</p>
<p>For example, several sisters may have been touched by the sense of life to consecrate themselves, but they may be unwilling to do so and instead keep asking others for their advice. The result of their asking only brings in more confusion and darkness. If one of these sisters would obey the sense of life and consecrate herself to the Lord, His life would shine out from within her. She would even become a light among the sisters. Whenever she would open her mouth, the other sisters would receive the shining.</p><h2 class="head4">Life Operating Within and Light Shining Without</h2>
<p>The picture in Revelation 22 clearly reveals that there is a throne out from which proceeds a river of water of life in the New Jerusalem (v. 1). The New Jerusalem presents a picture of the life of God operating in us. The result of the operation of the river of water of life is the shining forth of light from within the city. The Lord is life (John 11:25), and the Lord is also light (1 John 1:5). According to the Gospel of John, the entrance of God&rsquo;s life into us and its operation in us, brings in the light of life (8:12). In the New Jerusalem the river of water of life in the middle of the street flows downward as a spiral, as indicated by the one river and one street that passes through all twelve gates. In the city the river of water of life is continually flowing as a spiral; this is a portrait of the operation of Christ&rsquo;s life in us.</p>
<p>The outward expression of the city is the shining of light, and the inner content of the city is the flow of life. This may be likened to an electric lamp, which has the outward shining of light and the inward flow of electricity. This indicates that by the inward flow of life there is an outward shining of light. This light brings us into oneness. If Christ as life is not able to shine forth from the church to be the light of the nations, all the things of creation will have no way to be headed up in Him. When the nations walk by the light of the city, there will be no harm to men and no damage to things. At that time the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah (Isa. 11:9), and all things will be headed up in Christ (Eph. 1:10).</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that God does not enlighten all things directly from heaven; instead, God puts Himself into a vessel and shines forth through the vessel. This vessel, a corporate vessel, is the church. God imparts Himself into the church as His corporate vessel. If the church allows God to move freely, it will be able to shine forth God. The shining will then become the light to all things. On the contrary, Satan, the source of death, brought the element of death into all things. When death enters, there is darkness, and darkness brings everything into confusion. Hence, God needs to do a work of recovery.</p>
<p>God is the source of life; therefore, He recovers the oneness of the universe by entering into man to be man&rsquo;s life. First, He became a man, a part of &ldquo;all things. &rdquo; Then He put His life into people, the church, and works in them so that they can shine Him forth as light to all things so that all things can walk in the light. Through the shining, all things will be in one accord and will be headed up in Christ. Hence, the condition of oneness in the universe is altogether related to life and death, light and darkness.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Light of Life Making Us One</h2>
<p>Many books and newspapers offer various kinds of opinions and theories concerning human life. However, in the end we must confess that man is in darkness and that the human race is in confusion without oneness. Hence, when we read human philosophy, we sense that the writers are speaking and groping about in darkness. They do not know about man&rsquo;s source, current situation, or destiny, much less the meaning of human life. Some of them incline toward Socrates&rsquo;s understanding, and others lean toward Rousseau&rsquo;s understanding. Each has his own explanation, and as a result the situation on earth is truly confusing, causing people to be perplexed. This confused situation can be cleared up only by God&rsquo;s life shining forth through the church and enabling people to see the light. In this light all the different kinds of teachings, views, and human philosophies are done away with, and people are able to arrive at the oneness in the light.</p>
<p>Before we were saved, we had different views of life. Some of us were professors, civil servants, soldiers, or businessmen, and in our different professions we all had different views of life; consequently, when we come together and are polite, we are able to get along with one another. In contrast, when we are not polite, we fight with one another. We do not respect and approve of one another. However, it is wonderful that despite our different careers and backgrounds, whenever we walk in the light of Jehovah, we are one in our speaking and views.</p>
<p>In our humanity, our views of life are as different as heaven and earth. We do not agree with what other people think is right, and other people do not approve of what we consider to be good. However, we are not only in one accord; we are also one, having no differences. The thing that makes us one is not doctrine, religion, or the teachings of the Bible; rather, it is the life of God that has entered into us. When this life shines forth from within us, it enlightens others and causes them to be headed up. Thus, apart from the life of God, there is nothing that can cause all things to be one.</p>
<p>This principle can be applied to the unbelievers, to Christians, and to the Lord&rsquo;s workers, and even to all things. In order for the co-workers to be in one accord, they must allow the life of God, that is, the Spirit of the living God, to operate in them rather than simply agreeing on the same doctrines, beliefs, and understanding of the Bible. The degree to which we experience His operating determines the degree of the shining and the oneness we possess. If we are enlightened with the full knowledge of the Son of God (Eph. 4:13), we can be brought into oneness under the shining of this light.</p>
<p>God is the center of everything. He is life and light. Presently, all things are scattered and disintegrated because they are separated from Him. Death has damaged the oneness of all things, causing all things to be separated from the Head, the Creator, who is the center. The way of God&rsquo;s salvation is for Him, the center, the Head, and the source to enter into created man to be man&rsquo;s life. Whenever God&rsquo;s life flows in man, His light is able to shine forth. When the light shines on a person, he becomes joined to the Head. Just as an electric current flows in an electric lamp in order for the light to shine forth, God as light is continually shining forth and bringing man under His authority so that man may have a union with God as the source, the Head, and the center. In this way God heads up all things in Christ through the church.</p><h2 class="head3">All Things Being Headed Up<br />
through the Church and for the Church</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 says, &ldquo;Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; We need the Holy Spirit to show us the real significance of this word. As we learn to live in God&rsquo;s life and gain a certain amount of knowledge regarding the church, the Holy Spirit will reveal to us that God needs a group of people who live in His life and allow His life to shine forth from them in order to bring all things into the light of life to be headed up in Christ. Even though God&rsquo;s life is in us, if the light of life cannot be diffused out from us, we can never arrive at the oneness. All the brothers and sisters may be orderly and in one accord when we gather in a meeting hall, but if the lights were to suddenly go out, we would immediately be in darkness, and there would be cries and chaos. If the light were restored, however, everyone would immediately be quiet, and the situation would become orderly again. In like manner, when the life of the Head passes through the church, His Body, and reaches all things, all things become headed up in Christ. Where there is the life of the Head, there is the authority of the Head and also oneness.</p>
<p>The heading up in Ephesians 1:10 refers to all things, and arriving at the oneness in 4:13 refers to the church. The church arrives at the oneness, and then all things are headed up. When the church arrives at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, all things will be headed up, the church will become a transparent church, and the light of life within the church will be fully diffused. The light that is diffused shines on all things in order that all things may be in the light. In this way, all things are headed up.</p>
<p>Romans 8 shows that the church has not yet arrived at the oneness, because the sons of God have not yet entered into glory. All things are still subject to vanity and are groaning and travailing due to the slavery of corruption (vv. 20-22). Their being subject to vanity proves that all things are not in oneness. However, when the sons of God enter into the freedom of glory, there will be harmony without any struggle, friction, slavery, vanity, corruption, groaning, or travailing. This will be the genuine oneness. Moreover, when the New Jerusalem is expressed, the life within her will shine forth, and the nations will walk by her light (Rev. 21:24). At that time, no one will go astray, walk on the wrong way, or stand on the wrong position. Everyone will be in his own position, walk on the proper way, and be absolutely one. All things will be headed up and in oneness.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 implies that God heads up all things through the church. Verse 22 says that God subjected all things under Christ&rsquo;s feet and gave Christ &ldquo;to be Head over all things to the church.&rdquo; Verse 10 reveals the means: through the church Christ is the Head over all things. Verse 22 presents the aim: Christ is the Head over all things to the church. <em>Through</em> indicates the means, and <em>to</em> indicates the aim. On the one hand, without the church Christ cannot be the Head over all things. It is through the church by means of the church, and because of the church that Christ can be Head over all things. On the other hand, Christ is the Head over all things to the church. In verse 10 first there is the church and then the heading up. It is through the church that Christ can be the Head over all things. Verse 22, however, speaks of the heading up and then of the church. Christ is the Head over all things to the church. Christ heads up all things through the church and to the church. The church is both the means and the aim of Christ&rsquo;s heading up of all things.</p>
<p>God Himself is the life of the church. God&rsquo;s life operates in the church and shines forth from the church to be light to the nations; this is how He heads up all things. Hence, the heading up of all things is through the church. In order to understand the meaning of <em>to the church,</em> we must read verses 22 and 23. Verse 22 says that God subjected all things under Christ&rsquo;s feet, and verse 23 says that the church is &ldquo;His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; These two verses speak of all things being subjected under Christ&rsquo;s feet and Christ filling all things. If the church was merely the means for God to head up all things, the church would simply be a vessel used by God. The church would be just like a bottle in the kitchen; when we use the bottle, we do not need to take care of its feeling. However, the church is not merely a vessel but the Body. When we take care of our physical body, we need to pay attention to the feeling of our body. However, as far as a bottle is concerned, it does not matter where we place it. A bottle has no feeling regarding where it is stored. However, we always take care of our body&rsquo;s enjoyment, comfort, feeling, and sensation.</p>
<p>When the Head governs all things, the Body also governs all things. When all things are subject to the authority of the Head, they are also subject to the authority of the Body. In Revelation the Lord said, &ldquo;He who overcomes...to him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod,...as I also have received from My Father&rdquo; (2:26-27). Revelation 20:4 says, &ldquo;They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.&rdquo; Matthew 19:28 says, &ldquo;You who have followed Me, in the restoration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones.&rdquo; He is the Head of all things to His Body; He has subjected all things under His feet to the church. When He was glorified, the church was also glorified; when He was enthroned, the church was also enthroned; when He reigns, the church also reigns; when He governs all things, the church also governs all things.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s heading up of the church is the means. On the other hand, the church as a living Body with feeling and enjoyment is the aim. Christ subjected all things under the feet of the church so that the church might rule over the universe with Christ. Thus, the church will receive the glory and exaltation that Christ has received and enjoy the result of His work.</p><h2 class="head4">Walking Worthily of the King of Glory</h2>
<p>The church is not merely a vessel but the Body of Christ. However, the present condition of the church does not match this reality. Although we have a royal status, our condition is altogether improper. Psalm 45:13 says, &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s daughter is all glorious within the royal abode; her garment is a woven work inwrought with gold.&rdquo; Our Head is the king, and the church is &ldquo;the king&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo; Being the king&rsquo;s daughter implies that she belongs to the king and that she is of the royal family, having a royal status. A queen, the wife of a king, is also the daughter of a king. The king governs nations and the queen matches him. Her conduct and behavior must match the king&rsquo;s position of governing the nation. A king might say to his queen, &ldquo;I govern the nation for you, and I head up the nation to you.&rdquo; The church is not merely the vessel of the Head but also the Body of the Head.</p>
<p>Today our situation, condition, behavior, and actions do not match our King. All things have not been subjected under our feet, and we do not exercise much authority. We have a royal status, but our condition can be compared to that of a beggar. Christ the Head is gold, yet the church as the Body is seemingly clay. We do not match the Head, and we do not resemble a royal priesthood. When we shop at the market, we lose our royal status because we quibble over a small amount of money. We must realize that we are members of a royal family and that we have a royal status.</p>
<h2 class="head4">God Leading Many Sons into Glory</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:22 says that God subjected all things under Christ&rsquo;s feet. This seems to indicate that everything has already been subjected to Him. However, Hebrews 2:8 says, &ldquo;But now we do not yet see all things subjected to Him.&rdquo; In Ephesians 1 God caused His power to operate in Christ to raise Him to the heavenlies, to seat Him at His right hand, and to subject all things under His feet. Yet in Hebrews 2:10 we do not yet see all things subjected to Him because He must first lead many sons into glory. The reason that all things are not subjected to Him is that we have not yet entered into glory. The sons of God have not yet entered into the freedom of glory; thus, the light of God still is unable to shine forth to all things. Hence, all things are still groaning and travailing in pain, are not in harmony, and are not subjected to the authority of the Head (Rom. 8:21-22). In other words, the bride has not yet made herself ready (cf. 19:7; Rev. 21:2).</p>
<p>The bride is the city in Revelation; she is the Body of Christ. When she is adorned and has the glory that should be hers, the sons of God will have entered into glory, and all things will be subjected under Christ&rsquo;s feet. Hence, all things are subject to the Head through us and to us. The Head will shine forth through us, and we will reign with the Head. However, at present we are still not ready. Although we are sons of the Lord of hosts and are of a royal family, our daily living, walk, and behavior do not match the glory of God. This is not a matter of knowledge or doctrine; rather, this is a matter related to even the smallest things in our living.</p>
<p>We should not be satisfied merely with our royal status; instead, we should allow Christ&rsquo;s life to work in us and allow Him to fully reign in us. Brother Lawrence is an example of a person who was weighty and noble when people contacted him, despite the fact that he was a cook. In the Old Testament, when Pharaoh stood before Joseph, he felt that he was lower than Joseph (Gen. 41:38-42). Later when the king of Babylon stood before Daniel, he felt inferior to Daniel, because Daniel possessed something that he did not have (Dan. 2:47-48). Both Daniel and Joseph were on the throne. In Egypt God reigned through Joseph and to Joseph, and in Babylon God reigned through Daniel and to Daniel. Through them God was able to subject all things under the authority of the Head, and they were able to enjoy the glory of reigning with the Head.</p>
<p>In like manner, when the children of Israel returned from captivity, God&rsquo;s authority prospered among His desolated people through Nehemiah and to Nehemiah (Neh. 2:3-8). Whenever we allow the glorious life of Christ to live out from us and God&rsquo;s light to shine forth from us, God will cause people to turn to Him through us and to us. The matured Jacob in his senior years was such a person. When Jacob stood before Pharaoh of Egypt, he was more noble than Pharaoh; thus, Jacob blessed Pharaoh (Gen. 47:7). When Jacob was young, he was not an important person. He only knew how to cause trouble. Later when he was old, God was able to be expressed and to reign over Egypt through him. At that time Jacob caused all things to be subject to the authority of the Head, and he enjoyed the glory with the Head.</p>
<p>All things are subjected under the feet of Christ, the Head, through the church and to the church. When the sons of God are brought into glory, God will be the glory and the enjoyment of the church. In principle, this is our condition today; we can cause all things to be subject to Him and can enjoy with Him the heading up of all things. For this, we must first allow God to bring us into glory. In order to receive the grace of God, we need to grasp the secret that we will all enter into glory. For us to provide the way for all things to be subject to the Head and for us to enjoy the heading up of all things together with the Head, we must allow God to bring us into glory.</p>
<p>Presently we are not able see all things subject to Him, because the sons of God have not yet entered into glory. When the church is in glory, all things will be subject under the church. When the church allows God to live out from within, everything will be to the church. When the church practically expresses God, everything will be under the feet of the Head and under the church. He is the Head over all things to His Body&mdash;the church. The heading up of all things to the church is the purpose that God desires to accomplish, and it is the goal to which the church will ultimately attain.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="title">EVE AND REBEKAH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TYPES OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>When we speak of the types of the church, we need to start from the very beginning of the Bible. In the Old Testament, God arranged a number of persons, matters, and things to be types of the church in order to explain the history, the process, and the different aspects of the church in the New Testament. In the Old Testament, God did not explicitly speak of the church. Hence, the church was hidden. God, however, arranged certain persons and established certain matters and things to portray and typify the various aspects of the church in a detailed way.</p>
<p>In the age of the Old Testament people did not know the meaning of the types, but in the age of the New Testament the Holy Spirit reveals the significance of these types. The types of the church as revealed in the Old Testament make it easier for us to know the various aspects of the church. When we speak concerning the church, we must not overlook the types in the Old Testament. The Old Testament can be likened to a picture, and the New Testament, to a written explanation. What is not clearly understood by the picture can be made clear by the words of the explanation. Likewise, what is difficult to explain in written words can be easily understood in the picture.</p>
<p>The types in the Old Testament can be likened to the pictures in an elementary school textbook that visually illustrate what has been written. An elementary school textbook has not only text but also pictures. By comparing the words and the pictures, the point being conveyed becomes clear. The many types in the Old Testament depict various aspects of the church that are not explicitly spoken of in the New Testament. When we read passages related to the types, we must not be too fast, because a single line in the picture may convey much meaning. Those who pursue to know the church must know the types in the Old Testament concerning the church.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the types of the church fall into two general categories: first, women, revealing that the church is a counterpart, which focuses on the church&rsquo;s life and position; second, the city, the tabernacle, or the temple, revealing that the church is a dwelling place, which focuses on the church&rsquo;s function.</p>
<p>According to type, the position of the church before God is that of a counterpart. God&rsquo;s counterpart has the position of a woman who matches a man. In the entire Bible God likens Himself to a man, and He likens the totality of His created and redeemed people to a woman as His counterpart. The purpose of God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages, whether in creation or redemption, is to produce a corporate woman. At the end of the Bible, at the completion of God&rsquo;s work, a bride is produced&mdash;the holy city New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the corporate woman whom God desires. It is composed of God&rsquo;s created and redeemed people as the consummation and aggregate of the church.</p>
<p>The New Testament reveals that Christ came to the earth seeking a group of people to redeem to be His bride. When the Lord Jesus was working for God on the earth, John the Baptist introduced Him with two titles: <em>the Lamb of God</em> (John 1:29) and <em>the bridegroom</em> (3:29). Hence, the Lord Jesus came to the earth not only to take away the sin of the world but also to gain a group of people to be His counterpart. When the Lord was on the earth, He referred to Himself as a bridegroom (Matt. 9:15) who desires to marry a bride. In his Epistles Paul says clearly that he betrothed the church as a pure virgin to Christ (2 Cor. 11:2). A betrothal refers to an engagement. Revelation 19:7 reveals the marriage of the Lamb. The phrase <em>marriage of the Lamb</em> connects both titles that John the Baptist used for the Lord Jesus, revealing that the Lamb is the Bridegroom. The bride whom Christ will marry is the totality of His redeemed from all the ages, that is, the church. Hence, according to typology, the church always stands in the position of a woman. In the Old Testament the church is often typified by women.</p><h2 class="head2">Eve&mdash;Typifying the Producing of the Church<br />
and the Nature of the Church</h2>
<p>Eve is a type of the producing of the church and the nature of the church (Gen. 2:18-24; Eph. 5:31-32). Every woman in the Old Testament who typifies the church has her own particular characteristics. Eve typifies the church with an emphasis on the producing of the church and the nature of the church, illustrating how the church is produced, what the origin of the church is, and how the church comes into being. Without Eve as a type of the church, it would be difficult to see clearly how the church is produced. The picture of Eve enables us to have an accurate understanding of the producing of the church. If we read the explanation in the New Testament and compare it to the picture in the Old Testament, we will have a clear view and an accurate conclusion regarding the producing of the church, and it will be easy to know the nature of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Background</h2>
<h2 class="head4">It Not Being Good for Adam to Be Alone&mdash;<br />
Implying that It Was Not Good for God<br />
to Be Alone in the Universe</h2>
<p>The background related to the producing of Eve reveals the background related to the producing of the church. Before God created Eve for Adam, He said, &ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone&rdquo; (Gen. 2:18), meaning that it was not good for Adam to be alone. In its spiritual significance, this word reflects the feeling of God toward Himself. The man, Adam, symbolizes the God of the universe. For God to say that it was not good for Adam to be alone indicates that God felt that it was not good for Himself to be alone; thus, He needed to create a counterpart for Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Adam Being Unable to Find a Counterpart&mdash;<br />
Implying that God Was Unable to Find Someone<br />
in the Universe to Match Him</h2>
<p>Before God created a counterpart for Adam, He brought all kinds of living animals before Adam. Adam named them one by one, but he was not able to find a counterpart to match him (vv. 19-20). Adam could not find his counterpart out of all the living animals. This signifies that God could not find anything to match Him out of all the created things. The word <em>match</em> means that the two parties must be similar. Among so many living animals, Adam was unable to find one who matched him. This implies that among all the created things, God was not able to find anyone who could match Him and be His counterpart.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Producing of the Church</h2>
<h2 class="head4">Incarnation</h2>
<p>Adam could not find his counterpart among all the things. Then God caused a deep sleep to fall upon him. When he was asleep, God opened his side and took one of his ribs (v. 21). Adam signifies the incarnated Son of Man, God who became man. Romans 5:14 speaks of Adam as &ldquo;a type of Him who was to come.&rdquo; Adam is a picture of the One who was to come&mdash;Christ. Adam not only is a type of Christ as the Head over all things but also as God who became man.</p>
<p>The producing of the church began with incarnation. Without God becoming man, the church could not have been produced. God became a man in order to produce the church. Adam had to be created first, and then Eve could be produced. Although Christ existed before the creation of the world, in eternity past He had not yet become a man. In order to produce the church, it was necessary that Christ come to be Adam, a man; that is, it was necessary for the Creator to become a creature in order to produce the church. The church possesses a dual nature&mdash;both divinity and humanity; thus, divinity alone cannot produce the church. To produce the church, it was necessary for God to become a man.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Passing through Death</h2>
<p>God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam (Gen. 2:21), which typifies Christ&rsquo;s passing through death on the cross. When Christ was dying on the cross, His side was opened, and out came blood and water (John 19:34). When Adam fell into a deep sleep, God took one of Adam&rsquo;s ribs from his side. In the Bible bone signifies a life of strength. The water that flowed out from the Lord Jesus&rsquo; side while He was on the cross also signifies life. This life is the Spirit of life, the pneumatic life, which is also typified by the living water flowing out of the smitten rock in the Old Testament (Exo. 17:6).</p>
<p>In John 4:14 the Lord said, &ldquo;Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.&rdquo; The Lord also said, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive&rdquo; (7:37-39). Then Revelation 22:1 speaks of the river of water of life. Hence, water denotes both life and the Spirit of life. When Christ died on the cross, His side was opened, and water flowed out; that is, the Spirit of life flowed out from Him. The opening of Christ&rsquo;s side is typified in Exodus 17 by the rock being smitten and water flowing out. Thus, the water that flowed out from Christ&rsquo;s side and the rib that was taken from Adam&rsquo;s side both refer to the same matter.</p>
<p>When Christ died on the cross, not only water flowed out from His side, but blood also flowed out from His side. Because of the problem of sin, man needed the redemption of the blood. However, when Eve was produced from Adam, there was no problem of sin, and thus there was no need for redemption. It was sufficient to take a rib from Adam&rsquo;s side to produce Eve. However, when Christ produced the church, there was the need not only for producing but also for redemption. Hence, His side was opened and both water and blood flowed out.</p>
<p>There are two aspects to Christ&rsquo;s death: one aspect is for producing, and the other is for redemption. John 12:24 says, &ldquo;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; The death of the grain is altogether a producing death, not a redemptive death. The deep sleep of Adam does not signify Christ&rsquo;s redemptive death but His producing death. When people receive the Lord&rsquo;s gospel, many pay attention to and comprehend Christ&rsquo;s redemptive death, but very few hear of Christ&rsquo;s producing death. However, the producing aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death is more important to the saved ones than the redemptive aspect. The redemptive aspect is something additional, but the producing aspect is according to what God intended for man in His original plan, that is, that man would have life.</p>
<p>Even if man did not have the problem of sin, Christ still would have needed to pass through death. If He did not die, we could not be made alive. First Corinthians 15:36 says, &ldquo;What you sow is not made alive unless it dies.&rdquo; If the grain of wheat does not fall into the ground and die, it abides alone. If Adam had not slept and if his side had not been opened, Eve could not have been produced. Everything in the universe, both plants and animals, must pass through death in order to enter into us to be our life. In order for the fruit of a tree to be our life supply, it must be eaten by us. The fruit&rsquo;s being eaten by us is the fruit&rsquo;s passing through death. &ldquo;This the secret nature hideth, / Harvest grows from buried grain&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #482). This indicates that the producing death is more important than the redemptive death. The producing death is the principal objective, and the redemptive death is merely a supplement, an addition.</p><h2 class="head4">Passing through Resurrection</h2>
<p>If we take a rib out of the human body, the rib will surely die. Thus, when God took a rib from Adam&rsquo;s side, the rib must have passed through resurrection in order to become a living woman. After resurrection the dead bone became a living woman. Eve was produced in resurrection. First Peter 1:3 says, &ldquo;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.&rdquo; On the day Christ was resurrected, we also were resurrected. On the day of His resurrection, He caused the grain of wheat to become many grains and the only begotten Son of God to become the Firstborn among God&rsquo;s many sons. On the morning of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, He told Mary, &ldquo;Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God&rdquo; (John 20:17). On the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, His disciples became His brothers, and all those who believed into Him received His life. The producing of Eve was through the rib that God took from Adam&rsquo;s side, typifying that the church is produced through the three steps that Christ passed through&mdash;incarnation, death, and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Nature of the Church&mdash;Christ</h2>
<p>Just as the nature of Eve is Adam, so also the nature of the church is Christ. Eve was built from a part taken out of Adam&rsquo;s body. As a result, her nature was not only the same as that of Adam; she was Adam. Eve was not only the same as Adam; she was Adam. Before Adam fell into a deep sleep, he was alone, but when he woke up, Eve was there. When he awoke, Eve was alive. Both of them passed through resurrection. The word <em>woman</em> in Hebrew is <em>ishshah,</em> and the word for <em>man</em> is <em>ish.</em> In Hosea 2:16 God&rsquo;s people called Him <em>Ish.</em> In the New Testament, the Lord Jesus is called Christ, and the believers are called Christians. The two, Christ and the Christians, are not only similar; they are one and are out of the same source. Eve was Adam, and the church is Christ. Christ is the nature of the church, and the church is Christ Himself. Anything short of Christ is not the church. Whatever is not Christ is not the church. First Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&rdquo; In this verse the body refers to the church, but the following words, <em>so also is the Christ,</em> show that the church is Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Issue&mdash;<br />
Being Joined to Christ and<br />
Returning to Christ</h2>
<p>The issue of the church being produced is that the church is joined to Christ and will return to Christ. This is typified by Eve and Adam becoming one. Eve came out of Adam and returned to Adam. After Eve came out of Adam, she and Adam did not become two. In Genesis 2:23, regarding Eve, Adam said, &ldquo;This time this is bone of my bones / And flesh of my flesh.&rdquo; In verse 24 the two became one flesh. Eve came out of Adam, and she returned to Adam and became one with him. Ephesians 5:32 says, &ldquo;This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.&rdquo; We are bone of Christ&rsquo;s bone and flesh of His flesh. We came out of Him and are joined to Him. We are not only the same as He; we are one with Him and will return to Him in the future.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Rebekah&mdash;Typifying the Church<br />
Being Chosen from the World</h2>
<p>Rebekah typifies the church being chosen from the world (Gen. 24). After Eve, Rebekah is the second Old Testament type regarding the church. Sarah does not typify the church because Abraham is not a type of Christ. In his person, Abraham typifies God the Father, and in reference to doctrine, Abraham typifies justification by faith. Hence, Sarah typifies grace. In reference to Sarah as a type of grace, Galatians 4:26 says, &ldquo;The Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.&rdquo; The principal reason that Rebekah typifies the church is that her husband, Isaac, typifies Christ. In regard to person, Isaac typifies God the Son (the Son of God), and in regard to doctrine, Isaac typifies the inheritance in Christ.</p>
<p>Rebekah as a type of the church has an altogether different focus than Eve. As a type of the church, Eve depicts the producing of the church and the nature of the church. As a type of the church, Rebekah depicts the church being chosen out of the world. This type includes the choosing of the Father and the calling and leading of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit led Rebekah step by step through a long journey to Isaac. Hence, this picture of Rebekah being a type of the church depicts how the church was chosen out of the world and brought all the way into the heavenly tabernacle to enjoy Christ&rsquo;s love and to satisfy Him.</p><h2 class="head3">The Background&mdash;the World of Idols</h2>
<p>Rebekah originally lived in Paddan-aram (Gen. 25:20), an idol-worshipping place usurped by God&rsquo;s enemy. The people there opposed God, forsook God, and worshipped idols as their gods. The birthplace of Rebekah was a world of idols. Likewise, the birthplace of the church is also a world of idols. Before the church was called out, it was in the world of idols where people make a name for themselves, exalt themselves, forsake God, oppose God, put God aside, and give Satan the ground and authority. This was the original condition of the church. The focus of this type is not on our living or on sins but on our having being under the authority of the demons.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Calling&mdash;<br />
the Work of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Eve as a type of the church reveals how the church was produced, whereas Rebekah typifies how the church was called. God chose the church before the creation of the world, but His calling occurred in time. Choosing comes first, then calling. God chose the church in eternity before the creation of the world, but God called the church out of the world in time. God&rsquo;s calling is based upon His choosing. God the Father carried out the choosing, and the Holy Spirit carried out the calling. Although God&rsquo;s choosing occurred in eternity, His calling was accomplished in time. The place of God the Father&rsquo;s choosing was in the heavens, but the calling of the Holy Spirit was carried out on the earth. In typology, Abraham&rsquo;s sending of his servant to Paddan-aram was God the Father&rsquo;s sending of the Holy Spirit to the earth. The old servant&rsquo;s encounter with Rebekah was a calling. Calling comes out of choosing. Hence, the type of Rebekah shows that the church was chosen out of the world, or we may say that the church was called out of the world. These two things are actually one. We use the word <em>calling</em> rather than <em>choosing</em> because calling executes and fulfills the choosing.</p>
<h2 class="head4">God the Father Sending the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Many Bible readers acknowledge that Abraham typifies God the Father, and the servant, the Holy Spirit. Abraham&rsquo;s sending of the servant typifies God the Father&rsquo;s sending of the Holy Spirit to the earth. God the Father&rsquo;s choosing of the church is executed through the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit executes God&rsquo;s eternal choosing; that is, the Holy Spirit calls the church out of the world.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Object of the Calling</h2>
<p>One day Abraham said to his servant, &ldquo;You shall go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac&rdquo; (Gen. 24:4). This typifies that when God called the church, He sent the Holy Spirit to work among those who were the same as His Son when His Son was on the earth. God was not able to find a counterpart among the angels and the living creatures on earth. The church called by the Holy Spirit had to be of the same race as Christ. Hebrews 2:14 says, &ldquo;Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same.&rdquo; Rebekah was of the same race as Isaac, typifying that both Christ and the church share the same life. Isaac&rsquo;s family was originally from Paddan-aram, and Rebekah was also from Paddan-aram. Christ became flesh, and the church is composed of those who share in blood and flesh. The Holy Spirit could not call the church out from among the angels or from among other creatures. Therefore, the Holy Spirit came to call the church out from the Adamic race.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Arrangement of the Circumstances</h2>
<p>When the Holy Spirit calls man, His calling is accompanied by an arrangement of circumstances. When the Holy Spirit called the church, there was also an arrangement of circumstances. Was it a coincidence that Rebekah came out to draw water and was the first to whom the servant spoke (Gen. 24:15-17)? These coincidences were all according to God&rsquo;s arrangement. If we consider the history of our being called, we must bow our heads and confess, saying, &ldquo;The circumstances were just right!&rdquo; If this were not the case, we would not have been saved. Hence, when the Holy Spirit visits a person, a wonderful arrangement of circumstances in the environment takes place. This is not coincidence but the sovereign arrangement of the Lord of the universe.</p><h2 class="head4">The Sealing of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>The calling of the church includes God the Father&rsquo;s sending of the Holy Spirit, the object of the calling, and the arrangement of the circumstances. Moreover, when the servant met Rebekah according to the circumstances arranged by God, she received the sealing of the Holy Spirit in type. Through the arrangement of the environment, the servant met Rebekah and put a mark on Rebekah as a sign of separation. In reality, when we were called by the Holy Spirit, a similar situation occurred. As an illustration, the sealing of the Holy Spirit can be compared to putting a mark or signing our name upon a piece of furniture that we want to purchase in a furniture store. The mark or signature separates the piece of furniture from all the other furniture in the store, indicating that it belongs to us.</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit encounters those whom He calls, He immediately places a mark upon them. Ephesians 1:13 says, &ldquo;In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.&rdquo; There may have been many girls who came out to draw water, but the servant chose Rebekah; she alone was called. When the servant sensed that Rebekah was the object of his calling, he immediately put a nose-ring upon her nose and bracelets upon her hands (Gen. 24:47). The nose-ring and the bracelets signify the sealing of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The nose is our breathing organ, and our hands are for movement. The breathing of our nose is related to our existence, and the movement of our hands is related to our actions. When we heard the gospel and touched the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit immediately put a golden ring upon our nose and golden bracelets upon our hands; as a result, our breathing and actions became different from the past. When the Holy Spirit was sealing us, we may not have realized what He was doing. Nevertheless, after we heard the gospel and received the Lord, we felt that our living, existence, and actions had changed.</p>
<p>After the servant put the golden ring upon Rebekah&rsquo;s nose and the golden bracelets upon her hands, she went home. Even though she may not have said anything at home, when her parents and brother saw what had been added to her nose and hands, they knew that something must have happened. According to typology, she had the sealing of the Holy Spirit. When we heard the gospel and met the Holy Spirit, the same thing happened to us; we had something added to us. In the past we were able to speak casually, but after the sealing we could not; in the past we were able to act loosely, but afterward we were constrained inwardly. When our family noticed this change, they realized that we had become different. This indicates that we received the sealing of the Holy Spirit. The sealing of the Holy Spirit always adds something to us, even without our realization.</p>
<p>Every one of us has experienced such a day. One day I went to hear the gospel out of curiosity because I thought it unusual for a young lady to preach, but on that day the Holy Spirit met me and put a golden ring and bracelets upon me. In the Bible gold typifies God&rsquo;s nature. God&rsquo;s nature is in God&rsquo;s life, and God&rsquo;s life is just God Himself. God has added His element of gold into us; that is, He has added Himself into us. Hence, the mark that the Holy Spirit places upon us is not something apart from the Holy Spirit; it is the Holy Spirit Himself, that is, God Himself. When we first met the Holy Spirit, He wrought Himself into us. From that day onward, our living and actions have been influenced by the Holy Spirit. The golden ring and bracelets are nice, but once we put them on, we feel uneasy. It is good to have God&rsquo;s life in us, but at the same time, His life often bothers us in regard to our living and actions. We are not as free as we were in the past. This is the result of the Holy Spirit entering into us as the seal.</p><h2 class="head4">The Testimony of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>On the day that the servant encountered Rebekah, he testified on behalf of Isaac, saying, &ldquo;Sarah my master&rsquo;s wife bore a son to my master after she had become old. And he has given all that he has to him&rdquo; (v. 36). This signifies the Holy Spirit testifying of Christ. When the Holy Spirit calls man, He enables man to know that Christ is the Son of God and that God has given everything in the universe to Christ. Everything includes all matters and all things. Everything of God and everything He has accomplished, have been given to His Son as the Heir (Heb. 1:2). When we are called, the Holy Spirit testifies within us that all that God has is for His Son. John 15 reveals that the Holy Spirit came to testify not concerning the Father but concerning the Son (v. 26).</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Pledge of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>After we have the sealing and the testimony of the Holy Spirit, the pledge of the Holy Spirit is added to us. Ephesians 1:14 and 2 Corinthians 1:22 both speak of a pledge. A pledge is similar to a pawn. When I take my clothes to a pawnshop, the pawnshop gives me a sum of money. The Japanese call their pawnshops &ldquo;pledge houses.&rdquo; A pledge is similar to something that has been pawned; thus, the thing that is pawned may also be called a pledge. The word <em>pledge</em> also has the meaning of a security. When we seek a loan from the bank, we must present a lien on our house to the bank as a security. Our house becomes the collateral. When the Holy Spirit enters into us, He is not only the seal but also the pledge, the pawn, the security. This security is the guarantee that God has given us, guaranteeing that everything in the heavens is ours.</p>
<p>When the servant met Rebekah, his first action was to give her a golden ring and bracelets. After obtaining the consent of Rebekah and her family, the old servant immediately brought forth gold jewelry, silver jewelry, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother (Gen. 24:53). The gold jewelry, silver jewelry, and clothing that the servant gave her were not a seal but a pledge, a security, which is something more than a seal.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:14 says that the Holy Spirit is &ldquo;the pledge of our inheritance.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>pledge</em> has the meaning of a sample. In the selling of land in ancient times, the seller was required to give the purchaser a sample of soil from the land to confirm that the land being sold contained that soil. Similarly, the gold jewelry, silver jewelry, and clothing that the old servant gave to Rebekah were samples of the wealth of Isaac&rsquo;s house. The servant took a portion of Isaac&rsquo;s riches and gave it to Rebekah in order to show her the wealth of the one she was to marry. All the things were a pledge, guaranteeing that what was not yet in her hands would also be her portion. Previously, Abraham had given everything to Isaac; thus, if Rebekah married Isaac, all that he had would become hers. Because she had not yet seen or enjoyed the riches of Isaac, the servant gave a portion to her as a foretaste for her enjoyment, guaranteeing that the rest would come later.</p>
<p>The servant gave Rebekah gold jewelry, silver jewelry, and clothing. In typology, gold signifies the life of God, silver signifies the Lord&rsquo;s redemption, and clothing signifies the righteousnesses of the saints. Hence, the salvation that the Lord gives us is pledged by the Holy Spirit who works the Lord&rsquo;s redemption on the cross into us. It is in the Holy Spirit that God accepts and justifies us, and it is also because of the Holy Spirit that our behavior is changed. These things issue from the pledging of the Holy Spirit. Our receiving the pledge of the Holy Spirit includes our obtaining the life of God, the application of the Lord&rsquo;s redemption on the cross, our experience of being justified and reconciled by God, and a change in our behavior. It is in the Holy Spirit that we taste God&rsquo;s life, enjoy the element of Christ&rsquo;s redemption, and experience being justified by God, which causes us to be accepted by God, have peace with God, be reconciled to God, and have a genuine change in our behavior. All that we receive in the Holy Spirit works out the completion of God&rsquo;s salvation in us, causing us to be fully saved.</p><h2 class="head4">The Hindrance from the Relatives</h2>
<p>After the servant finished the sealing, testifying, and pledging, Rebekah should have immediately followed him. Her mother and brother, however, were reluctant to let her go and requested that she stay for at least ten days (Gen. 24:55). In typology, ten is the number of completion, and in this context it is used in the sense of hindering. When the Holy Spirit calls someone, his relatives often try to hinder him. Some may say, &ldquo;It is okay for you to believe in Jesus, but wait until you graduate from college.&rdquo; Or they may say, &ldquo;You must first go to work, and you can believe in Him later.&rdquo; These are examples of hindrance from the relatives. Some parents hinder their children, some children hinder their parents, some wives hinder their husbands, and some husbands hinder their wives. If we recall the story of our salvation, nearly every one of us experienced some hindrance from our relatives.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Willingness of the Church</h2>
<p>Even though there is hindrance from the relatives, there is still the willingness of the church. Rebekah not only typifies the church but also individual saints. On the one hand, there is the willingness of the church, but on the other hand, there is the willingness of the individual saints. When the servant and Rebekah&rsquo;s relatives discussed whether she should go or stay, they were not able to come to a decision, so they called Rebekah and asked about her preference. When they asked her, she said, &ldquo;I will go&rdquo; (v. 58). Her reply indicates her willingness.</p>
<p>Rebekah was truly brave. Transportation in those days was inconvenient. It was not easy for a young girl to marry someone in a foreign country far away from her hometown. However, when the Holy Spirit works in us, no matter how difficult the future may seem, we called ones spontaneously say, &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo; From the experience of our salvation, we can testify that when we said, &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; our inner being was strong and buoyant. Although we thought of the difficulty of our future, there was a power within us, strengthening and supporting us to say, &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo; This declaration is a determination to leave the world. From that day, our whole life was moved out of the world. At this point, our calling is complete.</p>
<p>I recall the story of my salvation. At that time I was pursuing the knowledge of the world and seeking to have a future in the world. Then one day I heard the preaching of a young sister. At that moment the Holy Spirit met me and put a ring upon my nose. Later when I was walking home, the Holy Spirit operated in me in a strong way, and I said, &ldquo;I do not want the world anymore. I decide to follow the Lord.&rdquo; I experienced what happened to Rebekah. Although at the time, I did not know that there was such a record in the Bible, much less understand the type, my inner being was saying, &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo; My inner being kept saying, &ldquo;I do not want the world. I want only God. Let my parents, relatives, and classmates be satisfied with the world. I must move away from here. I do not belong to this place. I have been betrothed to Him. Wherever He is, I must be also. My entire life has been moved out of the world.&rdquo; On the day the Holy Spirit met and called us, we said strongly and buoyantly, &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Journey</h2>
<p>Eve as a type of the church speaks of the producing of the church and the nature of the church. Rebekah as a type of the church speaks of the church being chosen from the world and of the journey of the church. After Rebekah was chosen, the servant took her to the land of Canaan on a camel (vv. 61-64). After the church was chosen, set apart, and called by God, the church must take a long journey.</p>
<p>After a person is called, he is destined to travel a long distance. No one who is called may stop and not continue forward. Some people count every day, calculating when Christ will come. They do not realize that Christ&rsquo;s coming has everything to do with our journeying. When the church finishes her journey, she will meet Christ. Rebekah did not wait for Isaac in Paddan-aram. Rather, she traveled a long distance from Paddan-aram, until one day toward evening, Isaac came to welcome her. There are two journeys in this account: a long journey and a short journey. The church takes a long journey, and Christ takes a short journey. When the church finishes her journey, Christ will come to welcome her. Hence, the church should not sit and wait for Christ&rsquo;s coming. Christ&rsquo;s coming requires us to journey. Some people spend all of their time speaking of how the church will be raptured and of the timing of the reaping of the harvest. However, only after the harvest has ripened will the Lord of the harvest come to reap the harvest. Hence, we should not consider the matter of rapture merely in terms of a prophecy; rather, we must consider it in terms of a journey. The church should not merely study the ways of being raptured but take the way of a journey. Only when the church has finished her course will she be raptured to marry Christ.</p>
<p>Rebekah took a long journey, and Isaac took a short one. In regard to direction, Rebekah traveled upward over a long distance, and Isaac came downward for only a short way. In regard to the time traveled, Rebekah must have traveled for a few weeks, whereas Isaac came out in the evening and walked for only a short period of time. Christ will come down from the heavens when the church is about to finish her journey. Hence, we should not simply study and wait for the rapture; instead, we should finish our journey.</p>
<p>On the evening of Rebekah&rsquo;s arrival, Isaac went out from the tent to the field (v. 63). In the New Testament the field refers to the world. This means that at the end of this age, Christ will come back to the earth to meet the counterpart whom He has called throughout the ages&mdash;the church. However, Isaac did not marry Rebekah in the field but in his mother&rsquo;s tent (v. 67). The tent typifies the New Jerusalem, the tabernacle of God with men (Rev. 21:3). At this time the church, which He called throughout the generations, will be completely one with Him.</p>
<p>The servant took Rebekah on a camel and passed through the wilderness. The camel is a means of transportation used in a dry place such as the desert. Rebekah traveled a way that was long and desolate from Paddan-aram through the deserts to the land of Canaan. This signifies that the way that the church takes on earth is a path full of suffering and sorrow; it is rugged, difficult, and dangerous. According to the record in Leviticus 11, the camel is unclean (v. 4). This signifies that while the church is journeying on the earth, the Holy Spirit arranges certain people, matters, and things as tools to deal with the church so that the church can proceed onward. The Holy Spirit always raises up certain people, matters, and things to help the church advance. These persons, matters, and things are not considered by God as clean; rather, they are unclean camels. There are oxen and lambs in God&rsquo;s tabernacle but never camels; however, on the path through the wilderness there are camels.</p>
<p>After we were saved, our family, classmates, and colleagues may have persecuted us. However, this kind of difficulty and persecution often carried us for a distance. At other times we may have experienced another kind of suffering that forced us to draw nearer to the Lord. These difficulties and sufferings are camels that carry us onward. All the environments that the Holy Spirit uses to deal with us are actually camels. The church not only journeys upon a desolate path that passes through deserts but is also carried along on camels, which are unclean in the eyes of God.</p>
<p>The servant was Rebekah&rsquo;s guide, and the camels were her means of transportation. The servant as the guide typifies the Holy Spirit as the guide of the church, and the unclean people, matters, and things raised up by the Holy Spirit typify the means of transportation that carry the church along its way. As the Holy Spirit leads a saint onward with the Lord, he may not be willing to follow; thus, the Holy Spirit must raise up a difficult environment to force him onward. This environment is similar to a large camel. Once the camel comes, it will bring him onward.</p>
<p>Our experience of salvation testifies that this picture is real. Romans 8:28 says, &ldquo;All things work together for good to those who love God.&rdquo; The path taken by the church on the earth throughout the past two thousand years has been long, hard, and rugged. In 1900 thousands of Christians were killed in the Boxer Rebellion. From the human perspective, the church suffered a great deal. But from God&rsquo;s perspective, the church in China was able to travel a long distance in a glorious way. The Boxer Rebellion can be compared to a large camel that was unclean in the eyes of God, yet it functioned as a means of transportation for the church.</p>
<p>The reason the churches in China are in their present condition is due to the persecution of Christians in the Boxer Rebellion. Since that time there has been the continual increase of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in China. On a large scale, international wars often serve as camels to bring God&rsquo;s church onward. On a smaller scale, husbands who persecute their wives, wives who make things difficult for their husbands, unsaved children, and parents who are not clear regarding salvation are also camels used by God to bring the saints onward. The &ldquo;all things&rdquo; spoken of in Romans 8:28 and 32 are the means that God uses to take His church onward in her journey on the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Result&mdash;Marriage</h2>
<p>In the end Isaac married Rebekah. This is a type of the marriage of the Lamb in Revelation (19:7; 21:2). The timing of this marriage is determined by the distance. When the church reaches the end of her course, she will meet Christ. From the viewpoint of the church, it will not be morning but close to the end of time. From Christ&rsquo;s viewpoint, it will be the morning, close to the dawning of the day. When the church finishes her journey, Christ will come to meet her.</p>
<p>Once Rebekah saw Isaac, she took her veil and covered herself (Gen. 24:65). Spiritually, this signifies that from that point onward Rebekah gave herself entirely to Isaac. Formerly, she lived her own life, but from that point onward, she lived her life under Isaac. She and Isaac were no longer two persons but one. She covered her head, indicating that she was finished, taken away, and given entirely to Isaac. She lived under Isaac, in Isaac, and mingled with Isaac. Rebekah&rsquo;s head covering indicates not only that she came under an authority but also that she hid and covered herself and ceased to exist. Hence, the result of the marriage is that the two became one flesh. This is also typified by Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>As types, the ultimate issue of both Eve and Rebekah is that the two became one flesh with their husbands. Rebekah was with the one to whom she belonged, and Isaac was comforted. This signifies that the church is with the One to whom she belongs and that Christ is satisfied. The type of Rebekah makes up for a lack in the type of Eve. In the type of Eve, there is a union and two becoming one flesh, but we do not see the result of two becoming one flesh. In the type of Rebekah, however, we see that the result of two becoming one flesh is love and comfort. &ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone&rdquo; (2:18). The issue of the union of Christ and the church is that the church is with Christ, enjoys Christ&rsquo;s love, and Christ is satisfied.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="title">ASENATH, ZIPPORAH, RUTH, AND ABIGAIL</h1>
<h2 class="head2">Asenath&mdash;Typifying the Church<br />
Being Gained from the World</h2>
<p>There are many women in the Old Testament, but not all of them are types of the church. Whether a woman in the Old Testament can be considered a type of the church is determined by her husband. If her husband is a type of Christ, she can be considered as a type of the church. Eve is a type of the church because her husband, Adam, typifies Christ. Rebekah is a type of the church because she was matched with Isaac, a type of Christ.</p>
<p>Adam and Eve in Genesis are the first couple in which the husband typifies Christ and the wife typifies the church. The second couple is Isaac and Rebekah, and the third couple is Joseph and Asenath. Although it is difficult to find a basis in the New Testament for saying that Joseph typifies Christ, according to the record in Genesis Joseph&rsquo;s entire life experience was exactly the same as Christ&rsquo;s. Therefore, Joseph is a type of Christ, and his wife, Asenath, is a type of the church.</p>
<p>Joseph typifies Christ in seven aspects. First, Joseph was loved by Jacob more than all of his brothers (Gen. 37:3). Similarly, the Lord Jesus is the Beloved of the Father. The Gospels record God&rsquo;s speaking concerning the Lord Jesus: &ldquo;This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight&rdquo; (Matt. 3:17). Second, Joseph was conspired against by his brothers (Gen. 37:18), just as our Lord Jesus was killed by the Jews, His brothers in the flesh (John 19:14-16). Third, Joseph&rsquo;s brothers conspired against him out of jealousy (Gen. 37:4, 11). In the same way, the Jews killed the Lord Jesus out of envy (Matt. 27:18). Fourth, Joseph&rsquo;s brothers sought to put him to death, but God raised up the environment to deliver him (Gen. 37:28). The Jews also sought to put the Lord Jesus to death, but God raised Him from the dead with His mighty hand (Matt. 28:6). Fifth, after Joseph was forsaken by his brothers, the Gentiles received him (Gen. 39:1-6). Likewise, the Jews forsook the Lord Jesus, but the Gentiles received Him (Matt. 15:21-28). Sixth, Joseph supplied the people in Egypt with food so that they were able to avoid death (Gen. 41:56-57). In the same way, after our Lord Jesus was forsaken by the Jews, He became the Savior who supplies men with the bread of life that men might not perish (John 6:51). Seventh, when Joseph was put into prison, he and the chief of the cupbearers and the chief of the bakers were condemned, but in the end the cupbearer lived and the baker died (Gen. 40:21-22). Similarly, when the Lord Jesus was nailed to the cross, two criminals were crucified with Him, and in the end one was saved and the other perished (Luke 23:32, 39-43). Therefore, the experiences of Joseph are similar in detail to the experiences of the Lord Jesus. Hence, there is no doubt that Joseph is a type of Christ. His wife, Asenath, therefore, is a type of the church.</p>
<p>Asenath typifies the church being personally gained by Christ out of the world (Gen. 41:45). This is in contrast to the experience of Rebekah as a type of the church. Rebekah typifies the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s choosing and calling of the church out from the world. According to the type of Rebekah, Isaac remained in the land of Canaan and did not go down to Paddan-aram to search for Rebekah. This implies that Christ had not yet come to the world but was still in His heavenly tent. It was the Holy Spirit who came to Paddan-aram, called out the church, and led her to go forward unto Christ. When it was close to evening, Isaac came out of his tent and met Rebekah. This shows that the type of Rebekah centers on Christ being in the heavens and the Holy Spirit calling the church out from the world.</p>
<p>The type of Asenath, however, centers on the church being gained by Christ in the world. Joseph went down to Egypt and took Asenath as his wife. He then stayed in Egypt. Asenath never left Egypt. This typifies that Christ came into the world and was received by men as the Savior; He gained the church in the world. Even though Asenath continued to live in Egypt, she no longer belonged to Egypt because of her marriage to Joseph. In the same way, even though the church is in the world, she does not belong to the world because of her union with Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Zipporah&mdash;Typifying the Church in the Wilderness</h2>
<p>Moses is another type of Christ. Hebrews 3 explicitly says that Moses typifies Christ. Moses was the apostle sent by God to deliver the children of Israel from Egypt. He typifies Christ as the Apostle sent by God to save the children of God from their degradation, that is, from Satan&rsquo;s usurpation.</p>
<p>Moses typifies Christ in four aspects. First, Moses was persecuted soon after he was born because the Egyptians were seeking to kill every son born of the Hebrew women; consequently, many sons were killed (Exo. 1:16, 22). This type was realized when Christ was born. King Herod sought to kill Him, and as a result, many sons were killed (Matt. 2:16). Second, Moses was born of his parents in the flesh, but he was raised by another woman&mdash;Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter (Exo. 2:10). In the same way, the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit but was raised by a woman&mdash;Mary (Matt. 1:23). Third, in order to flee Pharaoh&rsquo;s persecution, Moses fled to the wilderness of Midian (Exo. 2:15). The Lord Jesus also fled to Egypt to escape Herod&rsquo;s persecution (Matt. 2:13-15). Fourth, Moses was sent by God to save God&rsquo;s people from the ill treatment of Pharaoh in Egypt (Exo. 3:7-10). This typifies Christ being sent by God to the earth to save God&rsquo;s people from the bondage of Satan. Hence, Hebrews 3 points out that Moses is a type of Christ as the Apostle.</p>
<p>Since Moses is a type of Christ, his wife Zipporah typifies the church. Zipporah is the wife whom Moses married when he was persecuted and wandering in the wilderness (Exo. 2:21). Thus, Zipporah typifies the aspect of the church in the wilderness, being gained by Christ when He was forsaken and wandering in the wilderness.</p>
<p>After Moses, Joshua typifies Christ. Nevertheless, because the Bible does not speak of Joshua&rsquo;s wife, it is difficult to speak of her as a type of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ruth&mdash;Typifying<br />
the Church Being Redeemed</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Boaz Being the Lawful Heir<br />
of God&rsquo;s Inheritance</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament Boaz is yet another type of Christ. Boaz married a special woman who occupies a particular place in the Bible. Her name was Ruth. She typifies the aspect of the church being redeemed. The entire book of Ruth can be considered a story of redemption. Rebekah portrays the church as the called one, Zipporah portrays the church in the wilderness, and Ruth portrays the church in redemption.</p>
<p>The Old Testament pays much attention to the matter of the birthright. Boaz was a lawful heir of the inheritance of God. After God called Abraham, He gave Abraham every blessing: heavenly and earthly, material and spiritual, and even God Himself. Abraham received all the blessings that God prepared for man in His eternal plan, the blessings in both His creation and redemption. All the blessings of God&rsquo;s creation and even God Himself were given to Abraham.</p>
<p>There was a problem, however, of who would inherit the blessing that Abraham had received from God. Eliezer of Damascus was not qualified to inherit the blessing; neither was Ishmael, who was born of Hagar. Only Isaac, who was born according to the promise, could inherit the blessing. Of the two sons born of Isaac, Esau and Jacob, God chose Jacob to be the heir. In principle, only the one with the birthright could be the heir to inherit the blessing. Jacob was a crafty person, and he stole the birthright from his brother through trickery. Even if Jacob had not used any tricks, God&rsquo;s blessing and the birthright would still have come to him. Jacob had twelve sons, and since they were all born of Jacob, they all had a part in the blessing of Abraham. However, among these twelve, only the first one should have received the birthright.</p>
<p>According to the Old Testament, the blessing of the birthright consists of three items: a double portion of the land, the kingship of God, and the priesthood of God. These three items are the blessings of the birthright inherited by Jacob&rsquo;s sons. Reuben, as the firstborn of Jacob, should have inherited all three blessings of the birthright; however, he lost the birthright because he defiled his father&rsquo;s bed. Hence, the blessings of the birthright went to three of his brothers. The double portion of land went to Joseph (Gen. 48:22), the kingship went to Judah (49:8), and the priesthood went to Levi (Exo. 28:1).</p>
<p>At the time of Boaz, the inheritance of land was not an important issue, and the priesthood had become desolate. Only the kingship needed to be confirmed. Hence, at that time the kingship was the most important of the blessings related to the birthright, and Boaz was the lawful heir of this blessing. The Scriptures say that Boaz begot Obed, and Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David the king (Matt. 1:5-6). The kingship of Judah came from Boaz because he was an ancestor of King David. Hence, the kingship among the Jews was produced through Boaz. Moreover, the Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious eternal King, was also a descendant of Boaz according to genealogy.</p><h2 class="head3">The Created Aspect<br />
and the Fallen Aspect of Man</h2>
<p>Boaz married Ruth, a Moabitess. The Moabites were the shameful descendants of Lot. Genesis 19:30 through 33 and 36 through 37 show that Moab was born through incest between Lot and his eldest daughter. This incident was shameful and improper. Hence, the Bible records that a Moabite was not to enter the congregation of Jehovah, even to the tenth generation, and that none of their descendants were to enter the congregation of Jehovah forever (Deut. 23:3). This was Ruth&rsquo;s background.</p>
<p>Originally, Ruth had nothing to do with God&rsquo;s blessing, was not able to enter the congregation of Jehovah, even to the tenth generation, and was forsaken and separated from God&rsquo;s holy people. However, Boaz redeemed Ruth because she belonged to Elimelech, a man of his same family (Ruth 2:1). Ruth was the wife of Elimelech&rsquo;s second son, Mahlon (1:1-4). This relationship provided a connection for redemption. Ruth was a Moabitess, but through her marriage to a man of the same family as Boaz, she was joined to his family and, thus, had the position and right to be redeemed by Boaz. If a Japanese girl, who originally had nothing to do with the Chinese, married a man from China, she would be legally associated with and considered to be of China. As a result, after the death of her Chinese husband, she would have the legal right to inherit her husband&rsquo;s possessions. Ruth&rsquo;s redemption was based on the fact that she had this type of association with someone of Boaz&rsquo;s family. Thus, she had the legal position to be redeemed by Boaz.</p>
<p>Boaz redeemed Ruth based on the Jewish law. If an Israelite took a wife and died without a son, his brother should take her as his wife and raise up a seed to him. If he did not have a brother, his nearest kinsman should take her as his wife. The firstborn of the woman would then be counted as the offspring of her deceased husband (Lev. 25:25; Deut. 25:5-6). This is the law that God ordained for the children of Israel, and based upon this law, Boaz redeemed Ruth.</p>
<p>The background of Ruth was shameful. This shameful background typifies our shameful background prior to redemption. Our origin was exactly the same as the descendants of Lot, the Moabites, who were not allowed to enter the congregation of Jehovah, even to the tenth generation. According to this aspect of our background, we absolutely do not have the position to receive redemption. Formerly Ruth had nothing to do with Boaz; in the same way, we had nothing to do with Christ. We had nothing to do with Jehovah&rsquo;s blessing, and God had no obligation to redeem us. Ruth&rsquo;s background speaks of the corrupted and fallen aspect of our being; God will not save this aspect of our being.</p>
<p>Our being, however, has another aspect; that is, we as descendants of Adam are of the same family as Christ. Christ became flesh and was a descendant of Adam. According to the aspect related to the fall, we are Moabites who have nothing to do with Jehovah&rsquo;s blessing, but according to the aspect of our being the descendants of Adam, we are related to Christ and are able to receive God&rsquo;s redemption. The principle of redemption is not to save the sinful aspect of man but to save the aspect of man that was created and later fell into sin. The Lord became a man, not a sinner. Thus, the Lord is joined to us only in the aspect of our created humanity, not in the aspect of our fallen humanity. The fallen aspect is related to Moab, but the created aspect is related to Ruth&rsquo;s husband, Boaz.</p>
<p>Romans 7 reveals that the old man, the created man, was our husband. Bible readers throughout the ages have had a controversy over Romans 7 regarding whether the husband mentioned there refers to the law or to the flesh. In a sense, the law and the flesh are inseparable. The law was given because of man&rsquo;s flesh. If there were no flesh, the law would not be needed. Ephesians 2 says that the cross abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances in the flesh, meaning that it abolished the flesh upon which the law of the commandments in ordinances was based. Hence, we cannot separate the law from the flesh; the law and the flesh are actually one. Some believe that the husband spoken of in Romans 7 refers to the law, while others consider him to be the flesh. However, according to the viewpoint of the entire Scripture, the husband in Romans 7 refers to the created yet fallen old man.</p>
<p>Our fallen aspect is typified by the Moabites, and our created aspect is typified by Ruth&rsquo;s husband. Ruth&rsquo;s husband being the kinsman of Boaz typifies that our created aspect is of the same family as Christ. Based on this aspect, we have the position to be redeemed. Christ can redeem us and must redeem us because we have a created aspect. As fallen Moabites, we have a husband according to creation.</p>
<p>If Ruth did not have an Israelite husband, who was of the same family as Boaz, she would have had nothing to do with Boaz, and Boaz would not have had the obligation, responsibility, right, and position to redeem her. Boaz had the right to redeem Ruth because she had married a husband from the same family as Boaz. This type reveals that Christ redeemed us because we fallen sinners, fallen Moabites, have a created husband, a created element in us. In terms of our created aspect, Christ and we are of the same family; Boaz and we are of the same family. Hence, we have the position to be redeemed, and He has the obligation to redeem us. He must redeem us, and we should be redeemed by Him.</p>
<p>We should never regard Ruth the Moabitess and her husband as two persons but as one person. By being one person with her husband, Ruth was related to Boaz; otherwise, Ruth the Moabitess would have had nothing to do with Boaz, and Boaz would not have had any obligation and right to do anything for Ruth. They would have had nothing to do with one another. However, because Ruth married a man from Judah and had become one with the people of Judah, she had the right to be redeemed, and Boaz had the obligation to redeem her. This signifies that without the created element, the created aspect, fallen people would have nothing to do with Christ.</p>
<p>Hebrews 2 says that it is not to angels that Christ gives help; instead, He gives help to the seed of Abraham (v. 16), to men with blood and flesh. Ruth was redeemed because of her husband, not because she was a Moabitess. In the fall the created aspect of Adam became the fallen aspect of &ldquo;Moab&rdquo;; thus, there is still a need for Christ to redeem the created aspect. Hence, Ruth&rsquo;s redemption was based upon her being of the same family as Boaz.</p>
<p>Our created aspect is the same as Christ&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same&rdquo; (v. 14). Because angels do not have blood and flesh, they and Christ are not of the same family. Thus, Christ does not have any obligation to save the angels, and the angels do not have the right to enjoy Christ&rsquo;s redemption. Only Adam&rsquo;s descendants, who are of the same family as Christ, have been given the right to enjoy His redemption, and He is obligated to redeem us.</p>
<p>Just as Rebekah had to be of the same family as Isaac, Ruth had to be of the same family as Boaz in order to be redeemed by him. This shows that Christ became a man so that we might become His relatives. Once Christ became a man, He had the obligation to redeem man so that man could have the right to receive and enjoy His redemption.</p><h2 class="head3">The Deliverance from the Fallen Aspect<br />
in the Death of the Created Aspect</h2>
<p>Why did Boaz choose to redeem Ruth? The answer to this question can be found in Romans 7:2-4. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;The married woman is bound by the law to her husband while he is living; but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law regarding the husband.&rdquo; Among all of Boaz&rsquo;s relatives, Ruth was the only relative in the land of Israel whose husband had died and who sought to claim her right; thus, Boaz had to redeem her. If our &ldquo;husband&rdquo; had not died, Christ could not do anything for us. Because our husband, as part of the old creation and Adam, has died, Christ can become our Redeemer and our Husband.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Inheriting the Possession</h2>
<p>From this we see that the &ldquo;Moabite&rdquo; aspect of us is our fallen aspect, whereas the aspect of us that is of the same family as Boaz typifies the aspect created in Adam. The death of the husband typifies that our old man, our natural created aspect, must enter into death. Boaz became Ruth&rsquo;s husband, and Ruth became one with him. All Boaz had was hers. Eventually, David the king issued out of them. This typifies that they begot Christ and brought Christ into mankind. Ruth and Boaz, inheriting their lawful blessing together, typify Christ and we becoming one to inherit our lawful blessing together. This is the story of the redemption of the church.</p>
<p>The church is a group of people who were originally created by God and related to Adam. However, because of the fall, they acquired the element of Moab. Then they were delivered from their fallen position and the element of Moab when their old husband, their created part, died. This provided an opportunity for Christ to come in to join Himself to this people and become one with them. They became the counterpart of Christ to inherit the lawful blessing of God with Christ.</p>
<p>We must bear in mind these five points: (1) the created aspect, the aspect of the husband; (2) the fallen aspect, the aspect of Moab; (3) the need to be delivered from the position of a Moabitess; (4) our husband, our created aspect, needing to die; and (5) Boaz&mdash;Christ&mdash;needing to be added into us. Christ must replace our old husband and become our new Husband. Through the experience of these points, the church is redeemed to be the counterpart of Christ and to be one with Christ to inherit the lawful blessing of God, the blessing given by God to Abraham. This blessing is to reign with Christ in the future and to rule over the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Abigail&mdash;Typifying the Warring Church<br />
in the Midst of Sufferings</h2>
<p>David is the most thorough type of Christ revealed in the Old Testament, covering the longest period of time. The New Testament also clearly reveals that David typifies Christ (Matt. 12:3). Hence, David&rsquo;s wife is a type of the church. David had at least three wives: one was Michal, Saul&rsquo;s daughter (1 Sam. 18:27b), and one was Ahinoam (25:43). These two, however, do not possess any features typifying the church. Only Abigail (v. 42) possesses a feature typifying the church.</p>
<p>David typifies the warring Christ in the midst of sufferings; thus, his wife Abigail typifies the warring church in the midst of sufferings. From 1 Samuel 25 onward, Abigail was always at the side of David the warrior and followed him in his wars. Hence, she typifies the warring church, fighting for God&rsquo;s kingdom in the midst of sufferings. This is the feature of Abigail as a type of the church.</p>
<p>Both Ruth and Abigail had a previous husband. Ruth&rsquo;s previous husband shows that our old man is of the same family as Christ, and Abigail&rsquo;s previous husband shows how evil our old man is in forsaking Christ. Abigail&rsquo;s previous husband was Nabal, which means &ldquo;fool&rdquo; (25:25). Nabal despised, rejected, and opposed David at the time of his destitution (vv. 10-11). This typifies that our nature rejects Christ, despises Christ, and opposes Christ. One day, however, Nabal was struck down, and he died. This provided Abigail the opportunity to become David&rsquo;s wife. This indicates that when our corrupted nature, which forsook Christ, rejected Christ, and despised Christ, was struck down, we became Christ&rsquo;s counterpart who follows Him in the midst of sufferings, fighting for the kingdom of God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SHULAMMITE</h1>
<h2 class="head2">The Shulammite&mdash;<br />
Typifying the Church&rsquo;s Experience<br />
of the Resurrected Christ<br />
and Her Enjoyment of Rest with Him</h2>
<h2 class="head3">David and Solomon Typifying<br />
Christ in His Two Aspects</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament the seventh and last woman to typify the church is the Shulammite (S. S. 6:13). The Shulammite was Solomon&rsquo;s queen. Solomon typifies the resurrected and glorified Christ; hence, the Shulammite typifies the church in resurrection and glorification.</p>
<p>Some people think that Christ&rsquo;s glorification will begin with His second coming; however, the Bible clearly reveals that Christ entered into glory after His death and resurrection. In Luke 24:26 the Lord said to two of His disciples on the road to Emmaus, &ldquo;Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory?&rdquo; This indicates that the Lord entered into glory as soon as He resurrected. In principle, Christ&rsquo;s being in the heavens now, His coming back to the earth in the future, and His living in us and being with us today are all in glory. Solomon is a type of Christ in glory.</p>
<p>Before Christ was glorified, He experienced on the earth all kinds of sufferings and eventually death. David typifies the Christ who passed through all kinds of sufferings, and David&rsquo;s wife, Abigail, typifies the church in the midst of sufferings. Solomon typifies the glorification of Christ, and the Shulammite, the queen of Solomon, typifies the church reigning in glory and enjoying the resurrected Christ. The entire book of Song of Songs portrays how the Shulammite experienced and enjoyed Solomon, typifying the church&rsquo;s experience and enjoyment of the resurrected Christ. The Christ in Song of Songs is the resurrected Christ who passed through death, came out of death, and entered into resurrection.</p>
<p>Today the Christ in us is the resurrected Christ. The Christ whom we experience every day is the One who passed through all kinds of sufferings, death, and resurrection. This means that the Christ whom we contact and with whom we fellowship is the Christ in Song of Songs, the resurrected Christ. When we walk on the earth by relying on the resurrected Christ, we live out Christ in suffering. Only by the power of resurrection can we take the way of the cross.</p>
<p>David and Solomon, as types of Christ, are related. Solomon, as a type, did not come into being after the death of David but rather while David was still living. David and Solomon typify two aspects of a shared experience. David typifies the lowly aspect of Jesus, that is, His footsteps in His living; Solomon typifies the glorious aspect of Christ, that is, His power in His ascension. The Lord was first Jesus and then Christ, first David and then Solomon. However, in our experience He is first Christ and then Jesus, first Solomon and then David.</p>
<p>In the beginning the One whom we contacted was not Jesus but Christ. The expression <em>believing into Jesus</em> is not according to the truth. In the New Testament we cannot find such an expression. Jesus was a man into whom we have no way to believe. The One into whom we believe is the Christ in resurrection. He overcame the constraints of man, resurrected, and is in the Holy Spirit. He came out of death and entered into glory. This glory is resurrection and also the Spirit. The three&mdash;the Spirit, resurrection, and glory&mdash;cannot be separated; they are one.</p>
<p>Once the Lord entered into resurrection, He entered into glory; that is, He entered into the Holy Spirit. At that time, strictly speaking, He was not merely Jesus but the Christ; He was Jesus Christ. He was Jesus becoming the Christ in glory. Actually, the One into whom we believe is the Christ. In the Scriptures there are the expressions <em>believed into Christ Jesus</em> and <em>faith in Christ Jesus</em> (Gal. 2:16; 3:26; Phil. 3:9; 2 Tim. 3:15), but there is no such expression as <em>believing into Jesus.</em> Thus, the One whom we first contacted is the resurrected Christ. He is in resurrection, that is, in the Spirit. Through our believing, He touched our inner being, and our inner being touched Him. This may be likened to the radio waves in the air coming into contact with a radio transmitter, which corresponds to the radio waves. Similarly, the faith in us corresponds to the law of the Spirit. When the Spirit touches our inner being, our inner being touches the Spirit. The Spirit is resurrection, and He is the Christ into whom we believe and whom we contact.</p><h2 class="head3">Entering within the Veil<br />
and Going outside the Camp</h2>
<p>What we believe is not dead and empty doctrine; instead, in our spirit we have touched the Spirit, the Lord who is in resurrection and glory. His name is Christ. We have touched and contacted Him inwardly. If we allow Him to operate and move within us, we will be able to live a life just as that of Jesus the Nazarene, and we will be able to follow in His footsteps. Hebrews 13:13 says, &ldquo;Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.&rdquo; David&rsquo;s mighty men and Abigail, following David and wandering with him in the wilderness, typify going outside the camp and bearing Christ&rsquo;s reproach.</p>
<p>Our Christian living has two aspects&mdash;an inward aspect and an outward aspect. The inward aspect can be compared to the Shulammite, and the outward aspect can be compared to Abigail. On one hand, we are within the veil; on the other hand, we are outside the city, the camp. On one hand, we are in the Holy of Holies; on the other hand, we are before men. Inwardly we enjoy the resurrected Christ, and outwardly we follow Jesus. When we pray in our room in the morning, we touch Christ. This can be likened to the Shulammite and Solomon living and fellowshipping together in the palaces of ivory (Psa. 45:8). We touch the Lord in the inner chamber, in the Holy of Holies, in the secret place. When we testify for the Lord and work for the Lord in our outward living, we can be likened to Abigail, wandering with David in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Every day we experience these two aspects. On the one hand, we are within the veil as the Shulammite, living in the Holy of Holies and enjoying the resurrected and glorified Christ. On the other hand, we are outside the camp as Abigail, living in the world and following the lowly Jesus. Like the Shulammite and Solomon, we remain in the palaces of ivory and fellowship with the Lord inwardly, and like Abigail, we outwardly live and work by following David to war and suffering. The One within is the resurrected Christ, whereas the One without is Jesus the Nazarene. Inwardly we have the enjoyment of the Shulammite in the secret place, and outwardly we have the public living of Abigail.</p>
<p>We not only enjoy the resurrected Christ within, but we follow the suffering Jesus without. Our colleagues, relatives, neighbors, and friends may persecute and trouble us when we testify for the Lord. At such times we are outwardly walking on a narrow way similar to that of Jesus the Nazarene. Nevertheless, when people trouble, persecute, oppose, and harass us, we enjoy the resurrected Christ inwardly.</p>
<p>When I was arrested by the Japanese, they harassed me for a number of days. I was beaten, punished, and interrogated under torture in the prison. Outwardly it was truly difficult, yet at the same time inwardly I touched the Lord&rsquo;s presence in resurrection. Outwardly, like Jesus the Nazarene, I was tortured, but inwardly I enjoyed the Christ who is in resurrection, in glory, and in the Spirit, as typified by Solomon. In the future, when our Solomon comes back, we will be His Shulammite in His glory. Today in our spiritual experience, we can have a foretaste of that day and of the condition of that day.</p>
<p>Philippians 3:10 says, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&rdquo; As far as Christ is concerned, He first experienced suffering and then resurrection. As far as we are concerned, we touch resurrection and then experience suffering. He died and then resurrected, but we resurrect and then die. No one can take the way of the cross by himself; neither can he follow the footsteps of Jesus the Nazarene by himself. It is not until a person touches and contacts the resurrected Christ within and until the resurrected Christ enters into him that he can say, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>Only when a person comes out from within the veil, the inner chamber of fellowship, can he take the way of the cross and follow the suffering Jesus on the earth. Hebrews 10:19-20 says, &ldquo;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh.&rdquo; Only those who enter within the veil can go forth unto Him outside the camp and bear His reproach (13:13). It is the resurrected Christ in us who leads us to follow the suffering Jesus. He has walked the way of the cross and entered into us in resurrection. Now He is leading us to take the way of the cross.</p><h2 class="head3">The Shulammite Typifying<br />
the Church in Resurrection</h2>
<p>Christ is typified by Solomon, whom the Shulammite enjoyed and experienced. The Shulammite, as a type of the church, centers on the church in resurrection and the way that the church enjoys and experiences the resurrected Christ. For the church to be in resurrection means that the church is experiencing and enjoying the resurrected Christ. Without resurrection, the church could not exist. In other words, there is no church apart from resurrection. The Body of Christ is not natural or of the old creation; rather, the Body of Christ is in resurrection and of the new creation.</p>
<p>The Christ whom we have received is the resurrected Christ. We met Him as the Spirit. In John 7:38 the Lord said, &ldquo;He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; Then verse 39 continues, &ldquo;But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; This indicates that as the Spirit, Christ is in resurrection and glory. The Christ whom we have received and whom we contact daily is the resurrected Christ. The reason that we can experience Christ is that He is in resurrection. If He were not in resurrection, we would have no way to contact and experience Him.</p>
<p> As the church, we can enjoy our Solomon-Christ and rest with Him in the love feast whenever we contact Him, because He is in resurrection and glory. According to our condition today, we do not have full rest in Christ, nor does Christ have full rest in us; however, we do have some rest, and this rest is in resurrection.</p>
<p>The records of Eve and Rebekah end with their marriages, but the record of the Shulammite begins with her marriage and the living of her marriage life. This marriage life is a life in resurrection. After Eve came out of Adam, she joined with him to become one, and her story ends there. After Rebekah was married to Isaac, little is recorded about her, and what is recorded does not typify the church. The Shulammite&rsquo;s record, however, begins with her marriage and the living of her marriage life. Her marriage life is a life in resurrection. The wedding feast of the Lamb will be in the future, but in resurrection we have already been married to Christ, we are living a marriage life, and we are in the New Jerusalem. Our present marriage life is a foretaste of the life in the New Jerusalem. The focus of the Shulammite as a type is the church in resurrection. The church is not only united with Christ but is also living a marriage life with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Meaning of Resurrection</h2>
<p>In regard to the Lord, resurrection has two aspects, and also in regard to us, resurrection has two aspects. In John 11:25 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection.&rdquo; The <em>I</em> in John 11:25 is equivalent to <em>God</em> in 1:1: &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,...and the Word was God.&rdquo; The focus on the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of John is different from the other three Gospels. Whereas the focus in the other Gospels is on His humanity, the focus in the Gospel of John is on His being God. Thus, when the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection,&rdquo; <em>I</em> refers to His being God. In 11:25 He said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life.&rdquo; There is not a similar statement in the other Gospels. In Luke the Lord Jesus is portrayed as a man, in Mark He is portrayed as a slave, and in Matthew He is portrayed as a King. These three accounts have many similarities in terms of history, geography, and miracles. The Gospel of John, however, is uniquely different. The Gospel of John emphasizes the fact that the Lord Jesus is God. Hence, He said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life,&rdquo; meaning that resurrection and life are God Himself.</p>
<p>What is resurrection? Resurrection is life, and life is God Himself. God and resurrection coexist. Because there is God, there is resurrection. Resurrection did not come into being three days after the Lord Jesus&rsquo; crucifixion. Just as God Himself is not bound by time, resurrection is not bound by time. In John 11 Martha said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.&rdquo; Jesus replied, &ldquo;Your brother will rise again,&rdquo; to which Martha responded, &ldquo;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day.&rdquo; Then Jesus said to her, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live; and everyone who lives and believes into Me shall by no means die forever. Do you believe this?&rdquo; (vv. 21-26). Martha tried to put resurrection into time, but the fact is that resurrection is not bound by time. Resurrection is God Himself. Whenever there is God, there is resurrection.</p>
<p>What is the real significance of resurrection? In order to understand spiritual experience, we must know resurrection. Resurrection is not merely life; rather, it is life that has passed through a process. In other words, resurrection is life plus that which cannot be detained or restricted. Possessing life is not the same as possessing resurrection; resurrection is life plus something that cannot be detained or restricted.</p>
<p>A seed can be compared to a grain of life. When we plant this life into the soil to bury and constrict it, it resists death from within. When this life emerges from the soil, it is resurrection, even though it is still life. Resurrection is defined in 1 Corinthians 15. Resurrection is not merely life but a life that cannot be held by anything, not even by death (Acts 2:24-32). Our God is not only life but resurrection. He cannot be held or constricted by any matter or thing. He is able to break through any and every circumstance, person, matter, or thing. Nothing can oppress Him or bind Him. Any kind of chain means nothing to Him and has no effect on Him. Therefore, the meaning of resurrection is that life breaks through all bondage, oppression, and imprisonment and is not held by them.</p>
<p>God being life and God being resurrection are different in significance. God being resurrection is more emphatic than God being life. As resurrection, life cannot be oppressed, bound, or held by any kind of environment. It overcomes death and cannot be held by death. This is resurrection. Resurrection did not come into being three days after the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion; rather, it existed before the creation of the universe. In the beginning, in eternity, God was life and resurrection. One day, this life, which is God, entered into flesh. The flesh became His confinement and prison. God was willing to enter into this prison and be restricted.</p>
<p>During the last three and a half years that the Lord was on the earth, He was despised, persecuted, interrogated, rebuked, and beaten by men; He suffered all kinds of humiliation. Outwardly, His suffering was immense, and as Jesus the Nazarene, He was despised. Nevertheless, inwardly He was full of resurrection. Resurrection was His power within. This resurrection is God Himself. The Lord was able to take the way of Jesus the Nazarene because He was in resurrection. Resurrection did not come into being when, after having experienced birth, human living, and death, He was raised from the dead. It existed in eternity past. Resurrection is God Himself.</p>
<p>This resurrection came into a man who lived in all kinds of negative environments, including men&rsquo;s persecution, oppression, and harassment; therefore, nothing could hold Him down, constrict Him, or confine Him, because He is resurrection. For thirty-three and a half years Satan, who has the might of death, tried his best to hold down resurrection by binding and limiting God. If God had not entered into flesh, Satan would have had no way to bind Him. God, however, came in the flesh, into Satan&rsquo;s hand. God seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Come on, Satan. I will let you bind Me. Heap all that you are upon Me, and try to hold Me down.&rdquo; In the end, Satan loaded death upon resurrection. However, as Acts 2 reveals, even death could not hold Him, much less trouble Him even a little. Death could not bind Him. He broke through death and came out of death. This is resurrection.</p>
<p>Resurrection existed before Christ entered into death. In Philippians 3:10 the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection.&rdquo; The power of resurrection is God Himself, the God who is able to raise the dead. The Lord Jesus was first Jesus, then the Christ. He first lived the life of a Nazarene, and then He lived the glory of Christ. This glory is something inward. Before being raised from the dead, He told Martha and Mary that He was the resurrection. During the Lord&rsquo;s human living, Satan heaped every negative matter and thing upon Him, but He came out of them. This proves that He is resurrection.</p>
<p>When we believed into the Lord, we did not only believe into the Lord who became flesh. We also believed into the Lord who died and resurrected. Romans 10:9 says, &ldquo;If you...believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.&rdquo; We do not believe into a crucified Jesus. Throughout the entire Bible, we cannot find an expression that says that we believe in the crucifixion of Jesus or that we believe into the crucified Jesus but rather that we believe into the resurrected Lord. When we believe into Him, the resurrected Lord comes into us to become our resurrection from within.</p>
<p>This word may sound difficult, but it is easy to understand in our experience. When we believed in the Lord, we may have encountered persecution and harassment from men. Outwardly, we were pressed and in pain, but inwardly there was a power that caused us to feel glorious. Although we may have wept outwardly, we were joyful inwardly. That power, glory, and joy are resurrection. They are Christ, as Solomon, in us. The Shulammite typifies the glorified church in the future, and she also typifies the church in resurrection today. The type of the Shulammite is not merely objective in the future; she is subjective and for our experience today.</p>
<p>From God&rsquo;s perspective, resurrection is divided into two stages. The first stage was in eternity before its manifestation, and the second stage is in time and is its manifestation, which began three days after the Lord Jesus&rsquo; crucifixion when He was raised from the dead. Before that day, resurrection existed. At times, it was manifested to a limited degree. A small manifestation of resurrection occurred on the day of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; transfiguration on the mountain. During His last three and a half years on the earth, He never fell or failed, and no matter how people oppressed and threatened Him, He never changed. This also was a manifestation of resurrection. Resurrection is not something that man can produce; it can only be manifested.</p>
<p>During the Boxer Rebellion a brother was saved because he saw and was touched by the manifestation of resurrection. At that time he was only a teenager, an apprentice in a store in Peking. At the peak of the Boxers&rsquo;s rioting, when they were brutally killing the Christians, many stores in the city closed. One day he was in the store. Upon hearing the shouting and crying in the street, he peeked through a crack in the door and saw some of the Boxers with turbans on their heads and swords in their hands, ferociously escorting a wagon on which a twenty-year-old woman was being carried to the execution ground. She was to be put to death because she was not willing to deny the Lord&rsquo;s name. Anyone would be frightened in such a situation. In those days the girls in China rarely went out of their rooms or houses, but strangely the young woman sitting in the wagon was not at all afraid. She was rejoicing and singing hymns of praise. When the young man in the store saw this scene, he was deeply touched and impressed with what he had seen.</p>
<p>He received the Lord because of what he saw, and later he gave up everything, saying, &ldquo;I also want to go out to preach the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; On that day, when the sister was being dragged away by the Boxers to be executed, resurrection was manifested. Before the Lord Jesus died and resurrected, He suffered much pain and difficulties caused by men; however, in every situation He manifested resurrection until, one day, He entered fully into resurrection. This is the scene of His death and resurrection. Today the church is the same. One day, all the dead saints will be raised, and all the living saints will be transfigured and raptured, and we will enter fully into resurrection. However, even before that day comes, we can live in resurrection.</p>
<p>Today resurrection is in us. Many times we suffer reproach and hardship from men and are confronted with tests and temptations; nevertheless, we are able to stand because we still have God&rsquo;s presence and the Lord&rsquo;s glory. The result is the manifestation of resurrection. Both in relation to the Lord Jesus and to us, there are two stages of resurrection. In regard to the church in resurrection, typified by the Shulammite, there are also two stages; however, the emphasis is not on the second stage but the first, that is, in regard to our subjective experience.</p>
<p>The Shulammite&rsquo;s living with Solomon in the palaces of ivory typifies the church fellowshipping with Christ in the Holy of Holies. The emphasis is not on resurrection in the future but on living in resurrection today. To be a Christian is to be one who lives in resurrection. Christians are those who live in resurrection. Only those who are in resurrection are Christians; those who are in themselves are not Christians. God never intended for us to take the way of the cross by our own strong perseverance and reliance on ourselves. Instead, He comes into us in resurrection to be our power, supporting and motivating us to take the way of the cross.</p>
<p>Outwardly speaking, the way of the cross is harsh, but those who take this way realize that there is a power within them. This power is God coming into us in resurrection to be our &ldquo;Solomon,&rdquo; supporting and motivating us to take the way that David took and to live the life that David lived. We are Solomon inwardly and David outwardly. Inwardly we are the Shulammite, and outwardly we are Abigail. These are not two separate experiences; rather, the two exist simultaneously, one being inward and the other being outward.</p>
<p>To a certain degree, we have experienced being Solomon and David. Even though we suffer difficulties and hardships and are sons of sorrow who are persecuted and wander about in the wilderness, within there are a power and a fellowship that are sweet and glorious. We have God, the Spirit, and &ldquo;Solomon&rdquo;&mdash;the resurrected Christ&mdash;within us. Hence, the apostle Paul could say, &ldquo;To know...the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death&rdquo; (Phil. 3:10). Inwardly, Christ, as typified by Solomon, enables us to take the way of Jesus the Nazarene, as typified by David. A Christian with this kind of experience is deep and matches the biblical standard.</p>
<p>Although the marriage of the Lamb will take place in the future, according to our experience, in resurrection we have already been united with and married to Christ. In resurrection we are already the New Jerusalem and are living our marriage life. According to the central focus of the type of the Shulammite, our life is a life of foretaste. In resurrection the church has been united with Christ and is one with Him.</p><h2 class="head3">Three Crucial Points</h2>
<p>We must pay attention to three crucial points. First, the names <em>Shulammite</em> and <em>Solomon</em> have the same root, just as <em>Christian</em> and <em>Christ</em> have the same root. <em>Solomon</em> is the masculine form of the word, and <em>Shulammite</em> is the feminine form. The meaning of the root is peace. This means that in resurrection the church has the peace of Christ and is peace.</p>
<p>Second, Psalm 45 shows that Solomon is the experience and beauty of the Shulammite. The experience and beauty of the Shulammite are Solomon himself. Likewise, the experience and the beauty of the church are Christ. All that the church has passed through over the past two thousand years and the beauty of the church are of the Christ of resurrection, typified by the gold covering the Shulammite, her garment of woven work inwrought with gold, and her embroidered clothing (vv. 13-14).</p>
<p>Third, there is a complete union and full satisfaction between the Shulammite and Solomon, and in this satisfaction there is rest. Although the type of Eve shows her union and satisfaction with Adam and although the type of Rebekah shows her union with Isaac and Isaac&rsquo;s being comforted, these are not the main points of these two types. In the type of the Shulammite, however, the main point is the union and satisfaction between her and Solomon. At the end of Song of Songs, the Shulammite and Solomon have reached complete harmony with full satisfaction and endless rest without any distraction or interruption; this typifies the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The union and satisfaction between the Shulammite and Solomon typify the complete union and full satisfaction that exist between Christ and the church. In this satisfaction, Christ and the church are living a life of satisfaction and peace in endless rest. Rest and satisfaction are characteristics of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Conclusion</h2>
<p>A clear picture of the church can be seen by looking at the various aspects related to the seven women who serve as types of the church in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>First, as seen in the type of Eve, the church comes out of Christ and is born of Christ, having Christ&rsquo;s nature and being one with Christ.</p>
<p>Second, as seen in the type of Rebekah, God sent the Holy Spirit to the earth after Christ&rsquo;s ascension, to the place of the Lord&rsquo;s kinsmen according to His humanity, and the Holy Spirit called out a group of people to be Christ&rsquo;s counterpart, the church. At the end of this age, close to the evening, Christ will come out of His tabernacle, His dwelling place, and go to the field, the earth, to meet the church who has been led to Him by the Holy Spirit, and He will join with the church as one for their mutual satisfaction.</p>
<p>Third, as seen in the type of Asenath, the church was obtained in the world by Christ. When Christ was forsaken by men, He became the Savior of men; when He was in the world ministering life, He obtained a wife, the church.</p>
<p>Fourth, as seen in the type of Zipporah, the church was obtained by Christ in the wilderness. When Christ was forsaken by men and was wandering in the wilderness, He took a wife, the church. She is His companion in His wandering in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Fifth, as seen in the type of Ruth, the church is able to receive Christ&rsquo;s redemption and enjoy God&rsquo;s lawful blessing because her former husband, the old man, has died. Ruth&rsquo;s story speaks of redemption in detail. We were of the old man and were fallen, but because of the death of the old man, we have been delivered from our fallen position and are joined as one with Christ to inherit God&rsquo;s lawful blessing and to be fully redeemed.</p>
<p>Sixth, as seen in the type of Abigail, the church is composed of a group of people who by nature were those who forsook and opposed Christ. But one day her old nature was struck and died. She was then united with David. She passed through sufferings with David and became David&rsquo;s counterpart in warfare. In our old nature we forsook Christ, opposed Christ, and rejected Christ. But one day we were struck, and our old nature died. We were then united with Christ, and now we are following Him in the midst of all kinds of sufferings to fight for God&rsquo;s kingdom as the warring church.</p>
<p>Seventh, as seen in the type of the Shulammite, the church obtains full satisfaction and eternal rest through her union with Christ and her experience and enjoyment of Christ in His resurrection. Eventually, she becomes the New Jerusalem. The Shulammite typifies a living of complete rest and satisfaction.</p>
<p>These seven women are seven types of the church. They depict the church in a clear way: as coming out of Christ, being called out from the world, ministering together with Christ the bread of life in the world, wandering in the wilderness with Christ, receiving the redemption of Christ, warring by following Christ to fight for God&rsquo;s kingdom, and eventually becoming Christ&rsquo;s counterpart and reigning with Him in glory.</p>
<p>The sequence of these women as types of the church is truly wonderful. These seven types show, first, the producing of the church and nature of the church; second, the church coming out from the world; third, the church being in the world but not of the world (John 17:16); fourth, the church wandering in the wilderness; fifth, the church being redeemed; sixth, the church engaging in warfare; and seventh, the church reigning and being glorified. If we put these seven aspects together, we can see a complete picture of the church and have a thorough understanding of the church. We know where the church comes from, what way she should take as she is passing through the earth today, and what she eventually will be in the future. What a picture!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</h1>
<p>The types in the Old Testament concerning the church can be divided into two main categories: women and dwelling places&mdash;the tabernacle, the temple, and a city. The children of Israel connect these two categories.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Children of Israel</h2>
<p>The children of Israel connect two categories because God considers the children of Israel as a corporate woman as well as His habitation. In the Old Testament, God regarded the children of Israel as His spouse, His wife. Such terms can be found in Nehemiah, Ezekiel, and Isaiah. Hence, the children of Israel stand before God in the position of a woman. Moreover, the children of Israel also typify God&rsquo;s habitation because they were corporately God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth. Before God, the children of Israel are not only a woman but also God&rsquo;s habitation. In like manner, the New Jerusalem is both a woman and a habitation (Rev. 21:2).</p>
<p>Ephesians clearly says that the church is Christ&rsquo;s counterpart (5:31-32) and that the church is also God&rsquo;s dwelling place (2:22). In addition, Revelation speaks of the New Jerusalem as the wife of the Lamb (21:2, 9), indicating that the church is God&rsquo;s dwelling place as well as His counterpart. In Old Testament typology, the children of Israel connect the two types concerning the church by being both a woman and a dwelling place. Thus, in the children of Israel we see both a woman and a dwelling place.</p>
<p>In the types of Eve, Rebekah, and the Shulammite, we cannot see the aspect of a dwelling place, and in the types of the tabernacle and the city we cannot see the aspect of a woman. We can see the aspects of a woman and a dwelling place only in the children of Israel. Hence, the type of the children of Israel is complete and whole. With them there is a beginning, a process, and a conclusion. Each of the seven women who are types of the church focus on a particular aspect of the church. In contrast, the children of Israel typify the church in its beginning, its process, and its culmination.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 5 speaks of the Feast of the Passover, indicating that the children of Israel&rsquo;s keeping of the passover typifies the church&rsquo;s corporate keeping of Christ as the reality of the passover. Verse 7 says, &ldquo;Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened; for our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed.&rdquo; This means that our keeping of the feast is not an individual matter, in which one person keeps the feast today and another keeps it tomorrow; rather, everyone needs to keep the feast at the same time. In God&rsquo;s eyes we all, including the apostles Peter and Paul, keep the feast at the same time.</p>
<p>According to the type of the passover, it is not that one Israelite would repent, kill a lamb, and keep the passover on the first day of the first month, while another would repent, kill a lamb, and keep the passover on the fourteenth day of the same month. Instead, all God&rsquo;s people kept the passover at the same time on the same day. Hence, 1 Corinthians 5 speaks of the church corporately keeping the feast; it does not speak of individual salvation.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 10 also speaks of the processes through which the Israelites passed. Their exodus from Egypt and their journey in the wilderness typify the church coming out of the world and journeying in the wilderness. Hebrews 3 and 4 reveal that even though the children of Israel came out of Egypt and passed through the wilderness, only a few entered into Canaan to obtain the rest. These chapters do not refer to the believers individually but to the church as a whole.</p>
<p>These portions in the New Testament prove that the story of the children of Israel coming out of Egypt and entering into Canaan is a type of the church. This type does not focus on a single aspect of the church&rsquo;s experience; rather, it is a complete and systematic type with a beginning, a process, and a culmination.</p><h2 class="head3">Being Chosen by God Beforehand</h2>
<p>Before God saved the children of Israel, He chose them to be His people. Hence, the children of Israel are God&rsquo;s elect, that is, a people chosen by God. This typifies the church being chosen by God in Christ before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Going Down to Egypt</h2>
<p>The children of Israel went down to Egypt and fell into Pharaoh&rsquo;s hand, typifying the church, chosen by God in eternity, falling into the satanic world under the authority of Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Redeemed by God</h2>
<p>The children of Israel kept the passover in Egypt, typifying the church being redeemed by God. The church not only fell into the world and was under the authority of Satan, but she also fell into sin and was under God&rsquo;s condemnation. Hence, she needed the redemption of Christ as the Passover.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Rescued from the World</h2>
<p>The children of Israel came out of Egypt, that is, the world. When they came out of Egypt, they crossed the Red Sea. The crossing of the Red Sea typifies the baptism of the church, signifying that the church died with Christ and has been buried with Him. There is a sea that separates God&rsquo;s people from Egypt, and this sea is the water of baptism. This sea separates the church from the world. The church has come out of the world, having passed through baptism. Baptism is a deliverance; it delivers us from the world. By being buried in baptism, we are separated from the world.</p>
<p>There are two aspects in God&rsquo;s complete salvation: redemption and salvation. Fallen man is under God&rsquo;s condemnation and the bondage of Satan. In regard to God&rsquo;s condemnation, there is the need for the shedding of the blood of the Lamb for redemption. In regard to the bondage of Satan, there is a need to be saved by God&rsquo;s arm and God&rsquo;s great power. According to the sequence of the fall, man fell first under the authority of Satan and then under God&rsquo;s condemnation. However, according to the sequence of God&rsquo;s salvation, we are first redeemed from condemnation and then saved from bondage.</p>
<p>The children of Israel kept the passover by killing the lamb and applying the blood. In God&rsquo;s eyes, this is a matter of redemption; this is a matter of substitution, not of power. The lamb suffered God&rsquo;s judgment on behalf of the children of Israel. Later when the children of Israel fled Egypt, the Egyptian army followed them and was drowned in the Red Sea. At that time, the Israelites saw God&rsquo;s arm, God&rsquo;s power. This was not a matter of substitution but of power. In our salvation these two events occurred simultaneously. Because of the blood of the Lord Jesus, we escaped God&rsquo;s condemnation and were forgiven and justified by God. At the same time, the power of the Holy Spirit came upon us to save us out of the authority of Satan and to deliver us from the bondage of Egypt.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Journeying through the Wilderness</h2>
<p>Egypt typifies the world in which people are usurped by Satan and where God&rsquo;s elect are under Satan&rsquo;s usurpation, whereas the wilderness refers to the world in which people wander and the place through which God&rsquo;s elect pass. God&rsquo;s elect are in the world before their salvation, and they wander in the wilderness after their salvation. On the one hand, the church has come out of the usurping world of Satan; on the other hand, the church remains on the earth, wandering in the wilderness as a sojourner without roots in the earth. The journey in the wilderness also typifies the period of the church&rsquo;s immaturity. During this period of immaturity and wandering, the church has yet to attain to God&rsquo;s purpose or come up to God&rsquo;s standard.</p>
<p>There is a twofold significance in the type of the children of Israel crossing the Red Sea and journeying through the wilderness. On the one hand, the church is a sojourner, a pilgrim, and a wanderer on the earth; on the other hand, the church has not yet reached maturity, come up to God&rsquo;s standard, or arrived at the heavenly Canaan. To the church, both Egypt and the wilderness typify the world. Egypt typifies the world that usurps people, and the wilderness typifies the world in which people wander. Egypt is the place where God&rsquo;s chosen people were usurped, and the wilderness is the place where God&rsquo;s elect journeyed. Before we were saved, we were in Egypt; after we are saved, we are in the wilderness. Before our salvation, we were under the usurpation of the world; after our salvation, we are sojourning in the world. In the world we are not settled but journeying from place to place as sojourners and pilgrims. Because God&rsquo;s elect were sojourners and pilgrims, the tabernacle that followed them was portable, having no permanent attachment to the earth, and was not as a house built in a fixed location. The type of the children of Israel in the wilderness indicates that the church is still wandering and journeying in the world and that the church has not yet matured, attained God&rsquo;s purpose, or entered the spiritual Canaan.</p><h2 class="head3">Failing in the Wilderness</h2>
<p>The history of the children of Israel in the wilderness is altogether a history of failures. It took them a total of thirty-eight years to travel from their crossing of the Red Sea to their crossing of the Jordan River. During this period of time, the situation of the children of Israel can be described as a huge failure, and it typifies the condition of failure in the church. All the problems in the church are illustrated by the failures of the Israelites. This picture truly describes the repeated failures of the church.</p>
<p>After reading the history of the failures of the children of Israel, we may become discouraged and disappointed, because out of all those who left Egypt, only two&mdash;Joshua and Caleb&mdash;entered into Canaan. Joshua and Caleb did not fail, but the rest of the Israelites failed. This discouraging situation shows that those who failed were the older ones. The fact that the older Israelites failed in the wilderness bears a twofold significance. On one hand, the older ones typify those who fail in the church, and on the other hand, because they were born in Egypt, they typify the element of the old creation within the church. Once the old Israelites all died, the new Israelites were able to enter into Canaan. This signifies that our old creation must die during the period of wandering so that the new creation can attain God&rsquo;s goal of entering into Canaan.</p>
<p>The stories of failure among the children of Israel in the wilderness indicate that those who failed typify those who fail in the church, and the matters in which the children of Israel failed typify the matters in which the church fails. This type exposes the failures in the church. For example, in one of the seven epistles in Revelation the incident of Balaam is mentioned, indicating that the failures of the Israelites typify the failures of the church (Rev. 2:14). The failure of the older Israelites indicates that only when the nature of the old creation dies can the church achieve God&rsquo;s purpose. The new generation of the children of Israel did not enter Canaan until the old generation, which had come out of Egypt, died. The type of the crossing of the Jordan River clearly reveals that all who entered the land of Canaan passed through the water of the Jordan River. Through this crossing, their old man was buried, and they were resurrected from the dead. They were no longer old but had become new. Only those who are new are able to enter Canaan and reach God&rsquo;s destination.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Crossing the Jordan River</h2>
<p>The main significance of baptism is that the world is buried. In our experience, however, there is a second burial in which our old man is buried in the Jordan River. When the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, they were delivered from Egypt. Their failures in the wilderness, however, were not related to Egypt but to their old man. Hence, in order to cross over the Jordan and enter into the land of Canaan, the nature of their old creation needed to be terminated. In the same way, although the world was buried through baptism, our baptism was only the beginning of our following God. We still need to journey through the wilderness and cross over the Jordan, burying our old man, to enter into Canaan.</p>
<p>The main significance of crossing the Jordan is that the old man died and that the new man was raised up. The Egyptian army was buried in the Red Sea, but the Israelites themselves were buried in the waters of the Jordan River. The children of Israel left twelve stones in the Jordan River, signifying that their old man was buried in the water. Moreover, they took twelve stones from the river and brought them to the other side of the river into the land of Canaan (Josh. 4). This typifies that the new generation of Israel attained God&rsquo;s goal. This signifies that when our old man is buried in the death of Christ, God&rsquo;s purpose can be accomplished by the new man.</p>
<p>This type has two points of significance. First, when the church truly crosses the Jordan, the old creation will pass away, and everything will be of the new creation. This fulfills God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Second, the church, as well as the individual believers, is still in the spiritual process of progressing in life. Once the children of Israel crossed through the Jordan, their life of wandering in the wilderness came to an end. In terms of practical spiritual experience, once the church experiences the termination of the old creation, it begins to live in the new creation. The termination of the old creation occurs in the water of the Jordan River. After crossing the Jordan River, spiritual warfare begins.</p>
<p>What was buried in the Red Sea is entirely different from what was buried in the Jordan River. Whereas the water of the Red Sea buried the Egyptian army, the water of the Jordan River buried the children of Israel. When we were baptized, although we died with the Lord and were buried with Him, according to our experience the world was buried. Thus, we must experience a second burial, that is, the crossing of the Jordan. The crossing of the Jordan signifies that the life of wandering has ended and that our self has been terminated in Christ&rsquo;s death. These two waters typify Christ&rsquo;s death: one dealing with the world in us, and the other dealing with our self. Dealing with the world enables us to begin our journey of following the Lord; however, because the old creation, the flesh, and the self are still present, we wander. The failures of the children of Israel in the wilderness were not related to Egypt but were the result of the flesh and the self. Once the flesh, self, and old creation were dead and buried in the Jordan River, the new man rose up and entered into Canaan as the destination.</p><h2 class="head3">Entering into Canaan</h2>
<p>Canaan has a twofold significance in typology. On the one hand, it typifies the riches of Christ, and on the other hand, it typifies the heavenlies; both of these aspects are spoken of in Ephesians. Ephesians 3:8 speaks of the riches of Christ, and Ephesians 1:3 and 2:6 speak of the heavenlies. In this sense, the book of Joshua in the Old Testament is comparable to Ephesians in the New Testament. Both books are a record of &ldquo;Canaan.&rdquo; In regard to Canaan, there is the matter of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ and the matter of spiritual warfare. As soon as the children of Israel entered Canaan, they enjoyed the riches of Canaan and engaged in warfare. This means that when the church fulfills God&rsquo;s purpose, it immediately enjoys the riches of Christ and engages in spiritual warfare. These two matters are spoken of after the children of Israel entered Canaan in the book of Joshua and after the church was raised to the heavenlies in the book of Ephesians.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Typifying the Riches of Christ</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament three items are often mentioned to describe the riches of the land of Canaan: milk, honey, and grapes. Milk and honey are riches produced through the mingling of the vegetable life and the animal life. Milk comes from cattle and sheep, which feed on grass. Therefore, milk is a product of the animal life plus the vegetable life. Bees are animals, and flowers are plants. Bees gather nectar from flowers and produce honey. Hence, honey is also a product of the animal life plus the vegetable life. In a place without animal life or vegetable life, there can be no milk or honey. A place with milk and honey is a place full of life and full of the riches of life.</p>
<p>The unleavened bread, bitter herbs, and manna, which the children of Israel ate in Egypt and in the wilderness, typify Christ, but they do not typify the riches of Christ. It was not until the children of Israel entered Canaan, a place flowing with milk and honey, that they enjoyed the riches of Christ. A beautiful aspect of the type of Canaan is that it typifies the riches of Christ. In the good land two men were needed to carry a single cluster of grapes on a pole (Num. 13:23). The produce of the land was rich. The produce of the sixth year was sufficient to sustain the children of Israel for three years because no sowing was done on the seventh year (Lev. 25:4, 19-21). This portrays the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>In the land of Canaan there was not only milk and honey but also grapes. In the Bible, grapes produce the cheering wine (Judg. 9:13; Psa. 104:15). Hence, wine from grapes typifies the salvation of life. All the riches of the land of Canaan are related to life and the riches of life, typifying the riches in Christ. The riches of Christ recorded in Ephesians 3:8 are typified by the riches of the land of Canaan. The entrance of God&rsquo;s people into the land of Canaan signifies their entrance into the unsearchable riches of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Typifying the Heavenlies Spoken of in Ephesians</h2>
<p>Canaan also typifies the heavenlies spoken of in Ephesians. The land of Canaan not only yielded rich produce but also contained many enemies&mdash;the seven tribes of Canaan. These tribes typify the rulers, the authorities, the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies spoken of in Ephesians 6:12, that is, Satan and his angels. In the rich realm of Canaan there is still the need for warfare. The object of the warfare is not to deal with sin or the flesh but to deal with the devil.</p>
<p>When the church concludes her life of wandering in the wilderness and enters into the riches of Christ, she simultaneously enters into a spiritual warfare. At this time, there is the enjoyment of the riches of Christ, and there is the spiritual warfare. On one hand, the church enjoys all the riches of Canaan, but on the other hand, she engages in warfare to deal with God&rsquo;s enemy.</p>
<p>Both Joshua in the Old Testament and Ephesians in the New Testament speak of the enjoyment of the riches and spiritual warfare. These two books show that when the church measures up to God&rsquo;s standard, she enjoys the riches of Christ and bears the responsibility to fight for God&rsquo;s kingdom. In this warfare the church does not deal with the world, sin, or the flesh but with the forces of Satan, the rulers and the authorities of the air, typified by the seven tribes of Canaan in Joshua. These tribes harassed and opposed the children of Israel in every way. Hence, the record of the warfare in Joshua, Judges, and 1 and 2 Samuel is related to chapters 2, 3, and 6 of Ephesians, and it demonstrates the principles in spiritual warfare, including how the church can gain the victory and under what circumstances she can be defeated.</p><h2 class="head3">Establishing the Kingdom</h2>
<p>Once the children of Israel entered Canaan, they began to engage in warfare. This warfare continued until the time of David. Joshua was the first to enter Canaan, and he began to wage war. After him, various judges continued to fight for God. Samuel was a judge, and he too fought on behalf of the children of Israel. David followed Samuel and also fought for God&rsquo;s people. Through warfare, God&rsquo;s kingdom was brought in. Hence, the riches of Christ and the spiritual warfare have the purpose and result of bringing in the kingdom of God. The final result of the church&rsquo;s warfare is to bring in God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>Revelation 12 shows that the overcomers will war with Satan, the result of which will be the coming of the kingdom of God (v. 10). Today some in the church are in the wilderness, and others are already in Canaan fighting for God. The result of this warfare is that Satan will be cast down from the air and then from the earth, at which time the authority of God, the kingdom of God, will be brought to the earth. This will be Christ&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, after the kingdom of Israel was established, Solomon, the king of peace, sat upon the throne (1 Kings 2:12). This typifies the second coming of the Lord Jesus. Both the coming of the Lord Jesus and the establishment of the kingdom are the result of the warfare. We need to fight continually until the kingdom is established and the King of peace is enthroned; that is, we need to fight until the authority of God is brought to the earth, until Christ comes back, and until He becomes the King of peace on the throne of God, governing and ruling over everything. The children of Israel in each stage of their history are a type of the church in its various stages.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Desolate</h2>
<p>Not long after David and Solomon established the kingdom of Israel, the kingdom became desolate. At the completion of the temple, on the day when the temple was dedicated to God by Solomon, the glory of God filled the house (2 Chron. 7:1), demonstrating that God was with His people. However, not long after that the children of Israel were defeated in warfare, became desolate, and were finally carried away in captivity to Babylon. The establishment of the kingdom of Israel and the building of the temple typify the church bringing in the kingdom of God, attaining to God&rsquo;s purpose, and being full of glory. This was the situation of the church at Pentecost.</p>
<p>By the time Solomon dedicated the temple to God, he had already succeeded David, typifying that the Christ in glory had succeeded the suffering Jesus. On the day of Pentecost the apostle Peter said, &ldquo;The God of our fathers has raised Jesus, whom you slew by hanging Him on a tree. This One God has exalted to His right hand as Leader and Savior&rdquo; (Acts 5:30-31). According to the type, the age of David was already over, and the age of Solomon had begun, an age in which a temple was built on the earth and dedicated to God to be His habitation. The glory of God filled that temple. This typifies the Spirit of God filling the disciples on the day of Pentecost. The situation on the day that Solomon dedicated the temple to God, when it was filled with the glory of God, typifies the situation of the church on the day of Pentecost.</p>
<p>Shortly after the completion of the temple, however, the children of Israel failed and became desolate. This desolation typifies the desolation of the church after Pentecost. This is seen in the examples of Jezebel and Balaam. In the seven epistles in Revelation, Balaam is mentioned (2:14), showing that the failures of the children of Israel typify the failures of the church. Later, Jezebel (v. 20) and Babylon (17:5; 18:2) are also mentioned. This shows that the desolation of the children of Israel typifies the desolation of the church after Pentecost.</p>
<p>Because of the desolation, the children of Israel were taken captive to Babylon (2 Kings 24:13-16). In God&rsquo;s eyes, Babylon is equivalent to Rome. The children of Israel being taken captive to Babylon typifies the church being taken captive to Rome. Revelation 2 speaks of the church in Thyatira (v. 18) and of Jezebel (v. 20). The church in Thyatira denotes the apostate Roman Catholic Church. Rome is Babylon. The main reason that the children of Israel were taken captive to Babylon was due to the sins of Jezebel and Ahab. Jezebel taught the house of Ahab to worship idols, thus provoking God to anger (1 Kings 16:29-33), and as a result, the children of Israel were carried away into exile. The case of Jezebel depicts the desolation of the children of Israel and typifies the desolation of the church. The result of the desolation of the church is its being taken captive to Rome, that is, to Babylon.</p>
<p>In Revelation 17 the church has fallen into Babylon (vv. 1-6). Hence, a voice out of heaven is heard, saying, &ldquo;Come out of her, My people, that you do not participate in her sins and that you do not receive her plagues&rdquo; (18:4). <em>Her</em> refers to Babylon the Great, which points to Rome. According to Revelation 17:9, the woman Babylon the Great is sitting on the seven mountains, which correspond to the seven hills upon which Rome was built.</p>
<p>If we want to understand the desolation of the church, we need to carefully study the historical record of the period extending from Solomon to the deportation to Babylon; that is, we need to study 1 and 2 Kings and 1 and 2 Chronicles. These four books fully depict the desolation of the church. We should not consider these books merely as a history of the Israelites but as a portrait of the church. For example, what Jeroboam did in 1 Kings 12:26-30 is exactly what deformed Christianity does today. Likewise, Jezebel&rsquo;s causing the children of Israel to be carried away to Babylon parallels the church&rsquo;s being taken captive to Rome. Hence, Israel&rsquo;s desolation typifies the desolation of the church.</p>
<p>The entire Bible speaks of Christ and the church. In Genesis 2 there is a couple: Adam and Eve. From that time onward, the Bible continues to speak of Adam and Eve. At the end of the Scriptures, there is the wedding feast of the Lamb. The Lamb, Christ, is typified by Adam, and the woman He marries, the church, is typified by Eve. Between Adam and Eve and the marriage feast of the Lamb is the story of Christ and the church. We should never think that the books of 1 and 2 Kings and 1 and 2 Chronicles are only speaking of the history of the Israelites. Without the revelation of the Holy Spirit, we would consider these books to be merely history books; however, those who have spiritual insight realize that what is recorded in 1 and 2 Kings and 1 and 2 Chronicles is a picture of the church, a revelation concerning the church that depicts the desolation of the church on the earth.</p>
<p>If we read only the New Testament, we would not be able to clearly know the church. However, if we thoroughly study the Old Testament, we will see a clear picture of the church. We will realize that the failures of the church today are the same as those of the children of Israel. We will also see that the church is desolate just as the children of Israel became desolate shortly after building the temple. Moreover, we will see that the church has been taken into captivity just as the children of Israel were carried away to Babylon. If we take the history in the Old Testament as a picture of the church, we will see a detailed type of the church. The Bible is a living book by which we may know Christ and the church. These two great items&mdash;Christ and the church&mdash;are actually one. They are the Husband and the wife.</p><h2 class="head3">Being Recovered</h2>
<p>When Solomon dedicated the temple to God, there were priests in the temple and kings in the city. The temple was the holy temple, and the city was the city of Jerusalem. The priests were Levites, and the temple was where God&rsquo;s presence was found and God&rsquo;s glory was manifested. The kings were Israelites, and the city was where God reigned and His will was carried out unhindered. The priests and the kings took heed to the word of God, that is, the revelation of God and the books of law.</p>
<p>Later the kingdom of Israel became desolate, the temple and the city were lost, and the books of law were taken away. This means that the presence of God, the authority of God, and the revelation of God were lost. According to the history of the church, the church also became desolate, losing the presence, authority, and revelation of God. When the church degraded into Roman Catholicism, God&rsquo;s presence and authority were lost, and all that remained was human rule (cf. Rev. 2:20). The revelation of God was also lost, and the church became filled with the teachings of the deep things of Satan (v. 24) and human opinions.</p>
<p>When God began His work of recovery, He carried it out according to three lines: the temple of God, the city of God, and the word of God. People such as Ezra, Zerubbabel, and Nehemiah came out of Babylon and returned to the original ground to rebuild the temple and the city. Particular heed was given to recovering the word of God. Ezra mainly recovered the teaching of the law of the Old Testament. His expounding of the law in the Scriptures was even more enlightening than the Scriptural exposition at the time of Moses (Ezra 7:6, 10). The final two lines in the recovery work of God include the temple and the city. The temple is a matter of God&rsquo;s presence; the city is a matter of His authority. The temple was recovered by Zerubbabel, and the city was recovered by Nehemiah. Ezra, as a scribe, recovered the priesthood, and Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, as heads of the province, represented the kingship.</p>
<p>The recovery consists of three things: the recovery of God&rsquo;s word, God&rsquo;s presence, and God&rsquo;s authority. Since Martin Luther, there have been some Zerubbabels, Ezras, and Nehemiahs in the process of the recovery of the church. When we read the books that these ones have written, we sense that a certain one was an Ezra and that another was a Zerubbabel or a Nehemiah. Some recovered the matter of the authority of God and the word of God, and others recovered the matter of fellowshipping with God, which is the recovery of the temple. For example, George M&#252;ller surely had the presence of God, which is represented by the temple.</p>
<p>The recovery of the children of Israel in the Old Testament is a precise type of the recovery of the church in the New Testament. In the period of recovery, the light that the teachers among the Brethren received was far beyond what others had previously seen, especially in relation to the word of God. The recovery of God&rsquo;s word is a great matter in the Lord&rsquo;s work of recovery. Of course, the temple and the city also needed to be recovered. The temple is related to God&rsquo;s image, whereas the city is related to God&rsquo;s authority. The two lines of image and authority spoken of in Genesis 1 continue all the way to Revelation. First, the recovery of the temple occurred, that is, the recovery of God&rsquo;s presence, God&rsquo;s image; then came the recovery of the city, the recovery of God&rsquo;s authority. Ezra brought in the recovery of God&rsquo;s word, Zerubbabel brought in the recovery of the temple, and Nehemiah brought in the recovery of the city. The history of the recovery of the church is the history of the recovery of the word of God, the temple, and the city.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ&rsquo;s Second Coming</h2>
<p>The books of Zechariah and Malachi speak of awaiting Christ&rsquo;s coming. After the children of Israel were recovered, even though they still had weaknesses and failures, they had a glorious hope: the coming of Christ. In the church the matters of the word of God, the temple, and the city have been recovered to a certain degree. In certain ones we are able to see God&rsquo;s presence in a strong way, which is the recovery of the temple. In others we are able to see God&rsquo;s authority, which is the recovery of the city. Moreover, God&rsquo;s word is transparent in the church and is filling the church. Throughout the past two thousand years the Bible has never been so thoroughly known by men as it is today. We can say that today in the church the Bible is a transparent book. In the age of Moses, men&rsquo;s knowledge of the law was not as clear as it was in the age of Ezra. In the same way, in the church today the Bible is much more transparent to us than it was fifteen hundred years ago. This is the recovery work of God.</p>
<p>The word of God is recovered, the temple is recovered, and the city is also recovered. Although desolation still exists, in the midst of the desolation there is a continual recovery with a glorious hope: the second coming of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(5)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TABERNACLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head2">The Tabernacle</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will see how the tabernacle typifies the church (Exo. 26:15-30; 36:20-34). The tabernacle came into existence when the people of Israel left Egypt and came to Mount Sinai to serve God. The tabernacle was the center of children of Israel, and the twelve tribes of Israel encamped around the tabernacle. The tabernacle also was the means through which they served God. When the people of Israel gathered together, they met at the entrance of the tabernacle (29:42); hence, the tabernacle was called the Tent of Meeting.</p>
<p>As a type, the tabernacle, or Tent of Meeting, bears four significances. First, the tabernacle typifies the Lord Jesus Himself. John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; <em>Tabernacled</em> in Greek means &ldquo;pitched a tent.&rdquo; The incarnation of the Lord Jesus was God&rsquo;s tabernacling among men. He dwelt among men through His tabernacling in the flesh. Thus, the first significance of the tabernacle is that the Lord Jesus was manifested in the flesh among men. Just as the tabernacle was God&rsquo;s dwelling place for man to enter and meet God, so Christ is the dwelling place of God for man to contact God. In other words, the incarnation of the Lord Jesus provided God with a tabernacle, a place for Him to dwell on earth. The Lord&rsquo;s coming to the earth in the flesh was His becoming a tabernacle, in which God could dwell on the earth among men. Just as man was able to fellowship with God in the tabernacle, man was able to contact God in the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Second, the tabernacle typifies the church. The tabernacle as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth is an exact portrait of the church as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth. Ephesians 2:22 says, &ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; This verse points out that the church is God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth. Moreover, the church is the enlargement of Christ. Just as Christ is the tabernacle of God, so God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth is the church.</p>
<p>Third, the tabernacle typifies the saints. Every saint is a temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:19). Hence, the tabernacle also typifies the saints.</p>
<p>Fourth, the tabernacle typifies the coming New Jerusalem. Revelation 21:3 clearly says that the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God with men; God will tabernacle with men there.</p>
<p>In terms of the church as a whole, the church is the tabernacle of God. In terms of the members of the church, every believer is a tabernacle of God, a temple of God, a habitation of God. In the future the totality of all God&rsquo;s redeemed throughout the ages will be a great tabernacle, the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem will be the habitation of God on earth. Before this reality becomes manifest, there is a picture, a type in the Old Testament, which portrays how God will obtain a dwelling place, a tabernacle, on earth. In this chapter, we will focus on the second significance of the tabernacle, which is the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Base of the Tabernacle</h2>
<p>As a tent, the tabernacle had a simple construction and thus required a solid base in order to stand firm. The base of the tabernacle was composed of sockets made of the expiation silver spoken of in Exodus 30:11-16; thus, silver denotes redemption. The sockets made of the expiation silver typify that the base of the church, that is, the standing of the church before God, is the redemption of Christ. Exodus says that each socket was a talent of silver (38:27). One talent is approximately one hundred pounds, or forty-five kilograms (cf. Rev. 16:21). There were one hundred silver sockets in the tabernacle, representing a significant amount of weight.</p>
<p>If the silver sockets were not weighty, they would not have been able to stabilize the tabernacle. During the journeying of the children of Israel&rsquo;s journeying in the wilderness, the whole tabernacle would have blown away if the base of the tabernacle had not been stable. Therefore, in order to stabilize the tabernacle, the silver sockets had to be very weighty. The tabernacle&rsquo;s ability to stand firm when it was erected depended on the silver sockets underneath. This shows that the church has a standing, a base, before God, which is stable and unshakable and which cannot be swayed or shaken by any turmoil. This base is Christ&rsquo;s redemption, typified by the silver sockets.</p><h2 class="head3">The Boards of the Tabernacle</h2>
<p>The boards of the tabernacle were standing boards (Exo. 26:15). The tabernacle was a portable structure that could be taken apart, freely moved, and then assembled together again. Everything related to the tabernacle was portable. Forty-eight standing boards framed the tabernacle, or the Tent of Meeting. In the type of the tabernacle there are several important aspects related to the significance of the boards.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Having Two Natures</h2>
<p>Each board consisted of acacia wood overlaid with gold. As wood overlaid with gold, they had two natures (Exo. 26:29; cf. 25:10-11; 36:36). Gold signifies the nature of God. The nature of God is related to the life of God, which is God Himself. Hence, gold denotes God Himself. In typology wood refers to the human nature. The overlaying of the wood with gold signifies that the church is the mingling of God and man; hence, the church is an entity composed of two natures.</p>
<p>Acacia wood is strong in character and high in standard, signifying the Lord&rsquo;s humanity. The Lord&rsquo;s humanity is strong and noble. We should never think that we have an excuse not to be proper in the church because we are weak. In fact, every genuinely saved one should be acacia wood to the degree that their humanity has been worked on by God.</p>
<p>In the beginning, when the man Adam was created, he was both solid and strong; he was truly acacia wood. His thoughts were clear, his judgment was accurate, his will was strong, and his emotions were rich and proper. However, after Satan attacked man, man sinned and fell, and his humanity was ruined and gradually became dark and weak. The entire human race became darkened and ignorant. In contrast, after we believed into the Lord, God&rsquo;s salvation not only saved us from sin and the attraction of the world, but also began to remake and reconstitute our entire being.</p>
<p>The material that God uses to remake us is higher than the material He used in creating us. When God created man, He used the dust of the ground, but when He remakes us, He uses the divine nature, typified by gold. In other words, He adds Himself into us. Hence, after a person is saved, there should be a change not only in his behavior but also in his character. After salvation, one who lacked a clear mind should have a clear mind, one who had a weak will should have a strong will, and one whose discernment was improper should have a proper discernment.</p>
<p>Acacia wood is high in quality. In His salvation, God wants to save man to a high standard. Sadly, it seems that God&rsquo;s salvation has not been manifested much among the saints. Although we are saved, our character has not been uplifted. Those who lack a clear mind remain the same. Likewise, those with a weak will remain the same, and those with an improper discernment remain the same. In our daily life we are neither accurate in our speech nor precise in our timing; moreover, we are neither genuine nor strict. After our initial salvation, we have not allowed the life of God to operate in us. Even though we are saved, we do not realize that the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation is to remake us and to change our character. We think that the purpose of God&rsquo;s life in us is to change our behavior. Formerly we frequently lost our temper, but because of God&rsquo;s life in us, we do not lose our temper as much. Consequently we think that this is sufficient, and we are satisfied. However, we fail to realize that the purpose of God&rsquo;s life in us is to change our natural character.</p>
<p>We have urged the saints to train their character, but few brothers and sisters have experienced much of a change in their character. This proves that God&rsquo;s life has not had much of an effect upon them. It is not sufficient merely to pray; we must also allow the Spirit and the life of God to operate in us. Even if we should refrain from speaking negative things, we still must speak with full assurance and accuracy. Our character must be uplifted and strengthened. Whatever we do must be excellent and outstanding. We need to change from decayed wood to acacia wood. This is accomplished in God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we have not been saved in the matter of our character, we will not be able to discern the truth in the Bible because our character will not be exact. Our character must be genuine, exact, and strict. The kind of Bible we have depends on the kind of person we are. A sloppy person reads the Bible in a sloppy way, whereas an exact person reads the Bible in an exact way. This is a matter of character. This is not only true with the reading of the Bible but also in regard to our service in the church. Without a change in our character, everything we do will be careless and sloppy. As a result, we will not be of much use in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. In serving the Lord, we must allow our redeemed humanity to be uplifted.</p>
<p>In the tabernacle, acacia wood typifies the humanity that cooperates with God, the humanity that is high in standard, rather than a fallen humanity. Whenever we serve, we need to ask ourselves, &ldquo;Is our serving according to acacia wood or decayed wood? Is the way that we determine, handle, arrange, and do things solid and exact, or is it casual and sloppy?&rdquo; We do not realize how fallen our nature is. We need to be saved to see our own condition and to train our character. The humanity in the church must be acacia wood.</p>
<p>Some people are not exact in their speaking and in their use of time. They are sloppy in handling matters, but when they pray, they pray fervently. As a result, people think they are spiritual. This kind of person should not use prayers to utter empty words but rather to overturn his character. He should kneel down before the Lord and pray: &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy on me. Thoroughly change my loose character.&rdquo; In this way, his character will be changed from decayed wood to acacia wood, and the church will be strengthened.</p>
<p>The tabernacle was able to stand because of the boards, not because of the gold. Gold is precious, but gold is soft and cannot stand on its own. The tabernacle could stand only by means of the boards. Throughout the past two thousand years of church history, the church has been able to stand because of her strong human element. Martin Luther was a strong person. He was acacia wood, and as such, he was able to stand for the Reformation. In 1942 I bought a biography of Brother George M&#252;ller. The book contained a picture of his study. From the picture I saw the fine and neat arrangement of his study, and I was filled with admiration. Consequently, God gave M&#252;ller a particular commission for the age in which he lived because he was solid, exact, and strict. He was truly a piece of acacia wood.</p>
<p>If there are many such people in the church, the church will be able to stand strongly. It is true that the boards of the tabernacle were overlaid with gold, but the firmness of boards was due to the firmness of the acacia wood. The reason that many local churches are weak is that the brothers and sisters are weak in their humanity; that is, they lack the acacia wood. In God&rsquo;s eyes, a spiritual person is not a person without humanity but one whose humanity matches God. God is seeking spiritual men in whom there is no lack in their human element and in whom their humanity matches divinity. Instead of being independent of or detached from God, our humanity must match God and be mingled with God.</p>
<p>A basic principle in God&rsquo;s redemption is that God desires man to match Him. Paul had a strong character. Madame Guyon, though she was a sister, also had a very strong character. Likewise because of their strong character, John Bunyan bore a good testimony for the Lord, and J. N. Darby was greatly used by the Lord. They were acacia wood, strong and firm, and thus were able to stand and bear a glorious testimony for the Lord. If we want to be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, we must allow God&rsquo;s life and God&rsquo;s Spirit to operate in us. Our character can be compared to cement; we must allow the water of the Holy Spirit to mingle with us so that the cement of our character can solidify and become firm. When our character is firm, we can be useful in God&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>The tabernacle was able to stand because of the stable base of the silver sockets, but it still needed the firm acacia wood as support. Today the church is able to stand because of the solid base of redemption and a firm humanity. We should not have an erroneous concept that everything depends on who God is and what He does and that nothing is related to man or required of man. God cannot establish a strong church by calling and gathering together a group of young children. They could not possibly be used to establish a strong church because their humanity is not mature. Likewise, if there were only divinity but not humanity, there would be no possibility of establishing a strong church. Divinity is supported by humanity. Hence, there must be a strong humanity in order for the church to stand. The church is wood overlaid with gold. As saved ones, we have God within and the flesh without. However, the boards of the tabernacle show that the divinity, gold, was on the outside, and that humanity, acacia wood, was on the inside. Divinity was supported by humanity. The standing part was the acacia wood, and the expressed part was gold. At the time of the Reformation, Luther was standing, but he expressed gold. He was expressing God. This is the principle of wood overlaid with gold. Whether the church is strong or weak has a great deal to do with humanity. Therefore, we should not think that the church will be strong once we have some biblical knowledge and are spiritual. Strong humanity produces a strong church. The picture regarding the boards of the tabernacle shows that the church is able to stand because of the solid base of redemption and strong humanity.</p><h2 class="head4">Having Two Tenons</h2>
<p>Each board had two tenons (Exo. 36:22). In the Bible the number two signifies testimony. The basic principle of the number two is not being individualistic. Our standing by means of our two feet indicates that we are not individualistic. When a person stands, he uses both of his feet. In the church some brothers and sisters are not steady in their stand because they stand on only one foot; they are individualistic and have no testimony.</p>
<p>There were two tenons for each board and two sockets under the two tenons. These two tenons fit perfectly into the two sockets. This indicates a testimony (vv. 22, 24, 30). If there had been only one tenon matching one socket, there would not have been a testimony. Instead, there were two tenons matching two sockets. Each tenon had to match its respective socket. When both tenons matched their respective sockets, there was the testimony. If each board had only one tenon matching only one socket, then the board could be set up in different ways. With two tenons, however, the board had to be set up in a way so that each tenon matched a particular socket. The board would not have been able to stand if only one tenon matched a socket and the other did not. Both tenons had to match the sockets. This is a testimony. This type implies that a board cannot stand by itself. Every board had two tenons. Similarly, every believer in the church should stand by means of two tenons in two sockets. No action in the church should be individualistic but should require two sockets; it should be testified to by another person. This will ensure a stable standing.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Having Bars</h2>
<p>There were horizontal bars crossing and connecting all the standing boards. These bars served as connecting bands (vv. 31-34). Hence, the bars signify the oneness of the Spirit (cf. Eph. 4:3). Originally the boards were separate, but with the addition of the bars, the boards became one. This is the same in the church. The brothers and sisters start out as individuals, but by the Holy Spirit operating as the bars within them, they become one.</p>
<p>The boards had golden rings to hold the bars (Exo. 36:34). The golden rings may be compared to the nose-ring put upon Rebekah&rsquo;s nose (Gen. 24:47). The ability of the boards to stand depended upon the acacia wood, whereas their being connected together depended upon the golden rings. The Holy Spirit unites us together by the divine life, which entered into us on the day of our salvation. The golden ring typifies the divine life. Therefore, the oneness of the church is altogether in the Holy Spirit and in the divine life.</p>
<p>The oneness of the church cannot be found in man. In man there is only separation and dispersion. The oneness of the church is altogether in God. In the tabernacle the golden rings, not the wood of the boards, were used to join the boards together to form a wall. The many independent and separate boards were united by the golden rings. The boards by themselves could never be united with one another. The boards were linked together as a wall because golden rings were holding the bars. The boards of the tabernacle signify the saints in the church. All the saints have both humanity and divinity. In our humanity we have no way to be joined together, but in divinity we can be joined together as one. Thus, if we live only in our humanity, we will be separated and scattered, but if we live in the divine life, we will be one. The oneness of the church is altogether in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit who descended on the day of Pentecost possesses humanity. Hence, the bars were gold without and wood within. This matter is very mysterious, but this truth was made clear at the time of Andrew Murray. In the Old Testament, God was merely God, having nothing to do with humanity. Hence, His Spirit possessed only divinity. However, through incarnation, divinity entered into humanity, and through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, humanity entered into resurrection and was brought into divinity. Christ became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45b), and on the day of Pentecost the Spirit who came to earth possessed not only divinity but also humanity.</p>
<p>John 7:39 says that the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified. At that time the Spirit of God existed, but &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo;  was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified in His resurrection. The title <em>the Holy Spirit</em> was not used before the incarnation, because divinity had not yet been brought into humanity. Similarly, the title <em>the Spirit</em> was not used before the glorification of Jesus, because humanity had not yet been brought into divinity. Thus, the term <em>the Spirit</em> refers to the Spirit of God who now possesses humanity in resurrection. Today we are able to fellowship with the Lord because we are in &ldquo;the Spirit.&rdquo; This is very deep in significance. It is the Spirit who causes all the saints in the church to be one.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(6)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TABERNACLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">The Covering of the Tabernacle</h2>
<p>Exodus 26:1-14 describes the four layers of the covering of the tabernacle, beginning from the inner to the outer layer. The first layer was made of ten curtains of fine twined linen. The second layer was made of eleven curtains of goats&rsquo; hair. The third layer was a covering of rams&rsquo; skins dyed red, and the fourth layer was a covering of porpoise skins.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Curtains of Fine Linen</h2>
<p>The first layer was made of ten curtains of fine twined linen (vv. 1-6; 36:8-13). These ten curtains were divided into two groups of five. The number five signifies responsibility. Our two hands each have five fingers, and all five fingers are needed in order to work and bear responsibility. Another example is the ten virgins in Matthew 25, who are divided into two groups. Five of the virgins were foolish, and five were prudent (v. 2). The number two signifies testimony, and the number five signifies responsibility. Hence, the ten curtains divided into two groups of five curtains indicate that man bears responsibility before God on the ground of testimony.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of the curtains is that they were made of fine twined linen. Cherubim were embroidered upon the curtains, and in the curtains of fine twined linen there were blue and purple and scarlet strands. These curtains of fine twined linen signify humanity mingled with divinity. Fine linen, just as fine flour, denotes the condition of the Lord Jesus as a man before God. Fine flour signifies the fineness of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; humanity (Lev. 2:1-16), and fine linen denotes the purity of the Lord&rsquo;s humanity. The cherubim signify the glory of God manifested in the Lord&rsquo;s pure humanity.</p>
<p>Cherubim bear two significances in the Bible. Every time cherubim are spoken of in the Old Testament, they are spoken of in relation to the glory of God. Ezekiel 9:3 speaks of the glory of the God of Israel being upon a cherub. The Old Testament indicates that the glory of God was entrusted to and borne by the cherubim (1 Kings 8:7-11; Ezek. 10:3-4). Thus, cherubim are often associated with the glory of God.</p>
<p>Cherubim also refer to a part of the four living creatures. The seraphim in Isaiah 6 plus the cherubim in Ezekiel 10 compose the four living creatures in Revelation 4:6-8. Hence, one aspect of the significance of the cherubim is related to God&rsquo;s glory, and the other is related to the four living creatures. Thus, they signify God&rsquo;s glory manifested in His creatures. The cherubim embroidered on the curtains signify that the glory of God was manifested in the created humanity of the Lord.</p>
<p>Fine linen denotes the condition of humanity. Before being redeemed we were not like fine linen; we were rough and coarse in our humanity. After being redeemed we now express a degree of fineness, as typified by the fine linen. Both fine linen and acacia wood refer to humanity. Fine linen mainly denotes the fineness and beauty of humanity, whereas acacia wood mainly denotes the solidness and strength of humanity. In order to appreciate the strength of redeemed humanity, we need to consider the acacia wood. In order to appreciate the beauty of redeemed humanity, we need to consider the fine linen. The acacia wood was overlaid with gold, and the fine twined linen was embroidered with cherubim. Gold signifies God&rsquo;s precious worth, and cherubim signify God&rsquo;s glory. Just as gold covered the acacia wood, cherubim were embroidered upon the fine linen. The acacia wood upheld the gold, and the fine linen upheld the cherubim. This signifies that God&rsquo;s honor and glory are upheld by redeemed humanity that is strong, heavenly, dignified, and beautiful.</p>
<p>The boards of the tabernacle were for standing; thus, they needed to be strong. The covering of the tabernacle was for the expression of glory, and as such, it needed to be fine and beautiful. This can be compared to the ceiling of a house, which is mainly for appearance rather than support. Hence, in the first layer is seen the strength and beauty of humanity and the glory of divinity. The strength and beauty of humanity are typified by the fine linen, and the glory of divinity is typified by the cherubim. The fine linen denotes the condition of our humanity, the blue strands signify our heavenly condition, the purple strands signify our kingly position, and the scarlet strands signify our redemption. Moreover, the cherubim, representing God&rsquo;s glory, were upheld by the fine linen, because the cherubim were embroidered upon it.</p>
<p>Gold and cherubim denote divinity, and acacia wood and fine linen denote humanity. This typifies the church as the matching and mingling of God and man. When a priest entered into the tabernacle, he saw acacia wood overlaid with gold and fine linen embroidered with cherubim. When people come to the church, they should see divinity upheld by humanity, that is, gold and cherubim upheld by acacia wood and fine linen. To be proper, the church must match God with a strong and beautiful humanity.</p>
<p>The condition of the church before God should be that of a curtain of fine linen with blue, purple, and scarlet strands embroidered with cherubim. Fine linen signifies the Lord being both pure and righteous. The Lord is both pure and righteous. Blue signifies a heavenly condition, purple denotes a kingly position, scarlet signifies redemption, and cherubim indicate God&rsquo;s glory being manifested in His creatures. The most appealing aspect of this layer of the covering of the tabernacle was the cherubim. The strands of blue, purple, and scarlet were not as attractive. The most charming item was the embroidered cherubim. This means that the most striking aspect of the church should be God&rsquo;s glory manifested in His creatures who have been redeemed and who are pure, righteous, heavenly, and in a royal position. These people manifest God&rsquo;s glory, as signified by the cherubim. This should be the condition of the church before God.</p><h2 class="head4">Curtains of Goats&rsquo; Hair</h2>
<p>The second layer of the covering of the tabernacle was made of goats&rsquo; hair (Exo. 26:7-13). This layer denotes fallen humanity. The goats in Matthew 25 signify sinners, evil ones (vv. 32-33). In the Old Testament goats were often used as sacrifices for the trespass offering (Lev. 4:23, 28; 5:6). Hence, goats are related to sin. Furthermore, Exodus 26:7 says that the second layer of the covering was made of eleven curtains, not ten or twelve. Ten is the number of human perfection, and twelve is the number of perfection in the mingling of God and man. The number eleven indicates an excess because it is greater than ten, the number of human perfection, yet it is less than twelve, the number of the mingling of God and man.</p>
<p>A person normally has two hands and ten fingers. However, if a person&rsquo;s hand had six fingers, the sixth would be in excess. The second layer of the covering was composed of five curtains plus six curtains (v. 9), signifying the excessive condition of man before God. This excess is greater than what man should have yet less than what God is; thus, it is sinful and corrupt. To be less than God may not be sinful, but to be in excess of what man should have is sinful. Anything less than God but more than man is sinful and corrupted. Any time we have more than we should have, that is sin. Adam in the garden of Eden was a &ldquo;ten,&rdquo; but after Satan added himself to Adam, Adam became an &ldquo;eleven.&rdquo; In other words, he possessed something more than he should have possessed, that is, sin and corruption. Even today the church still has the nature of sin and corruption.</p>
<p>In the Bible animals signify man&rsquo;s need of God&rsquo;s redemption. The second layer of the covering was made of goats&rsquo; hair, of the animal life. This implies the need of redemption, that is, the covering of blood. The curtain of goats&rsquo; hair as the second layer signifies that today in the church there are still things that are fallen and corrupt and that God does not accept, which require redemption and the covering of the blood.</p>
<h2 class="head4">A Covering of Rams&rsquo; Skins Dyed Red</h2>
<p>The third layer of the tabernacle is a covering of rams&rsquo; skins dyed red (Exo. 26:14). This layer entirely covered the curtains of goats&rsquo; hair. This means that the corrupted humanity in the church is entirely covered by redemption. A person who entered the tabernacle or who stood outside of the tabernacle could not see the second layer of eleven curtains because it was totally covered by the rams&rsquo; skins dyed red. The blood covers our corrupted and sinful part. The color red is the color of blood, that is, the color of redemption. Because of this covering, God was able to say that He did not behold iniquity in Jacob (Num. 23:21). He beholds no sin in the church. All the sins and corruption of the church are under the covering of His blood. The Lamb was slain for us, and His blood and skin cover the church. Whether a person looks from the inside or from the outside, he will not be able to see the church&rsquo;s curtains of goats&rsquo; hair.</p>
<h2 class="head4">A Covering of Porpoise Skins</h2>
<p>The fourth layer, the outermost layer, of the tabernacle was a covering of porpoise skins (Exo. 26:14). Porpoise skins are thick, tough, and rough, without any beauty. Porpoise skins can withstand wind and rain and any type of condition. This signifies that the outermost layer of the church should be like porpoise skins, which have no outward splendor that man desires but that can endure all kinds of storms and attacks. This indicates that the church is not outwardly splendid or magnificent. Her beauty is God within.</p>
<p>Outwardly the tabernacle was made of porpoise skins, but inwardly it was made of gold and cherubim. The outward appearance of the church should not have anything that attracts people; rather, the beauty of the church is God within. Any person who tries to attract others by outward beauty or any church that tries to draw people by outward splendor violates the principle of the type of the tabernacle. Whatever can be seen on the outside should be rough, without any attractive or desirable form. This was the case with Christ, and this should be the case also with the church. Even though the church does not outwardly have any attractive appearance, she is strong and able to withstand any attack, storm, and difficulty. Any time the church has a magnificent outward appearance, inwardly it surely is weak and fragile. Such a church is just like a glass plate, which is outwardly nice but easily broken. Today some churches have a good outward appearance, but they fall and break easily. Some churches, however, are rough outwardly, but they are strong and beautiful inwardly.</p><h2 class="head3">The Floor of the Tabernacle</h2>
<p>The tabernacle did not have a floor. Its floor was the sandy soil of the wilderness. In the tabernacle, everything elevated is detailed and intricate, but everything positioned close to the earth is simple and plain. This signifies that although the church is located on the earth, she is heavenly.</p>
<p>The frame of the tabernacle was made of gold and was magnificent in appearance. Similarly, the covering of the tabernacle was splendid, being made of fine linen and embroidered with cherubim. However, beneath was the desert sand. Hence, the tabernacle above the ground was highly ornamented, but its floor was not ornamented at all. This signifies that the church should be heavenly. The beauty of the church is seen only by looking upward; when looking downward, all that is seen is a desert land. Hence, in the church we should look upward instead of downward.</p>
<p>The floor of the tabernacle indicates that the church is journeying on the earth as a sojourner, a pilgrim, walking through the wilderness. The church does not have a permanent position on the earth. It cannot take root in the earth. Wherever the tabernacle was placed, its floor was the sandy ground. The tabernacle did not take root on the earth; it was a traveler, a sojourner.</p>
<p>The first time I went to Foochow, the elderly women rowing boats near the bridge over the Min River caught my eye. Though they were dressed beautifully, their feet were covered with mud. The appearance of these women is similar to the appearance of the tabernacle. If a person looked up in the tabernacle, he would see blue, purple, scarlet, and white as well as embroidered cherubim. This was truly beautiful. However, if he looked down at the floor, it would look like &ldquo;muddy feet.&rdquo; The church is journeying on the earth and does not belong to the earth. The church does not care for anything of the earth; it cares only for the things that are above.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Sections</h2>
<p>The tabernacle was composed of different sections. The tabernacle itself consisted of two sections or parts. The outer section was the Holy Place, and the inner section was the Holy of Holies. In addition, there was a court outside the tabernacle, which the Bible calls the outer court. Long curtains of fine linen surrounded the whole outer court. Thus, including the outer court, there were three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. In type, the three sections of the tabernacle signify the three parts of our being&mdash;the body, soul, and spirit. The outermost part of a person is the body, the inner part is the soul, and the innermost part is the human spirit. The soul is inward, but the spirit is the innermost part. Even though the tabernacle typifies the parts of man, it is also a type of the church.</p>
<p>The sections of the tabernacle typify the spiritual condition of those within the church. Some are newly saved, and their spiritual condition can be associated with the outer court. Others who have made more spiritual progress can be associated with the Holy Place. Finally, the condition of those who have made further spiritual progress can be associated with the Holy of Holies. Under the grace of the new testament, our Lord is the High Priest in the heavens, and we are priests serving God. Thus, although the position and status of all the believers are equal before God, our inward spiritual condition may differ and vary greatly. Hence, the various kinds of people who served God in the tabernacle typify the spiritual condition of the individual believers in the church.</p>
<p>The Old Testament says that Levites served in the outer court, the priests served in the Holy Place, and the high priest served in the Holy of Holies. Under the grace of the new testament, there is no distinction among the saints as to their priestly service; rather, we are all priests (1 Pet. 2:5) and are all equal. Only the Lord Jesus Himself is our High Priest (Heb. 4:14). However, in terms of the level of spiritual experience, we cannot deny that some saints are like Levites, some are like priests, and some can be compared to the high priest in the Holy of Holies. We must have an accurate understanding concerning this point. We must not introduce the Judaistic concept of rank into the church. This is absolutely forbidden. On the other hand, we do acknowledge that there are indeed different levels in the spiritual growth of the saints. According to position, there is no rank among the saints; there is no first class, second class, or third class. There is only one class: the universal priesthood. But as far as spiritual experience is concerned, some are living in the outer court, some are in the Holy Place, and some are in the Holy of Holies.</p><h2 class="head4">The Outer Court</h2>
<p>Those living in the outer court contact the altar and the laver (Exo. 40:29-32). The altar was where offerings were offered to make expiation for the offerer (Lev. 1:4), and the laver was for washing the hands and feet. In type, this matches the experience of a newly saved one. Before a person is saved, in type he is outside the curtains of fine linen and has nothing to do with the tabernacle. Then one day he is convicted of sin and brings an ox or a lamb as a sin offering to present at the altar. Through the offerings, his problem of sin is dealt with. As a priest, he would then need to wash his hands and feet at the laver. This shows that a person begins to have a relationship with the church through expiation and cleansing. Through the experience of expiation for sin and the cleansing of the body, the barrier of sin between the believer and God is completely removed. This is the condition of someone in the outer court.</p>
<p>Although this condition depicts the condition of a newly saved one, there are many brothers and sisters who, despite having been saved for ten or twenty years, still remain in the outer court. When they testify of their experience, their testimony is related to the outer court, being related either to the altar or the laver, that is, concerning the washing away of their sins or concerning their being cleansed of earthly defilements. Their spiritual condition has not progressed beyond that of one who is newly saved.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Holy Place</h2>
<p>The spiritual condition of those in the Holy Place is deeper than that of those in the outer court. In the Holy Place there are three main items: the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar (Exo. 25:23-40; 30:1-6). Each of these three items refers to Christ Himself. The bread of the Presence signifies Christ as the bread of life, the lampstand signifies Christ as the light of life, and the incense altar signifies Christ as our acceptance before God. These three items show how Christ becomes our experience before God.</p>
<p>Those who are in the experience of the Holy Place are deeper and more advanced than those in the outer court. They know Christ as their bread of life, live in Christ as the light of life, and fellowship with God by relying on Christ as their acceptance before God. However, this is still not sufficient. Even though Christ has become their bread of life, light of life, and the means through which they fellowship with God, they spend most of the time in their soul. When they speak of certain matters, they are excited in their soul, sense the sweetness in their feeling, and enjoy testifying and talking to people regarding these matters. This kind of enjoyment and talk proves that their spiritual condition is related to the Holy Place.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Holy of Holies</h2>
<p>The Holy Place typifies the soul, but more specifically it refers to our person. In studying the type of the tabernacle, it is difficult to determine whether the outer court or the Holy Place signifies the outer man. Apparently, the outer court is outside, whereas the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies are on the inside. Nevertheless, according to the record in the Bible, the Holy Place denotes the outer man. Within the tabernacle there was a veil separating the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. Hebrews 10 tells us that the veil typifies the flesh that the Lord Jesus put on in His incarnation (v. 20). This flesh also signifies our person. Hence, in actuality, man, not God, is in the Holy Place.</p>
<p>From one perspective, the Holy Place is located inside the outer court, but from another perspective, the Holy Place is outside the veil. The book of Hebrews does not exhort us to enter the Holy Place but to enter into the Holy of Holies, that is, within the veil (v. 19). To enter within the veil means to enter into God. To leave the Holy Place and enter into the Holy of Holies is to leave man and enter into God. It is true that the bread of the Presence typifies Christ as the bread of life, the lampstand typifies Christ as the light of life, and the incense altar typifies Christ as the acceptance between God and man; however, none of these items typify Christ Himself. Only the Ark, which is in the Holy of Holies, typifies Christ Himself.</p>
<p>The Holy of Holies is the place where God dwelt, because only the Ark in the Holy of Holies typifies Christ Himself. In the Holy Place there was food, light, and God&rsquo;s acceptance, all of which are related to Christ. Christ is able to have an effect on our soul, causing us to be filled and joyful, and enabling us to sense God&rsquo;s acceptance. These are experiences related to the soul. Although Christ is the source of these experiences, He does not dwell in our soul. In the Holy Place, in our soul, Christ can fill us, enlighten us, and cause us to have a sense of harmony, comfort, and acceptance by God; nevertheless, Christ does not dwell in our soul. He is not outside the veil but within the veil.</p>
<p>Some saints may testify regarding how they are filled and enlightened by the Lord. They testify that they are full of joy and have sweet fellowship with the Lord. Such testimonies indicate that these brothers and sisters have entered into the Holy Place. It may seem that they are Christians with some depth of experience, but actually they are still outside the Holy of Holies and have not entered within the veil.</p>
<p>Another saint may testify that he was the topmost sinner but that the Lord Jesus died for him and released him from the burden of his sins. Now that Christ has delivered and released him from bondage, he feels that he must abandon all sinful matters and serve the Lord. From his testimony, we know that he is in the outer court, at the altar and the laver, offering oxen and lambs and washing his hands and feet. He is a Christian in the outer court.</p>
<p>Half a year later, this saint may testify of his sweet fellowship with the Lord and that he is satisfied, enlightened, and inwardly full of light. When he mentions these things, he is excited and has much to say. At this time, he has made progress and entered into the Holy Place. Formerly, he knew only that the Lord Jesus died for him and bore his sins, but now he knows that the Lord is in him as his food and light, enabling him to fellowship with God. Although he may seem to be a Christian who lives within the veil, he has not actually entered within the veil and is still outside of the Holy of Holies. If he is faithful to the Lord, the Holy Spirit will show him that he is still in the process and has not yet reached the destination. He will see that he needs to go deeper, to enter within the veil, that is, into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>There are some in the church who truly live within the Holy of Holies. Their experience is much deeper than those in the Holy Place. They truly live in their inner man. They not only sense the presence of Christ inwardly but have entered the Holy of Holies. Christ does not merely influence them outwardly; they touch Him in their innermost part. This is what it means to enter into the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar are not visible. The bread of the Presence has become the hidden manna within the Ark, the lampstand has become the tablets of the covenant within the Ark, and the incense altar has become the budding rod within the Ark. In the Holy of Holies everything is hidden within the Ark (Heb. 9:3-4).</p>
<p>The Ark typifies Christ Himself. When a person has entered into the depths, he may not speak much and has little excitement or even utterance in his prayer, but one can sense something solid within him. His condition is entirely different from one that is related to being in the Holy Place. A person who lives in the Holy Place prays much, and the sound of his prayer is like the fragrance of the incense altar in the Holy Place. Moreover, he can spend most of his time burning the incense with prayer. A person in the Holy of Holies, however, does not have much excitement, prayer, or outward testimony; nevertheless, when we contact him, we sense that there is a treasure in him, that something great is hidden within him. Although he does not shine forth much light outwardly, something hidden in him is very solid. Everything in the Holy Place is manifested, but everything in the Holy of Holies is hidden. Those who are in the Holy of Holies are not as excited as those in the Holy Place. However, something within them is very solid.</p>
<p>There are a number of people within the church who live in the Holy of Holies. They are weighty people. Their weightiness does not come from rank but from the measure of their spiritual experience and progress. If we apply rank in the church, the church will become Judaistic. In a Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, all the saints come with the same position; we are all priests. However, as soon as a certain saint opens his mouth to pray and praise the Lord, others know whether he is living in the outer court or in the Holy Place. The thanks and praises he renders are related to the Lord&rsquo;s table, but they are also related to the altar. When we hear the thanks and praises of the saints at the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, we should be able to sense the difference in their spiritual progress. Some people do not say much. Their voice is neither high nor loud, and they do not sound excited. Nevertheless, once they open their mouths, we sense that they are in the Holy of Holies. We are able to touch heaven and God through them.</p>
<p>Last November a brother from England came to visit us. In the first few days of these so-called revival meetings, some brothers were very excited when they prayed. It seemed that the roof of the meeting hall was almost lifted off. At that time, many brothers and sisters seemed to touch the presence of Christ and Christ as life, and as a result, they were excited. However, the more I heard their prayers and testimonies, the more my inner being sensed that they were in the Holy Place. Not only were they soulish, but their souls were released.</p>
<p>In the church there are definite differences in the degree of spirituality. According to typology the majority of believers are in the outer court, a few are in the Holy Place, and an even smaller number are in the Holy of Holies. This picture is very fitting. In the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting we often see people coming with lambs and oxen, hustling and bustling to offer sacrifices. This is the condition of those in the outer court.</p>
<p>When it comes to the prayer meeting, there is a little flavor of the Holy Place. Even though the number of people is smaller, the prayer meeting is deeper than the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning message meeting. At the time of prayer, sometimes we are even able to touch Christ directly, touching something deeper in certain saints. This is to be in the Holy of Holies. Hence, in the church there are three levels of spiritual experience among the believers.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(7)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TABERNACLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">The Content</h2>
<p>The real value of the tabernacle altogether depended upon its content, just as the nobility of a house depends upon those who live in it. The tabernacle was composed of three sections. Likewise, the content of the tabernacle can be divided into three groups. According to the record in Exodus 25 through 30, the description of the three sections begins from the Holy of Holies and proceeds to the outer court. However, according to our human perspective, the three sections begin from the outer court and proceed to the Holy of Holies.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Outer Court</h2>
<p>There were two important items in the outer court: the altar, which can also be called the altar of burnt offering or the bronze altar, and the laver, which is also referred to as the bronze laver. When a priest entered the tabernacle, he first contacted the altar and then the laver. The altar signifies the Lord&rsquo;s cross, and the laver signifies the washing of the Holy Spirit. This means that the first experience within the church is the cross and that the second is the washing of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head5">The Altar</h2>
<p>The first item within the tabernacle was the altar. Thus, the first item related to the content of the church is the cross, which is typified by the altar. Concerning the altar as a type, there are three main points.</p>
<h2 class="head6">The Place of Expiation</h2>
<p>From the human perspective, the altar was the place for expiation, yet from God&rsquo;s perspective, expiation is not the only emphasis. The expiating blood of the animals slain for the offerings was sprinkled on and around the altar (Lev. 1:5, 11). This signifies that the Lord was killed and that His redeeming blood was shed on the cross on our behalf. Therefore, redemption for sin was accomplished on the cross. As far as man is concerned, this is the significance of the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head6">Consecration</h2>
<p>The altar, however, is also related to consecration. The altar is referred to as the altar of burnt offering (Exo. 30:28) but never as the altar of sin offering. According to Leviticus 1, the burnt offering was the first offering among five kinds of offerings and denotes man offering himself to God. This means that man is food to God. In the Old Testament, God said that His food was the burnt offering (Num. 28:2-3). We may consider only that God desires to be our food and satisfaction, but the Bible also tells us that man is God&rsquo;s food and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Man can be God&rsquo;s food and satisfaction by willingly placing himself upon the altar of burnt offering. This is similar to Abraham offering Isaac as a burnt offering. According to God&rsquo;s original intention, even if man had never sinned, and there was no need for the sin offering, man would still need to present himself to God as a burnt offering. The thought with the burnt offering is not related to sin. In the burnt offering, man as a creature puts himself into the hands of the Creator to become the Creator&rsquo;s food and satisfaction. The altar, as a type of the cross, is related both to the sin offering for redemption and the burnt offering for consecration.</p>
<p>From the human perspective the cross has two significances. One is the propitiation of our sin, and the other is consecration so that God may gain our being. First we experience the blood, that is, redemption, and then we experience death, that is, our willing consecration. In this regard, the cross deals with our self, our person. When we offer ourselves on the altar, the fire consumes us. From the perspective of the Lord&rsquo;s work, we have already been dealt with. But, experientially, a person&rsquo;s self cannot be dealt with unless he willingly offers himself to God to be put to death. If a person does not hand himself over to God, he cannot experience the cross. In order for the experience of the cross to be manifested in a person, he must willingly offer himself up to God and give himself into God&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Most people do not like to hear the word <em>death.</em> But those with experience know that God&rsquo;s work in us puts us to death. All those gained by God have been terminated by Him. They are clear that death represents God&rsquo;s hand. Giving themselves to God is to put themselves in the position of death. This is the meaning of consecration. If a person has never experienced death, he has never consecrated himself to God. All those who have handed themselves over to God have put themselves in the place of death. The picture of the burnt offering shows that the offerer of the burnt offering participated in the slaughtering of his offering and laid his hand on the offering (Lev. 1:4-5). This signifies that everyone who consecrates himself to God willingly puts himself in the place of death.</p>
<p>The burnt offering was slaughtered by the offerer and was then consumed by God with fire. According to the type, we slaughter our own offering and offer it to God. God then accepts our offering by burning and consuming it with fire. God&rsquo;s consuming of the burnt offering implies His acceptance of it. His consuming of the offering signifies that He ate and devoured it. The experience of the cross involves man&rsquo;s killing and God&rsquo;s consuming, that is, His enjoyment. The purpose of these experiences is to deal with our person in order for God to gain us. God terminates man on the cross in order to gain him. Everyone who is gained by God has been terminated by Him. The extent to which we have been terminated by God is the extent to which He has been able to gain us.</p>
<p>Religion teaches that people give themselves to God in order to accomplish a great enterprise, a great work, for God. This kind of speaking comes from those who do not know God. Those who know God realize that we give ourselves to the Lord in order to be killed, to be put to death, and to be given to God for His acceptance, not in order to do a great work.</p>
<p>Everyone who gives himself to the Lord ultimately becomes a sweet fragrance to God and a heap of ashes to man. When something is burned to ashes, it has reached its end. Regardless of whether it is a piece of wood, a sheep, a bull, or a garment, as long as it is burned to ashes, it has reached its end, and there is no further way to deal with it. Once any matter comes to the stage of ashes, it has reached its final stage. Even after a person dies, his body must still be dealt with. However, once his body is burned to ashes, it has reached the final stage.</p>
<p>Once a bull or a sheep became a burnt offering, it was terminated; that is, it was burned to ashes. God gained it through termination. Likewise, God gains man by terminating man. God did not select bulls or sheep from the herd or flock and put them on the altar. The act of offering was man&rsquo;s obligation, and it was carried out by man. After man offered the sacrifice, it was God&rsquo;s responsibility to burn it. This is the burnt offering. Hence, the burnt offering means that man gives himself to God to be terminated by God for God&rsquo;s enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>
<p>God desires to terminate our being, but He is not willing to do the work of putting us on the altar. Instead, He wants us to offer ourselves willingly. After we have offered ourselves willingly, He consumes us. This is the experience of the cross in the aspect of death. In regard to the blood, the cross is for redemption from sins; however, in regard to death, the cross is for the burnt offering, for consecration. We must give ourselves to God in this way in order to have the experience in Romans 6.</p>
<p>When a person becomes ashes before God, he becomes a fragrance to God, something for God to eat, enjoy, and possess. This is the ultimate significance of the cross. God does not desire that we do something for Him. On the contrary, God does everything for us. God created the earth beneath our feet and the heavens above our head. God provides the sunshine, water, air, and food that we need. He also provides the life, wisdom, and power that we require. God does not have the intention that we do anything for Him.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, when David sought to build a temple for God, God sent Nathan to David to tell David not to build it (1 Chron. 17:4-5). God does not desire that man do anything for Him. Instead, God is always doing something for man. The thought and concept of doing something for God issues from religion, not from God&rsquo;s revelation. God&rsquo;s only intention is for us to be gained by Him to be food for Him. This is the cross. The altar deals with man&rsquo;s sin and also enables God to gain man. These are the significances of the sin offering and the burnt offering. The cross deals with man&rsquo;s sin and enables God to gain man.</p><h2 class="head6"> All-inclusive</h2>
<p>Some people have once said that all the furniture and utensils in the tabernacle, according to their sizes, could fit in the altar. In other words, the capacity of the altar was sufficient to contain all the furniture and utensils in the tabernacle. Moreover, the history of the Jews also tells us that when the children of Israel journeyed through the wilderness, every time they rolled up their tents to proceed, they put all the furniture and utensils of the tabernacle into the altar. If we calculate their sizes, we know that this must be a reliable fact.</p>
<p>When a priest entered the tabernacle and handled the furniture or utensils, he had to first pass through the altar. This means that the altar is the basis for every experience in the tabernacle. This typifies that the cross is the basis for every experience in the church. In other words, the cross is the basis for every spiritual experience. No one could handle the furniture and utensils or enter the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies without passing through the altar. In the same way, every spiritual experience involves passing through the cross. The cross, as the altar, encompasses everything. On one hand the cross is for redemption and consecration, on the other hand, it is the basis for all spiritual experience.</p>
<h2 class="head5">The Laver</h2>
<p>After the altar comes the laver. The laver is for washing (Exo. 40:30-32). Those who served in the tabernacle were required to wash their hands and feet in the laver in order to be cleansed. The New Testament shows that this signifies the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5). All these types are pictures. When a person commits a sin before God, he needs both the cleansing of the blood and the washing of the water. The washing of the water cleanses his hands and feet from the dust of the earth, the filthiness of the world. The blood deals with condemnation, not contamination. The blood cleanses us from condemnation, and the water cleanses us from contamination, from uncleanness, in our being. The washing of the water signifies the Holy Spirit washing away all our defilement. The defilement we receive from our contact with the world is washed by the Holy Spirit. The Lord Jesus spoke of this washing in John 15: &ldquo;You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you&rdquo; (v. 3). Hence, this kind of washing is not related to redemption.</p>
<p>If a child wears clean clothes, his mother may charge him, saying, &ldquo;Do not make your clothes dirty. If you make them dirty, you will offend me.&rdquo; If the child then goes out to play and is careless, his clothes will become dirty, and he will be condemned by his mother. Knowing this, he will be afraid to see his mother. Hence, he has two problems: an offended mother and contaminated clothes. If he confesses to his mother and asks for forgiveness, the problem of his offense can be solved; however, there still is dirt on his clothes. This requires washing. Even though there is no barrier of offense between the mother and the child, his clothes still need to be washed.</p>
<p>Before a certain brother was saved, he worked for the government and embezzled public funds to buy a bed, a desk, and a chair. After he was saved, he began to sense that his stealing was a sin that offended God. Inwardly, he had no sense of peace. When he stole the items, this brother was outside of the linen hangings of the outer court. He was living in darkness, and he did not have any sense related to his actions. After he entered within the boundary of righteousness and purity, he immediately sensed that his stealing was a sin. At that point, he came to the cross and said, &ldquo;O God, forgive me of my sin of stealing. Please forgive me.&rdquo; When this brother confessed his sin, he received the Lord&rsquo;s redemption. Through the Holy Spirit he sensed that the Lord had already borne his sins on the cross. He then had the faith to receive the cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood. In this way, he had peace with God. The blood at the altar cleanses us from our sins, erasing our record of sin before God and cleansing us from the condemnation in our conscience.</p>
<p>Later he sat down to read the Bible, and a sense of filth related to the bed, desk, and chair was still present because they had been bought with stolen money. Such a sense of filthiness cannot be washed away by the blood. Although the blood cleanses us from the record of sin before God, it cannot wash away the defilement related to these sins. Defilement is only washed away through the laver, that is, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit. When the brother knelt down to pray, the Holy Spirit bothered him and spoke to him with power, saying, &ldquo;Go and return these things. Deal thoroughly with all the things that do not belong to you.&rdquo; After this speaking, he did accordingly, and the peace returned to him.</p>
<p>A person may steal a tie, remove the original tag, and put his name on a new tag. Once he is saved, the blood will cleanse him of this sin when he confesses; however, when he wears the tie, there will still be a sense of defilement in his being. This shows that he needs the renewing of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit continually works in us to wash us. When something is washed with water, it may not be thoroughly cleaned immediately. Sometimes more scrubbing is needed. This is similar to the washing of the Holy Spirit. He operates in us and bothers us until we are restless. Similarly, He will not stop until the new brother returns the tie to its owner and tells him, &ldquo;I believe in Jesus; He saved me. I am returning your tie. Please forgive me. I also changed the name tag on the tie, so I need to pay you some money.&rdquo; This kind of washing is related to the laver; the blood cannot wash away this kind of defilement. The blood can wash away the record of our sin before God, but the defilement within us can only be dealt with by the renewing of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The redemption of the cross deals with our problem of sin before God. This dealing is accomplished by the washing of the blood. However, according to our experience, we know that the earthly defilement still remains. We still have filthy thoughts and improper concepts in our mind, and our actions are contaminated by earthly defilements. All these require the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit, which have nothing to do with redemption and are not for the purpose of dealing with the problem of sin. The washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are for ridding us of the inward defilement. The cleansing of the precious blood cleanses us of our sin before God; the washing of the Holy Spirit rids us of our inward filthiness. In other words, the problem of sin is dealt with at the altar, and the problem of filthiness is dealt with at the laver.</p>
<p>Worldly people see only the filthiness but not the condemnation, whereas the eyes of theologians focus too much on condemnation, overlooking the matter of defilement. The Bible, however, reveals that both aspects are of equal importance. We need the altar with the blood because of our condemnation before God, and we need the laver with the washing of water because of our defilement.</p>
<p>Whenever we desire to approach God and sense that we are condemned and defiled, we need the washing of the blood to deal with our condemnation and the renewing of the Holy Spirit to rid us of our defil ent. We may need ten minutes to make a petition regarding a certain matter, but prior to making the petition, we may need twenty minutes to seek the cleansing of the blood and the renewing of our inner being. One cannot enter the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies without spending time at the altar and the laver. If a person has not spent much time passing through the altar and the laver, he is not able to have much experience of the Holy Place and of the Holy of Holies. The altar deals with our sin, and the laver deals with our filthiness. A person who seeks spiritual experiences must pass through the altar and the laver.</p>
<p>When we enter into the Holy of Holies to contact God, we must pass through these two items in the outer court. Sometimes, we may first come to the laver and then to the altar. Our experience may not necessarily follow the sequence of first going to the altar and then to the laver. Actually, one who serves God must always go first to the laver and then to the altar. For instance, today we may need to speak for the Lord, but yesterday we offended a brother. In Matthew 5:24 the Lord says, &ldquo;Leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother.&rdquo; <em>First go and be reconciled to your brother</em> means to go to the laver. We need to first go to our brother and tell him, &ldquo;Brother, I am sorry that I offended you yesterday.&rdquo; This is the significance of going to the laver. First we go to the brother to wash our hands and feet; then we come to God and say, &ldquo;God, forgive me of my sin.&rdquo; After this, we will be able to speak for God and serve Him in the Holy Place. This is to pass through the laver and then through the altar.</p>
<p>The altar and the laver have two functions. The altar washes away man&rsquo;s record of sin before God, and the laver washes away the filthiness of man. Our record of sin is washed away by the judgment at the altar, the cross, and our filthiness is cleansed by the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit at the laver. Both the altar and the laver were made of bronze; however, the source of the two items was different. The bronze used for the laver came from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting (Exo. 38:8). This implies that the laver is similar to a mirror, reflecting men&rsquo;s true condition and contamination. The bronze used to overlay the altar came from the censers of the two hundred fifty sinful ones who were judged by God (Num. 16:19-50); thus, this bronze bears the significance of judgment. At the altar, judgment cleanses men from condemnation, and at the laver, shining rids men of their uncleanness. Because of condemnation, we need the blood; because of filthiness, we need the water. The altar deals with the matter of condemnation, and the laver deals with the need for shining.</p>
<p>When a person came to the altar, the bronze reminded him of God&rsquo;s judgment; when he came to the laver, the bronze reminded him of God&rsquo;s enlightening. When a person comes to the cross, he is reminded that the Lord was judged, and when he comes to the Holy Spirit, he is enlightened to see his true condition, his filthiness.</p>
<p>In the tabernacle, that is, within the church, the first item is the redemption of the cross, and the second item is the washing of the Holy Spirit. The cross is related to redemption, and the Holy Spirit is related to washing. A person in the outer court contacted these two items all the time, signifying that both newly saved ones and those who do not have much growth in life frequently have experiences related to the redemption of the cross and the washing of the Holy Spirit. This is often the limit of their spiritual experience. At most, they are able to testify that they liked playing mah-jongg and going to movies, but now they sense that these things offend God. They may even testify that there is a power within them that enables them to stop doing these things. This is the redemption of the cross and the washing of the Holy Spirit, experiences related to the outer court.</p><h2 class="head4">The Holy Place</h2>
<p>Proceeding inward from the outer court, a priest would enter the Holy Place, in which there were three items.</p>
<h2 class="head5">Table of the Bread of the Presence</h2>
<p>The first item was the table of the bread of the Presence (Exo. 25:30), also translated as the &ldquo;showbread table.&rdquo; On the north side of the Holy Place was a table on which was set the bread of the Presence. We know that the bread was displayed, as indicated by the translation &ldquo;showbread.&rdquo; This bread signifies Christ becoming our food, our bread of life. This is something displayed. A person who liked watching movies in the past can be cleansed from condemnation through the Lord&rsquo;s blood and washed from the defilement of movies through the Holy Spirit. As he begins to learn to pray and fellowship with the Lord, he will enter the Holy Place and be able to experience Christ as his power of life. He will even be able to testify that Christ is in him as the power of life, enabling him not to be defiled by earthly things. The power of life within him is displayed especially when he gives a testimony that is full of the power of life. This, however, is merely the visible bread of the Presence. This is a superficial experience; nevertheless, in comparison to the experience of the laver, it is deeper and more inward.</p>
<h2 class="head5">The Lampstand</h2>
<p>The second item was the lampstand (vv. 31-39). The lampstand was on the south side of the Holy Place. The light of the lampstand shone forth and was expressed. The display of the bread of the Presence signifies the power of life, and the shining forth of the lampstand signifies the light of life. Both of these signify Christ in us as our life. The bread signifies that Christ&rsquo;s life satisfies and strengthens us, and the light shows that Christ&rsquo;s life shines on us as our light. Hence, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger&rdquo; (John 6:35), and also, &ldquo;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness&rdquo; (8:12).</p>
<h2 class="head5">The Incense Altar</h2>
<p>The third item was the incense altar (Exo. 30:6). The incense altar was on the west side of the Holy Place. The fragrance of the incense ascended upward, the bread of the Presence was displayed, and the light shone forth. Everything was visible and not hidden. The incense altar signifies Christ as our acceptance before God. This means that Christ is our acceptance before God and the power by which we live before God. Christ Himself is our strength, our light, and our acceptance. Through Christ we have the power to live the Christian life, the light to proceed on our way, and the means of being accepted before God.</p>
<p>Although the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar were found in the Holy Place, they still were manifest. Hence, they have both an inward and outward aspect. In contrast, the altar and the laver were entirely outward, being located in the outer court. All the offerings offered on the altar, as well as the bronze laver, were located in the outer court and were altogether visible. The Holy Place, however, was enclosed within the tabernacle. The three items in the Holy Place&mdash;the displayed bread, the shining light, and the ascending incense&mdash;speak of outward aspects of inward matters.</p>
<p>The Holy Place typifies man&rsquo;s soul, the outer man. Psychologists divide man into two parts: metaphysical and physical. The outward, visible part is physical and is related to the outer man, whereas the inward, invisible part is metaphysical and is related to the inner man. Thus, to say that man&rsquo;s soul is inward and man&rsquo;s body is outward is very logical. However, the Bible and our experience indicate that even though man&rsquo;s soul is something inward, it belongs to the outer man. What then is the inner man? Our spirit is the inner man. Only the spirit of the saved ones has the presence of God. God is in our spirit. This means that God is not in the Holy Place but in the Holy of Holies. Hence, the Holy Place typifies the outer man, the soulish man. A person who has not been saved for a long period of time has normally experienced Christ as life, light, and acceptance. It can be said that he is altogether in his soul and in his excitement. It is not bad to be in the soul, but it is superficial. In the Holy Place, Christ is our life, which is related to the bread of the Presence; Christ is our light, which is related to the lampstand; and Christ is our acceptance, which is related to the incense altar. However, all these aspects are still shallow; they are outward aspects of inward matters.</p><h2 class="head4">The Holy of Holies</h2>
<p>A separating veil was located between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies is within the veil (26:33-34; Heb. 9:3, 8). The veil typifies the man of flesh, which the Lord Jesus put on. Only when a man is broken can he enter into the spirit. The bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar in the Holy Place typify Christ as our bread of life, our light of life, and our acceptance before God. It can be said that the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar refer to aspects of Christ. However, the Ark in the Holy of Holies refers to Christ Himself, to God Himself. The three items that are displayed openly in the Holy Place are related to items hidden within the Ark in the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies the hidden manna within the Ark is related to the bread of the Presence. This is the hidden manna referred to in Revelation 2:17, the manna that was placed before Jehovah (Exo. 16:32-33), not the manna which fell from heaven for the children of Israel to eat (vv. 4-5, 14-16). In the Holy of Holies the tablets of the law within the Ark are related to the lampstand. The law is light. Psalm 119 tells us that the shining forth of the law is light (v. 105). The light of life is the shining forth of the law of life. Even though the law is hidden inwardly, the light shines forth outwardly. The budding rod within the Ark is related to the golden incense altar.</p>
<p>The incense altar was the basis and proof of man&rsquo;s acceptance by God, and the budding rod was the basis and proof that Aaron&rsquo;s house was accepted by God. Both the incense altar and the budding rod are items in resurrection, and both are related to acceptance and recognition. A man can be accepted by God in resurrection only when he rejects himself. The company of Korah was able to stand up and speak, but God did not accept or recognize them. God accepted and recognized the budding rod (Num. 16:1&mdash;17:13). Men may do many things before God, but God may not accept or recognize them. God&rsquo;s acceptance and recognition are at the incense altar. Hence, the incense altar and the budding rod are actually one in the matter of God&rsquo;s acceptance and recognition.</p>
<p>Moreover, both the incense altar and the budding rod are items related to resurrection. God&rsquo;s acceptance and recognition are only in resurrection. If we live in ourselves, we will be as those of the company of Korah and will provoke God&rsquo;s hatred and rejection. On the other hand, if we are like Moses and Aaron, rejecting ourselves and living in resurrection, we will surely be accepted and recognized by God. Resurrection is Christ. The budding rod of Aaron in the Ark indicates that acceptance is related to the Ark.</p>
<p>The three items in the Holy Place have been encapsulated within the Ark, that is, within Christ, in the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies, Christ is everything and He is hidden. We, to a limited degree, have experienced Christ within the Holy of Holies. Some experience Christ&rsquo;s life as the bread of the Presence, whereas others experience Christ&rsquo;s life as the hidden manna. Some are led by Christ through enjoying the shining of the lampstand, whereas others are led by Christ through experiencing the hidden law. Some experience Christ as the incense altar for their acceptance by God, whereas others experience Christ as the budding rod for their acceptance by God. Everything in the Holy Place is manifest, whereas everything in the Holy of Holies is hidden. These experiences indicate that the cross, the washing of the Holy Spirit, the manifest Christ, and the hidden Christ are all in the church. Because of the differences among the saints in their knowledge and experience of the various aspects of Christ, there is a corresponding difference in their degree and level of spirituality.</p>
<p>In the church, some are experiencing the redemption of the cross and the washing of the Holy Spirit. These saints are living in the outer court. Other saints are experiencing Christ as their life, light, power, and acceptance. They are excited, living, shining, and fresh and have sweet fellowship with God. When we touch them, we can tell that they are Christians in the Holy Place. There is also a small number of saints who are deeper in their experience, knowledge, and gaining of Christ than those in the Holy Place. Christ is their hidden manna, their hidden law, and their hidden acceptance. When we contact them, we cannot see the bread of the Presence, the shining light, or the ascending incense. However, we can sense that they have the hidden manna and the inward law. They have a deeper knowledge of God, and they have the authority, the resurrection life, and God&rsquo;s acceptance in them. They are not merely influenced by Christ but are living in Christ. They have advanced further and are Christians living in the Holy of Holies. These conditions are the content of the church.</p>
<p>If we read the New Testament without reading the Old Testament, we can never gain such a clear understanding regarding the content of the church. The types related to the furniture in the tabernacle show that there are saints in the church who have these different experiences. The fourth book of Psalms can be said to be concerning the Holy of Holies. Experience indicates that the Holy of Holies is God Himself. Psalm 90:1 says, &ldquo;O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations.&rdquo; God has been our dwelling place in all generations. He is our Holy of Holies. On the other hand, the Holy of Holies is our spirit, the place where God mingles with man. When we live in Him, He also lives in us. Our mingling with God is a spiritual Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>When we are mingled with God, Christ is richly hidden within us. The Holy of Holies is nothing less than Christ Himself. To God, the Holy of Holies is our regenerated spirit; to us, it is the God whom we experience. God lives in our human spirit, and we live in God. We are in union with one another. Christ is the center of this union, just as the Ark was the center of the Holy of Holies. In Christ as the center are the hidden life, the hidden light, and the hidden authority. Everything that enables us to live before God, walk before God, and reign for God is hidden in Christ as the center. Everything that causes us to be joined to God and to live before God is through Christ the center. Now that we have been united with God, we should fully take this One as our center. Christ is the real content of the church.</p>
<p>The three items in the Holy Place are particularly related to the three parts of our soul, and the three items in the Holy of Holies are related to the three parts of our spirit. The lampstand in the Holy Place is related to our mind, the incense altar is related to our emotion, and the bread of the Presence is related to our will. Whether a person&rsquo;s thoughts are clear before God depends upon the light he receives from God. Whether a person&rsquo;s feelings and emotions are stable depends upon his being accepted by God. Likewise, whether a person is strong in his will depends upon the supply of Christ he receives inwardly. Thus, the three items in the Holy Place have a special relationship with the three parts of our soul.</p>
<p>The three items within the Ark in the Holy of Holies are related to the three parts of our spirit. The function of the intuition in our spirit is similar to the function of the mind in our soul; it enables us to understand and sense spiritual matters. The function of our conscience in our spirit is similar to the function of the emotion in our soul. Whether or not we have peace and sense God&rsquo;s acceptance are matters of the conscience. The function of the fellowship in our spirit depends upon the supply of life and is thus related to the will in our soul. The hidden manna is related to the fellowship in our spirit, because fellowship is out of life and of life. The budding rod is related to the conscience in our spirit, because the conscience enables us to obtain peace before God. And the inner law is related to the intuition in our spirit, because the intuition enables us to know God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>The three items in the Holy Place are clearly related to the three parts of our soul, and the three items in the Holy of Holies are clearly related to the three parts of our spirit. In other words, when our spiritual condition corresponds to the Holy Place, our mind is enlightened by Christ as the light of life, our will is strengthened by Christ&rsquo;s life, and our emotion is joyful and peaceful because of Christ&rsquo;s acceptance. When we progress to live in our spirit, the inner law enables our intuition to touch God&rsquo;s will, the acceptance of Christ in resurrection enables us to have peace in our conscience, and the hidden life supply enables us to have fellowship within.</p>
<p>From our perspective, our experience begins at the altar, but as far as God is concerned, it begins from the Ark. All the experiences related to the tabernacle have their basis in the altar. The altar is the cross. Regardless of the starting point, the arrangement of the furniture in the tabernacle forms the shape of the cross. The cross is the basis for all spiritual experiences and includes all spiritual experience. All experiences issue from the cross. The experience of the cross is not for the sake of experiencing the cross; rather, the cross enables man to experience Christ. The ultimate goal of the cross is for man to enter into God and be in complete union with God. In this way, man and God become the universal Holy of Holies with Christ as the center. This is confirmed by experience.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(8)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TABERNACLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">The Hangings of the Outer Court</h2>
<p>The hangings of the outer court were a wall of hangings made of fine white linen. The hangings were portable and could be taken down and put up at any time. The hangings were not the same as the walls of our meeting hall, which are fixed and unalterable. There are several matters related to the hangings that deserve our attention, including the bronze sockets, the silver connecting rods, and the fine white linen.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Sockets of Bronze</h2>
<p>Beneath the tabernacle, silver sockets supported the standing boards, which were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. On top of the boards were four layers of coverings. The outer court of the tabernacle was framed with hangings of fine linen supported by bronze sockets, bronze pillars, and silver rods. The children of Israel would set up the pillars and silver rods around the outer court, and then hang the hangings of fine white linen upon them. Beneath the rods were bronze sockets and pillars (Exo. 38:17, 29-31). Those familiar with the types of the Bible know that bronze signifies judgment. The children of Israel lifted up a bronze serpent on a pole, typifying that the Lord Jesus was hung on the cross and judged by God for the sin of the world (Num. 21:9). Furthermore, the strongest proof that bronze signifies judgment is found in Numbers 16 and 17, where two hundred fifty people from the company of Korah rebelled against God while holding bronze censers. Later their bronze censers were used to cover the altar (16:39). Hence, bronze is a sign and a symbol of judgment.</p>
<p>Whenever we encounter bronze in types, we need to understand that it signifies judgment. When the Lord appeared to John in Revelation 1:15, it says, &ldquo;His feet were like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace.&rdquo; This signifies that the Lord Jesus passed through the test of God&rsquo;s judgment and that the Lord is executing judgment in the church. The Lord&rsquo;s feet having the appearance of shining bronze signifies that all the steps the Lord passed through and all He accomplished on the earth have passed through the test of God&rsquo;s judgment. The Lord Jesus is able to judge the church because His feet have been fired in a furnace. Since bronze signifies judgment, the bronze sockets at the base of the hangings around the tabernacle signify that the judgment which the Lord bore for us on the cross has become the base of the hangings.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Connecting Rods of Silver</h2>
<p>On top of the bronze sockets were silver connecting rods (Exo. 38:17). In the Old Testament, silver was used for expiation; therefore, it signifies redemption (30:11-16). The judgment that the Lord Jesus bore for us accomplished a redemption that enables us to stand before God. The redemption that we enjoy today is based on the judgment that the Lord Jesus bore for us. Hence, redemption is the result that issues from the bronze sockets as the base and is typified by the silver rods.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Hangings of Fine White Linen</h2>
<p>Hangings made of fine white linen (38:16) were hung on silver rods (27:9, 11-12, 14-15). We should pay attention to this point. Fine white linen denotes the righteous acts of man before God, the righteousness that enables man to be acceptable to God. Isaiah 64:6 indicates that our condition may be likened to a soiled garment. In Luke 15 the first thing that the father did for the prodigal son when he returned home was to change his robe (v. 22). His original robe was intolerably filthy. As soon as his father saw him, his father put the best robe upon him. This signifies our being justified by God.</p>
<p>Our past behavior and living offended God and were not acceptable to Him. They were entirely incompatible and did not match the status, position, glory, and condition of God. However, when we received the Lord Jesus, God gave the Lord Jesus to us as our righteousness, and thus we were justified by God in the Lord. This means that when we are in the Lord, He becomes our garment, the best robe, which enables us to meet God&rsquo;s requirement and glory. Thus, our condition before God is able to match God&rsquo;s status and position, causing us to be justified before God. In brief, the hangings in the outer court denote our justification before God.</p>
<p>The hangings are not only related to justification but also to the matter of forming a boundary. The hangings were a border, a clearly defined boundary, separating the tabernacle from the world. Everything outside the hangings was unrelated to the tabernacle; however, everything inside the hangings was related to the tabernacle. The hangings signify the boundary of the church. What is the boundary of the church? What is the difference between the church and the worldly people? The New Testament offers some explanations, but these explanations are not sufficiently clear; however, in the Old Testament the tabernacle as a type presents a clear picture.</p>
<p>The separating line between the church and worldly people is the clean, white condition of the saints. This clean, white condition is the result of God&rsquo;s redemption, and God&rsquo;s redemption is based upon the judgment that the Lord bore for us. From the picture of the tabernacle we see that the boundary of the tabernacle was a line of white cloth. When we examine this picture further, we can see that the white linen was hanging on silver rods that connected the pillars, which were standing in bronze sockets. The separation, the boundary, between the church and the world is the condition of the church&rsquo;s being justified by God, which makes her clean and white. This condition issues from God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s redemption is based upon the judgment that Christ bore for us. This point requires much care. The bronze sockets signify the Lord&rsquo;s suffering the judgment of God on our behalf. Redemption issued from this judgment; hence, the silver rods were above the bronze sockets. Redemption produces justification; hence, the fine white linen was hanging from the silver rods. The fine white linen, however, not only signifies our justification before God but also our justification, which is expressed and hung before men to see.</p>
<p>If we read about the types in the Old Testament carefully, we will see that the tabernacle contained fine white linen within and without. When a person looked at the tabernacle from a distance, he would see fine white linen. If he entered into the tabernacle, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies, he would see fine white linen with strands of blue, purple, and scarlet, as well as embroidered cherubim. The first layer of fine white linen in the tabernacle typifies that we are saved, justified, and accepted by God because of the Lord&rsquo;s redemption. The fine white linen in the hangings of the tabernacle also indicates that our justification before God is manifested among the worldly people as the boundary between us and them. Among our colleagues, family, friends, and relatives, there should be an expression in us that we are justified by God. The hangings, the white linen, signify the justification that we express, which is the separating boundary between the church and the world. This white line issues from God&rsquo;s redemption, and God&rsquo;s redemption is based upon the judgment that the Lord bore for us. Hence, white linen was hung on the silver rods, and the silver rods were on the pillars standing in the bronze sockets.</p>
<p>The linen hangings of the outer court make the boundary between the church and the world crystal clear. The three main items with respect to the hangings are bronze sockets, silver rods, and fine white linen. The bronze sockets signify the Lord&rsquo;s bearing God&rsquo;s judgment, the silver rods signify the Lord&rsquo;s redemption, and the fine white linen signifies God&rsquo;s justification. Judgment, redemption, and justification are the separating line between the church and the world. The church consists of those who have accepted the judgment that the Lord received on the cross and who have been redeemed and justified by God. Everyone else is outside of the church, outside of the boundary. The separating boundary between the church and the world is drawn in this way: Whoever has received the Lord&rsquo;s redemption and God&rsquo;s justification by receiving the Lord Jesus&rsquo; judgment on the cross is within the boundary. Whoever has not received the Lord&rsquo;s redemption and God&rsquo;s justification is outside of the boundary.</p>
<p>The responsible brothers in all the local churches must be aware that if they bring someone who has not been redeemed by the Lord or justified by God into the church, they are eliminating the boundary of the church. This can be likened to the tabernacle without the hangings. Without the hangings, the tabernacle would have no boundary. We must be very careful in this matter. Today in many so-called Christian churches, there are no linen hangings. Not only have the linen hangings been taken down, but the bronze sockets have been taken away. This means that some who have not received the work of the Lord Jesus on the cross, who have not received the redemption of the Lord, and who have not been justified by God have become part of the so-called Christian churches. This creates an abnormal situation of confusion.</p>
<p>Our main emphasis, however, is regarding the fine white linen. The boundary of the church is the fine white linen. Anything that is within this boundary is fine, clean, white, and beautiful, without any filthiness or coarseness. We must realize that justification is not merely a doctrine, that is, something objective; it is also something very subjective to us. Justification relates not only to our position but also to our living. This means that we not only confess that Christ suffered judgment on our behalf, that the Lord&rsquo;s blood is for our redemption, and that God has justified us, but we also experience a change in our being. Hence, justification is not merely an objective doctrine but also our subjective experience.</p>
<p>Anyone who has received the Lord&rsquo;s work of the cross and is truly justified by God must display the condition of the fine white linen. If a person has only the fact of justification in Romans and Galatians without the proof of the justification in the Epistle of James, we should put a question mark on the justification he has received. If a person truly has received the justification in Romans and Galatians, he will have the works of justification in James. The justification spoken of in James is related to works and in one&rsquo;s living.</p>
<p>When a sinful and filthy person, who formerly did all kinds of evil, hears the gospel, receives the Lord as his Savior, and is redeemed and justified by God, there should be a great change in his living. It is difficult to believe that a person who is full of sinful stains will have no change in his living after receiving the Lord&rsquo;s redemption, God&rsquo;s justification, and God&rsquo;s life. If this is the case, his believing is questionable.</p>
<p>Zaccheus, the tax collector, had a great turn in his being after he met and touched the Lord (Luke 19). Once he received the Lord, his life changed. He said to the Lord, &ldquo;Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much&rdquo; (v. 8). In the past he received but never gave. After meeting the Lord, he not only dealt with his unrighteous possessions but also tried his best to give away everything that he owned. His life was completely changed. This shows that justification is a matter not only before God but also before man. Justification is a wall of linen for man to see. It testifies that worldly people are on one side and the church is on the other side. Those who are within the boundary of the church should be like fine white linen, expressing a significant change in their living.</p>
<p>The church should remove from among them a saint who is a fornicator, a covetous man, an idolater, a reviler, a drunkard, or a rapacious man (1 Cor. 5:11-13), because the boundary of the church is fine white linen. If a saint is unclean, he will contaminate the fine white linen. Like the lepers in the Old Testament, he is unclean, and he must be cast outside the clean white boundary. He must be dealt with in another place and wait until his leprosy is cleansed before coming back within the boundary.</p>
<p>Although we cannot define a certain truth based solely upon our personal experience of salvation, our experience always testifies to the meaning of the truth. It is inconceivable that after receiving the Lord, a person would have no change in his living before man. The gospel is the power of God. If someone has received the gospel in a proper way, he will undergo an immediate change. This is an unalterable fact without any exceptions. This change causes our walk, our behavior, and our living to be as clean as white linen. Formerly, we were full of stains, coarseness, and roughness, but now we are saved. God&rsquo;s life is in us, and our living has changed. What we express is not only clean and white but also gentle and fine. We have the condition of fine white linen. To be coarse is to be rough. An unsaved person is coarse and rough even in his gentleness. To be fine is to be gentle. A saved person is gentle and fine.</p>
<p>Most of us work in various professions, and the people whom we contact every day are worldly people. The separating line between us and them is not a Christian symbol that we wear, but the fine white linen within us. They can lie, but we cannot; they can give and take bribes, but we cannot; they can do things that wrong the nation, but we cannot; they can freely take possession of public property, but we cannot. There must be a distinct separating line between us and the worldly people. This separating line is not that we call ourselves Christians but that we bear the expression of fine white linen. As a result, we have a walk and living that is clean and fine. The worldly people should testify: &ldquo;This person belongs to the church and is different from us.&rdquo; We may sometimes attend certain banquets in order to meet a need. While others are able to eat, drink, and talk casually, we cannot, because there is a distinction between us and them. As a result, people will say, &ldquo;Oh, he belongs to the church.&rdquo; This is the reality of the boundary of the tabernacle.</p>
<p>We are a group of people who have received the Lord&rsquo;s work of the cross, the Lord&rsquo;s redemption, and God&rsquo;s justification. The justification that we have received from God &ldquo;hangs&rdquo; upon us for others to see. This is not a matter related to the doctrine of justification but to expressing our condition of justification. We prove our justification by the condition of our living. In the picture seen in this type, the hangings of fine linen were not for God to see but for man to see. God was within the veil, and the veil was not transparent. Hence, the hangings were for man to see.</p>
<p>During the time the children of Israel were wandering in the wilderness, the white linen hangings surrounding the tabernacle formed a boundary whenever the tabernacle was erected. Even people who were far away in the wilderness could see the white boundary. All other colors are mixtures; only the linen hangings were clean and white. The tabernacle was within a white boundary. This typifies that the church is clean, white, and fine to those who contact her. If people can say that a certain church is clean, white, and fine, the church has a proper expression.</p>
<p>The boundary was not related to the bronze sockets and the silver rods but only to the clean, fine, and white linen hangings. These linen hangings were hung on silver rods, and the silver rods were on pillars that had their base in the bronze sockets. This typifies that the distinction between the church and the world depends upon the expression of justification in the saints, which is worn and is based on redemption and judgment. The fine white linen not only signifies the justification that we receive from God but also the expression of this justification before worldly people as a separating line between us and them.</p>
<p>The church should have a boundary of linen hangings; it should be located within a clean, white boundary. Today&rsquo;s Christianity has lost its white linen hangings. Its condition is just as filthy as that of society and as corrupt as that of the worldly people. This should not be the case. Nevertheless, we should not use human methods to draw a separating line; instead, we should always look to the Lord for His mercy so that the power of His salvation would not depart from us. The gospel is the power of God. We should preach not only the gospel but also the power. It is not enough for people to merely hear the gospel; they need to touch the power. When we baptize people, we should not merely ask them to receive a doctrine and then baptize them into the water with a view to making them &ldquo;members&rdquo; of the church. We must ask the Lord for mercy so that when people touch our gospel preaching, they also touch power. When people receive the gospel, a power should operate in them to the extent that they would not only be justified by God but would also wear the fine white linen of justification. The justification that they receive from God should be worn, hung, expressed, and displayed before men. This will enable others to see that they are justified by God and that they are wearing fine white linen. This is the real boundary of the church.</p>
<p>I have a heavy burden that all of God&rsquo;s children would see the separating line of the church. The church is set apart. Hence, those in the church must also be set apart. A church without this separating line has lost her linen hangings. Anyone who enters the church must pass through regeneration and experience some definite change. The Lord said, &ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God&rdquo; (John 3:5). In our daily living, we cannot avoid speaking about something humorous, but on certain occasions, we must not utter even one humorous word for the sake of drawing a separating line. The church is a realm that is only for those who have been regenerated and have experienced changes in their life and behavior. Whoever is still in old garments and has not put on new garments cannot enter into this realm.</p>
<p>In Luke 15 the father put the best robe on his son. When he saw his son from a long way off, he ran and fell on his son&rsquo;s neck and kissed him affectionately. The son immediately confessed to the father, but before he could finish his speaking, the father asked his slaves to bring out the best robe and put it upon him (vv. 20-22). The son did not put on the robe inside the house but outside the house. Later the fattened calf was eaten inside the house (v. 23). Thus, everyone who participatesin the church must first take off his old garment and put on a new garment.</p>
<p>Sadly, after some people change their garments in baptism,they do not have much of a change in their life and living. Although they have been baptized, they remain the same, living in their old manner of life, their old living. This is wrong. One who is baptized into the church and is received by the church must change his garment, that is, his living.</p>
<p>The linen hangings form a separating line, testifying that a person is redeemed and justified by God. Inside the hangings is the outer court. The hangings testify to those outside concerning the contents of the outer court. Here we see that a person may be redeemed by God and changed before men but still not enjoy Christ inwardly. Formerly he was filthy. Now he is not only cleansed, but his life has truly been changed. Nevertheless, these are merely outward changes. The first stage of being a Christian is to express the condition of fine white linen before men. However, this is typified by the altar and the laver in the outer court. At this stage, the believer has not yet entered into much experience of the church; thus, he still needs to go from the outer court and enter into the Holy Place and then into the Holy of Holies.</p><h2 class="head3">The Veil</h2>
<p>A person could enter the outer court by passing through the linen hangings of the tabernacle. In order to go from the Holy Place into the Holy of Holies, it was necessary to pass through a veil. The outer boundary of the tabernacle consisted of linen hangings, and within the tabernacle was a veil. The linen hangings formed a separating line, and the veil within also formed a separating line. Even though the tabernacle was divided into three sections, there was only one separating line within the tabernacle. While there was a distinction between the Holy Place and the outer court, they were connected. The distinction between the Holy Place and the outer court was not absolute. There was a distinction but not a division between them. The separation between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, however, was quite different. There was not merely a distinction but a division, a complete separation. Strictly speaking, the tabernacle was divided into three sections with one separating line, the veil.</p>
<p>If a person in the church wants to progress from being an outward Christian to being an inward Christian, he must pass through the veil. An outward Christian is typified by one who is either in the outer court or in the Holy Place. It does not matter if, according to the type, he is offering sacrifices, washing his hands and feet, putting the bread of the Presence on the table, lighting the lamps, or offering incense at the incense altar; in all these matters he is an outward Christian. He is within the boundary of the fine white linen hangings, yet he is not within the veil. He has passed the separating boundary between the world and the church, but he has not passed through the separating line of the veil. He has entered into the outer court and even into the Holy Place, but he has not entered into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:20 says, &ldquo;The veil, that is, His flesh.&rdquo; This is the flesh that is spoken of in John 1:14. According to the human understanding, flesh is not positive. However, when the Lord became a man, He actually became flesh. He was exactly the same as us in outward appearance. The serpent that was lifted up on the pole was exactly the same in appearance as the serpents that bit the people (Num. 21:4-9). The Lord came to be a man by becoming flesh. The veil in Hebrews 10 is His flesh. Hence, <em>flesh</em> denotes fallen human beings.</p>
<p>The veil signifies our flesh, and thus it also signifies us as fallen human beings. The Lord Jesus was sinless, but He came in the likeness of the flesh of sin on our behalf (Rom. 8:3). The Lord Jesus Himself never fell and was without sin, but we, His redeemed ones, are fallen and sinful. He was not fleshly, but we are fleshly. The separating line in this verse is our fallen being. The separation between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies is the veil, the fallen man, the flesh. This separation is not the same as the white linen hanging along the outer boundary of the tabernacle. The separation of white linen is a matter of making a distinction between righteousness and unrighteousness, cleanliness and filthiness, darkness and light, and fineness and coarseness. However, the main emphasis in regard to the veil is whether it has been rent and whether the man of the flesh has been cleft.</p>
<p>We should not understand Hebrews 10 in a manner that is too objective. While the rent veil signifies the Lord Jesus&rsquo; being cleft on the cross and eliminating the barrier between God and man, this view is still objective. We must check with ourselves: He has been cleft, but how about us? The Lord was cleft on the cross, but have we been cleft? This means that there is still a veil between us and God. In fact, we ourselves are the veil. We may have been saved and bear an expression that is clean and fine; nevertheless, the veil of our flesh may still be whole and not rent. The veil is not a matter of being good or evil or of being sinful and worldly; rather, it is something that must be rent. The veil separating the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies was not something evil. It was not a matter of good or evil. This veil, typifying the flesh of Christ, had to be rent so that the separation between God and man could be removed.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:14 says that He has broken down the middle wall of partition. This wall of partition refers to the wall between the Jews and the Gentiles; it has been broken down by the cross. If we read the context of this verse, we will see that the wall of partition refers to the law of the commandments in ordinances (vv. 14-16). The ordinances in the law say that Jews cannot have any dealings with Gentiles. However, this wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles has been abolished by the cross. The base of the wall is man&rsquo;s flesh (v. 15). The law is a wall, and the flesh is the base of the wall. The wall of the law is built upon the base of the flesh. Without a base, there cannot be a wall; hence, if there were no flesh, the problem of the law would not exist. The cross has already abolished the base of the law, which is the flesh; therefore, the wall, which is the law, has spontaneously been eliminated.</p>
<p>Today in our experience the wall of partition between us and God has not been broken down, and so the wall of partition between us and other people remains. This is not a matter of sin or the world but a matter of our self. The brothers and sisters who live in the workers&rsquo; homes share a room with two or three other people. Outwardly speaking, they may not have any opinions or differences and consequently do not quarrel, but inwardly there is a wall of partition, hindering them from having a thorough fellowship and a deeper knowledge of one another. This indicates that we ourselves are the veil between ourselves and God and between ourselves and the other saints. Neither sin nor the world separate us from God; we are the separation. The reason that we are not able to have thorough fellowship with the brothers and sisters and thus a deeper knowledge of them is because of who we are in our very being. We are the veil, the wall of partition.</p>
<p>The separation of the linen hangings is a matter related to whether or not our behavior is clean and white. The separating line between the church and the worldly people indicates that the latter is filthy, but the church is clean and white. This is a matter of righteousness versus unrighteousness, which is related to behavior. Righteousness is God&rsquo;s action. This is the first line of separation. The separation of the veil, the second separation, however, is not related to behavior but to nature. In scriptural terms, it requires the rending. Once the veil is rent, man is able to pass to the other side of the veil. If the veil is not rent, man remains outside the veil. The linen hangings are a matter of being righteous or unrighteous; the veil is a matter of being holy or unholy. Holiness is the nature of God, that is, God Himself. Righteousness is a matter of behavior, but holiness is a matter of nature.</p>
<p>Righteousness is related to God&rsquo;s hand, and love is related to God&rsquo;s heart; holiness is simply God Himself. The line separating the church from the world is the righteousness of the church. The world is unrighteous and filthy; however, the church is righteous, clean, and white. This refers to living and behavior, and it is not related to the inward nature. We may not watch movies, go dancing, or enjoy leisure like worldly people, and we may not have worldly hobbies, much less blatant sins. Nevertheless, we may still live in our self. In the eyes of the worldly people, we are clean, and white. We cannot deny that this is the result of the work of the Spirit of God within us; nevertheless, we remain whole. We have passed through the first separating line, but there is another separation that keeps us from God. This separation is neither the world nor sin; rather, it is our self. We are not a corrupted or defiled person but a redeemed and sweet person. Nevertheless, even a redeemed and sweet person can be separated from God.</p>
<p>Although the veil signifies the flesh that the Lord Jesus put on, it was not made of goats&rsquo; hair. It was exactly the same as the first layer of the covering of the tabernacle; it was made of blue, purple, and scarlet strands and fine twined linen with embroidered cherubim (Exo. 36:35). The rending of this veil indicates that a good man, a man with the glory of God, was broken and cleft. If the veil had been made of goats&rsquo; hair, the material of the second layer of the covering, it would indicate that a fallen and corrupted sinner under God&rsquo;s condemnation had been cleft.</p>
<p>Those who have been saved by God are clean and white in the eyes of others. We can even acknowledge that we are good men. However, what we are as good men still separates us from God. Consequently, the creature needs to be broken. The creature that expresses God needs to be broken, not the fallen, sinning creature. Cherubim, on one hand, signify God&rsquo;s glory and, on the other hand, signify God&rsquo;s creatures. The glory of God is upheld by creatures, the cherubim. Even creatures such as the cherubim need to be broken. The creature that needs to be broken is not the sinful creature who loses his temper but rather the creature who expresses God.</p>
<p>The first half of Romans speaks of the matter of righteousness. Chapters 1 through 5 are related to behavior. Chapter 1 records all kinds of filthiness. Romans 1 can be compared to a person clothed in a garment that was taken from a garbage dump, a person covered with filthiness. In chapter 3 the blood is introduced, and in chapter 4 man is justified. In the first half of chapter 5, we see a person clothed in a clean, white garment without any defilement. He is able to stand before God and is in accordance with God&rsquo;s righteous law; he is able to stand before the great white throne and match the color of the throne. In chapter 5 the person is clean and white; he has been reconciled to God and has peace with God. The matter of righteousness has been satisfied, and this forms a white boundary. Anyone who has gone from chapter 1 to chapter 5 is within the white boundary and in the church. Anyone who stays in chapter 1 is outside of the white boundary. Roman 1 through 5 speaks of entering the first boundary of the church.</p>
<p>The second half of Romans is on the matter of sanctification. Beginning in chapter 5, the focus is on our nature. In chapter 8 there is the matter of being &ldquo;conformed to the image of His Son&rdquo; (v. 29). Before speaking of image, chapter 8 begins with the spirit. We should live in the spirit, not in ourselves or in the flesh. This is a matter related to a change of nature, not behavior. The matter of behavior was dealt with prior to 5:12. Now our nature needs to be dealt with and changed. This means that merely changing a garment is not enough. We musthave a change in the inward source. We need an inward change from the flesh to the spirit and from man to God.</p>
<p>In the second half of chapter 8, the matter of image is mentioned. A person may have clean, white behavior but still be void of the image of God. Hence, it is not merely a matter of being clean and white but of having the likeness of God. Does our cleanness come from ourselves or does it come from God living in us? There is a great difference. Then in chapter 12 the Body is presented, not as a matter of behavior but as a matter of enlargement. It is Christ being enlarged in us. Our behavior cannot produce the church; only the enlargement of Christ can produce the church.</p>
<p>Whether or not the church is righteous is related merely to how the worldly people see the church; it is not directly related to God&rsquo;s dwelling place. In other words, God&rsquo;s dwelling is not directly inside the hangings of fine white linen. The hangings are merely a separating line. Only in the Holy of Holies is there a dwelling place where God and man can be joined together. The white linen hangings are related to the matter of behavior; however, the separation between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies is related to the matter of nature, which is related to our union with God and the presence of God. The reason that the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies are holy is that the presence of God is there. If we want to enter into God, into His presence, we as the veil must be rent.</p>
<p>This veil does not refer to things or matters outside of us; it refers only to our created and redeemed being. We, the created and redeemed people, are a veil, which must be rent. This rending enables us to know God&rsquo;s presence, to be joined to God as one. This rending enables us to be in God&rsquo;s holiness, in God Himself, instead of merely being in the realm of God&rsquo;s righteousness. This is a radical separation. Sadly, there are too few in the church who are this kind of person and who pay attention to this matter. Many pay attention to the first separating line, but hardly anyone pays attention to the second separation. Not only are there few who pay attention to this matter, but there is also little light regarding this matter. Many messages have been released related to the first separating line at the white linen hangings, but very few people speak concerning the veil, the second separating line.</p>
<p>We are the veil. We are a separation. <em>We</em> refers to those who are created and redeemed, not to those who are fallen and not redeemed. We, the created and redeemed ones, are the veil between us and God. We may be good, but we are still outside of God&rsquo;s countenance; we may be good, but we are still apart from God; we may be good, but we still have not been mingled with God. We are the veil, and this veil needs to be rent.</p>
<p>Although this kind of person is rare in the church, some are like this. If we look at the ratio of the size of the sections in the tabernacle, we will realize that the outer court was quite large. More people were able to fit there. Also, the Holy Place was twice the size of the Holy of Holies. The Holy Place was twenty square cubits, and the Holy of Holies was ten square cubits. Twenty square cubits equals ten square cubits multiplied by two. This means that there are few in the Holy of Holies, more in the Holy Place, and many more in the outer court. Those in the Holy of Holies have been broken in their natural life. They have been broken before God. There are few such persons in the church. However, this group of people can touch God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>The Old Testament shows that all the actions in the Holy Place and all the activities in the outer court were governed by the Holy of Holies. When the condition of the Holy of Holies was proper, the actions in the Holy Place and the activities in the outer court were also proper. Whenever the condition of the Holy of Holies was even slightly off, the condition of the Holy Place and the outer court were also affected. It is the same in the church. If even one of us or a few among us are in the Holy of Holies, our outward activities will be proper; however, if none of us enter into the Holy of Holies, the condition of the Holy of Holies will be poor, and all our outward activities will have problems. All the activities in the outer court were governed by the Holy Place, and all the actions in the Holy Place were governed by the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>If there is hardly anyone in the church living in the Holy of Holies, the outward activities of the church will have problems. The activities of the church depend upon the condition of those who are in the Holy of Holies. If there are some in this condition, the outward activities will be proper; otherwise, the outward activities will be improper. The Holy of Holies is the kernel, the center of the church. A peach has a stone, or pit, and within the pit is a kernel. The life of the peach is contained in the kernel. In the same way, the life of the church is contained in the Holy of Holies. If no one lives within the Holy of Holies in the church, the life of the church and the outward activities of the church will have problems.</p>
<p>In order to enter into the Holy of Holies, a person must pass through two separating lines. If he passes through only the first line, he is still an outward person. He can be considered to be an inward person, an inward Christian, only after passing through the second line. To enter from the outer court into the Holy of Holies requires that we pass through the Holy Place. The Holy Place is not inward, because the items in it are apparent and visible; hence, they are still outward. It is only when we enter into the Holy of Holies that all the items become hidden and invisible; this is something deep and inward.</p>
<p>Thus, there are two separating lines. There is also a separating line between the Holy Place and the outer court, but it is not of vital importance. Although there is a difference between the Holy Place and the outer court, the difference is not that great. However, between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies there is a strict, impenetrable separation, the veil. A person may never have seen that Christ is his life and thus may remain in himself. However, another person may have seen that Christ is his life and may also remain in himself. One person, who remains in himself, may think that it is boring and tasteless to pray. However, another person, who remains in himself, may pray livingly and strongly. This is because he has not passed from outside the veil to within the veil. His being forms a separation that has not been broken. His separation is nothing other than himself.</p>
<p>Those who enter through the fine white linen hangings are in the tabernacle and have been separated from those outside of the tabernacle. Within the tabernacle, however, there is another separating line&mdash;the veil. Only those within the veil live in God. Everyone in the church should bear an expression of fine white linen and be inside the white hangings made of fine twined linen. Among these people, however, some are within the veil, and others remain outside. Those outside the veil are great in number, and those within the veil are small in number. Turning from being an unbeliever to being a believer is to pass through the separating line of the fine white linen hangings; turning from the outer man to the inner man is to pass through the separation of the veil. The purpose of our studying these types is to be deeply impressed with a picture. Our intention is not merely to expound the Bible; instead, we look to the Lord that He would open our eyes to see the church and the spiritual boundaries in the church so that we may advance.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us that some among us would enter into the Holy of Holies. In this matter we cannot help one another. No one except God can bring us into the Holy of Holies. The veil was not rent by itself or by others. We need to see that the veil was split in two from top to bottom, indicating that it was split by God (Matt. 27:51). We have no way to break one another. The more we try to break each other, the harder we will become. Often when we try to deal with a certain brother, he only becomes stronger. We have no way to make other people spiritual, and they have no way to make us spiritual. Only God can do this.</p>
<p>One day God will come to tear us down, just as He did with Job. Job was the best veil. The veil was made of fine white linen with a heavenly color and the condition of being redeemed, royal, and noble. Job was such a person. One day, however, God came to split this veil in two. After God accomplished this, Job was able to say, &ldquo;I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear, / But now my eye has seen You&rdquo; (Job 42:5). This is when Job entered into the Holy of Holies to see God and to enjoy His presence. This was God&rsquo;s act, and no one could render any help. The Lord will do such a work in us for the sake of His church. Our responsibility is to allow Him to do His work.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s rending work can be done only in a person like Job. God will not do such a work in those who do not love Him, in those who love the world and act wildly. God does a rending work only in those like Job. We must see that the number of people among us who enter the Holy of Holies is the number of those who have been rent. The life and the activities of the church depend entirely upon this. If some are in the Holy of Holies, the outward activities will be proper. But if some are not in the Holy of Holies, then the outward activities will have problems.</p>
<p>Though the tabernacle presents a clear picture of the church, we do not claim that we have seen it thoroughly. We simply walk about Zion and go around her, counting her towers (Psa. 48:12). I believe that the Holy Spirit will grant us more light that we may clearly see the church. When we advance and grow in life, the light will follow and shine upon us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(9)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TEMPLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head2">The Temple</h2>
<p>The temple and the tabernacle reveal two aspects of the church, each appearing in two different periods of Israel&rsquo;s history. During the time of Israel&rsquo;s sojourning in the wilderness, there was the tabernacle; after Israel settled down in Canaan, there was the temple. In its move, it was the tabernacle, and in its residence, it was the temple. Just as the tabernacle is a type of the church, the temple is also a type of the church. Everything related to the tabernacle, which typifies the church, is included in the temple. Nevertheless, there are a few items of the church that are not spoken of in relation to the type of the tabernacle. These items require the supplement of the temple; likewise, some items of the church require the supplement of the tabernacle. When the aspects of the tabernacle and the temple are considered together, the church can be completely and clearly explained.</p>
<p>There are four related aspects to the types of the tabernacle and temple. First, both the tabernacle and the temple typify the Lord Jesus Himself. In John 2:19 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo; At that time the Jews did not understand what this word meant, but later the disciples understood that the Lord was referring to His body. The Lord Jesus was the temple of God on earth. The Jews used the hands of the Gentiles to destroy the body of the Lord Jesus, but after three days He was raised from the dead (vv. 21-22). This clearly shows that the Lord Jesus is the temple.</p>
<p>Second, both the tabernacle and the temple typify the church. Just as the tabernacle was God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth, the temple also was God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth.</p>
<p>Third, both the tabernacle and the temple typify the individual saints. First Corinthians 6:19 says that our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, a temple of God. In the tabernacle there were three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. The temple was also composed of these three sections. Both types reveal that we as individuals are composed of three parts: body, soul, and spirit (1 Thes. 5:23).</p>
<p>Fourth, both the tabernacle and the temple typify the New Jerusalem. In the new heavens and the new earth, the temple will be enlarged into a city, the New Jerusalem. There will be no temple in the New Jerusalem because the temple will be enlarged into a city (Rev. 21:22). Today God&rsquo;s dwelling can be likened to a house, but in eternity God&rsquo;s dwelling will be a city. The house will be enlarged into a city.</p>
<p>In considering the temple as a type of the church, we need to pay special attention to the builders, the material, and the way the temple was built.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Builders</h2>
<h2 class="head4">David</h2>
<p>Two persons built the temple: David and Solomon. Both David and Solomon typify Christ. David typifies Christ in His sufferings, and Solomon typifies Christ in glory. The temple was built by these two persons. In a strict sense, Solomon built the temple, but David cannot be excluded because he had much to do with its building.</p>
<h2 class="head5">The Desire</h2>
<p>David&rsquo;s desire was to find a dwelling place for God and to build a resting place for God. This desire typifies Christ&rsquo;s desire. Second Samuel 7 and Psalm 132 both record that David swore to find a resting place for God. David had a strong desire and made an oath because the Ark of God did not have a dwelling place. The Ark was God&rsquo;s representative on earth. The fact that the Ark did not have a dwelling place indicated that God did not have a dwelling place on earth. When Christ came to the earth, He desired to find a dwelling place for God and to build a resting place for God, that is, to establish the church as God&rsquo;s resting place on earth. Hence, the church is God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth. Without the church, God does not have a dwelling place or a resting place on the earth.</p><h2 class="head5">The Preparation</h2>
<p>Even though David had this desire, God did not allow David to build a house for Him because David had shed blood abundantly and waged great wars (1 Chron. 22:7-8). In typology, this refers to Christ in His suffering before He entered into glory. He was not able to build the temple until He entered into glory. As long as Christ stayed in His suffering, the church could not be produced. In God&rsquo;s ordination, David could not build the temple. Instead, he did the preparation work.</p>
<h2 class="head6">The Materials</h2>
<p>First Chronicles 22:14 speaks of David&rsquo;s preparation of the materials. David told Solomon, &ldquo;Now then in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah...gold...silver and bronze and iron without weight, for it is in abundance; and timber and stone I have prepared.&rdquo; In his affliction David prepared all the materials for the building of the temple. According to typology, in His affliction Christ prepared all the materials for the building of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head6">The Site</h2>
<p>David not only prepared the materials but also the site for the building of the temple. The site was the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite (21:18-30). When Solomon&rsquo;s time came, he simply carried out the building work. This indicates that in His suffering Christ prepared everything&mdash;both the materials and the site&mdash;needed for the building of the church. Thus, when Christ entered into glory, He could begin to build. David told Solomon that the materials that he had prepared were sufficient but that Solomon could add to them (22:14). In reality, most of the materials were prepared in David&rsquo;s time. In principle, this shows that Christ in His suffering prepared all that was needed for the building of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Solomon</h2>
<p>In typology, Solomon and David signify two aspects of one person. David typifies Christ in His sufferings, and Solomon typifies Christ in His glory.</p>
<h2 class="head5">Being Glorified</h2>
<p>After Solomon was made king, the first thing he did was build the temple. This means that as soon as Christ entered into glory, He produced the church. Christ&rsquo;s glorification is recorded at the end of the Gospels (Matt. 28; Mark 16:6-20; Luke 24:46-51; John 20:19-31). Then in the beginning of Acts, the church was produced. As recorded in Acts 2, the church was produced on the day of Pentecost. This can be compared to the day on which Solomon completed the temple. Solomon&rsquo;s being made king and his enthronement were his exaltation and glorification by the Israelites; these were absolutely related to the building of the temple. Likewise, Christ&rsquo;s exaltation and glorification are absolutely related to the producing and building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head5">Building the Temple</h2>
<p>As soon as Solomon was made king, he built the temple (1 Kings 6). This typifies that as soon as Christ was glorified, He produced the church.</p>
<h2 class="head5">The Ark Entering the Temple</h2>
<p>After Solomon completed the temple, the priests brought the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah into it. On the day when the temple was dedicated to God, it was filled with the glory of God (8:6, 10). God obtained a dwelling place on the earth and caused His glory to fill it. Once the temple was built up and God obtained a dwelling on earth, He could fully express His glory. The temple&rsquo;s dedication is a type of the day of Pentecost; once the church was produced on the earth, the glory of God was expressed on the earth and filled the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Building Materials</h2>
<h2 class="head4">The Preparation and Obtaining of the Materials</h2>
<p>The materials for the building of the temple were prepared in part by David and in part by Solomon. If we carefully read 1 Kings 5 through 6 and 1 Chronicles 22, 28, and 29, we will see that David prepared most of the materials for the building of the temple and that Solomon prepared a small part. David plus Solomon typify the complete Christ. David typifies Christ in His death; thus, everything prepared by David typifies what Christ obtained in His death. Likewise, Solomon typifies Christ in His resurrection; everything Solomon prepared typifies what Christ obtained in His resurrection. Hence, the obtaining of the materials for the building of the church depends on Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. Most of these materials were obtained by Christ&rsquo;s death, and a small part was obtained by His resurrection.</p><h2 class="head4">The Categories of Materials</h2>
<p>According to the record in the Old Testament, the principal building materials for the temple were timber and stone; in addition, there were gold, silver, and bronze.</p>
<h2 class="head5">Timber</h2>
<p>First Kings 5 and 6 show that two kinds of timber were used to build the temple: cedar and cypress (5:6, 8-10; 6:9, 15-20, 34).</p>
<h2 class="head6">Cedar</h2>
<p>The cedar used for the building of the temple came from tall trees grown in the mountains of Lebanon (5:6). In the Old Testament times cedar was a valuable timber. In the temple all the places where timber could be seen were made of cedar. Cedar denotes resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head6">Cypress</h2>
<p>The term <em>pine tree</em> mentioned in the Chinese Union Version is better translated as &ldquo;cypress tree.&rdquo; In ancient China, people planted cypress trees at gravesites because an evergreen cypress symbolizes everlasting life. In biblical typology cypress trees signify death. The acacia wood in the furniturea nd utensils of the tabernacle signify humanity, cypress signifies humanity in death, and cedar signifies humanity in resurrection. The two kinds of timber used in the temple&mdash;cypress and cedar&mdash;signify death and resurrection.</p>
<p>The tabernacle was constructed mostly of gold and wood. Gold signifies divinity, and wood signifies humanity. This means that the church is the mingling of God and man. The principle of the mingling of God and man is also seen in the building of the temple, where the aspect of wood is quite important. This shows that in the church the human element is very important. As far as our natural being is concerned, the church is not composed of natural persons, but as far as our resurrected being is concerned, the church is full of the human element. If the church were not composed of men, it would have no material and could not be established and built up. The church can be compared to the temple in ancient Israel. Most of the materials were cypress and cedar, signifying persons who have died and resurrected. The church is not composed of natural persons but of persons who have passed through death and entered into resurrection, that is, persons who are as cypress and cedar.</p>
<p>When I began to serve the Lord, I did not know what it meant to experience death and resurrection in the matter of serving God, nor did I know the experience of death and resurrection in the church. Although I was clear about these matters doctrinally, I did not have any subjective experience. I believe that many people are in this situation. After years of experience, however, I have gained a deep understanding concerning this matter. For example, some saints are truly talented. When we contact them, it is easy to think that they could be very useful in the church. Saints will also frequently suggest that a certain person could be very useful in the church because he has run a business, operated a factory, participated in education, or accomplished some great matter. This kind of speaking may seem correct, but if we have experience and light, we will realize that this concept is natural and questionable.</p>
<p>Although the basic building material for the church is humanity, it must not be natural humanity. In the temple there was no timber besides cedar and cypress. Man&rsquo;s natural ability can never be brought into the church or become building material for the church. In the church there is nothing natural. Whenever people try to bring their natural abilities into the church, the reality of the church is lost. Only that which passes through death and resurrection can be brought into the church.</p>
<p>How can we differentiate natural ability from ability that has passed through death and resurrection? There is a great difference between the two. In this regard, we do not need to speak doctrinally; instead, we must know this matter according to experience. First, all natural ability contains pride; everything that we can do naturally causes us to be proud. Hence, anything that we do in the church which causes us to be proud is natural. If a brother cleans the windows in the meeting hall nicely and thinks that he has done the best job, he has a problem. His thought proves that he is still natural.</p>
<p>Paul boasted in the book of 1 Corinthians, but there was no pride in his boast. He was forced by the Corinthians to boast, but it was not expedient for him to do so. His boast was in resurrection, in spirit (cf. ch. 9). When we read 1 Corinthians, we sense that Paul was a person whose speech was straightforward, whose spirit was clean, and whose flesh had been crucified. In other words, in 1 Corinthians Paul was pure. If our boasting gives people a feeling that we are impure and fleshly, we are still natural.</p>
<p>Second, natural ability causes self-reliance. To rely on ourselves means to have confidence in ourselves. If we sense that we are secure and trustworthy in the matter of serving God and if we are full of confidence that everything put into our hand will be successful, we still have the natural element. Everything that comes out of the natural man, just as everything that issues from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, causes us to have much confidence in ourselves and not to depend on God. Everything that passes through death and resurrection, just as everything that issues from the tree of life, causes us not to depend on ourselves and not to have confidence in ourselves but rather to depend on God.</p>
<p>Third, natural ability is temporary and unable to withstand tests, setbacks, or opposition. If we serve in the church by our natural ability, we will stop as soon as the saints criticize us and be discouraged after the elders have dealt with us. If something can cause us not to complete our service or can discourage us, our service is quite natural. Everything that passes through death and resurrection is able to endure and withstand opposition, criticism, and setbacks. It is able to stand firm in the midst of a test.</p>
<p>Fourth, those who serve according to natural ability desire rewards or, at least, appreciation from others. Some brothers and sisters require people&rsquo;s gratitude, exaltation, and appreciation for their service in the church; this is to seek a reward. After doing a certain thing, they hope the responsible brothers will appreciate and praise them. They seek to receive a reward. If the responsible brothers ignore their service, they become cold and backslide. If they receive a compliment, however, they are excited and seek to do even better. This proves that they are still serving God in the natural man.</p>
<p>Fifth, natural ability likes to manifest itself, to be known by man, and to be carried out in front of man. The five preceding points are a gauge and a check as to whether a saint is still living in the natural man or has passed through death and resurrection.</p>
<p>Those who have passed through death and resurrection are not proud and do not have a consciousness of success. Although they may have done many things well, they do not consider that they have done something special. In Matthew 25 the Lord commended the sheep, saying, &ldquo;I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me a drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in, naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me&rdquo; (vv. 35-36). In response, the sheep asked, &ldquo;Lord, when have we seen You hungry and have fed You, or thirsty and have given You a drink? And when have we seen You a stranger and have taken You in, or naked and have clothed You?&rdquo; (vv. 37-38). Their response indicates that they were not conscious of doing those things. This is similar to a healthy person who is not conscious of breathing even though he is breathing constantly. A person in resurrection may do many things, but he is not conscious of doing those things.</p>
<p>If a person is immediately conscious of what he has done and desires others&rsquo; appreciation, he is not right. If a brother is full of feeling when he offers material things for the Lord&rsquo;s work, his offering certainly contains a natural element. If his giving is in resurrection, he will not have any feeling, even if he gives half of his possessions. In matters such as helping the brothers and sisters or giving hospitality, we will be very conscious of our actions if we are in our natural man, but if we are in resurrection, we will not have any consciousness. Whatever passes through death and resurrection comes out of life, and what comes out of life is spontaneous, without any special feeling. For instance, when our body is healthy and normal, we are not conscious of our blood&rsquo;s circulation and our stomach&rsquo;s digestion. Thus, if we inwardly have a sense of accomplishment after doing a certain thing or fulfilling a task, we are still in our natural man.</p>
<p>Everything that comes out of resurrection is able to endure and to withstand any blow. The Lord said in John 2:19, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo; This is resurrection. Resurrection is the ability to rise up in the midst of any setback. When Peter was preaching concerning the Lord in Acts 2:24, he said that it was not possible for Him to be held by death. The Lord resurrected because He could not be held by death. Resurrection cannot be constrained, bound, or oppressed. Instead, the more the oppression and death it experiences, the more it grows. The more the opposition, the stronger it becomes; the more there is criticism, the more living it becomes; and the more it is despised, the more it multiplies.</p>
<p>Whatever issues from resurrection does not need a reward, and what comes out of life is not affected by criticism. A person such as this, in both the work and service of the church, has passed through death and resurrection. Such a person never thinks of other people&rsquo;s assessment of him and does not expect any appreciation or reward from man. He labors according to an inward sense of peace and joy, not caring for outward things. On the contrary, a natural person serves more fervently if he is commended, because compliments touch him; however, he withdraws when others are cold toward him, because he is touched by the coldness. Some people will not pray a second time if no one says Amen to their first prayer, yet if many people say Amen to their prayer, they will pray even louder. The Amen is their reward, but this indicates that they are living in the natural man. A person who has passed through death and resurrection cannot be touched by people&rsquo;s appreciation or indifference.</p>
<p>Furthermore, whatever is of resurrection is hidden. Even if it is done in public, it is still hidden. No one living in resurrection likes to show off. Only fleshly ones like to show off. In the church there cannot be any who are natural; rather, everyone must experience death and resurrection. In our service we should not see only ability but also cypress and cedar, that is, death and resurrection. Today the situation of many Christians is pitiful. In the matter of material offering, there are donation records, showing who has donated the most. This kind of donation is for self-boasting. This is not cypress and cedar. It is altogether natural and has not passed through death and resurrection.</p>
<p>The fact that the temple was only cypress and cedar timber indicates that the materials for building the church must pass through death and resurrection. In the elders&rsquo; room, the deacons&rsquo; office, and the bookroom, there should be only cypress and cedar. Anything natural should not be brought into the church. The church is not strong, because there is a mixture of many kinds of wood instead of only cypress and cedar. The type of the building of the temple shows that there should be only cypress and cedar in the church, not any other kind of wood. The material of the church is composed only of what has passed through death and resurrection.</p><h2 class="head5">Stone</h2>
<p>In addition to wood, stone was used for the building of the temple (1 Kings 5:15-18). The stones were cut in a mountain quarry in the wilderness with much effort (6:7). This signifies that the materials for the building of the church are found in the world and cut with much effort. First Peter 2:4-5 says, &ldquo;Coming to Him...you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house.&rdquo; Everyone in the church is a living stone. The name Peter means &ldquo;a stone.&rdquo; In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said to Peter, &ldquo;You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; Formerly Peter&rsquo;s name was Simon, but after the Lord revealed that He would build His church, He changed Simon&rsquo;s name to Peter. This means that Peter became a stone for the building of the church.</p>
<p>Every saved one in the church is a stone in the church. Just as the stones were in the mountains of the wilderness, we were all in the world, but one day God&rsquo;s workers found us; that is, we were found by God&rsquo;s work. Then God&rsquo;s workers and God&rsquo;s work began to deal with us and do a cutting work upon us. The spiritual stones used for the building of the church must have life inwardly and be worked upon outwardly. Hence, the New Testament speaks of living stones (1 Pet. 2:5), and the Old Testament speaks of cut stones (1 Kings 5:15, 17-18; 6:7). The stones used for the building of the church must be living inwardly and must be cut outwardly. Living implies regeneration. However, after regeneration the stones still need to allow God to cut them over a long period of time.</p>
<p>In the church some brothers and sisters can be compared to &ldquo;wild&rdquo; stones, freshly cut from the quarry and full of sharp edges. When people contact them, they are hurt and have an uncomfortable feeling. Such a person, although regenerated, is short of God&rsquo;s cutting work. By the time the temple was built, all the stones had been prepared. The preparation work was done at the quarry. The stones were cut and shaped into certain sizes. In the actual construction, the stones were laid on top of each other to form the building. The way of building the temple indicates that those who are built into the church must pass through a considerable amount of God&rsquo;s cutting work.</p>
<p>Both the wood and stones which were used as building materials for the temple indicate that the materials for the building must pass through much work by God. Wood denotes death and resurrection, and stones denote man&rsquo;s need to be regenerated inwardly and dealt with outwardly. People in the church must not only pass through death and resurrection but must also have God&rsquo;s life and be dealt with by Him. Those who have been regenerated but not dealt with have no way to be built up. They may be living, but they also are raw and wild. They can be compared to freshly cut stones in a quarry that have not yet been built into a house.</p>
<p>When we consider the condition of some brothers and sisters, we cannot deny that they are stones; however, they are freshly cut stones. At this point, there is no way to be built with them. They are not stable enough to be built upon, nor are they stable enough to coordinate and serve with others, to fight the battle with others, or to bear the Ark with others. They have been regenerated, and they love the Lord, but they are not willing to be dealt with; consequently, they are full of sharp edges. They may be capable and quick-witted, but they cannot bear the testimony because they have never been dealt with.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters are too round and slippery. They are like rolling stones that can slip away no matter where they are placed. We can arrange certain things for them to do in the morning, but they sneak away in the afternoon. They may say, &ldquo;No problem, I will do it&rdquo;; however, once we turn around, they disappear. When this kind of person comes into the church to coordinate and serve, their round shape needs to be made square. There is the need for much cutting in order for them to become a certain size to match others. Then when others are placed above them, they can uphold them. In this way they will be able to coordinate and be built up with others wherever they are placed.</p>
<p>According to typology, wood signifies that the materials used for the building of the church must pass through death and resurrection, and stone signifies that the materials must be living and be dealt with. Those who have not passed through death and resurrection cannot be materials for the building of the church; moreover, those who have passed through death and resurrection must also be dealt with. Only those who have passed through death and resurrection and who have been dealt with can be materials for the building up of the church.</p><h2 class="head5">Metal</h2>
<h2 class="head6">Gold</h2>
<p>Besides wood and stone, gold was also used in the building of the temple (1 Kings 6:20-21, 30, 32, 35; 7:48-51). In typology, gold signifies a great principle in the building of the church. Gold denotes that in the church there is not only man but also God. The building of the temple and its furniture&mdash;including the Ark, the table of the bread of the Presence, and the incense altar&mdash;were all composed of wood overlaid with gold. This typifies that the materials consist of humanity plus divinity. The church has a dual nature&mdash;humanity plus divinity. The materials are men who have passed through death and resurrection, who have been dealt with, and who also contain divinity. According to the outward appearance of the temple, the stone was visible and the wood was invisible. Once a person entered the Holy Place, he saw only an abundance of gold. This indicates that the church possesses the element of God.</p>
<p>Both wood and stone signify the human element, and gold signifies the divine element. The fact that stone and wood were associated with gold indicates that humanity has been mingled with divinity. The church is God added to man. In Revelation 1:20 there are seven churches. The seven lampstands are the seven churches. The number seven is composed of three plus four. Four is the number of the creature, and three is the number of the Triune God. Three plus four is seven. This means that the church is God added to man. When God is added to man who has passed through death and resurrection and who has been dealt with, two natures&mdash;divinity and humanity&mdash;are mingled together to become God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head6"> Silver and Bronze</h2>
<p>Silver and bronze, in addition to gold, were included among the materials used in building the temple (1 Kings 7:15-47; 1 Chron. 28:14-17; 29:5). Silver was not used much in the temple; however, bronze was used in great quantity. Just as in the tabernacle, bronze was used outside of the temple. The bronze altar and the bronze laver were in the outer court of the tabernacle, and bronze sockets were underneath the linen hangings of the wall of the outer court (Exo. 27:18-19; 38:17). Likewise, in the outer court of the temple there was a molten sea with twelve oxen upholding the sea, all of which were made of bronze (1 Kings 7:23-26). Bronze signifies the judgment that the Lord bore for us, that is, His work on the cross. Although not much silver was used in the temple, there was some silver, as in the tabernacle (v. 51). This indicates that the church is God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth because the Lord Jesus was judged on the cross and accomplished redemption for us.</p>
<p>The materials for the building of the temple&mdash;bronze, silver, gold, timber, and stone&mdash;typify the materials used for the building of the church. Bronze typifies the judgment that the Lord bore on the cross. Silver typifies the redemption produced through the work of the cross. Gold typifies God Himself as divinity added into humanity. And timber and stone typify humanity that has passed through death and resurrection and has been dealt with. All these materials are the church of God on earth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(10)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TEMPLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">The Way to Build</h2>
<h2 class="head4">The Design</h2>
<p>When Moses built the tabernacle, he built it according to the pattern that was shown to him in the mountain by God. This pattern was not according to man&rsquo;s opinion or imagination but was according to God&rsquo;s revelation (Exo. 25:40; 39:42-43; Heb. 8:5). The building of the temple was carried out according to the same principle. First Chronicles 28:11-19 indicates that the Spirit of God inspired David with the design for the construction of the temple. Although God desired that man build the temple, the design of the temple was from God. God did not give man any ground to make decisions in regard to this matter.</p>
<p>God revealed to Moses the blueprint for building the tabernacle, and He revealed to David the blueprint for building the temple. Even though Solomon was the one who built the temple, he did not receive revelation directly from God; rather, he received it indirectly.</p>
<p>Solomon typifies Christ in His resurrection, and David typifies Christ in His death. The blueprint for the building of the church was not revealed at the time of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection; rather, God revealed the blueprint for building the church while Christ was passing through suffering on earth. The design for building the temple was revealed to David, not to Solomon. God did not wait until the time of Solomon to reveal the design for building the temple; rather, He revealed it while the tabernacle was wandering on the earth. Likewise, God did not wait until after the resurrection of Christ to reveal the principles for building the church; rather, He revealed them while Christ was passing through suffering on the earth. From Christ&rsquo;s speaking in Matthew 16, we can clearly see what the church should be.</p>
<p>Throughout two thousand years of church history, the Roman Catholic Church has been involved in great controversies with regard to Matthew 16. Even before the papacy was introduced into Catholicism, there were sharp contentions concerning the design of the church. Even today, there are different understandings in Roman Catholicism and Protestantism concerning the matter of the building of the church as revealed in Matthew 16. Each side builds according to its own understanding of Matthew 16, which occupies an extremely important position in defining what the church should be like on the earth.</p>
<p>Our intention in this chapter is not to expound Matthew 16; rather, by using the Lord&rsquo;s words, our desire is to declare to the saints that the Lord Jesus revealed the proper blueprint of the church to His disciples before His crucifixion. He did not wait until after His resurrection. This matches the type of the temple. The design for the building of the temple was revealed to David, not to Solomon. Even though the design for building the temple was revealed to David, the execution of that design was carried out through the hands of Solomon. David was given the design for the temple, and Solomon carried out the building of the temple. This indicates that Christ revealed the blueprint of the church while He was on the earth, and now Christ is executing the blueprint of the church in resurrection in us. Matthew 16 contains the revelation, and Acts 2 reveals the execution. The revealing One is Christ, as typified by David, and the executing One is Christ, as typified by Solomon.</p>
<p>We must pay attention to how the church should be built. The building of the church was revealed by Christ on earth and is being carried out by Christ in resurrection. When we live in resurrection and allow the resurrected Christ to have the ground in us, the blueprint revealed in Matthew 16 can be fulfilled, and when we live in resurrection, the blueprint of the church can be carried out in us.</p>
<p>The controversy between the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church is doctrinal. Having received mercy from God, we need to realize that the building of the church is not merely a matter of doctrine but also of life. If we continue to live in ourselves and continue to be natural, the design of the temple will remain a doctrine to us and not be our practical reality, even though we may have a proper understanding of Matthew 16. On the contrary, if we live in resurrection, allowing God to deal with us, learning to reject ourselves, knowing the resurrected Christ, and allowing the Spirit of Christ to have ground in us, then our spiritual condition will match Matthew 16, even if our comprehension of Matthew 16 is not adequate.</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries, the endless controversy between the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church concerning Matthew 16 has been with respect to the position of Peter. Dealing with this issue on a doctrinal level is an endless matter with no hope of a resolution. If men had been willing to judge their flesh and themselves, the pope and archbishops would not have come into being. We acknowledge that there is authority in the church and an order in God&rsquo;s house, but no one can be the authority in the church in his natural man, in himself, and in his flesh. The church is not a worldly organization and cannot make decisions concerning responsibility and authority in the church based merely on doctrine. If we base our decisions merely on doctrine, the church will have many problems. The blueprint of the church is not in doctrine but in resurrection. We must see that Matthew 16 is the revelation and that Acts 2 is the execution.</p>
<p>The group of people who prayed in the upper room in Jerusalem was in resurrection. They left everything behind; they forsook everything. They were able to pray in one accord because they rejected themselves, put themselves aside, and allowed Christ through the Holy Spirit to have a prominent position in them. They may have forgotten about Matthew 16, but they expressed the condition described in Matthew 16. On the evening of the day of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, His Spirit entered into them, enabling them to pray in one accord for ten days. They lived in the Spirit of resurrection. Hence, on the day of Pentecost, God was able to produce the church through them and thus fulfill the word spoken in Matthew 16.</p>
<p>Even though the Protestant Church has a doctrinal understanding of Matthew 16 that is more proper than the Roman Catholic Church, both replace Christ with man. We need to understand that the blueprint of the church can be executed and fulfilled only in resurrection. Although we may know the principles of authority, we should not rely on doctrines and human arrangements; rather, we should live in resurrection. Every one of us should check, when we bear some authority, &ldquo;Am I acting in myself or in Christ? Am I acting according to my disposition or according to the Spirit of resurrection?&rdquo; If we do not live in the resurrected Christ and allow Christ to have the ground within us, the blueprint of the church will be altered among us.</p>
<p>In the local churches we have elders. According to the light of the truth, they are the authority in the church, and the brothers and sisters should submit to them (Acts 15:2; 1 Thes. 5:12-13; 1 Tim. 5:17; 1 Pet. 5:5). However, if the elders act like high government officials when the brothers and sisters visit them, it will give people an uneasy and uncomfortable feeling in their spirit. The elders may be right doctrinally, but their being is wrong. They may be right according to revelation but not according to life. This can be likened to having the design of the temple, which was revealed to David, but the building of the temple carried out by someone other than Solomon. The doctrine is in Matthew 16, but the reality is in Acts 2.</p>
<p>Sometimes the brothers and sisters submit themselves to the elders as if they were students submitting to a school principal. This makes people feel uneasy and uncomfortable. When the principal is not in sight, the students run around like mice, but when the principal comes, they freeze and dare not move, just as mice do when they see a cat. This is a strange phenomenon in the church, and it carries a flavor that is totally worldly. In terms of doctrine it cannot be considered wrong, but in terms of life it is absolutely wrong.</p>
<p>Every one of us should learn to reject ourselves and to live in the Spirit of resurrection. In the presence of the older brothers, we should live before God, and when they are absent, we should live before God in the same way. We should submit to the elders because of life, not because of regulation; we should submit to them in the Spirit of resurrection, not based on doctrine. As brothers and sisters in the church, we should submit to the elders, who are the authority in the church. If we do not submit, we are unlawful. This is according to doctrine. But if we simply act according to doctrine without living in the Spirit of resurrection, there is not much profit. The revelation seen by David was executed by Solomon. This means that the revelation of the church unveiled in the Scriptures can be carried out only by the resurrected Christ as the Spirit of resurrection.</p>
<p>If there is no Spirit of resurrection in the church, the church will certainly become deformed. The blueprint of the church altogether depends upon the Spirit of resurrection. The church is where the Spirit of resurrection is. Simply put, the blueprint of the church is the Spirit of resurrection. When we live in the Spirit of resurrection, the reality of Solomon&rsquo;s building of the temple is fulfilled within us; that is, the reality of David&rsquo;s design for the building of the temple is executed within us. All of the problems in the church are due to the fact that we have David&rsquo;s design without Solomon&rsquo;s execution. We have revelation and doctrine but not much expression of the Spirit of resurrection.</p>
<p>In some local churches the saints may argue among themselves, and their arguments may be scriptural. One group of brothers may say that they do certain things according to the principle of Antioch, and another group of brothers may say that they do certain things according to the principle of Jerusalem. The principle of Jerusalem is correct and so is the principle of Antioch. These two principles can be compared to the design that was revealed to David. The problem is not related to the design but to who carries out the design. Is this design carried out by man or by the Holy Spirit, by the flesh or by Christ? We should not merely hold on to doctrine. We must allow the Lord as the Spirit of resurrection within us to break us. We cannot take a doctrine merely as written instructions, nor can we merely take the basis of the Scripture as a safeguard. If our person and our life are not right, the doctrine concerning the line of Jerusalem will not be realized among us, even though the doctrine itself is correct. This means that the design cannot be carried out in us. From the types revealed in the Bible, we can see that the design revealed to David must be executed by Solomon. All the revelations in the Bible can be fulfilled only in the Spirit of resurrection. When we live in the Spirit of resurrection, we will not have contentions in serving the Lord and in the church; instead, we will have the spiritual reality.</p>
<p>In general, for the last twenty years there has not been much contention among the brothers. The underlying reason is that the brothers have received mercy to touch the resurrection life. This is not a matter of doctrine but of person. We may contend for a correct doctrine, but if our person is wrong, we are still wrong even though our doctrine is correct. If we were enlightened, we would see that it is not our doctrine that is wrong but our person. We would see that we still speak in ourselves and act in our flesh and that we have not been broken and do not act in our spirit. We allow ourselves to have the ground instead of giving the ground to Christ. In everything we do, we are the ones who are acting, not Christ. These words should become a lamp shining within us, causing our outward contentions for doctrine to completely collapse. If we have been broken, we will not be able to argue, even if we want to, and consequently, we will be able to see the execution of the blueprint for the church, in the expression of the true church.</p>
<p>If we are willing to submit to the authority of the Holy Spirit, as soon as we begin to argue, we will realize our self and our flesh and be willing to submit, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, I am about to argue, but my person is not right, so I will stop.&rdquo; This may seem unpleasant, but at this point the blueprint of the church will be shown in us. This is Solomon&rsquo;s execution of what was revealed to David, and this is what the Lord was referring to when He said, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). Through these experiences, Matthew 16 will be expressed in us to a great extent. However, if we insist on our own view regarding doctrines and take the Bible only as a basis for argument and debate, we will build upon ourselves and our contentions, not upon Christ, even if our doctrines are correct. This will make us comparable to the &ldquo;Peter&rdquo; of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>The real blueprint for building the church is fulfilled in resurrection. The blueprint for the temple was revealed to David and executed by Solomon. In the matter of building the church, no one can bring in his own opinion. Solomon built the temple according to David&rsquo;s design, which came from the Spirit of God. There was no room for human opinion. Those who serve in the church and have a part in building up the church must learn to put their opinions aside, to receive revelation in spirit, and to see the blueprint for the building from God.</p><h2 class="head4">The Consecration</h2>
<p>David prepared the materials for the building of the temple. In 1 Chronicles 29:3 and 5 David said, &ldquo;Furthermore, because I set my affection on the house of my God, and since I have a private treasure of gold and silver, I give it for the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for this holy house...Gold for the things of gold and the silver for the things of silver and for all the work by the hands of the craftsmen. And who will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to Jehovah?&rdquo; David prepared the materials, and this preparation became his offering. The materials that he prepared were offered mainly by him, but he charged the children of Israel also to give. The children of Israel were moved to give something to God. In these verses the thought related to consecration for the building of the church is not according to our usual understanding of consecration, which is to offer material things to God. This understanding is superficial. The deeper meaning of consecration is that in the building of the church there is a need for the consecration of the person. The building of the church does not merely require the material offerings but the consecration of our person.</p>
<p>For example, some responsible brothers may feel that meetings should be started in a certain locality. As a result, they discuss the matter and ask a brother to go and serve in the locality in order to meet the need. This brother may feel that since the responsible brothers have given him a commission, he should accept it; nevertheless, he may do so reluctantly. This kind of practice is not right. However, in today&rsquo;s organized Christianity, the situation is worse. A group of people first establishes a &ldquo;church&rdquo;; then they go to a seminary to find an outstanding student from among the graduates. If the seminary agrees, the student is sent to be the resident pastor after he graduates. This has absolutely nothing to do with consecration. Such a practice is not the way to build the church. The way to build the church is for every builder to be consecrated. If there is a need in a certain locality, some brothers and sisters should receive the burden according to what they see from the Lord, and they should give themselves to the Lord to meet the need. This kind of consecration is according to the principle for the building of the temple.</p>
<p>The principle for building the church is consecration. Without consecration, the building of the church will not be accomplished. Consecration does not refer only to offering material riches. Offering material riches occupies only a small part. The greater part of consecration for the building is offering ourselves to God. When David was preparing materials for the building of the temple, he declared to the children of Israel, &ldquo;Who will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to Jehovah?&rdquo; (v. 5). This indicates that God&rsquo;s desire was for everyone to consecrate himself and participate in the building of the temple. Once David made the proclamation, the children of Israel consecrated themselves (vv. 6-9). Hence, the building of the church is in resurrection and in consecration. If the consecration in a certain locality is strong, the building of the local church will be strong; if the consecration is solid, the building of the local church will be solid. On the contrary, if the consecration is weak, the building of the local church will be weak, and if the consecration is poor, the building of the local church will be poor.</p>
<p>Those who serve the Lord cannot use human methods in doing the Lord&rsquo;s work. We may see a capable person and desire to bring him to the church, or we may find a person who is good at contacting people and desire to make him a leading one, thinking that this will build up the church. But no matter what is built in this way, it will be blown away when the wind and the rain comes. The genuine building of the church does not occur by attracting and adding brothers or sisters with special talents; rather, it occurs when brothers and sisters have an absolute consecration according to their burden. Only when there is consecration is there building. Without consecration, there is no building. The building of the church depends upon consecration and not upon looking for people to attract and add to the church. Wherever we do a work and establish a local church, we should not attract people by our human hands; rather, we need to show them our lovely and glorious Lord and how much He deserves our service. He is worthy of our all. We should give our life to the Lord just as Mary poured the ointment on His head (Matt. 26:7). This is the building of the church.</p>
<p>Often we hear people say, &ldquo;This brother is very talented. If he stayed with us, he would be very useful. Regrettably, he has been taken away from us.&rdquo; At first, this may sound right, but in fact it is not correct. If such a talented one stayed among us, I am afraid that he would be useful only for creating disputes and dissensions. Birds of a feather flock together. A certain kind of person seeks others of his own kind. If we seek those who are talented, talented ones will spontaneously come in among us. However, if we have learned the matter of consecration, the true followers of the Lord will come into our midst.</p>
<p>In 1949 when I began the work in Taiwan, many Sunday churchgoers came into our midst to &ldquo;worship.&rdquo; At that time there were not many who came for the gospel; many came only to attend the &ldquo;worship.&rdquo; At a certain point, I had a feeling before the Lord that I needed to speak a strong word to them. Therefore, I said, &ldquo;In our service to the Lord, we have no intention of developing into something big, nor do we want to limit the work of the Holy Spirit. Anyone who comes here to meet with us must have a heart that seeks only the Lord. In the way of illustration, we do not serve steamed buns or dumplings; we serve only white rice. When you come here, you must know what you want to eat. If you want to eat dumplings, there are dumpling stores elsewhere. If you want to eat steamed buns, there are places offering steamed buns elsewhere. Here, we have only white rice. If you have come here for steamed buns or dumplings, you have come to the wrong place.&rdquo; The building of the church is not accomplished by attracting people in a natural way but by consecration. If we serve the Lord in various places but are unable to present the Lord&rsquo;s loveliness, glory, and honor in order to gain their hearts for Him so that they follow Him willingly, then our work is in vain.</p>
<p>The way to build the church is not to use schemes to contact, attract, and add people. Instead, we should shut our door and bow our knees, looking to the God who is on the throne. We should not merely be busy outwardly; instead, we should fellowship with God inwardly. We should show people the Lord&rsquo;s glory, loveliness, and honor. The Lord of glory and honor deserves our all. However, we do not need to exhort people to be fervent or compel people to love the Lord. If our service is the result of human exhortation, human contact, and human relationships, we are finished before the Lord. Everyone who serves with us must be one who has seen the Lord&rsquo;s glory, loveliness, and honor. He must be one who has knelt before the Lord and told Him, &ldquo;Lord, I pour out my heart, my blood, and my life on You. I place my all at Your feet.&rdquo; Only this kind of service is well pleasing to God. The way to build up the church is through consecration.</p>
<p>We definitely acknowledge that there is a need for fellowship in spiritual matters and that under the Lord&rsquo;s leading we should spend time to contact people to dispense grace into them. However, if our motive in contacting people is to attract and win them, we will offend the Lord and be condemned by Him. If a brother has problems, some may suggest that we ask a friend to visit him; likewise, when a sister has troubles, some may suggest that we ask a relative to visit her. These methods are not the way to build up the church. The way to build up the church is by consecration and by kneeling down to pray, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, manifest Your glory that men may sense that You are glorious.&rdquo; When we pray this kind of prayer, the Lord&rsquo;s glory will manifest itself from the Holy of Holies. As a result, men will sense that the Lord is glorious and thus be willing to give their all to Him.</p>
<p>The way to build up the church is not by using methods to attract and add people. The building of the church requires consecration. If some have joined us because of our exhortation and attracting methods, we must be particularly careful. We need to ask the Lord to have mercy on them that they would be willing to pour out their hearts on Him. Our work in all the localities must be to lead people to consecration. Only in this way will there be the genuine building of the church. For example, if the motive of our love feasts is to add people, the saints eventually will cool down, even though they initially came because of the love feasts. Those who are added in this way have not passed through consecration; consequently, they will not last. We must be careful and pay attention only to consecration. The way to build up the church is through consecration, not human methods.</p><h2 class="head4">Without Any Noise</h2>
<p>For the building of the temple, there was the need for a design and for consecration. Moreover, the work had to be done without any noise. Every piece of stone used for the building of the temple was, in principle, already cut and dealt with in the mountains (1 Kings 5:15-18; 6:7). At the time of the building, there was only the need for the pre-cut and shaped stones to be placed one on top of the other. There was no need for additional work with an ax or hammer. Thus, the sound of the hammer and ax were not heard, and the temple was built quietly.</p>
<p>A person must be dealt with by God in order to have his function manifested and to be built up in the church. Before someone can become an elder, he must be dealt with by God. Likewise, before someone can become a deacon, he must also be dealt with by God. A brother is not qualified to be an elder merely because he has attained a certain level of seniority, knowledge, capability, morality, and reputation. He may be a good stone, but his sharp edges may not have been dealt with by God. If this kind of person becomes an elder, the church will be filled with the noise of the hammer and ax. The secret for building the church is that it is accomplished without any noise. If a church is not noisy, it is strong and healthy.</p>
<p>If God has never dealt with a person, that person should not be an elder or a deacon. In principle, everyone who serves in the church must be a cut stone. If a newly saved believer or a brother from another Christian group comes into the church and begins to criticize recklessly, saying things that he should not say, the responsible brothers should not create any noise. If everyone remains silent after the contentious brother has spoken, his voice will surely disappear within a short time. However, if a person responds to what this brother has spoken, there will be more speaking and debate. In this way, the church will be weakened.</p>
<p>All those who have been dealt with by God are able to be silent and can bear people&rsquo;s rebukes and criticisms. If a person has not been adequately broken by the Lord and has not sufficiently learned some deep lessons, he will be inwardly provoked when he hears the rebukes or criticisms of others, and he will answer back or even quarrel with them. On the contrary, one who has truly learned the lesson would never argue with people. If he can receive help from others, he will seek the help; if he can render help to others and if they are willing to receive the help, he will try his best to teach them what he has learned according to the leading of the Spirit. However, if he notices that the other party only seeks to argue, oppose, and criticize, he will swallow his words and remain silent. This one has truly learned the lesson; that is, he has been cut by an ax and dealt with by a hammer in the mountains.</p>
<p>The building of the church should be without noise. In all the church service, we should hear only praising, thanksgiving, and singing. These are the proper sounds in the church. There is a saying, &ldquo;A single hand cannot clap.&rdquo; In any meeting, if a brother stretches out his hand and another brother also stretches out his hand can they clap. In the Lord&rsquo;s table meetings we have sometimes heard people fighting against one another by praying to nullify another one&rsquo;s prayer. This shows that the church has not been genuinely built up. A necessary condition for the building of the church is the absence of noise.</p>
<p>In the church, if we hear others&rsquo; criticism, judgment, and opposition, we should withdraw into the Holy of Holies, that is, turn to our spirit and be silent. When we are silent, others will also be silent, but when we are loud, others will be louder. The temple was not built with the sound of hammering and beating; it was built in quietness. This requires that we learn a serious lesson before the Lord.</p>
<p>In order to build the temple, to build the church, we must live in resurrection, live a consecrated life, and receive God&rsquo;s dealing. These three items are indispensable. Resurrection, consecration, and dealings are the way to build the church. Hence, we must all constantly live in resurrection, reject all that we are, live a consecrated life, and receive God&rsquo;s dealings. David was such a person. He gave all that he had for the temple and continually submitted himself under God&rsquo;s hand to receive God&rsquo;s dealing. May God have mercy on us that in both our service and church life, we would live in resurrection, receive God&rsquo;s dealings, and live a consecrated life. This is the way for the church to be built up.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(11)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TEMPLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">The Course of the Temple</h2>
<p>If a person wants to know the significance of the course of the temple, he must understand its origin. The temple was built by David and Solomon. David prepared the materials, and Solomon carried out the building work. The origin of the temple, however, did not begin with David and Solomon; its origin was much earlier.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Origin of the Temple</h2>
<p>To determine the origin of the temple, we must consider it according to the significance of the tabernacle. Even though the temple and the tabernacle are different, their central significance is the same. They both speak of God&rsquo;s desire to be inwardly joined with man in order to obtain a dwelling place on earth.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire in gaining man can be seen in Adam. Nevertheless, God was unable to accomplish His purpose through Adam and the Adamic race. Hence, God chose a group of people from among His creation. He chose Abraham and the race of Abraham. Since Adam, the created man, failed, God turned to Abraham, the called one. This resulted in a change of race. From that point onward, God&rsquo;s goal was no longer related to the Adamic race; it was transferred from the descendants of Adam to the descendants of Abraham. After the time of Babel, the goal of God&rsquo;s work was with the descendants of Abraham; it was no longer with the descendents of Adam.</p>
<p>The called race, the descendants of Abraham, appears at the end of Genesis 11, indicating that God wanted to obtain a dwelling place so that He could dwell with them. Nevertheless, it was difficult for God to obtain His dwelling with Abraham as an individual. However, in chapter 18 there is a miniature&mdash;God came to visit Abraham and entered into his tent. This tent can be considered a miniature of the tabernacle that the children of Israel later erected in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Abraham presented cakes of fine flour and a calf to God (vv. 6-8). This was a shadow of the meal offering and the sacrifices that the Israelites would later offer and indicates that God had a new beginning with man and a fresh opportunity to accomplish His purpose. God entered into man&rsquo;s tent to dwell with man, eat with man, and fellowship with man. Such a situation was not seen in regard to Adam or Noah and was not attained to even by Abel or Enoch. God came to eat and dwell with Abraham only after Abraham was circumcised (17:24; 18:1), indicating that Abraham had learned the lesson of being dealt with and had been delivered from his natural man with the old creation.</p>
<p>When God led the children of Israel to come out of Egypt, His intention was that His chosen people would live before Him and be a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:4-6). This means that God desired that they be completely separated from the world unto Himself and have direct fellowship with Him. God established the tabernacle so that He might dwell in their midst (25:8). Apparently, the tabernacle was God&rsquo;s dwelling but from the spiritual perspective, the children of Israel, who had been separated from the world, were the real dwelling place of God. The tabernacle was merely a symbol, a sign; the children of Israel were the reality.</p>
<p>When the condition of the Israelites was proper, the condition of the tabernacle was normal, but when the condition of the Israelites was improper, the condition of the tabernacle became abnormal. Hence, the condition of the tabernacle was determined by the condition of the children of Israel. The children of Israel were the real dwelling place of God. The Ark represented God, and the tabernacle represented the children of Israel. When the condition of the Israelites before God was proper, the Ark of God would remain within the tabernacle, but when their condition before God was improper, the Ark was separated from the tabernacle, indicating that God had left the children of Israel. Hence, when the Ark was taken captive, it was said, &ldquo;The glory has departed from Israel&rdquo; (1 Sam. 4:22). The Ark&rsquo;s being separated from the tabernacle was God&rsquo;s departure from the children of Israel. This demonstrates that the origin of the temple and the tabernacle was a group of people gained by God to be His dwelling place on earth. Without such a group of people, the dwelling place of God would not have an origin. Thus, the origin of the temple is man being gained by God.</p>
<p>The Old Testament shows that there are two obvious steps through which God gained man: the priesthood and the kingship. In the age of the priesthood, there was the tabernacle, not the temple. The temple did not come into existence until the age of the kingship. The priesthood represents fellowship with God, and the kingship represents the authority of God. This indicates that when man was gained by God and entered into fellowship with God, the tabernacle came into being. The temple, however, did not exist until God gained man to the extent that man was able to reign for God. Hence, the tabernacle and the temple are two aspects of one thing. They were God&rsquo;s dwelling place among his people in their wandering and in their settling down; one was movable, and the other was set. This indicates that in the age of the tabernacle, God had not yet gained man in a sufficiently deep and solid way. Man had only reached the stage of fellowshipping with God but not of allowing God to rule among man.</p>
<p>When David brought the Ark to Jerusalem, he praised and worshipped God. His praise and worship represent two things: the priesthood and the kingship (2 Sam. 6:12-15). At that time David was a king, but he was also girded with an ephod, indicating that he was a priest. According to the regulations in the Old Testament, priests came from the tribe of Levi, and kings came from the tribe of Judah; the two were not to be mixed (cf. 2 Chron. 26:16-19). If a king sought to serve God in the temple, it was a violation of the ordinances of the priesthood. However, when David brought the Ark to Jerusalem, he was a king girded with an ephod. On that day the king and the priest were one. This indicates that God had gained a man to the extent that the man not only fellowshipped with God but allowed God to reign among men. God&rsquo;s gaining of a man not only enabled God to have a dwelling place on earth, but it allowed Him to establish His throne in the midst of man. Hence, there are three matters related to the origin of the temple: man, fellowship, and authority.</p>
<p>Concerning man, we need to trace back to Adam; concerning fellowship, we need to trace back to Aaron; and concerning authority, we need to trace back to David. Hence, when we speak of the origin of the temple, we need the entire Old Testament. Reading from Adam all the way to Abraham, we discover that there were men on earth whom God was able to truly gain. When created man failed to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose, the chosen and called ones replaced them and filled the lack. Once God gained these called ones, they fellowshipped with Him and stood before Him wearing an ephod, allowing Him to speak, express His intention, and shine forth through them. This is the priesthood, the history of Aaron&rsquo;s descendants.</p>
<p>The priesthood of Aaron was man&rsquo;s obligation. When God created Adam, His original intention was that the entire Adamic race would be priests before Him. Because Adam lost his position, God called Abraham to fill the lack. When the sons of Abraham went out of Egypt and arrived at the foot of Mount Sinai, God told them that He wanted them to be a kingdom of priests and that every Israelite was a priest (Exo. 19:4-6). However, the sons of Abraham also failed, and the Levites came in to replace them. Abraham replaced Adam, and Aaron replaced Abraham. With Aaron, God gained a group of people who fellowshipped with God, stood before God, conversed with God, allowed God to express His intention, and afforded God the opportunity to carry out His will in the universe. This is the priesthood.</p>
<p>At the time of the tabernacle there was only the fellowship of the priests with God. There was not an authority, because the kingship had not yet come into being. After the priesthood failed, the ephod was transferred from the priests to Samuel. Samuel was not a priest; he was a Nazarite. A Nazarite was one who voluntarily consecrated himself. The principle of the Nazarite was that a man would cooperate with God and allow God to possess all that he had (Num. 6:1-21). Aaron was chosen and called, but a Nazarite was one who voluntarily consecrated himself. God&rsquo;s choosing and calling required man&rsquo;s cooperation, but when the chosen and called ones were not willing to cooperate with God, the voluntarily consecrated ones replaced them. Samuel, a Nazarite, replaced the priests at the time of Eli as a result of their degradation. The ephod was transferred to a Nazarite who was willing to cooperate with God. Samuel then brought in the authority, which is related to the throne of God.</p>
<p>After Samuel anointed David, the kingship was produced (1 Sam. 16:12-13). Then on the day that David brought the Ark to Jerusalem, the ephod was transferred to him (2 Sam. 6:12-15). Hence, on the day that he stood before the Ark, David possessed a threefold status: he represented man, fellowship, and authority. He was a man girded with an ephod, and at the same time, he was a king possessing authority. In other words, he was one who had been gained by God, who fellowshipped with God, and who ruled for God. In David we see man, the priesthood, and the kingship. The result of God gaining such a person was the producing of the temple. This is the origin of the temple. God is able to produce a solid dwelling place among man when there are men on earth fellowshipping with God and allowing God to rule.</p>
<p>Apparently, David and Solomon built the temple, but actually, the temple did not originate with them. Rather, it originated with man, fellowship, and authority. If no one was gained by God, if no one fellowshipped with God, and if no one allowed God to rule on earth, there would not have been a temple on the earth. This is the same in regard to the origin of the church. The church could not exist on the earth if no one was gained by God, fellowshipped with God, and allowed God to rule. These three factors are necessary for the origin of the church. Thus, whether a church can be established in a certain place depends upon whether God has gained some people in that place who fellowship with Him and allow Him to establish His throne. If these three factors are present, the church in that place will be solid. If even one factor is missing, the church cannot be established. The building of the temple depends upon God gaining a group of people who are girded with an ephod to fellowship with God and who rule for God. In this way, God is able to establish His throne among man and thus establish a dwelling place on earth in which His glory is expressed.</p>
<p>On the day that Solomon dedicated the temple to God, a glorious scene took place (1 Kings 8:10-11). On the day of Pentecost, a similar scene took place. On that day there were one hundred twenty people who were gained by God, in fellowship with God, and allowing God to rule; hence, the church was produced, and God was able to fill the one hundred twenty with His glory (Acts 2).</p>
<p>The church is neither a doctrine nor an organization; the church is a reality. The degree to which we are gained by God, the depth to which we fellowship with God, and the extent to which we allow God to rule determine the origin of the church. The reason that the disciples had such power on the day of Pentecost was that the upper room, in which they had prayed, was like an altar of consecration. In this upper room one hundred twenty people consecrated themselves to allow God to gain them, to fellowship with God, and to allow Him to rule in them; thus, they became the origin of the church. They became God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<p>We need to ask ourselves: When God touches us, are we willing to submit to Him, allow Him to rule in us, and allow Him to gain us? The outpouring of the Holy Spirit that occurred at Pentecost does not come through crying, praying, and fasting for several days. Rather, it comes if we are willing to be subdued by God when He touches us strongly and if we are willing to yield to Him in every matter that He has touched. This enables the Holy Spirit to be poured out upon us and to fill us. The building of the temple depends upon man being gained by God, fellowshipping with God, and being ruled by God. The origin of the temple required Adam, Aaron, and David. It was only through Adam, Aaron, and David that God&rsquo;s temple and tabernacle could come into being among men.</p><h2 class="head4">The Desolation of the Temple</h2>
<p>The peak in the history of the temple was the day that Solomon dedicated the temple to God. Not long afterward, the temple began to have problems. However, the temple itself, as a symbol, did not have problems; rather, the children of Israel, as the reality of the temple, had problems before God. There were three reasons for their problems. First, they did not allow God to rule among them; second, they did not fellowship with God but instead worshipped idols; and third, they went to Egypt to seek help. Initially, God gained them and set them apart from Egypt; nevertheless, they forsook God and returned to their former place of captivity. In addition, their priests worshipped idols and did not fellowship with God or allow God to rule in them. At this point, the reality of the temple was gone; hence, there was no need to keep the symbol. Thus, God allowed the Gentiles to come and completely destroy the temple (2 Chron. 36:17-19). Since there was no one whom God had gained, who fellowshipped with God, or who was ruled by God, there was no need for the temple to exist. This is the course of the temple.</p>
<p>The situation of the church is the same today. If there are some whom God is able gain, who are willing to learn to fellowship with God, and who are ruled by God, then on earth God will have the church. If the believers, instead of being gained by God, put the authority of God aside, pursue things other than God as the Israelite priests who worshipped idols, and go back to the world as the children of Israel did in going down to Egypt, the church will be desolated. What is the church? The church is a group of people on the earth whom God gains so that they might fellowship with Him and let Him reign. When these three factors are present, so is the church. If any of the three are missing, there may be a meeting hall but not the church.</p>
<p>We may wonder why God would spend so many years to build the temple through man and then send Gentile armies to destroy it shortly after it was built. This was not merely God&rsquo;s chastisement of the children of Israel; it reflects the deeper significance that God does not want anything empty and without reality. Since the reality of the temple was gone, the symbol could be demolished. Since the three factors related to the origin of the temple were absent, there was no need for the temple to exist on the earth. Hence, the temple was not only destroyed, but the vessels in the temple used for God&rsquo;s service were also carried away to Babylon and put in the house of the idols (Ezra 1:7). This captivity was worse than the desolation that occurred at the time of Eli.</p>
<p>In order to obtain His dwelling, God called the father of the Israelites to come out of Babel, that is, Babylon. However, the children of Israel were eventually taken captive and returned to the original place from which they had been called. God had no intention for the children of Israel to return to Babylon, but their heart was there. Even before they physically returned to Babylon, their inward condition indicated that they had already returned to Babylon. God never desires that His people think one way inwardly and behave another way outwardly. Therefore, God sent people to carry them away as captives to Babylon. Since they were in Babylon inwardly, God sent them there outwardly (2 Chron. 36:17-20).</p>
<p>Both Babylon and Egypt refer to the world. Babylon represents the world associated with idolatry, and Egypt represents the world associated with earning a livelihood. When the children of Israel went down to Egypt, it signified that they were returning to Babylon. Likewise, when the children of Israel were called out of Egypt, it was similar to Abraham being called out of Babylon. The children of Israel were called by God to be the sanctuary of God. Yet because they returned to Babylon in their inward condition, God caused them, together with the vessels in the temple, to be carried away to Babylon outwardly. Since they had their heart set on idols, God brought them to the land of idols. This typifies the course of the church.</p>
<p>The church was originally composed of people separated from the world, who had been gained by God, had fellowship with God, and were ruled by God. The Israelites&rsquo; going down to Egypt and their returning to Babylon typify that God allows the church to return to the world. The desolation of the church is typified by the devastation of the temple.</p><h2 class="head4">The Recovery of the Temple</h2>
<p>The recovery of the temple depends upon man fellowshipping with God and letting God reign. During the desolation of the temple, God gained a few among the captives. Among them, God gained Daniel and his three friends. God gained them in a situation of desolation. From the record in Daniel we see that even in a desolate situation, in which nearly everyone worshipped idols and God seemingly was not able to do anything, God still gained a few. Even though they were in Babylon, their hearts were turned toward Jerusalem, and even though they were in front of idols, their hearts were turned toward God.</p>
<p>Daniel and his three friends show that even in desolation God was still able to gain some. Their being gained by God had much to do with the later recovery of the temple. Even though they were physically in Babylon and saw the idols, their hearts were contacting God. Instead of standing on the devil&rsquo;s side, they stood on God&rsquo;s side and were gained by God (Dan. 1:8; 3:16-18, 23-28; 6:10, 16-23; 9:20). Because God gained them, they lived before God and prayed. Thus, they ushered in the fellowship represented by Ezra the priest. The temple was recovered shortly after Ezra the priest returned to Jerusalem (Ezra 7).</p>
<p>While Ezra was recovering the temple, he focused on the recovery of God&rsquo;s word. To fellowship with God is to let God speak. Ezra was more skilled in the law than perhaps even Moses. Through Ezra&rsquo;s recovery of God&rsquo;s word, fellowship with God was also recovered (vv. 6, 10; Neh. 8:8-12). If, however, there was only the temple without the city, the temple would have been left unprotected. Hence, God gained Nehemiah, the governor of Judah. At that time there was no king in Judah; however, Nehemiah reigned for God. He returned from captivity to restore the city. Once the city was restored, the temple was protected and secured.</p>
<p>The recovery of the temple depends upon man being gained by God, fellowshipping with God, and being ruled by God. The principle behind both the destruction of the temple and the recovery of the temple is based upon the origin of the temple. The key is man being gained by God, fellowshipping with God, and being ruled by God. At the time of the Reformation, God gained Martin Luther, just as He had gained Daniel and his three friends, ones who clearly lived before God. The Reformation also recovered man&rsquo;s fellowship with God, as signified by the priesthood. At that time, however, although the temple was restored, the city was not yet recovered, because there was not much of God&rsquo;s ruling. This is similar to the superficial recovery of Protestantism, a recovery that is still unstable.</p>
<p>In the epistle to the church in Sardis in Revelation 3, the Lord charged her to establish the things that remained and were about to die (v. 2), indicating that the recovery in Protestantism is weak and unstable. It is weak and unstable because it does not have much of God&rsquo;s reigning. God has gained some in Protestantism, and they have fellowship with God; nevertheless, they do not allow God&rsquo;s authority to be realized among them. The things that they have recovered will not be secured until there are some who see God&rsquo;s authority and let God reign. This principle is also true in regard to our individual spiritual condition, as well as that of the church. The church, God&rsquo;s dwelling place, comes into being when man is gained by God, fellowships with God, and allows God to reign.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Conclusion of the Types</h2>
<p>All the types involving the seven women and the house are related. The position of the children of Israel before God was not only that of a woman but also a house. In the Old Testament, God designated the children of Israel according to two aspects: a woman and a house. As a woman, the children of Israel were God&rsquo;s counterpart; as a house, they were God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Thus, the emphases in the ten types are first on the counterpart and then on the dwelling place.</p>
<p>This is seen even more clearly in the New Testament. Ephesians 5:31-32 indicates that the church is God&rsquo;s counterpart, and 2:21-22 says that the church is the dwelling place of God. Revelation presents the full manifestation of this picture. The New Jerusalem is a city, and this city is the wife of the Lamb, Christ&rsquo;s counterpart. This city as God&rsquo;s dwelling place is the tabernacle of God with men. Being a woman is a matter of life and position, and being a house, or a dwelling place, is a matter of function. The seven women, as types of the church, emphasize the aspect of life and position; the tabernacle and the temple, as types of the church, emphasize the aspect of function. Both aspects are for the purpose that God would obtain a dwelling place on earth, express Himself and His glory, and exercise His authority.</p>
<p>The function of the church is based upon her life and position. Her life issues from God, and her position is that of being joined to God as one and being part of God under His authority as the Head. Since the church has God&rsquo;s life and the position of belonging to God, it has functions with respect to God. The church is joined to God and allows God to dwell within it and be expressed through it so that God&rsquo;s will can be carried out. This is the church.</p>
<p>Of the seven women as types of the church, Eve typifies the church being produced as well as the nature of the church, Rebekah typifies the church being chosen from the world, Asenath typifies the church being obtained by God in the world, Zipporah typifies the church in the wilderness, Ruth typifies the church being redeemed, Abigail typifies the warring church in the midst of sufferings, and the Shulammite typifies the church experiencing the resurrected Christ and enjoying rest with Christ in a condition of resurrection and glory. The significances of the types of the seven women, the children of Israel, the tabernacle, and the temple present a clear understanding of the church, showing where the church comes from, how the church is produced, the nature of the church, and the course of the church, including its origin and destination.</p>
<p>In the history of the children of Israel we can see many aspects related to the types of the seven women. For example, Rebekah was from a far country, and the children of Israel also came from a far country; Zipporah was in the wilderness, and the children of Israel were also in the wilderness; Ruth was redeemed, and the children of Israel were also redeemed; Abigail engaged in warfare, and the children of Israel also engaged in warfare. Hence, the children of Israel connect the types of the women and the dwelling places. The children of Israel were a woman on one hand and a city on the other; they were both a counterpart and a dwelling place. The children of Israel as a type connect the two categories of Old Testament types concerning the church: a woman and a dwelling place. The types in the Old Testament enable us to have a clear understanding of God&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<p>The church is both God&rsquo;s counterpart and His dwelling place. The church is joined to God and is the place of God&rsquo;s dwelling. Likewise, the church comes out of God and is for God. The consummation of the church will be the New Jerusalem as a woman to be God&rsquo;s counterpart and as a city to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p></body></html>
