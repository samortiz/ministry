   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 With the Church as the Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With the church as the Body, God is expressed and Satan is dealt with Eph 1:23; 3:19b; 6:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whenever and wherever God is expressed and His enemy dealt with, there is the foretaste of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is also true in our home life, marriage life, and personal life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you buy something that will not help you to express God and to deal with Satan, you will lose the foretaste of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you express God and deal with His enemy in whatever you do and wherever you go, you will have a sweet foretaste of the coming rest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the church life don't argue and don't murmur.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One night I received a phone call, telling me that a certain church was in poor condition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Two people were on the phone, the one confirming what the other said about the poor and sick condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They stopped their talking and wanted to hear what I would say.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Immediately I said, "Don't talk this way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From now on forget about your talk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you say that the church is bad, the church certainly will be bad because you are bad.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you say the church is wonderful, the church will certainly be wonderful because you are wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church is you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you say that the church is bad, you are condemning yourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I further told the brothers that they must be aware of the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They said, "What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To whom shall we go?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I said, "Don't go to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Don't talk!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just go to the church meetings and praise the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They asked, "Shouldn't we pray?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I replied, "Yes, you should pray, but don't pray negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Pray positively.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church has no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church doesn't need you to pray, 'O Lord, there is a problem.'</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You are the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more you pray about the problem, the more you become the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Don't cause a problem and there won't be any problem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Go to the church meeting, praise the Lord, and pray positively."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all must see through the wiles of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From now on don't talk about the condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just go to the church meeting and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So, we have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever you talk about the condition of the church, you will lose your rest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You will never have the foretaste of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you go to the church meeting and praise the Lord, you will immediately be in the foretaste of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>e The Fulfillment of Rest the Rest of the Millennium</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fulfillment of rest is the rest of the millennium, the thousand-year kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to Hebrews, there is a rest promised for God's people, and we all must labor to enter into that rest Heb 4:1, 3, 9, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do not endeavor to enter into that rest, we will miss it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The way to enter into that rest is to experience the foretaste today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we have the foretaste, we will certainly enter into the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we don't have the foretaste of that rest today, we will miss the full taste to come.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>During the rest of the millennium, the saints will be fully like Christ, expressing God's glory 1 John 3:2; Col 3:4; 1 Thes 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The saints will reign with Christ Rev 20:6 .</S>
