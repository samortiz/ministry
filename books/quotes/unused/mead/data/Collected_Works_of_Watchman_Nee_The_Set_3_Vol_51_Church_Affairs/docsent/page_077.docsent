   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Needing to Bring Mark</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 11 continues, "Take Mark and bring him with you.''</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the Mark about whom Paul and Barnabas contended.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Remember that in Acts Barnabas wanted to take Mark with them, but Paul disagreed because Mark went away when the work was at a crucial time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the beginning they went together; but when the work was intense, Mark left, Mark got sick, and Mark was not able to work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, Paul did not agree to take Mark with them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time Barnabas wanted to take Mark with them, perhaps because Mark was his relative.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the two had a sharp contention, and they went their separate ways.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The amazing thing is that later Barnabas did not have the opportunity to work with Paul, but Mark had such an opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Remember that Mark later had learned many lessons from Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Gospel of Mark was dictated by Peter and written down by Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Shortly before Paul's death, Paul said, "Take Mark and bring him with you.''</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For what reason?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"For he is useful to me for the ministry.''</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Mark was profitable to Paul for the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 12 says, "But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.''</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This shows us that this was the arrangement of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul asked Timothy to come, he asked Timothy to bring Mark with him, and he also sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 20 says, "Erastus remained in Corinth.''</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do you see?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul was the one who knew the condition of the work the best.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Leaving Trophimus at Miletus</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Erastus remained in Corinth, and Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.''</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Trophimus is one of the famous sick persons in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Epaphroditus was one, and Trophimus was another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.''</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times sick persons need to obey; they cannot say that they want to move around.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they are sick, they must stop for a little while.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul said that he left Trophimus at Miletus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was better for him to be left at Miletus and not be occupied with so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Concerning Timothy, Paul said "Be diligent to come before winter.''</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul gave him a definite time limit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not decide for yourself when to come.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Be diligent to come before winter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brothers, we should see that this way is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A brother like Paul, who walked before God, should be obeyed by Mark, Timothy, and Trophimus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If so, spontaneously, we will see that there is fellowship in the church, and spontaneously we will also be able to understand what authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Titus Being Left in Crete</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>and Being Diligent to Go to Nicopolis</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Concerning Titus we do not need to say much.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A few verses from the first and the last chapters of Titus are sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Titus 1:5 says, "For this cause I left you in Crete, that you might set in order the things which I have begun that remain and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you.''</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are we clear?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Titus was a young brother.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 2 Corinthians Paul indicated that he had entreated him to go to Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They went to Crete together.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then Paul left Titus in Crete to complete the unfinished business.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul told him how to set in order the things that were lacking, as he charged him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here we can see authority and also fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Titus 3:12 says, "When I send Artemas to you or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.''</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do you see?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the way of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul said, "I want to send one of two brothers to you, maybe Artemas or Tychicus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It has not been fully decided; in any case, one will come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When he gets there, you need to come to me quickly in Nicopolis.''</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here we see how an elderly brother arranged many things and how a young brother listened to his word.</S>
