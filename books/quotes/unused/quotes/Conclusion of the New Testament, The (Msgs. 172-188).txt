We may teach these matters without touching the source of the strength, energy, and capability to carry them out
According to God's design and arrangement, all these things, matters, and persons are used by God for our good
No doubt, growth comes from inward nourishment, but this nourishment needs the coordination of the outward environment
There is the need of God's sovereignty to arrange our environment so that all things may work together for our good according to His purpose
God's purpose is His plan, and His plan is that we be conformed to the image of His Son that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers
We have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of God's Son that He may be the Firstborn among many brothers
Whether or not the things, matters, and persons in our environment are good for us depends on whether or not we love God
Because He loves us and because we are His beloved, sooner or later we all shall be sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified
Righteousness is the way of God, holiness is the nature of God, glory is the expression of God, and love is the heart of God
After speaking in the book of Romans of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory, Paul brings us into God's heart of love
Like Paul, we may be persuaded that nothing can separate us from the love of God, for this love does not derive from us nor depend on us
Paul included this phrase because he knew that there would be a problem if the love of God had been shown apart from Christ Jesus
Because the love of God is in Christ Jesus, everything is insured, and we are assured that nothing can separate us from it
Romans 836 and 37 say As it is written For Your sake we are being put to death all day long we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter
Paul expected that in nothing he would be put to shame, that is, that in nothing he would be defeated by his circumstances or environment
He was a living witness of Christ, testifying of His ability, power, patience, love, and wisdom, all without measure
As believers, we should be a magnifying glass in relation to Christ so that others may see Christ magnified through us
As we experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God, nothing can put us to shame, but Christ is magnified in us
Matthew 5:10 says, 'Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
Matthew 5:10 says that those who are persecuted for righteousness are blessed, 'for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
If we stay in righteousness, we are in the kingdom because the kingdom is absolutely a matter of righteousness
Peter 4:14 says, 'If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you'
In the name of Christ' is actually in the person of Christ, in Christ Himself, because the name denotes the person
The believers, having believed into Christ and having been baptized into His name , that is, into Himself , are in Christ and one with Him
When they are reproached in His name, they are reproached with Him, sharing His sufferings in the fellowship of His sufferings
We should rejoice when we are reproached in the name of Christ, because the Spirit of glory is resting upon us
They went from the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be dishonored on behalf of the Name'
It is a real honor to be dishonored on behalf of the Name, the very name of the man-dishonored but God-honored Jesus
The Greek word rendered 'boast' also has the meaning of exult and glory; thus, we may boast, exult, glory, in tribulations
Because our natural being needs to be sanctified, transformed, and conformed, God brings in certain tribulations and sufferings for our good
If we read Romans 5 carefully, we shall see that tribulation does not stand on the same level as grace, for it is under grace
Peter 2:19 and 20 say, 'This is grace, if anyone because of conscience toward God bears sorrows, suffering unjustly
We have been called to unjust suffering so that in it we may have the enjoyment of God as grace and express Him
If we are established in the faith, afflictions will do good to us according to God's purpose in His appointment
In affliction the believers by experiencing the dispensing of the processed Triune God enjoy the peace of Christ who has overcome the world
He arranges everything sovereignly so that we may suffer in order to be perfected in this age and glorified in the coming age
In all these divine acts the bountiful supply of the divine life is ministered to us as grace in varied experiences
The God of such grace will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground the persecuted believers after they suffer a little while
The suffering believers should be encouraged by the fact that, although they are suffering, their God is the God of all grace
After we have suffered a little while, the God of all grace will personally perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us
Perhaps after you believed in the Lord Jesus you thought that in the Christian life there would be no sufferings or trials
You may have had the concept that, as a child of God, the Father would not allow anything bad to happen to you
The various trials through which we must pass as believers serve the purpose of trying, testing, and proving us
Many believers can testify that through trials God has perfected them in a practical way in their Christian life
In 2 Corinthians 4:8 Paul says, 'We are afflicted in every way, but not straitened; perplexed, but not despairing'
The word translated 'despairing' literally means 'utterly unable to find a way out'; that is, the way is entirely shut up
Paul is saying that they were perplexed, unable to find a way out, yet not despairing, not utterly unable to find a way out
The life in verse 10 is the resurrection life, which the Lord Jesus lived and expressed through the working of the cross
In 2 Corinthians 4:16 Paul says, 'If indeed our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day'
By experiencing the dispensing of the processed Triune God, the believers can accept with joy the plundering of their possessions
According to the facts of the Lord's life on earth, His name, Jesus, denotes a suffering person, a man of sorrows
When we say that we are in Christ this means that we are saved are enjoying Gods blessing have peace with God and are under Gods blessing
The Greek word for fiery trial, purosei, means burning, signifying the burning of a smelting furnace for the purification of gold and silver
We may face fiery ordeals, but these are the sufferings of Christ in which we have the privilege to participate
Peter 4:16 says that if a believer suffers 'as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name'
It glorifies God because when we suffer in the name of Christ and as Christians the Spirit of God who is the Spirit of glory rests upon us
The ending -ianos, denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire
We need to realize that even in such matters as being bothered by our husband or wife or becoming ill there is an amount of God's judgment
God judges us because we are wrong in certain things, not pure in our motives, or not righteous in dealing with others
Often when believers suffer they ask why their situation is so poor when that of unbelievers is often prosperous
God judges His own children, His own house, His family, that His children may not suffer the same end as the ungodly
In 4:17 Peter asks what will be the end of those who disobey the gospel of God if God's judgment first begins from us
In 4:18 Peter goes on to say, 'And if the righteous is saved with difficulty, where will the ungodly and sinner appear'?
If God's children, the members of His own household, are saved with difficulty, surely the unbelievers will not escape God's judgment
Literally 'commit' in 1 Peter 4:19 means to give in charge as a deposit, as in Luke 12:48; Acts 20:32; 1 Timothy 1:18; and 2 Timothy 2:2
The Creator in 1 Peter 4:19 does not refer to the Creator of the new creation in the new birth but to the Creator of the old creation
We see that the condition for being heirs of God and joint heirs of Christ is that we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him
The more suffering we pass through, the more our glory will be intensified, for suffering increases the intensity of glory
In 1 Corinthians 15:41 Paul says that 'star differs from star in glory,' indicating that some stars shine more brightly than others
The believers, by the experience of the divine dispensing, shall reign in the coming age with Christ through endurance in this age
Behold, the Devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation ten days
It also signifies that these overcomers have attained to 'the out-resurrection from among the dead' , that is, the outstanding resurrection
Under God's sovereign arrangement, many trials, troubles, tribulations, and sufferings have been assigned to us
In this message we shall see that the believers experience this divine dispensing also in having the best attitude toward others
There is the need for us to know what kind of attitude we should hold toward others, that is, toward unbelievers
Subjection to authority requires transformation from the growth in life through the experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God
We need to recognize that the authorities are from God, appointed by God, as servants of God to the believers for their good
If you do evil, fear; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who practices evil'
In order to maintain a peaceful situation there is the need of government with authority to rule over the people
He who resists the authority opposes what God has appointed, and those who oppose will receive to themselves judgment
In verse 5 Paul says, 'It is necessary to be subject, not only because of wrath, but also because of conscience'
Because of conscience, we need to learn, by being transformed through the divine dispensing, to be subject to authorities
In being subject to the government, the believers should pay taxes and revenues to the authorities as God's officers
In 13:6 Paul explains, 'Because of this you also pay taxes; for they are God's officers, attending constantly to this very thing'
Verse 1 says, 'Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work'
Before Paul could teach the saints to respect the government, he himself had to experience a certain amount of transformation
When he was Saul of Tarsus, he was a patriotic Jew and wanted to be free from the yoke of the Roman imperialists
In Titus 3:1 he instructs the saints to subject themselves to rulers and authorities, being ready unto every good work
Paul recognized that even those officials appointed by Caesar were rulers appointed by God, His deputy authority
We need to be transformed through the divine dispensing in order to be subject to rulers and to be ready unto every good work
According to the context, 'every human institution' includes 'a king as supreme' and also 'governors as sent by him'
In Matthew 5:43 and 44a the Lord Jesus says, 'You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy
You hate your enemy because he does not agree with your natural choice, and you love your good neighbor because he suits your natural choice
The reason we find it difficult to love our enemies is that they are against our being and our natural feeling
As Spirit is the nature of God's person and light is the nature of God's expression, so love is the nature of God's being
When he was being stoned, even unto death, he knelt down and cried with a loud voice, 'Lord, do not hold this sin against them'!
We have been called to bless others, so we, as a blessed people, should always bless others that we might inherit blessing
Peter's word corresponds to what the Lord Jesus says in Matthew 5:44 and to what Paul says in Romans 12:14 and 1 Corinthians 4:12
In order to bless our persecutors and not curse them, we need to be saturated with the processed Triune God through His dispensing
Sometimes it is not possible to live in peace with all men because the other parties are not willing to have a life of peace
After we have been saved, our standard of morality should be far higher than that of the requirements of the law
If man had taken God into him as life, then the divine attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness would have come into man
God's intention in His New Testament economy is that all the believers in Christ become a reproduction of Christ, the God-man
Ephesians 2:10 says, 'We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God before prepared that we should walk in them'
The Greek word poiema means something which has been made, a handiwork, or something which has been written or composed as a poem
Poetry does not consist only of poetic writings; any work of art that expresses the maker's wisdom and design may be considered a poem
We, the church, the masterpiece of God's work, are the highest poetry, expressing God's infinite wisdom and divine design
As the masterpiece of God's work, we are an absolutely new item in the universe, something newly originated by God
According to Ephesians 2:4-10, we have been saved by grace to be God's masterpiece that we may walk in the good works prepared before by God
We, the believers in Christ, have been created in Christ for good works and redeemed by Christ to be His people, zealous of good works
Now we need to see that, in order to have the highest standard of morality and virtues, we need to be regulated by four governing principles
The Greek word rendered 'lawful' here literally means 'under my power of choice to do'; hence, permissible, allowable, lawful
Paul's thought may be that all things are lawful but not all things help us to remain in the central lane of God's economy
All things are lawful, but not all things help us in bearing the cross or are profitable in experiencing Christ
You may be free to do certain things, but those things will not help you in the church life, and they will not strengthen your prayer life
When we consider whether or not to do a certain thing, we should ask if we are under the power or control of that thing
In 1 Corinthians 6:12 and 10:23 and 31 we have four basic principles for regulating the conduct of the New Testament believers
Because it is difficult for us to be released from our habits, we need the Triune God, and we need His dispensing
Through the experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God the believers have the highest standard of morality and virtues
The surpassing righteousness is the condition of entering into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium
The law of the old dispensation deals with the act of murder, but the new law of the kingdom deals with anger, the motive of murder
We should have no confidence in our natural life but enjoy Christ's overcoming life through the divine dispensing
In order to live up to a moral standard higher than that of the old law, we must overcome our temper and our lust
We shall experience and enjoy the divine life, a life that can fulfill the highest standard and that overcomes our anger and lust
Romans 8:4 tells us that when we walk according to the spirit, we spontaneously fulfill all the righteous requirements of the law
We do not need to keep the law in the sense of striving in ourselves, but we must walk according to the spirit
In Matthew 5:31-32 this law regarding divorce is changed, and the matter of marriage is recovered to God's intention at the beginning
The Lord's word in verse 37 indicates strongly that the evil one seeks an opportunity to express himself through our excessive talking
In verses 40 and 41 the Lord goes on to say, 'To him who would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak also
Through the divine dispensing we, the believers in Christ, must be above our temper, not resisting an evil one
The title 'sons of your Father' is a strong proof that the Lord's word here is addressed to regenerated believers of the New Testament
If we intend to live in the kingdom, we need to practice the high standard of morality and virtue revealed by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 5
The demand of the new law of the kingdom is much higher than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation
The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the life of the Father is the highest supply to meet that demand
When we have been exposed and subdued, we shall give the full opportunity to the divine life to live within us
Because we are the Father's children possessing His life and nature, there is no need for us to imitate Him or copy Him
As believers in Christ, we are not only God's creatures; we are also His regenerated children, possessing His life and nature
We are not God's creatures trying to copy and imitate Him; we are the Father's children living the Father's life
We became children of God when the Spirit of God came into our spirit to regenerate us and to make our spirit the habitation of God
The Father has begotten us, He has imparted His life into us, and He has given us His nature for our enjoyment
The divine life brings us into His fellowship, and in this fellowship we enjoy the Father in His life and nature
The way to be perfect is to remain in the divine fellowship to receive and enjoy continually the dispensing of the processed Triune God
In 1 Thessalonians 5:20 and 21 Paul says, 'Do not despise prophecies; but prove all things; hold fast what is good'
The fact that the believers have the highest standard of morality and virtues is seen in their enduring suffering for doing good
Since Paul himself lived Christ, he certainly would not charge the believers to live something instead of Christ
Based on the whole context of the book of Philippians, we can say that the six virtues in 4:8 are the expression of the living of Christ
The principle is the same with praise: there is something worthy of praise in all these six aspects of the Christian life
Matthew 26:41 says, 'Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is ready, but the flesh is weak'
In Revelation 3:10 the Lord promises the recovered church, the church in Philadelphia that He will keep her out of the hour of trial
He will keep her not only out of the trial but also out of the hour of trial, because she has kept the word of the Lord's endurance
If we pray in a particular way and are watchful, we shall prevail to escape all the things that are about to take place
The believers need to watch and pray not only to escape from the great tribulation but also 'to stand before the Son of Man'
It indicates that the raptured overcomers will stand before the Savior on Mount Zion in the heavens before the great tribulation
Whether or not we shall be raptured before the great tribulation and be taken away to meet Christ on the throne does not depend on Him
We need to pray that we may have the strength and ability to escape the things that will take place on earth and stand before the Son of Man
The householder refers to the believer and the house to the believer's conduct and work which he has built up in his Christian life
Therefore,' as the Lord says in verse 44, 'you also, be ready, for the Son of Man comes in an hour that you think not'
If we read Matthew 25:13 in its context, we shall see that to be watchful is to be filled with the Holy Spirit
Every day our lamp is burning, and every day our soul, our being, is filled with the extra portion of the Holy Spirit
It is a serious mistake for any believer to think that he can know the exact day and hour of the Lord's coming
In the air, to which the rest of the believers will be raptured, the Lord will set up His judgment seat to judge the believers
Although the Bible speaks clearly of these things, it does not tell us the day and the hour of the Lord's coming
The issue of this experience and enjoyment of the divine Trinity is that the believers become, as the bride, one with the Spirit
The Spirit is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God and the bride is the ultimate expression of the transformed tripartite man
By the time of Revelation 2217 the processed Triune Godthe Spiritand the transformed tripartite manthe bridewill be one and speak as one
The Spirit is the Triune God after He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
The Spirit as the consummation, even the ultimate consummation, of the processed Triune God has been and is being dispensed into us
Eventually, this Spirit becomes one with the bride, the aggregate of all the regenerated and transformed tripartite men
The processed tripartite man will match the processed Triune God forever for His full expression and satisfaction
In the Old Testament God told His redeemed people Israel that He was their Husband and that they were His wife
When the Lord Jesus came, John the Baptist told his disciples that Christ was the Bridegroom coming to take the bride, which is the church
Finally, the New Jerusalem will be the consummation of God's counterpart, the aggregate of all His redeemed and perfected people
For eternity this universal couple will be the full manifestation of the Triune God expressed in all His glory
The Spirit and the bride express the desire for the Lord's coming as revealed by Him in Revelation 22:7 and 12
In chapters two and three of Revelation the Spirit is the speaker, and the churches are the receivers of the speaking of the Spirit
The Spirit and the bride call the thirsty ones to come and drink the water of life-the flow of the processed and dispensing Triune God
When we have a sincere desire for the Lord's desire, we also have an earnest expectation for the sinner's salvation
Revelation 22:17 strongly implies that if we have a desire for the Lord's coming back, we shall be very concerned for others' salvation
As you are saying, 'Come, Lord Jesus,' a burden may rise up within you for your family, neighbors, friends, and colleagues
Philippians 3:20 says, 'Our citizenship is in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ'
We have seen that the believers' present comprises both the initial stage and the progressing stage of God's full salvation
The first aspect of the believers' future is their future in the completing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of glorification
Many believers have experienced a good deal of transformation and are heading toward the goal of glorification
The glorification of the believers, they claim, will take place instantaneously at the coming of the Lord Jesus
As the divine life grows in us, it saturates us with the divine element, and this element changes us metabolically
Glorification is the issue of transformation, and transformation is accomplished by the gradual and continuous growth in life
Since glorification will take place in the future, we may wonder why Paul in Romans 8:30 uses the past tense and says 'glorified'
For God to glorify us means that the glory which has been sown into us saturates our whole being and is expressed through us
When our entire being has been permeated and saturated with the element of glory, that glory will come out of us
As the blossom of a carnation flower is in the carnation seed, so our glorification is in Christ as the seed of glory dwelling in us
The Christ who is God's expression, the effulgence of God's glory , is the One who has come into us to be our hope of glory
In the future the believers will enjoy their eternal destiny-glorification-as the goal of God's full salvation
In 2 Thessalonians 2:14b Paul tells us that God has called us through the gospel 'unto the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ'
The glory of the Lord is that He is the Son of God the Father, possessing the Father's life and nature to express Him
The glory which the Father has given the Son is the sonship with the Father's life and divine nature to express the Father in His fullness
The glory of the Lord Jesus is that the Father has given Him the Father's life and nature for Him to express the Father
God has called us unto the obtaining of this glory, the glory of the divine life and the divine nature to express the divine Being
Even though the creation will not share the glory, the creation will enter into the freedom of the glory of the children of God
Romans 8:19 through 21a say, 'The anxious watching of the creation eagerly expects the revelation of the sons of God
The creation will be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God
We, the believers in Christ, shall be glorified, but the creation will only share in the freedom of that glory, not in the glory itself
We shall be glorified in the divine life and the divine nature to bear the glory of the Triune God for His expression
No matter how mature we may become in the divine life, as long as we have not been glorified, we have not been redeemed in our body
Corinthians 1:30 tells us that Christ has become 'wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
He is sanctification by which we are being sanctified in our soul that is transformed in our mind emotion and will with the divine life
The firstfruit of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the firstfruit of the coming harvest of what God is to us
The issue of the enjoyment of the Spirit as the foretaste is the redemption of our body, which is the full sonship
The sonship in 8:23 is the full sonship, the consummation of the sonship, not the initiation of the sonship as in Galatians 4:5
The redemption of the believers body is for Gods purchased possession to be redeemed with the Holy Spirit as the pledge of our inheritance
Ephesians 1:14 says that the Holy Spirit 'is the pledge of our inheritance, unto the redemption of the acquired possession'
Redemption here refers to the redemption of our body, that is, the transfiguration of our body of humiliation into a glorious one
In God's New Testament economy, the processed Triune God becomes our inheritance, and we become God's possession
The divine dispensing of the divine Trinity is the enjoyment in a practical way of God Himself as our inheritance
As we enjoy the processed Triune God as our inheritance, His element comes into our being and transforms us to make us His inheritance
Through our enjoyment of Him we are infused and saturated with His element and transformed to become His inheritance for His enjoyment
The Holy Spirit within us is not only a foretaste but also a pledge guaranteeing that God is ours and that we shall be His
The crucial matter in Ephesians 1:14 is that the Spirit is pledged into us as a guarantee that God will be our inheritance in full
God pledges Himself as the Spirit within us for our enjoyment, guaranteeing that we shall eventually have the full taste of the Triune God
The result of this dispensing is that we become God's inheritance, His purchased possession, for His enjoyment
The word 'unto' indicates that we are sealed with the Holy Spirit resulting in, or issuing in, the redemption of our body
The seal was put in us when we believed in the Lord Jesus, but the sealing has been going on from that time until now
Many of us can testify from experience that when we believed in the Lord Jesus, we realized that we had been sealed in our spirit
Because the Spirit came into our spirit and sealed us at the time of our regeneration, the Bible says that we were sealed
Philippians 3:21a says that Christ 'will transfigure the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory'
Christ's body of glory is His resurrected body, saturated with God's glory and transcendent over corruption and death
In the way of His full salvation, God first regenerates us in our spirit that we may have Him within us as our life
Though our body may be quickened by the Spirit who dwells in us , yet it is a mortal body, subject to death and needing to be redeemed
No matter how much our body may be quickened and even saturated by the Spirit, it still requires the Lord's full redemption
For the believers to be redeemed in their body is also to have death in their entire being swallowed up by the resurrection life in victory
The time is coming when the last enemy, death, will not only be destroyed but also swallowed up by resurrection life
In between is the process of the metabolic transformation of our fallen soul by the life-giving Spirit, who is the reality of resurrection
When death in our entire being is swallowed up by Christ's resurrection life, the corruptible will put on incorruption
Life is the divine element, even God Himself, imparted into our spirit; incorruption is the consequence of life saturating our body
The apostles groaned in the desire not to be unclothed disembodied that is not to die but to be clothed upon to put on the spiritual body
To have our mortal body 'swallowed up by life' is to have it transfigured by resurrection life swallowing up the death in our mortal body
Under the weight of this burden we groan not that we would be unclothed or found naked but that we would be clothed with a transfigured body
When we are transfigured and clothed with the heavenly, spiritual, and resurrected body, then what is mortal will be swallowed up by life
Although the rapture is emphasized strongly in the New Testament, it is somewhat difficult for us to understand
The second school, the school of post-tribulation, says that the rapture will take place at the end of the great tribulation
Those in the school of partial rapture say that the overcomers will be raptured earlier than the majority of the believers
In the Bible there are two main aspects of the rapture: the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of the majority of the believers
Exodus 23:19 says, 'The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God'
The crop is Gods people and the first of the crop to ripen is the firstfruit which will be brought directly to Gods temple in the heavens
Although many Bible teachers have written about the rapture, most of them have not taken care of this matter of the ripening of God's crop
Abel, who was the first martyr, the Apostles, and all the martyrs and deceased overcomers are waiting for the time of resurrection
A believer who is an overcomer and dies before the Lord Jesus comes back will be resurrected to be part of the man-child
The rapture of the man-child differs from that of the majority of the believers as mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 4:17
From this we see that the manchild comprising the dead overcomers through all the generations will be raptured before the great tribulation
One hundred forty-four is twelve times twelve, which signifies the completion of completions, the ultimate completion in the fullest way
The one hundred forty-four thousand firstfruit are believers who are for the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose
Revelation 14 shows us that among God's people growing in His field a small part will be the firstfruit and a great part will be the harvest
In Revelation 14:1 we see that the one hundred forty-four thousand firstfruit are with the Lamb, Christ, on mount Zion
From this we see that the firstfruit will be raptured to mount Zion in the heavens, where God and His throne are and where Christ is
The enemy, the Devil, in heaven must be cast down by the man-child, who will execute the Lord's judgment over him
The one hundred forty-four thousand living overcomers will be raptured to mount Zion in the heavens before the great tribulation
The rapture of the overcomers will include the rapture of the minority of the believers who will be living at the Lord's coming back
In Matthew 24:40 and 41 the Lord Jesus says, 'Then shall two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left
Of the two men in the field one is taken and the other is left and of the two women grinding at the mill one is taken and the other is left
In Luke 17:34 the Lord says, 'I tell you, in that night there will be two on one couch; the one will be taken, and the other will be left'
Those who are taken in this way will be raptured before the great tribulation, which will be a severe trial upon the whole inhabited earth
When the rapture takes place some will be raptured in the night and others will be raptured in the day depending on where they live on earth
It indicates that the raptured overcomers will stand before the Savior on mount Zion in the heavens before the great tribulation
At the time of the rapture of the living overcomers, Christ will not yet have left heaven to come down to the air
In Luke 21:36 the Lord Jesus speaks of our prevailing 'to escape all these things which are about to take place'
When the believers are raptured, the majority of them, who have died through all the generations, will rise up from the dead
Matthew 251 says Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom
When the Lord Jesus returns, the believers will be of two classes signified by the numbers two in Matthew 24 and ten in Matthew 25
Because the two men or two women are working, they represent the believers who will be alive when the Lord returns
The ten virgins, on the contrary, were all asleep, indicating that the majority of the believers will have died by the time the Lord returns
In Matthew 25:1-12 the Lord Jesus addresses what will happen to the majority of the believers, who will have died before His coming
The believers are like chaste virgins, bearing the Lord's testimony in the dark age and going out of the world to meet the Lord
In Revelation He promised to come quickly, but nearly two thousand years have passed, and still He delays His coming
The fact that five were foolish and five prudent does not indicate that half the believers are foolish and the other half are prudent
We should be ready by always having oil in our vessel, by always being filled with the Spirit of God in our whole being
The marriage feast in 25:10, the marriage dinner of the Lamb, will be held in the air during the Lord's coming
The foolish ones were foolish because they had oil only in the lamp but not the extra portion of oil in the vessel
In addition to the regenerating Spirit, they did not have the infilling Spirit, the extra portion of the Holy Spirit
Going out' proves that the lamps of the foolish virgins are lighted, having oil in them, but not having an adequate supply
Those who sell must be the two witnesses during the great tribulation, the two olive trees and the two sons of oil
Matthew 25:11 and 12 say concerning the marriage feast, 'Later the rest of the virgins came also, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us!
When the Lord Jesus comes back, all His dead believers will be resurrected and will be taken up with the living believers to the air
The resurrection of the righteous is the resurrection of life, when God will reward the saints at the Lord's return
We should not be content merely to be in the general resurrection; rather, we should aspire to be in the first, the best, resurrection
It is the resurrection set apart from the common resurrection, the resurrection with honor, comparable to a graduation with honors
The rapture of the overcomers will take place before the last three and a half years, a period known as the great tribulation
According to 1 Thessalonians 4, the rapture of those who are alive and remain will be to the clouds in the air
They will enjoy the Lord's presence much more than what they enjoy of His presence merely in their spirit today
To be glorified, redeemed, and raptured will be a procedure that will bring the believers into the stage of glorification
We may think that in the New Testament God's judgment of people is only of one kind-to decide whether they will perish or be saved
God judges His people so that they may be disciplined, purified, and separated from the unbelievers and not have the same destiny as they
The third kind of judgment in the New Testament will be the judgment of the believers at the judgment seat of Christ
Those that are regarded as goats will go with their leader, Antichrist, 'into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels'
The fifth judgment in the New Testament will be executed by Christ on the dead unbelievers after the millennium
Just as Noah and his family were judged by the water but were inside the ark, so we have been judged by God on the cross in Christ
Eventually, at the Lord's coming back, He will judge us to decide whether in the coming age we shall receive a reward or punishment
Matthew 25:19 speaks of this: 'Now after a long time the lord of those slaves comes and settles accounts with them'
A long time' signifies the entire church age, and the coming signifies the Lord's coming to the air in His parousia
If our heart is right, good, pure, and for God, then at the judgment seat of Christ we shall be rewarded with a praise from God
At the Lord's coming, this reward will be rendered to each one of the believers, after their rapture, at the judgment seat of Christ
According to the context the work that remains must be that of gold silver and precious stones the product of faithful ministers of Christ
Revelation 1118b says The time came for the dead to be judged and the time to give the reward to Your slaves the prophets and to the saints
The giving of the reward to the prophets and to the saints will occur after the resurrection and rapture of the saints
It will depend on whether or not we keep ourselves under the killing of the cross, on whether we save our soul life in this age or lose it
The manifestation of the kingdom in the millennium will be the reward to the followers who remain under the killing of the cross
In Philippians 3:14 Paul declares, 'I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus'
The reward spoken of here is the kingdom reward because it will be given to us for our enjoyment in the coming kingdom, not in this age
If we are faithful in the kingdom exercise today, we shall be rewarded with the kingdom as an enjoyment in the coming age
Based on Christs eternal redemption eternal salvation has been given to us freely and eternally according to Gods eternal selection of us
Eternal salvation is by faith, having nothing to do with our work , whereas the kingdom reward is for our work after we are saved
We may not receive the kingdom reward even though we are saved, because we are void of the work which the Lord would approve
To give them food' is to minister the Word of God and Christ as the life supply to the believers in the church
The faithful slave of the Lord will be set 'over all His possessions' as a reward in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
Corinthians 3:15 says, 'If anyone's work shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but he shall be saved, yet so as through fire'
Those believers whose Christian works will not be approved by the judging Lord and who will suffer the loss of reward will still be saved
Two other portions of the New Testament that speak of the believers' suffering loss are Matthew 24:48-51 and 25:26-30
The problem with the evil slave is not that he does not know that the Lord is coming, but that he does not expect Him
The Lord will not cut the evil slave in pieces; rather, He will cast him off from the glory in which He Himself will be
In Matthew 25:26-30 the one-talented one, who was not faithful in using his gift, is rebuked by the Lord and punished
Verse 30 says, 'Cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth'
The verses that we have covered in this message concerning the believers' being judged at the judgment seat of Christ are very serious
As a result of studying these verses, we should care about our future, in particular how we shall meet the Lord and give an account to Him
God's economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life
By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age
The Gospel of John reveals that Christ is the Lamb who came to take away sin and also the Bridegroom who came that He might have the bride
The marriage of the Lamb will come after the rapture of the majority of the believers and also after the judgment
The righteousness we receive for salvation is objective so that we may meet the requirement of the righteous God
The fine linen with which the overcoming believers are clothed is equal to the marriage garment in Matthew 22:11 and 12
According to the revelation of the Scriptures, the believers need two garments-one for our salvation and one for our reward
We also need the second garment, which is the wedding garment in Matthew 22:11 and 12 and the fine linen in Revelation 19:8
The first garment qualifies us to meet God for our salvation; the second garment qualifies us to meet Christ for our reward
After being dealt with by the Lord in the kingdom age, they will participate in the New Jerusalem for eternity
Revelation 19:16 says, 'He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords'
The fact that this name will be written upon Christ's garment and thigh indicates that it will be openly revealed and known to all
Revelation 17:14 says, 'He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and they who are with Him are called and chosen and faithful'
To be called is to be saved, but to be chosen is to be approved by the Lord on the basis of an overcoming life
Although we have the assurance that we have been called, we do not yet have the assurance that we have been chosen
According to Revelation 19, the armies consist of those who are both the bride and the guests invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb
The heavenly armies following the Lord will fight against Antichrist and the false prophet and their armies and destroy them
Antichrist and his false prophet and their armies will be the strongest people against God, fighting directly with God
By means of the signs they perform, these spirits of demons will gather the kings of the inhabited earth for war
After Christ and His heavenly armies fight against Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies, the kingdom will be brought in
The overcomers will participate in the coming kingdom, which will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens during the millennium
The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward state of the kingdom of the heavens in name, as revealed in Matthew 13
After the Lord Jesus comes back, these overcoming believers will participate in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
When in the millennium the overcoming believers enjoy the Father as light, they will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father
In the heavenly part of the millennium the overcoming believers will drink the cup of the new covenant anew with their Lord
According to Matthew, the manifestation of the kingdom will be a reward to the overcoming saints as their enjoyment with the Lord
To inherit the kingdom is not just to enter the kingdom; it is to receive the kingdom as a reward for our enjoyment
In Galatians 5:21 Paul, referring to the works of the flesh, says, 'Those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God'
The inheritance of the kingdom of God refers to the enjoyment of the coming kingdom as a reward to the overcoming believers
Those believers who practice the works of the flesh listed in Galatians 5 will not inherit the coming kingdom as a reward
The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God and in the church life, are living in the kingdom of God today
The millennium will be a kingdom in a way that is more practical than what we are experiencing in the church today
Today all believers are in the kingdom of God, but not all of them will have an inheritance in the coming millennial kingdom
The kingdom of God here is also the kingdom of Christ, which will be inherited by the overcoming believers in the coming age
In Luke 12:32 the Lord Jesus says, 'Do not fear, little flock, because your Father delights to give you the kingdom'
In the manifestation of the kingdom the overcoming believers will participate in the enjoyment of eternal life with the Lord Jesus
In the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the overcomers will enjoy the eternal life in a fuller way
For the believers to participate in the coming kingdom also includes their being rewarded to have their names remain in the book of life
The name being erased out of the book of life indicates that that name was already written in the book of life
The book of life is a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings God has prepared for them
The names of all the saints chosen by God and predestinated to partake of these blessings are written in this book
All God's chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life have a share in these initial portions to begin their spiritual life
The names of those who have lived an overcoming life in the church age will remain in the book of life during the coming age of the kingdom
The main enjoyment in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be the enjoyment of different aspects of eternal life
To participate in the coming kingdom is also to gain our soul, to save our soul, and to enjoy the salvation of our soul
In Matthew 10:39 the Lord Jesus says, 'He who finds his soul life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul life for My sake shall find it'
These verses indicate that in the coming manifestation of the kingdom the overcoming believers will reign with Christ as His co-kings
In the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the overcoming believers will rule over the nations
The overcomers will exercise the authority of Christ over the nations and rule them with Christ in the millennial kingdom
In the Lord's teaching about faithfulness in Luke 19:11-27, He indicates that the overcoming believers will rule over the nations
Verse 17 says, 'Well done, good slave; because you became faithful in the least, have authority over ten cities'
These verses indicate that the overcoming believers' reigning in the coming kingdom as a reward will differ in extent
In Matthew 24:47 the Lord says concerning the faithful and prudent slave, 'He will set him over all his possessions'
The faithful ones will be set over all the Lord's possessions as a reward in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
We have covered the believers' future in the completing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of glorification
In eternity the believers will participate in the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the divine Trinity
The New Jerusalem also should be a sign signifying the ultimate consummation of the divine Trinity dispensing Himself into His chosen people
The interpretation of the New Jerusalem as a literal, physical city does not fit in with the entire revelation of the Bible
Christ died to clear up the old creation, so eventually the old creation with the old heaven and the old earth will pass away
Christ's death terminated the old creation, and His death as the grain of wheat released the divine life to germinate the new creation
Revelation 21:27 tells us that only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life shall enter into the New Jerusalem
After his creation, man was put before the tree of life , indicating that he was privileged to partake of that tree
After all Gods redeemed saints have been raptured to the heavens they will be the New Jerusalem which will come down out of heaven from God
As the wife of Christ, the New Jerusalem comes out of Christ to be His spouse, just as Eve came out of Adam and became his counterpart
As the components of the holy city, New Jerusalem, the believers will be the tabernacle of God-God's eternal habitation among men
men' refers not to the believers but to the nations , the people living on the new earth outside the New Jerusalem
The believers will be the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle of God among men, that is, among the nations
Speaking of Abraham, Hebrews 11:10 says, 'He waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Maker is God'
To say that the New Jerusalem is a physical city depreciates God's wisdom and belittles Him as the eternal, wise Architect
God is a wise Designer and Artificer who designs such a city to be a full manifestation of His multifarious wisdom
In His wisdom God constructs the New Jerusalem by dispensing Himself as the Architect and Maker into our being
We have the Spirit of the Son and the life of the Son in us, sanctifying us, transforming us, and conforming us to the image of God's Son
We have the position of the Son that we may have the legal right to inherit all that God the Father is and all that He has
They will live on the new earth outside the New Jerusalem and enjoy the common blessings in the new heaven and new earth
The believers as sons of God will dwell in the New Jerusalem participate in all its enjoyment serve God and the Lamb and reign for eternity
The one throne for both God and the Lamb signifies that God and the Lamb are one-the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, God the Redeemer
The Lamb-God, the redeeming God, is on the throne as the center of the holy city for the administration of the eternal kingdom of God
God is the One who had a purpose, who made a plan in eternity past, and who created all things for the fulfillment of His plan
The throne of God and of the Lamb indicates that this throne is for the carrying out of God's plan through Christ's redemption
In the New Jerusalem the throne of the redeeming God will be the center of the city, and His expression will extend to its circumference
The redeeming God will also be the temple of the holy city for the believers' eternal dwelling with God as His serving ones
Revelation 21:22 says that the Apostle John saw no temple in the New Jerusalem, for the temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb
The Lamb as the lamp will shine with God as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, the expression of the divine light
Because such a divine light will illumine the holy city, it will have no need of any other light, whether created by God or made by man
The glory of God, with God as its substance, essence, and element, will be the light of the New Jerusalem shining in the Lamb as its lamp
We see that in the New Jerusalem we shall enjoy not only the spring of the water of life but also the river of the water of life
The water of life is a symbol of God in Christ as the Spirit flowing Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply
In the New Jerusalem we have God in the Lamb, and out of the redeeming God flows the river of life, the life-giving Spirit
Every part of the city receives the life supply because the tree of life grows in the river and the river reaches every part of the city
These people, the nations, will simply be the natural man created by God, fallen, and restored to the natural condition of God's creation
The believers, the first category of people belonging to God, are God's sons born of Him, regenerated of God with His nature and life
The leaves of the tree of life will not supply the nations but will heal them, keeping them alive for eternity
In the consummation of the dispensing of the divine Trinity, the believers will be the ruling ones and the nations will be the ruled ones
The light of the New Jerusalem is like a jasper stone, bearing the appearance of God to express God by her shining
In eternity all the redeemed people of God will be a great light shining over the nations, and the nations will walk in this light
The rest will be transferred to the new earth as the nations, living around the New Jerusalem and walking by its light
