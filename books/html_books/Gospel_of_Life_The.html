It is the world&#8217;s most widely read book and has been translated into more languages than any other book.<br><br>The Bible is appreciated by millions of people for its accurate historical record, its wisdom concerning man&#8217;s relationship with God and his relationship with his fellow man, and its teachings concerning ethics and morality. However, the central revelation of the Bible is life. The Bible is a book of life, and this life is a living person, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. The Bible reveals that God desires to give eternal life to all men. This eternal life that God desires to give us is the very life of the eternal God. Since God is embodied in Jesus Christ, the life of God also is in Christ. The Bible reveals that the way for men to obtain this wonderful life is to receive Christ by believing into Him.<br><br>Among the four Gospels at the beginning of the New Testament, the Gospel of John is unique. It is the Gospel of life. The purpose of this Gospel is to show us that Jesus Christ as the eternal, divine life can meet every need of man. Man&#8217;s basic need is not any material thing, nor is it to improve himself through moral teachings or religious practices. Man&#8217;s basic need is to be born of God and thereby to obtain the life of God and become a son of God. According to the Gospel of John, the divine life of God regenerates us, satisfies us, heals us, enlivens us, feeds us, quenches our thirst, delivers us from the bondage of sin, opens our eyes and gives us spiritual sight, and raises us from death. Whatever our condition or situation, the life of God in Christ can meet our every need.<br><br>Our prayer is that by reading this new translation of the Gospel of John, and the two articles that follow this Gospel, you will see the very Christ revealed in this Gospel and will believe in Him and receive Him as your Redeemer, your Savior, and your life. We also pray that, after receiving Christ, you will continue to grow in the divine life by daily eating Christ as your spiritual food, drinking Christ as your spiritual drink, and breathing Christ as your spiritual breath.</p></td></tr></table></div><h1 class="series">THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO<br>JOHN</h1><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER 1</h1><h2 class="head4">I. The Eternal Word Incarnated Coming to Bring God into Man 1:1-13:38</h2><h2 class="head4">A. Introduction to Life and Building 1:1-51</h2><h2 class="head4">1. The Word in Eternity Past, Who Was God, through Creation Coming as Life and Light to Bring Forth the Children of God vv. 1-13</h2><p><sup>1</sup>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <sup>2</sup>He was in the beginning with God. <sup>3</sup>All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being. <sup>4</sup>In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. <sup>5</sup>And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it. <sup>6</sup>There came a man sent from God, whose name was John. <sup>7</sup>He came for a testimony that he might testify concerning the light, that all might believe through him. <sup>8</sup>He was not the light, but came that he might testify concerning the light. <sup>9</sup>This was the true light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man. <sup>10</sup>He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, yet the world did not know Him. <sup>11</sup>He came to His own, yet those who were His own did not receive Him. <sup>12</sup>But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, <sup>13</sup>Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p><h2 class="head4">2. The Word Becoming Flesh, with Grace in Fullness and with Reality, to Declare God in the Only Begotten Son of God vv.14-18</h2><p><sup>14</sup>And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality. <sup>15</sup>John testified concerning Him and cried out, saying, This was He of whom I said, He who is coming after me has become ahead of me, because He was before me. <sup>16</sup>For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace. <sup>17</sup>For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ. <sup>18</sup>No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</p><h2 class="head4">3. Jesus as the Lamb of God, with the Holy Spirit as the Dove, Making the Believers Stones for the Building of the House of God with the Son of Man vv. 19-51</h2><p><sup>19</sup>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you? <sup>20</sup>And he confessed and did not deny, and he confessed, I am not the Christ. <sup>21</sup>And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the Prophet? And he answered, No. <sup>22</sup>They said then to him, Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself? <sup>23</sup>He said, I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness, &#8220;Make straight the way of the Lord!&#8221; as Isaiah the prophet said. <sup>24</sup>And those who had been sent were of the Pharisees. <sup>25</sup>And they asked him and said to him, Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet? <sup>26</sup>John answered them, saying, I baptize in water; but among you stands One whom you do not know, <sup>27</sup>He who is coming after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie. <sup>28</sup>These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</p><p><sup>29</sup>The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <sup>30</sup>This is He of whom I said, A man is coming after me who has become ahead of me, because He was before me. <sup>31</sup>And I did not know Him, but in order that He might be manifested to Israel, for this reason I came baptizing in water. <sup>32</sup>And John testified, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him. <sup>33</sup>And I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit. <sup>34</sup>And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.</p><p><sup>35</sup>Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples, <sup>36</sup>And looking at Jesus walking, he said, Behold, the Lamb of God! <sup>37</sup>And the two disciples heard him speak this, and they followed Jesus. <sup>38</sup>And Jesus, turning and beholding them following, said to them, What are you seeking? And they said to Him, Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying? <sup>39</sup>He said to them, Come, and you will see. They went therefore and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day; it was about the tenth hour. <sup>40</sup>One of the two who heard this from John and followed Him was Andrew, Simon Peter&#8217;s brother. <sup>41</sup>He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which translated means Christ). <sup>42</sup>He led him to Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said, You are Simon, the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which is interpreted, Peter).</p><p><sup>43</sup>The next day He wanted to go forth into Galilee, and He found Philip. And Jesus said to him, Follow Me. <sup>44</sup>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. <sup>45</sup>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth. <sup>46</sup>And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good be from Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see. <sup>47</sup>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said concerning him, Behold, truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile! <sup>48</sup>Nathanael said to Him, How do You know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you. <sup>49</sup>Nathanael answered Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel. <sup>50</sup>Jesus answered and said to him, Is it because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree that you believe? You shall see greater things than these. <sup>51</sup>And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER 2</h1><h2 class="head4">B. Life&#8217;s Principle and Life&#8217;s Purpose 2:1-22</h2><h2 class="head4">1. Life&#8217;s Principle-To Change Death into Life vv. 1-11</h2><p><sup>1</sup>And the third day a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. <sup>2</sup>And Jesus also was invited, as well as His disciples, to the wedding.</p><p><sup>3</sup>And when the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine. <sup>4</sup>And Jesus said to her, Woman, what do I have in this that concerns you? My hour has not yet come. <sup>5</sup>His mother said to the servants, Whatever He says to you, do. <sup>6</sup>Now there were six stone waterpots lying there, according to the Jews&#8217; rite of purification, holding two or three measures each. <sup>7</sup>Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</p><p><sup>8</sup>And He said to them, Draw some out now and take it to the master of the feast. And they took it to him. <sup>9</sup>And when the master of the feast tasted the water which had become wine and did not know where it came from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew, the master of the feast called the bridegroom <sup>10</sup>And said to him, Every man sets out the good wine first, and when they have drunk freely, then that which is worse; you have kept the good wine until now. <sup>11</sup>This beginning of signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed into Him.</p><h2 class="head4">2. Life&#8217;s Purpose-To Build the House of God vv. 12-22</h2><p><sup>12</sup>After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples; and they remained there not many days.</p><p><sup>13</sup>And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <sup>14</sup>And He found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting there. <sup>15</sup>And having made a whip out of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, as well as the sheep and the oxen, and He poured out the money of the moneychangers and overturned their tables. <sup>16</sup>And to those who were selling the doves He said, Take these things away from here; do not make My Father&#8217;s house a house of merchandise. <sup>17</sup>His disciples remembered that it was written, &#8220;The zeal of Your house shall devour Me.&#8221;</p><p><sup>18</sup>The Jews then answered and said to Him, What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things? <sup>19</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. <sup>20</sup>Then the Jews said, This temple was built in forty-six years, and You will raise it up in three days? <sup>21</sup>But He spoke of the temple of His body. <sup>22</sup>When therefore He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.</p><h2 class="head4">C. Life Meeting the Need of Man&#8217;s Every Case 2:23-11:57</h2><h2 class="head4">1. The Need of the Moral-Life&#8217;s Regenerating 2:23-3:36</h2><p><sup>23</sup>Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed into His name when they saw the signs which He did. <sup>24</sup>But Jesus Himself did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men, <sup>25</sup>And because He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER 3</h1><p><sup>1</sup>But there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</p><p><sup>2</sup>This one came to Him by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher, for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him. <sup>3</sup>Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God. <sup>4</sup>Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother&#8217;s womb and be born, can he? <sup>5</sup>Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. <sup>6</sup>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. <sup>7</sup>Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born anew. <sup>8</sup>The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit. <sup>9</sup>Nicodemus answered and said to Him, How can these things be? <sup>10</sup>Jesus answered and said to him, You are a teacher of Israel, and you do not know these things? <sup>11</sup>Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that which we know and testify of that which we have seen, and yet you do not receive our testimony. <sup>12</sup>If I told you of the things on earth and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you of the things in heaven? <sup>13</sup>And no one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.</p><p><sup>14</sup>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, <sup>15</sup>That every one who believes into Him may have eternal life.</p><p><sup>16</sup>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life. <sup>17</sup>For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. <sup>18</sup>He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God.</p><p><sup>19</sup>And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil. <sup>20</sup>For every one who practices evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his works be reproved. <sup>21</sup>But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be manifested that they are wrought in God.</p><p><sup>22</sup>After these things, Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He spent some time with them and baptized. <sup>23</sup>And John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came and were baptized; <sup>24</sup>For John had not yet been thrown into prison. <sup>25</sup>There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John&#8217;s disciples with a Jew about purification. <sup>26</sup>And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, He who was with you across the Jordan, of whom you have testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him. <sup>27</sup>John answered and said, A man cannot receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven. <sup>28</sup>You yourselves testify of me that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before Him. <sup>29</sup>He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom&#8217;s voice. This joy of mine therefore is made full. <sup>30</sup>He must increase, but I must decrease.</p><p><sup>31</sup>He who comes from above is above all; he who is from the earth is of the earth and speaks out of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all. <sup>32</sup>What He has seen and heard, of this He testifies, and no one receives His testimony. <sup>33</sup>He who receives His testimony has sealed that God is true. <sup>34</sup>For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for He gives the Spirit not by measure. <sup>35</sup>The Father loves the Son and has given all into His hand. <sup>36</sup>He who believes into the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER 4</h1><h2 class="head4">2. The Need of the Immoral-Life&#8217;s Satisfying 4:1-42</h2><p><sup>1</sup>When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John <sup>2</sup>(Although Jesus Himself did not baptize, but rather His disciples), <sup>3</sup>He left Judea and went away again into Galilee. <sup>4</sup>And He had to pass through Samaria. <sup>5</sup>So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob gave to Joseph his son; <sup>6</sup>And Jacob&#8217;s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from the journey, sat thus by the well; it was about the sixth hour. <sup>7</sup>There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give Me something to drink. <sup>8</sup>For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</p><p><sup>9</sup>The Samaritan woman then said to Him, How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) <sup>10</sup>Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water. <sup>11</sup>The woman said to Him, Sir, You have no bucket, and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water? <sup>12</sup>Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, as well as his sons and his cattle? <sup>13</sup>Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, <sup>14</sup>But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life.</p><p><sup>15</sup>The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water so that I will not thirst nor come here to draw. <sup>16</sup>He said to her, Go, call your husband and come here. <sup>17</sup>The woman answered and said, I do not have a husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I do not have a husband, <sup>18</sup> For you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly.</p><p><sup>19</sup>The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. <sup>20</sup>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship. <sup>21</sup>Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. <sup>22</sup>You worship that which you do not know; we worship that which we know, for salvation is of the Jews. <sup>23</sup>But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him. <sup>24</sup>God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.</p><p><sup>25</sup>The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when He comes, He will declare all things to us. <sup>26</sup>Jesus said to her, I, who speak to you, am He.<p><sup>27</sup>And at this point His disciples came, and they marveled that He was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, What are You seeking? or, Why are You speaking with her? <sup>28</sup>Then the woman left her waterpot and went away into the city, and said to the people, <sup>29</sup>Come, see a man who told me all that I have done. Is this not the Christ? <sup>30</sup>They went out of the city and came to Him.</p><p><sup>31</sup>In the meantime, the disciples urged Him, saying, Rabbi, eat. <sup>32</sup>But He said to them, I have food to eat that you do not know about. <sup>33</sup>The disciples therefore said to one another, Has anyone brought Him anything to eat? <sup>34</sup>Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work. <sup>35</sup>Do you not say that there are yet four months and then the harvest comes? Behold, I tell you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are already white for harvest. <sup>36</sup>He who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto eternal life, in order that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together. <sup>37</sup>For in this the saying is true, One sows and another reaps. <sup>38</sup>I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.</p><p><sup>39</sup>And many of the Samaritans from that city believed into Him because of the word of the woman who testified, He told me all that I have done. <sup>40</sup>So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to remain with them, and He remained there two days. <sup>41</sup>And many more believed because of His word. <sup>42</sup>And they said to the woman, It is no longer because of your speaking that we believe, for we ourselves have heard and know that this One is truly the Savior of the world.</p><h2 class="head4">3. The Need of the Dying-Life&#8217;s Healing 4:43-54</h2><p><sup>43</sup>And after the two days He went forth from there into Galilee, <sup>44</sup>For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country. <sup>45</sup>Then when He came into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all that He did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.</p><p><sup>46</sup>He then came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water wine.</p><p>And there was a certain royal official, whose son was sick in Capernaum. <sup>47</sup>When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and asked Him to come down and heal his son, for he was about to die. <sup>48</sup>Jesus therefore said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe. <sup>49</sup>The royal official said to Him, Sir, come down before my little child dies.</p><p><sup>50</sup>Jesus said to him, Go, your son lives. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him and went his way. <sup>51</sup>And as he was now going down, his slaves met him and said that his child was living. <sup>52</sup>So he asked them the hour in which he got better. They said then to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. <sup>53</sup>Then the father knew that it was in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives; and he believed, he and his whole house. <sup>54</sup>Again, this second sign Jesus performed when He came out of Judea into Galilee.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER 5</h1><h2 class="head4">4. The Need of the Impotent-Life&#8217;s Enlivening 5:1-47</h2><p><sup>1</sup>After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <sup>2</sup>Now there is in Jerusalem near the sheepgate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes. <sup>3</sup>In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, waiting for the moving of the water. <sup>4</sup>For an angel went down from time to time in the pool and stirred up the water; the first then to step in after the stirring up of the water was made well of whatever disease he was being held by. <sup>5</sup>And a certain man was there, who had been thirty-eight years in his sickness. <sup>6</sup>When Jesus saw this one lying there and knew that he had already been a long time in that condition, He said to him, Do you want to get well? <sup>7</sup>The sick man answered Him, Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me. <sup>8</sup>Jesus said to him, Rise, take up your mat and walk. <sup>9</sup>And immediately the man became well, and he took up his mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day;</p><p><sup>10</sup>Therefore the Jews said to the one who had been healed, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your mat. <sup>11</sup>But he answered them, He who made me well, that One said to me, Take up your mat and walk. <sup>12</sup>They asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up your mat and walk? <sup>13</sup>But he who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, there being a crowd in that place. <sup>14</sup>After these things Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you have become well; sin no more so that nothing worse happens to you. <sup>15</sup>The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus was the One who made him well. <sup>16</sup>And because of this the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He did these things on the Sabbath.</p><p><sup>17</sup>But Jesus answered them, My Father is working until now, and I also am working. <sup>18</sup>Because of this therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath but also called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.</p><p><sup>19</sup>Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner. <sup>20</sup>For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and greater works than these He will show Him that you may marvel. <sup>21</sup>For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wills. <sup>22</sup>For neither does the Father judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son, <sup>23</sup>In order that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him. <sup>24</sup>Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life. <sup>25</sup>Truly, truly, I say to you, An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. <sup>26</sup>For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son to also have life in Himself; <sup>27</sup>And He gave Him authority to execute judgment because He is the Son of Man. <sup>28</sup>Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming in which all in the tombs will hear His voice <sup>29</sup>And will come forth: those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have practiced evil, to the resurrection of judgment.</p><p><sup>30</sup> I can do nothing from Myself; as I hear, I judge, and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.</p><p><sup>31</sup>If I testify concerning Myself, My testimony is not true.</p><p><sup>32</sup>There is another who testifies concerning Me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies concerning Me is true. <sup>33</sup>You have sent people to John, and he has testified to the truth. <sup>34</sup>But it is not from man that I receive My testimony, but I say these things that you may be saved. <sup>35</sup>He was the lamp that was burning and shining, and you were willing to exult for a while in his light.</p><p><sup>36</sup>But I have the testimony which is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father has given Me to finish, the works themselves which I do, testify concerning Me that the Father has sent Me.</p><p><sup>37</sup>And the Father who sent Me, He has testified concerning Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor have you seen His form, <sup>38</sup>And you do not have His word abiding in you, for Him whom He sent, this One you do not believe.</p><p><sup>39</sup>You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. <sup>40</sup>Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life. <sup>41</sup>I do not receive glory from men. <sup>42</sup>But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves. <sup>43</sup>I have come in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him. <sup>44</sup>How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that is from the only God? <sup>45</sup>Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; there is one who accuses you: Moses, in whom you have set your hope. <sup>46</sup>For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote concerning Me. <sup>47</sup>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER 6</h1><h2 class="head4">5. The Need of the Hungry-Life&#8217;s Feeding 6:1-71</h2><p><sup>1</sup>After these things Jesus went away across the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias. <sup>2</sup>And a great crowd followed Him, because they saw the signs which He did on those who were sick. <sup>3</sup>And Jesus went up to the mountain and sat there with His disciples. <sup>4</sup>Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near. <sup>5</sup>Jesus then lifting up His eyes and seeing that a great crowd was coming toward Him, said to Philip, Where shall we buy bread that these may eat? <sup>6</sup>But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He was about to do. <sup>7</sup>Philip answered Him, Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that each one may take a little. <sup>8</sup>One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter&#8217;s brother, said to Him, <sup>9</sup>There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are these for so many? <sup>10</sup>Jesus said, Have the people recline. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men reclined, in number about five thousand. <sup>11</sup>Jesus then took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed to those who were reclining; likewise also of the fish, as much as they wanted.<sup>12</sup>And when they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather the broken pieces leftover that nothing may be lost. <sup>13</sup>So they gathered them and filled twelve handbaskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves which were left over among those who had eaten. <sup>14</sup>The people therefore, seeing the sign which He did, said, This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.</p><p><sup>15</sup>Then Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him King, withdrew again to the mountain, Himself alone.</p><p><sup>16</sup>And when evening fell, His disciples went down to the sea, <sup>17</sup>And they got into a boat and began crossing the sea to Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. <sup>18</sup>And because a strong wind was blowing, the sea was churning. <sup>19</sup>Then, when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they became frightened. <sup>20</sup>But He said to them, It is I. Do not be afraid. <sup>21</sup>Then they were willing to take Him into the boat; and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.</p><p><sup>22</sup>The next day the crowd which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there had been no other small boat there except one, and that Jesus had not gotten into the boat with His disciples, but that His disciples had gone away alone. <sup>23</sup>But other small boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks. <sup>24</sup>So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. <sup>25</sup>And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did You get here? <sup>26</sup>Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek Me not because you have seen signs, but because you ate of the bread and were filled. <sup>27</sup>Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for Him has the Father, even God, sealed. <sup>28</sup>Then they said to Him, What shall we do that we may work the works of God? <sup>29</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe into Him whom He has sent. <sup>30</sup>They said then to Him, What sign then will You do that we may see and believe You? What work will You do? <sup>31</sup>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, &#8220;He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.&#8221;</p><p><sup>32</sup>Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread out of heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven. <sup>33</sup>For the bread of God is He who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world. <sup>34</sup>They said therefore to Him, Lord, give us this bread always. <sup>35</sup>Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst. <sup>36</sup>But I have said to you that you have also seen Me, and yet you do not believe. <sup>37</sup>All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out. <sup>38</sup>For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me. <sup>39</sup>And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all which He has given Me I should lose nothing but should raise it up in the last day. <sup>40</sup>For this is the will of My Father, that every one who beholds the Son and believes into Him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.</p><p><sup>41</sup>The Jews therefore murmured concerning Him because He said, I am the bread that came down out of heaven. <sup>42</sup>And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does He now say, I have come down out of heaven? <sup>43</sup>Jesus answered and said unto them, Do not murmur among yourselves. <sup>44</sup>No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up in the last day. <sup>45</sup>It is written in the prophets, &#8220;And they shall all be taught of God.&#8221; Every one who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me. <sup>46</sup>Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from God, He has seen the Father. <sup>47</sup>Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes has eternal life. <sup>48</sup>I am the bread of life. <sup>49</sup>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. <sup>50</sup> This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die. <sup>51</sup>I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; And the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world.</p><p><sup>52</sup>The Jews then contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us His flesh to eat? <sup>53</sup>Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves. <sup>54</sup>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day. <sup>55</sup>For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.</p><p><sup>56</sup>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him. <sup>57</sup>As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me. <sup>58</sup>This is the bread which came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread shall live forever. <sup>59</sup>He said these things in a synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.</p><p><sup>60</sup>Many therefore of His disciples, when they heard this, said, This word is hard; who can hear it? <sup>61</sup>But Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples were murmuring about this, said to them, Does this stumble you? <sup>62</sup>Then what if you saw the Son of Man ascending to where He was before?</p><p><sup>63</sup>It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. <sup>64</sup>But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who were the ones who did not believe and who was the one who would betray Him. <sup>65</sup>And He said, For this reason I have told you that no one can come to Me unless it has been given to him from the Father.</p><p><sup>66</sup>From that time many of His disciples went back to what they left behind and no longer walked with Him. <sup>67</sup>Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Do you also want to go away? <sup>68</sup>Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life, <sup>69</sup>And we have believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God. <sup>70</sup>Jesus answered them, Was it not I who chose you, the twelve? Yet one of you is a devil. <sup>71</sup>Now He spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, would betray Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER 7</h1><h2 class="head4">6.

If You do these things, manifest Yourself to the world. <sup>5</sup>For not even His brothers believed into Him.</p><p><sup>6</sup>Jesus therefore said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready. <sup>7</sup>The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify concerning it, that its works are evil. <sup>8</sup>You go up to the feast; I am not going up to this feast, because My time has not yet been fulfilled. <sup>9</sup>And having said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.</p><p><sup>10</sup>But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He Himself also went up, not openly, but as it were in secret. <sup>11</sup>The Jews therefore sought Him at the feast and said, Where is He? <sup>12</sup>And there was much murmuring about Him among the crowds: some said, He is a good man; but others said, No; rather He leads the crowd astray. <sup>13</sup>Yet no one spoke openly about Him for fear of the Jews.</p><p><sup>14</sup>But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach. <sup>15</sup>The Jews therefore marveled and said, How does this man know letters, without ever having studied? <sup>16</sup>Jesus therefore answered them and said, My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me. <sup>17</sup>If anyone resolves to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself. <sup>18</sup>He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him. <sup>19</sup>Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill Me? <sup>20</sup>The crowd answered, You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill You? <sup>21</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and you all marvel. <sup>22</sup>For the same reason Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man. <sup>23</sup>If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath? <sup>24</sup>Do not judge according to appearance, but judge the righteous judgment.</p><p><sup>25</sup>Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, Is not this the One whom they are seeking to kill? <sup>26</sup>And look, He is speaking openly, and they say nothing to Him. Have the rulers, perhaps, really recognized that this is the Christ? <sup>27</sup>But we know where this man is from; yet when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from. <sup>28</sup>Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, You both know Me and know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know. <sup>29</sup>I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me. <sup>30</sup>They sought then to seize Him, yet no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come. <sup>31</sup>But many out of the crowd believed into Him and said, Will the Christ, when He comes, do more signs than this man has done? <sup>32</sup>The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent attendants to arrest Him. <sup>33</sup>Jesus therefore said, I am still with you a little while, and then I am going to Him who sent Me. <sup>34</sup>You will seek Me and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come. <sup>35</sup>The Jews then said to one another, Where is this man about to go that we will not find Him?

Jesus answered. You know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me, you would know My Father also. <sup>20</sup>These words He spoke in the treasury as He taught in the temple; and no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.</p><p><sup>21</sup>He said therefore again to them, I am going away, and you will seek Me and will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come. <sup>22</sup>The Jews then said, He is not going to kill Himself, is He, for He says, Where I am going, you cannot come? <sup>23</sup>And He said to them, You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world. <sup>24</sup>Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins. <sup>25</sup>They said then to Him, Who are You? Jesus said to them, Altogether that which I also tell you. <sup>26</sup>I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true, and what I have heard from Him, these things I speak to the world. <sup>27</sup>They did not understand that He was speaking to them of the Father.</p><p><sup>28</sup>Jesus therefore said to them, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am, and that I do nothing from Myself, but as My Father has taught Me, I speak these things. <sup>29</sup>And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him. <sup>30</sup>As He spoke these things, many believed into Him.</p><p><sup>31</sup>Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, If you abide in My word, you are truly My disciples; <sup>32</sup>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free. <sup>33</sup>They answered Him, We are Abraham&#8217;s seed and have never yet been enslaved to anyone. How is it that You say, You shall become free? <sup>34</sup>Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin. <sup>35</sup>And the slave does not abide in the house forever; the son does abide forever. <sup>36</sup>If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed.</p><p><sup>37</sup>I know that you are Abraham&#8217;s seed; but you seek to kill Me because My word has no place in you. <sup>38</sup>I speak the things which I have seen with My Father; so then, you also do the things which you have heard from your father. <sup>39</sup>They answered and said to Him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham&#8217;s children, you would do the works of Abraham. <sup>40</sup>But now you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God; Abraham did not do this. <sup>41</sup>You do the works of your father. They then said to Him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, God. <sup>42</sup>Jesus said to them, If God were your Father you would love Me; for I came forth out from God and have come from Him; for I have not come of Myself, but He sent Me. <sup>43</sup>Why do you not understand My speaking?

He went therefore and washed and came away seeing. <sup>8</sup>The neighbors then and those who previously saw him as a beggar said, Is not this the one who used to sit and beg? <sup>9</sup>Some said, This is he. Others said, No, but he is like him.

I went therefore and washed, and I received my sight. <sup>12</sup>And they said to him, Where is He? He said, I do not know. <sup>13</sup>They brought him who was once blind to the Pharisees.</p><p><sup>14</sup>Now it was the Sabbath, on which day Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. <sup>15</sup>Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight.

As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me. <sup>5</sup>I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing. <sup>6</sup>If one does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up; and they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. <sup>7</sup>If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you. <sup>8</sup>In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit and so you will become My disciples. <sup>9</sup>As the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. <sup>10</sup>If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; even as I have kept My Father&#8217;s commandments and abide in His love. <sup>11</sup>These things I have spoken to you that My joy may be in you and that your joy may be made full.</p><p><sup>12</sup>This is My commandment, that you love one another even as I have loved you. <sup>13</sup>No one has greater love than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. <sup>14</sup>You are My friends if you do what I command you. <sup>15</sup>No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all the things which I have heard from My Father I have made known to you. <sup>16</sup>You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you. <sup>17</sup>These things I command you that you may love one another.</p><p><sup>18</sup>If the world hates you, know that it has hated Me before you. <sup>19</sup>If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. <sup>20</sup>Remember the word which I said to you, A slave is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted Me, they will persecute you also; if they have kept My word, they will keep yours also. <sup>21</sup>But all these things they will do to you because of My name, because they do not know Him who sent Me. <sup>22</sup>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. <sup>23</sup>He who hates Me hates My Father also. <sup>24</sup>If I did not do among them the works which no one else has done, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated both Me and My Father. <sup>25</sup>But it is so that the word written in their law may be fulfilled, &#8220;They hated Me without cause.&#8221; <sup>26</sup>But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me; <sup>27</sup>And you testify also, because from the beginning you have been with Me.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER 16</h1><p><sup>1</sup>These things I have spoken to you so that you would not be stumbled. <sup>2</sup>They will put you out of the synagogues; but an hour is coming for every one who kills you to think that he is offering service to God. <sup>3</sup>And these things they will do because they have not known the Father nor Me. <sup>4</sup>But these things I have spoken to you that when their hour comes you may remember them, that I told you of them.

And that disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest; <sup>16</sup>But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple, the one known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the maid who kept the door and brought Peter in. <sup>17</sup>Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, Are you not also one of this man&#8217;s disciples? He said, I am not. <sup>18</sup>Now the slaves and the attendants were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold, and they were warming themselves; and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself. <sup>19</sup>The high priest then questioned Jesus concerning His disciples and concerning His teaching. <sup>20</sup>Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together, and I spoke nothing in secret. <sup>21</sup>Why do you question Me?

The Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to kill anyone, <sup>32</sup>That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which He spoke, signifying by what kind of death He was to die. <sup>33</sup>Pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium and called for Jesus.

Your nation and its chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done? <sup>36</sup>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My attendants would be struggling so that I would not be delivered to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not from here. <sup>37</sup>Pilate said therefore to Him, So then You are a king?

And he said to them, Behold, the man! <sup>6</sup>When therefore the chief priests and the attendants saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify! Crucify! Pilate said to them, You take Him and crucify Him, for I do not find fault in Him. <sup>7</sup>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to that law He ought to die because He made Himself the Son of God. <sup>8</sup>When Pilate therefore heard this word, he became frightened the more, <sup>9</sup>And he entered into the praetorium again and said to Jesus, Where are You from? But Jesus gave him no answer. <sup>10</sup>Therefore Pilate said to Him, You do not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You and I have authority to crucify You? <sup>11</sup>Jesus answered him, You would have no authority against Me if it were not given to you from above; for this reason, he who has delivered Me to you has the greater sin. <sup>12</sup>From then on, Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar; every one who makes himself a king opposes Caesar. <sup>13</sup>Pilate therefore, when he heard these words, brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. <sup>14</sup>Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, Behold, your King! <sup>15</sup>They cried out then, Take Him away! Take Him away! Crucify Him! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king except Caesar. <sup>16</sup>Therefore at that time he delivered Him to them that He might be crucified. Therefore they took Jesus.</p><h2 class="head4">4. Tested in God&#8217;s Sovereignty by Death 19:17-30</h2><p><sup>17</sup>And bearing the cross for Himself, He went out to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha, <sup>18</sup>Where they crucified Him, and with Him two others, on this side and that, and Jesus in the middle. <sup>19</sup>And Pilate wrote a notice also and put it on the cross; and it was written, JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup>20</sup>This notice therefore many of the Jews read, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. <sup>21</sup>The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the Jews, but that He said, I am the King of the Jews. <sup>22</sup>Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.</p><p><sup>23</sup>The soldiers then, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, a part for each soldier, and they took the tunic as well. But the tunic was seamless, woven from the top throughout. <sup>24</sup>They said therefore to one another, Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots for it to see whose it shall be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says, &#8220;They divided My garments among themselves, and for My clothing they cast lots.&#8221; So then the soldiers did these things. <sup>25</sup>And there were standing by the cross of Jesus His mother and His mother&#8217;s sister and Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary the Magdalene. <sup>26</sup>Then Jesus, seeing His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, said to His mother, Woman, behold, your son. <sup>27</sup>Then He said to the disciple, Behold, your mother. And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.</p><p><sup>28</sup>After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had now been finished and so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst. <sup>29</sup>There was lying there a vessel full of vinegar; therefore, they put a spongefull of vinegar on hyssop and brought it to His mouth. <sup>30</sup>Then when Jesus had taken the vinegar, He said, It is finished!

He came therefore and took His body away. <sup>39</sup>And Nicodemus, he who had come to Him the first time by night, came also, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes of about a hundred pounds. <sup>40</sup>Therefore they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the custom of the Jews for burying. <sup>41</sup>Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever yet been laid. <sup>42</sup>Therefore because of the day of preparation for the Jews and because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus there.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER 20</h1><h2 class="head4">7.

They cast therefore, and they were no longer able to haul it in because of the abundance of fish. <sup>7</sup>Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord! Therefore when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment around himself, for he was naked; and he threw himself into the sea. <sup>8</sup>But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away, dragging the net of fish. <sup>9</sup>Then when they got out onto the land, they saw a fire of coals laid there, and fish lying on it and bread. <sup>10</sup>Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish that you have just now caught. <sup>11</sup>Simon Peter therefore went up and hauled the net to the land full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there were so many, the net was not torn. <sup>12</sup>Jesus said to them, Come and have breakfast. But none of the disciples dared to inquire of Him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord. <sup>13</sup>Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish likewise. <sup>14</sup>This was now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples after He had been raised from the dead.</p><h2 class="head4">5. Working and Walking with the Believers 21:15-25</h2><p><sup>15</sup>Then when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My lambs. <sup>16</sup>He said to him again a second time, Simon, son of John, do you love Me? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Shepherd My sheep. <sup>17</sup>He said to him the third time, Simon, son of John, do you love Me? Peter was grieved that He said to him the third time, Do you love Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You. Jesus said to him, Feed My sheep. <sup>18</sup>Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go. <sup>19</sup>Now this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had said this, He said to him, Follow Me. <sup>20</sup>Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also reclined on His breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is the one betraying You? <sup>21</sup>Peter therefore, seeing him, said to Jesus, Lord, and what about this man? <sup>22</sup>Jesus said to him, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me. <sup>23</sup>This word therefore went out among the brothers, that that disciple would not die, yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?</p><p><sup>24</sup>This is the disciple who testifies concerning these things, and the one who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true. <sup>25</sup>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself could contain the books written.</p><h1 class=msg>The First Step in Living a Christian Life</h1><p>Perhaps you have wondered what kind of life God wants you to live. You may already know that the Bible is a wonderful book, but perhaps you do not know what it says about the kind of life a Christian ought to live. The following article, based on the Gospel of John, explains how you can live the life God desires you to live. It tells you who you are and what you can do to experience the divine things of God&#8217;s salvation. Please read it carefully and prayerfully.<p>The Gospel of John reveals that in Christ, the Word of God, is life (1:4); that He came that man may have life (10:10b); and that He Himself is life (11:25; 14:6). Furthermore, this Gospel shows us that Christ is the bread of life (6:35); that He has the water of life (4:14); that He gives life to man (5:21); and that He even lives in man as life (14:19).<sup>1</sup><p>Man was made as a vessel to contain God as life. However, by creation he was merely an empty vessel; he did not have genuine life. The created life of man is not genuine; genuine life  is the divine life, which is in Christ. The life we have before we receive Christ is, at best, a temporary life; it is not a permanent life, an everlasting life. Although it is an instant life, it is not a constant one. Before we receive Christ we are uncertain just how long our instant life will endure. Thus, in a sense, before we are saved we do not have life. The life in Christ is eternal, constant, and permanent. All men need such a life, the divine and uncreated life that is in Christ. This life is for man, and man is the receiver of this life.<sup>2</sup><p>Chapter three through chapter eleven of the Gospel of John relate nine cases to expose the condition and need of man, and then they reveal how the Lord can deal with all the conditions and meet all the needs of man. Only God&#8217;s life can meet the need of man&#8217;s every case. We must realize that life here means the Lord Himself (1:4), the Word which was God (1:1) and which became flesh (1:14). Although the Lord might have dealt with thousands of human cases, the Gospel of John selected only nine of them to illustrate how the Lord as life could and still can meet the need of every human case.<h2 class=head1>MAN&#8217;S CONDITION AND NEED</h2><p>Let us see, first of all, the condition of man in each case. The first case, in chapter three, is about a high-class, moral person who came to the Lord (3:1-13). He is a superior gentleman, highly cultured, very religious, God-seeking, and God-fearing. The second case, in chapter four, shows forth exactly the opposite condition (4:1-42). The first case is about a moral man; the second case is about an immoral woman. The former is about a mild, high-class person, while the latter is about a wild, low-class person. This wicked woman had had five husbands and was living with a sixth who was not her husband. The third case, also in chapter four, is about a young man who was sick and about to die (4:46-54). The fourth case, in chapter five, is about a man who had been sick for thirty-eight years (5:1-4). He was utterly weak and unable to move even one step. The fifth case, in chapter six, is about the hungry multitude who were seeking something to feed on (6:1-15). The sixth case, in chapter seven, is about the thirsty people whose thirst could not be quenched by the best religion or by anything of this life (7:37-39). The seventh case, in chapter eight, sets forth a sinful woman who committed a terrible sin and who was under the condemnation and bondage of her sin (8:2-11). The eighth case, in chapters nine and ten, concerns a blind man who was born blind (9:1-38). Finally, the ninth case, in chapter eleven, is about Lazarus, who died and was buried for four days (11:1-44).<p>The conditions of the people mentioned in these nine cases represent the conditions of all men. Some men are good like Nicodemus, while others are wicked like the Samaritan woman. Others, like the young man in Capernaum, are dying. Most are weak like the man who was sick for thirty-eight years. They desire to do good, but they do not have the strength to fulfill that desire. They know religion, but, because they are weak, they do not have the power to live out its standards or fulfill its regulations. Other people are hungry, craving for something to enjoy, while some are thirsting for something more than their human life can offer them. There are some people whose thirst is so great that nothing in this life can satisfy them. Some people continually commit sins and are under the condemnation and bondage of their sins. Some, like the blind man, are blind, not physically, but psychologically and spiritually. Finally, the last condition of all men is death, for they are in death and, at the same time, are on the road to death. They are dead already and yet they all will die later. All men are dead men who are going to die. Therefore, these nine cases portray the true conditions of all men. These conditions speak forth man&#8217;s need, which only the Lord as life can fully meet.<h2 class=head1>EACH INDIVIDUAL&#8217;S CONDITION AND NEED</h2><p>All the conditions of these nine cases can also be found in each individual person. One person can possess all the conditions of all men. For example, you may be a good man, or, at least you have the intention of being a good man. You may also be quite religious, fearing God and seeking Him. At the same time, however, you may also have done something mean, something which is not honorable. You may be a religious gentleman with high morals and yet have done something low. On the one hand, you are a high-class person; on the other hand, you are a low-class person.<p>You are also sick and about to die morally and spiritually. You may be very living physically, but you are dying morally and spiritually. Even physically you are also dying day by day. Apparently you are living; actually you are dying.<p>Another condition of yours is that you are a weak person. You know that you should do good and you know what is right, but you lack the strength or the power to do it. Perhaps you are not yet twenty-five years old, but you have been sick for &#8220;thirty-eight years&#8221; (5:5). You know that you should love others, but you are weak; you want to keep all the laws of God and you desire to please God, but you are unable to do so. In other words, you have the desire to do good, but you do not have the ability to perform what you desire. You need the proper power of life.<p>Hunger and thirst are also two items of your condition. Many times you feel that you are a hungry person; many times you are thirsty for education, for money, or for pleasure. You need the Lord as the bread of life to satisfy your hunger, and you need the Lord&#8217;s living water to quench your thirst.<p>Another condition that can also be found in you as an individual is your sinfulness. You are sinful. You are a sinner and you commit sin. You need the forgiveness of the Lord as well as deliverance from the bondage of sin.<p>In another respect, you are in a state of blindness. Even though you may have perfect vision with your physical eyes, you cannot perceive the meaning of human life, and especially you cannot see spiritual things. You are blind and you need the Lord to open your eyes and to give you sight.<p>Your last condition is that of a dead man who eventually will die. Have you ever realized that you are a dead person? No one is alive in spirit-everyone is dead. You need the resurrection life of the Lord Jesus.<p>Every person has, in his fallen condition, every aspect of these nine cases. Every person, to a certain degree at least, is in each of these conditions. Every condition is an indication of everyone&#8217;s real need.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S SUFFICIENCY IN MEETING MAN&#8217;S NEED</h2><p>We have seen the condition and need of man in these nine cases. Now we must see how the Lord is able to come into man&#8217;s fallen condition and meet his every need. In every case, the Lord presents Himself as the One who can fulfill the deficiencies of man. These nine cases fully prove the Lord&#8217;s sufficiency to meet man&#8217;s every need.<p>The first case shows that the Lord can afford us regeneration (3:3, 5), which even a superior person such as Nicodemus needed that he might have the life of God for the entrance into the kingdom of God. The case of the Samaritan woman, a sinful and unsatisfied woman, reveals how much the Lord can satisfy such a person with His living water (4:10). For the case of the dying man, the Lord is the healing power of life (4:50). The case of the weak man who had been sick for thirty-eight years demonstrates the enlivening power of the Lord&#8217;s life (5:8-9). In the case of the hungry multitude which needed something to feed on, the Lord presents Himself as the bread of life (6:47, 48). In the case of the thirsty people, the Lord assures them that He can quench their thirst by the flowing river of living water (7:37, 38). In the case of the woman living in sin, we see that the Lord is able to deliver such a one from her sinful situation and release her from the bondage of sin (8:34-36). In the case of the blind man, the Lord opens his eyes and gives him sight (9:5-7). Finally, in the case of Lazarus, who had died, had been buried, and was even decaying in the grave, the power of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection life is fully exhibited (11:25).<p>In all of these cases the Lord&#8217;s sufficiency in meeting man&#8217;s need is adequately proved. There is not one of man&#8217;s conditions that He cannot solve. There is not a need that He cannot meet. He is able! He is sufficient! He can deal with all our problems and supply all our needs! Praise His name!<h2 class=head1>REGENERATION-THE PREREQUISITE TO FULL SALVATION</h2><p>All aspects of the Lord&#8217;s work as shown and signified in these nine cases are the different aspects of the Lord&#8217;s full salvation, which are 1) regeneration, 2) the satisfaction with the living water, 3) the healing power of life, 4) the enlivening with the power of life, 5) the feeding with the bread of life, 6) the quenching of thirst with the rivers of living water, 7) the deliverance from sin, 8) the opening of the blind eyes, and 9) resurrection. All of these items are included in the Lord&#8217;s salvation.<p>The first of these items is regeneration. Regeneration is the start of the spiritual life. All spiritual experiences begin with regeneration. If we have regeneration, we are then qualified to participate in all the other items of the Lord&#8217;s salvation. Regeneration is a prerequisite to the experience of all the other items of the Lord&#8217;s salvation. This is the reason that the case of regeneration is recorded as the first one. All the experiences of the other items depend upon the experience of regeneration. Before we can be satisfied with the living water, we must first be regenerated. The living water issues from the initial experience of regeneration. Without regeneration, the Lord&#8217;s living water can never be in you. The principle is the same with all the other experiences. A dying person needs to be regenerated that he may be healed and live eternally. A weak person must first be regenerated; then he can be enlivened with the power of life. A person must first be regenerated before he can feed upon the Lord as the bread of life. To enjoy the nourishment of life depends very much upon regeneration. To have the flow of living water is also dependent upon regeneration. If you are not regenerated, you could never have your thirst quenched by the Lord&#8217;s living water. To be delivered from sin and to have our blind eyes opened both require that we first be regenerated. Without regeneration, it is impossible for anyone to partake of the deliverance from sin or to receive spiritual sight. Furthermore, no one can participate in resurrection life before experiencing regeneration. The Lord&#8217;s salvation begins with regeneration and ends with resurrection life. Thus, we need to examine very carefully the first case, the case of Nicodemus, which reveals man&#8217;s need for regeneration.<h2 class=head1>REGENERATION</h2><p>The first case, that of Nicodemus, is the case of regeneration. Nicodemus was a person of the highest class, and we need to consider his virtues and attributes. First, he was a teacher with the highest attainment in education. As a teacher of the Jews, he taught the Old Testament, the Sacred Word. Second, Nicodemus was &#8220;a ruler of the Jews.&#8221; He had a position with a certain amount of honor and authority. Third, he was an old man. As an old man, he had a good deal of experience. He was a man full of experiences. Fourth, he was undoubtedly a moral man, a good man. If you look at the way he talked, you will realize that he was a moral man. Fifth, Nicodemus was a man who was truly seeking after God. Although he was somewhat fearful of the Pharisees, he still came to the Lord Jesus by night. This indicated that he was seeking God. Sixth, he was very humble. Nicodemus was an old man of perhaps sixty or seventy years of age, yet he came to see the Lord Jesus, who was only a little over thirty years of age. That such an experienced, educated, and elderly man would come to see someone much younger than he indicates his humility. Furthermore, although Nicodemus was a teacher, he addressed the Lord Jesus as Rabbi. Among the Jews, to call a person Rabbi means that you are humbling yourself. Seventh, Nicodemus was an honest man. His speech reveals his honesty. Can you find a better person than Nicodemus? He was a man of a superior standard, high attainment, and morality.<p>When Nicodemus came to the Lord Jesus, the Lord took the opportunity to reveal the true need of mankind. In His conversation with Nicodemus, the Lord revealed that regardless of how good we are, we still need regeneration. Regeneration is the first need of man. Moral people, as well as immoral people, need regeneration. Many Christians hold the mistaken concept that people need regeneration simply because they are fallen. However, if man had never fallen, he still would have needed regeneration. Even if Adam had not fallen, he still would have needed regeneration. That was why God put him in front of the tree of life. If Adam had partaken of the tree of life, he would have been regenerated.<p>Since we are human beings, we all have a human life. The problem is not a matter of whether or not our human life is good or bad. Regardless of the kind of human life we have, as long as we do not have the divine life, we need to be regenerated. To be regenerated simply means to have the divine life besides our human life. God&#8217;s eternal purpose is that man be a vessel to contain the divine life. Our being with our human life is a vessel to contain God as life. The divine life is God&#8217;s goal. The divine life is God Himself. God&#8217;s goal is that we, as people with a human life, receive the divine life into our being as our real life. This is the true meaning of regeneration. Many Christians are not clear about this fact, thinking that regeneration is necessary simply because we are fallen and sinful. According to this concept, we need to be regenerated because our life is bad and cannot be improved. This concept is wrong. I say once again that even if Adam in the garden of Eden had never fallen, he still would have needed to be regenerated, to be born again, that he might have another life, the life of God. Therefore, to be regenerated is to receive the divine life, God Himself.<p>What is the meaning of regeneration? Regeneration is not any kind of outward improvement or cultivation; neither is it only a mere change or con version without life. Regeneration is a rebirth which brings in a new life. It is absolutely a matter of life, not a matter of doing. Regeneration is simply to have a life other than the life we already have. We have already received the human life from our parents; now we need to receive the divine life from God. Hence, regeneration means to have the divine life of God in addition to the human life which we already possess. Therefore, regeneration requires another birth in order to possess another life. To be regenerated, to be born again, does not mean to adjust or correct ourselves. It means to have the life of God, just as to be born of our parents means to have the life of our parents. To be regenerated is to be born of God (John 1:13), and to be born of God is to have the life of God, that is, the eternal life (3:15-16). If we have the life of God, we are the sons of God. The life of God gives us the right to become the sons of God (John 1:12), because by this life we have the divine nature of God (2Pet. 1:4) and have the life-relationship with God, that is, the sonship (Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:56).<h2 class=head2>A. Man&#8217;s and Religion&#8217;s False Concept-the Need of Better Teaching to Improve Man</h2><p>Due to human culture and the Jewish religion, Nicodemus thought that man needed to behave. Since man must have good conduct and worship God in a proper way, man needs much teaching. Nicodemus considered Christ to be a teacher come from God. This indicates that he might have thought that he needed better teachings to improve himself. But the Lord&#8217;s answer in the following verse unveiled to him that his need was to be born anew. To be born anew is to be regenerated with the divine life, a life other than the human life received by natural birth. Hence, his real need was not better teachings, but the divine life. Nicodemus was seeking for teachings, which belong to the tree of knowledge, but the Lord&#8217;s answer turned him to the need of life, which belongs to the tree of life (cf. Gen. 2:9-17). The Lord told Nicodemus very emphatically that what he needed was to be born again. Thus, man&#8217;s real need is to be regenerated with another life. All of us must realize that what we need is not religion or teaching to regulate and correct us, but another life, the life of God, to regenerate us. Man needs regeneration because he needs the divine life. Regardless of how good you are, you still do not have the life of God. You need another birth in order to receive the life of God with His divine nature. Although you may feel that you are good, you must admit that you do not have the life of God with His divine nature. Another birth, regeneration, is necessary that you may receive another life, the divine life of God.<p>The Lord&#8217;s answer to Nicodemus cut across his human, traditional, religious concept. The Lord seemed to be telling Nicodemus, &#8220;Nicodemus, what you need is not teaching, but another life. Regardless of how good you are, you have only the human life. You need the divine life. Nicodemus, don&#8217;t you realize that by seeking knowledge you are on the line of the tree of knowledge? You are not on the line of the tree of life.&#8221; Nicodemus was not on the line that would lead him to the New Jerusalem, but on the line that would take him to the lake of fire. Nicodemus, however, did not know that he was partaking of the wrong tree.<h2 class=head2>B. Man&#8217;s Real Need-To Be Born Anew</h2><h2 class=head3>1. Not to Enter the Mother&#8217;s Womb and Be Born Again</h2><p>When Nicodemus heard that he had to be born anew, he thought that this meant that he had to go back to his mother&#8217;s womb and come out again. His answer proves that he did not know how to exercise his spirit. He misunderstood the Lord&#8217;s word. Then the Lord Jesus said that that which is born of the flesh is flesh. He seemed to be saying to Nicodemus, &#8220;Regardless of the number of times you go back into your mother&#8217;s womb and come out again, you still will be flesh. That which is born of the flesh is flesh. Nicodemus, there is no need for you to say that you can&#8217;t go back to your mother&#8217;s womb and be born a second time, for even if you could do it, you would still be the same. Even if you could be born anew in that way and be young again, after another sixty or seventy years you would be the same as you are now. You do not need that kind of rebirth.&#8221; Nicodemus did not need another birth in time, but another birth in nature.<h2 class=head3>2. But to Be Born of Water and the Spirit</h2><p>&#8220;Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God&#8221; (John 3:5). Water is the central sign of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to bury and terminate people of the old creation. In his ministry, John the Baptist came to baptize with water. He told people that they had to repent and realize that they were fallen and good for nothing except burial. Everyone who heard John&#8217;s preaching and repented was baptized in water. This means that, as fallen men of the old creation, they were being terminated. That was John&#8217;s ministry. Furthermore, John told people that his ministry was for the ministry of the Lord Jesus. As water is the central sign in the ministry of John the Baptist, Spirit is the central significance of the ministry of Jesus, that is, to germinate people in the new creation. These two main concepts, water and Spirit, when put together, are the whole concept of the matter of regeneration. Regeneration, to be born anew, is the termination of the people of the old creation with all their deeds, and their germination in the new creation with the divine life. What does it mean to be born again? It means to be terminated by John&#8217;s ministry through water and to be germinated by Jesus&#8217; ministry through the Spirit.<p>How can we have the ministry of John the Baptist today? We have it by repentance. Whenever a person repents, confessing that he is a fallen being who is good for nothing, that is the acceptance of John&#8217;s ministry. There is no need, of course, for John literally to be present, for his ministry is in the New Testament already. When we preach the gospel, we firstly preach the ministry of John. That is why we preach very much about sin and repentance. Whoever accepts this ministry, in one sense, is terminated, and, in another sense, is born of water. Following repentance, everyone must believe in the Lord Jesus and accept His ministry of life in order to be germinated. In order to accept salvation, we need both repentance and faith. To repent is to receive John&#8217;s ministry, and to believe is to accept the ministry of the Lord Jesus. This is regeneration. Now we understand what it means to be born of water and of the Spirit.<p>The Lord made Nicodemus&#8217;s situation very clear to him. Everyone, whether he is good or bad, needs to be terminated through water and then germinated with the divine life. This is the second birth, a birth not of the mother&#8217;s womb, but of water and of the Spirit.<sup>3</sup><h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO BE REGENERATED</h2><p>What is the way for us to be regenerated? How can we receive regeneration? In verses 15, 16, 18, and 36, the Lord said, &#8220;That everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life&#8221;; &#8220;that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life"; &#8220;he who believes in Him is not judged&#8221;; &#8220;he who believes in the Son has eternal life.&#8221; These emphatic words spoken repeatedly by the Lord tell us clearly and definitely that the way for us to be saved and regenerated is simply to believe in the Lord. To believe is the only way for us to receive salvation and regeneration. It is absolutely a matter of faith. Regardless of how much we can work or how good our work may be, we cannot be saved and regenerated by our work. Our work does not count in this matter. Only faith counts. Salvation and regeneration must be by faith. It is by faith in the Lord, by believing in the Lord, that we receive forgiveness, the release from God&#8217;s condemnation negatively. It is also by faith, by believing in the Lord, that we receive eternal life, the divine life of God, positively for our regeneration. The Lord has accomplished the redemptive work for us. By His redemptive death on the cross, He has met all of God&#8217;s righteous demands on us and has fulfilled all the requirements of God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, and glory for us. By His death on the cross in the form of the serpent, the Lord has even destroyed Satan, the devil who usurps us and enslaves us, that we might be delivered from the evil one&#8217;s slavery and power of death (Heb. 2:14). All negative things have been solved by His all-inclusive death on the cross. We do not need to do anything except believe in what the Lord has accomplished. He has dealt with and solved all of our problems. He has left no room for our doing or work. So, there is no need of our work, only of faith in His finished, completed, and all-inclusive redemptive work.<p>After passing through death, by and in resurrection, the Lord has released His life and has become a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Now, in resurrection, He is the Spirit of life (2 Cor. 3:17), with all the virtue of His redemptive work, waiting for us to believe in Him. Once we believe in Him, we not only receive the forgiveness of sins and the deliverance from Satan&#8217;s evil power of darkness, but we also receive the Spirit of life, that is, the Lord Himself, with the eternal life of God. In this way we are saved and regenerated. It is by the way of believing in the Lord with His all-inclusive redemptive work that we receive God&#8217;s life and are born of Him to be His sons.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO BELIEVE</h2><p>To believe in the Lord means to receive Him (John 1:12). The Lord is receivable. He is now the life-giving Spirit, with His complete redemption, waiting for and expecting us to receive Him. Our spirit is the receiving organ. We can receive the Lord&#8217;s Spirit into our spirit by believing in Him. Once we believe in Him, He, as the Spirit, enters into our spirit. Then we are regenerated by Him, the life-giving Spirit, and become one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). The phrase &#8220;believes in&#8221; in verses 16, 18, and 36literally translated should be &#8220;believes into.&#8221; When we believe in the Lord, we believe into Him. By believing in Him, we get into Him to be one with Him, to partake of Him, and to participate in all that He has accomplished for us. By believing into Him, we are identified with Him in all that He is and in all that He has passed through, accomplished, attained, and obtained. As we become one with Him by believing into Him, we are saved and regenerated by Him as life. It is by believing into Him that we partake of Him as life and are regenerated in Him.<sup>4</sup><p>If you have not yet received the Lord into you, you can receive Him now. Please pray the following simple prayer:<p>&#8220;Lord Jesus! I am a sinner. I need You. Come into my spirit. Take away my sins. Fill me that I may have the life of God. I receive You right now as my Savior and life. I give myself to You. I ask this in Jesus&#8217; name. Amen!&#8221;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2 class=head1>SOURCE</h2><p><sup>1</sup>Life-study of John, Message One, p. 13.<br><sup>2</sup>Life-study of John, Message Two, p. 25.<br><sup>3</sup>Life-study of John, Message Eight, pp. 91-102.<br><sup>4</sup>Life-study of John, Message Nine, pp. 116-118.<br><p>By Witness Lee, published by Living Stream Ministry.</p><h1 class=msg>The Way to Experience God in the Gospel of John</h1><h2 class=head1>THE WORD, THE FLESH, AND THE BREATH</h2><p>In the Gospel of John, there are three wonderful words. In the first chapter, the first verse, we read, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word.&#8221; So we have the Word. Then in the same chapter there is another word, flesh. &#8220;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us&#8221; (v. 14). Then at the end of the book, in chapter twenty, we have breath. Jesus, the resurrected One, breathed on the disciples and told them to receive the Holy Spirit (v. 22). &#8220;Spirit&#8221; in Greek means &#8220;breath.&#8221; So, here it can be rendered &#8220;breath.&#8221; He breathed upon the disciples and told them to receive the holy breath. So we have three words: the Word, the flesh, and the breath. The Word was God, the flesh is man, and the breath is the Spirit.<p>The Gospel of John is a wonderful book. In the beginning, in eternity, there was God who was the Word. But on the earth, in time, He became a man who was flesh. Then from chapter one to chapter twenty we see a man as the flesh who was the Lamb of God that took away the sin of the world (1:29). With Him there is incarnation, crucifixion (including redemption), resurrection, and ascension. Then eventually, He came back to the disciples to do simply one thing: to breathe on them and ask them to receive Him as the breath. This is the end of this book. In the beginning was the Word, and at the end is the breath. And in this breath everything is included.<p>Just consider again the whole Gospel of John. In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God, and the Word was made flesh to be the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world. He accomplished redemption by crucifixion, and He was buried and resurrected. Did He become a great Lord to sit on the throne for man to bow down to worship Him? Is this in the Gospel of John? No! Jesus in the Gospel of John is not like this. In the beginning was the Word and the Word was made flesh, and eventually the flesh was resurrected to be the breath for us to breathe in.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE BREATH</h2><p>Read the Gospel of John again. It is wonderful. In the beginning was the Word, the Word was made flesh, and the flesh was resurrected to become a breath. Then He came back to the disciples, not as a great giant asking everyone to bow down to worship Him, but in a very silent way. All of a sudden He was there, and nobody knew how He came in (20:19). He was just there. And He did not tell them to do this or to do that. He did something rather unusual. He breathed on them. He simply breathed on them and told them to receive the holy breath. That is all.<p>He did not tell the disciples, &#8220;I am the Son of God, and I have been resurrected; so you must do this to glorify Me, and you must do that to magnify Me.&#8221; He did not tell them to do anything. He just breathed on them and told them to receive the holy breath. That was good enough, because everything is included in that breath.<p>From that time He was never absent from them. He came, but He never left, because now He, as the holy breath, was within all the disciples. This is the Gospel of John. I am afraid most Christians know the beginning of John, but they are not clear about the ending of John.<p>The beginning of this book is something very high, very profound, and very great. &#8220;In the beginning was the Word and the Word...was God&#8221; (1:1). Everything that was made was made through Him, and in Him was life, and this life was the light of men (vv. 3-4). But at the end the disciples went fishing (21:3). And while they were fishing, this wonderful One also was there. Just compare the two ends of this book. The beginning is very high, but the ending seems very low.<p>But the secret, the mystery of Christ, is with these seemingly foolish ones. To them He was just like the breath. That is all. After all that He accomplished in this Gospel, He was just the breath. This is the third stage of Christ.<p>In the first stage He was God. In the second stage He was man as the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption. But in the third stage He is simply the breath. This is why it is rather hard for people to realize Him.<p>We all know Christ in the first and second stages, but we do not know Him properly and accurately in the third stage. You may say, &#8220;Well, I have heard that there is the Holy Spirit, and that Christ is in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; You have heard this, but we must know more adequately that Christ is not only in the Spirit, but Christ is the Spirit. &#8220;And the Lord is the Spirit&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:17). He is the Spirit, the breath, the air. He is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45).<h2 class=head1>THE INDWELLING BREATH</h2><p>If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit, who is as available as breath or air, how could He be in us? If Christ were not the spiritual breath, the heavenly air, how could He be our life? Christ is in the heavens, and we are on the earth. How could something in the heavens be our life? If anything is to be our life, it must be in us.<p>In the beginning of this Gospel we see the Word expressing and explaining God. But this Word was made flesh in order to accomplish redemption and remove all the barriers that God may come into man. Now He is not only the Word, but also the Word plus the flesh-God plus man.<p>But this is not all. He must come into man in order to be his life. How can He do this? There is no other way but to be resurrected and be made a life-giving Spirit, just like breath or air. The air fills the whole earth. Wherever we go, the air is waiting for us to breathe it in.<p>This is the Gospel of John. This book eventually brings us to the point of this wonderful Christ being so available, even like the air that we breathe. It is very easy for Him to get into us, because He is the air. Since He is the breath, we may simply breathe Him in. Now in this spiritual breath we have God, man, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Everything is included in this heavenly air. It is wonderful and so all-inclusive.<sup>1</sup><h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO EXPERIENCE GOD</h2><p>The way to experience God begins in John chapter four. In verse 24 the Lord said, &#8220;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&#8221; To worship God is to contact God, to enjoy God, and to partake of all He is. Worshipping God is a matter of taking God into us. It is not merely objective, but also subjective. This is proved by the fact that in this chapter the Lord speaks, on the one hand, about worship and, on the other hand, about drinking the living water (v. 14). If we put verses 14 and 24 together, we shall see that to drink of the living water is to worship God. Moreover, worshipping God by our spirit and in our spirit is the real drinking of the living water, which is God Himself. God Himself is the Spirit, and this Spirit is the living water. We drink this living water by worshipping God. Hence, drinking of God and worshipping Him are synonymous. We all must drink the very God, who is the living water, the Spirit.<p>Another aspect of the way is unveiled in chapter six. In verse 48the Lord said, &#8220;I am the bread of life,&#8221; and in verse 57 He said, &#8220;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&#8221; The way is not only to drink God as the living water, but also to eat Christ, the embodiment of God, as the living bread. The Lord&#8217;s word about eating Him was offensive to the religious people, and they could not bear it (v. 60). In verse 63 the Lord said to His disciples, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&#8221; The Lord seemed to be saying, &#8220;I am the bread of life. But I can be dispensed into you as your life supply only through the living Word. This living Word is the Spirit.&#8221; Thus, we must not contact the living Word as the black and white letters; we must contact the living Word as the living Spirit by exercising our spirit. Thus, the way to experience Christ is to contact the very God, who is the Spirit, and to eat and drink of Him.<h2 class=head1>THE OVERFLOW</h2><p>If we truly contact the Lord and eat and drink of Him, we shall have the overflow spoken of in 7:37 and 38. On the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles Jesus stood and cried out, saying, &#8220;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water." What an overflow! Whoever believes in Him will have an overflow of rivers of living water. The water the believers take in of Christ will become overflowing rivers.<p>If you have such an overflow, could you help but love the Lord? Could you still live in sin and continue to love the world? This would be impossible. There is no need to strive to overcome sin and the world. There is not even any need to try to love the Lord. In fact, there is no need for us to do anything. Because we realize that the Triune God has been wrought into our being, and that we have been constituted with His riches and have become parts of Him, something naturally and spontaneously will flow out of us.<sup>2</sup><h2 class=head1>DRINKING, EATING, AND BREATHING</h2><p>If we consider these various items covered in John, we realize how vital they are for our existence. Without drinking, eating, and breathing we could not live.<p>These three means for our physical existence are all used by the Lord Jesus to illustrate how we may take Him. He is our water, more refreshing than the best earthly drink. We must drink Him!<p>He is our bread. We must eat Him! Bread is not merely to be looked at. Its purpose is to be eaten. Christ as the living bread must be eaten. Do not think that to say this is uncultured and wild. He says Himself that we must eat Him.<p>He is our breath, imparting Himself as life to us. We must breathe Him!<p>This enjoyment of Jesus is God&#8217;s economy. It is this that He would recover among His people. Jesus is the living water, the living bread, and the living breath. We must drink of Him, eat Him, and breathe Him.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO TAKE CHRIST IN</h2><p>There are two ways by which we may drink, eat, and breathe Jesus. These are the Word and the Spirit. &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&#8221; (John 6:63). This verse mentions both the Word and the Spirit. The very Word revealed in John 1:1 eventually became the Spirit. It is this Spirit who is the water, the bread, and the breath.<p>John 20:22 reads, &#8220;Receive the Holy pneuma.&#8221; This Greek word pneuma may be translated either as &#8220;spirit&#8221; or as &#8220;breath.&#8221; It is equally correct to say, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; or &#8220;Receive the holy breath.&#8221; The Spirit today is our breath. This breath is Jesus, the incarnate Word who went to the cross, entered into resurrection, and ascended to the heavens. He then returned to us as the life-giving Spirit.<p>We have the Word outside us and the Spirit inside us. Day by day we must come to the Word, not only with our mind but also with our heart and spirit. As we open the Bible, we must open our whole being. We must read not only with our understanding but also with prayer. The Bible is not an ordinary book. In this holy Word there is life, the Spirit, God, and Jesus Christ. These are all contained in the Word and are conveyed to us as we open ourselves and pray. This prayerful reading of the Word is the eating, drinking, and breathing in of the Lord.<p>How would you answer if someone asked you where God is? Do not say that God is in the heavens. Heaven is too far away. How could one get there to find Him? God, you must tell him, is in the Bible. Where is Christ? He too is in the Word. Where is the Spirit? Where is life? The answer to these questions is also &#8220;in the Word.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>SPENDING TIME IN THE WORD</h2><p>Spend time with this book. Besides your ten minutes in the morning, take a few more minutes at noon, and a few more in the evening. As you open this book, open yourself also. Read, understand, and pray. As you pray, you are drinking the water, eating the food, and breathing the air. You will grow. The more you take Christ into you in this way, the more Christ you will have growing in you. You will become another person. Do not expect quick results; growth takes time. It does not come about from a few concentrated days of praying and fasting and then having something fall upon you from the heavens. Take time to water the little seed of life sown into the soil of your heart. Not only will you grow; the church will also grow and be built up in this way. In the church meetings Christ will come forth in the teaching, the preaching, and the testifying. Such riches in the church life will convince and attract new ones.<h2 class=head1>REGULAR GROWTH</h2><p>Do not be concerned about how much you understand of what you read. What matters is that you faithfully open the Word, open yourself, and read and pray. This is not a once-for-all procedure. It is not like being born, but like breathing. Growth, like breathing, is continual, day by day and even minute by minute. You will grow by coming regularly to the Word. Carry a pocket version of the Word with you. Wherever you are, when you have a few minutes, open it and read a chapter or so, then pray over what you have read. There is little need for you to pray over your grades at school, or for your business to be successful, or for guidance when you go shopping. Simply pray the Word. In this way you will receive and enjoy God Himself.<h2 class=head1>PRAYING THE WORD</h2><p>What do you think makes you healthy and strong? It is by eating, drinking, and breathing. When it gets close to meal time you probably feel weak; you need to eat to regain your energy. The same is true spiritually. You are weak if you have not been eating, drinking, and breathing Christ in the Word. In fact, it is a mercy that you are still here. Do not try to run the race without food, drink, and air any longer! Come to the Word. Open to the Lord. Speak to Him the words you read. For example, you may pray the words of John 1:14 and 16: &#8220;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. Lord, thank You, You are the Word. You became flesh. Thank You that You tabernacled among us. Among us! Amen. Full of grace. Hallelujah, grace! Grace and reality. Amen, grace and reality! Of His fullness we have all received. We have all received. We have received, Lord, and we are receiving even now. Praise the Lord!&#8221; Does praying the Word in this way seem like foolishness to you? I tell you, it is the way to eat, drink, and breathe Christ. This is how we can live Christ, rather than living morality or ethics. Read and pray the Word!<sup>3</sup></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2 class=head1>SOURCE</h2><p><sup>1</sup>The Stream, pp. 20-22.<br><sup>2</sup>Life-study of John, Message Fifty-one, pp. 609-612.<br><sup>3</sup>Life Messages, pp. 22-26.<br>By Witness Lee, published by Living Stream Ministry.</p></body></html>
