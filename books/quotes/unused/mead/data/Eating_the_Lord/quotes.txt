[1]  CONTENTS The Bible Being a Book of Eating The Lord Being for Man to Eat Coming to the Feast and Keeping the Feast Two Kinds of Eating Eating in Sowing and Eating in Harvesting
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE BIBLE BEING A BOOK OF EATING Scripture Reading: Gen 2:8-9, 16; Exo 12:6-8; Deut 12:6-7; 15:19-20; 16:10-11, 15; John 6:35, 57, 63; Rev 22:2, 14 THE BIBLE A BOOK OF EATING
[3]  GENESIS GOD'S DESIRE BEING FOR MAN TO EAT THE TREE OF LIFE
[4]  What does the Bible speak about from beginning to end?
[5]  All those who know the Bible acknowledge that there is a principle in the Bible: The way a certain thing is spoken of the first time in the Bible record becomes the immutable meaning of that thing in its later development.
[6]  Therefore, if we want to know the proper relationship between God and man, we have to see what God wanted man to do after He created him.
[7]  The verses we read in Deuteronomy 15 say that the firstborn ox should not be put to work and the firstborn sheep should not be shorn; instead, they should be eaten vv.
[8]  Did you know that every day you want the Lord Jesus to till the ground for you?
[9]  In the book of Deuteronomy, you see all kinds of produce as different kinds of offerings for the people of Israel to bring before God.
[10]  CHAPTER TWO THE LORD BEING FOR MAN TO EAT Scripture Reading: Matt 15:21-28; Luke 14:15-16; 15:22-24; 1 Cor 3:2; 1 Pet 2:2 READING THE BIBLE TO TOUCH THE LIFE IN IT
[11]  When we read the Bible, we need to say to the Lord from our innermost being, "Lord, get rid of my concepts; remove my veils that I may see the pure light in Your Word and touch the pure feelings in You."
[12]  Why is it that when we read the Bible, all we can see is that we need to serve the Lord, to labor for the Lord, to be zealous for the Lord, and to do this or that for the Lord?
[13]  THE LORD BECOMING SMALL ENOUGH TO ENTER INTO US
[14]  Brothers and sisters, you have to see the significance of this case.
[15]  People invariably address the Lord Jesus according to their religious concepts, regarding Him as a great man.
[16]  The Canaanite woman came to ask the Lord to do something for her.
[17]  CHAPTER THREE COMING TO THE FEAST AND KEEPING THE FEAST Scripture Reading: Matt 22:2-4; 1 Cor 10:17-21; 11:23; 5:7-8; Rev 3:20-21; 19:7-9 TO RECEIVE THE GOSPEL BEING TO COME TO THE FEAST
[18]  In the New Testament we see that in His salvation the Lord pays attention to the matter of eating.
[19]  I truly wish that you would read and pray over these verses again and again; then you will see that if this matter of eating were not so important, it would not be repeated over and over again in the New Testament.
[20]  THE BREAKING OF BREAD MEETING BEING THE LORD'S FEAST
[21]  Why do we have the breaking of bread meeting frequently?
[22]  We daily eat the Lord, drink the Lord, and enjoy the Lord; therefore, we now come together to testify to the whole universe that we are a group of people who eat, drink, and enjoy the Lord.
[23]  We thank the Lord that now we all are learning to eat the Lord.
[24]  However, according to the revelation in Deuteronomy, there are many particular points in the matter of eating, drinking, and enjoying the Lord.
[25]  On the one hand, the Lord is the bread of life, and we simply need to eat Him.
[26]  On the other hand, according to Deuteronomy 12, 14, and 15, the Lord Jesus, whom we eat, comes out of our laboring; He is produced from our sowing of the field and from our raising of the herd and the flock.
[27]  When you call, "O Lord," and the Lord gives you a sense that you have offended your wife, if you would quickly confess your sins before the Lord and also go to your wife to admit your failure and ask her for forgiveness, then the seed in you will grow very fast.
[28]  A COMPARISON BETWEEN MANNA AND THE PRODUCE OF CANAAN
[29]  ACCEPTING THE DEALINGS IN OUR LIFE TO HAVE A RICH HARVEST
[30]  To obtain manna does not require our laboring, but to get the produce of the land of Canaan does.
[31]  While we are enjoying the Lord and receiving Him into us, He often raises up circumstances and allows many things to happen for our good, so that the seed in us can grow and produce something.
[32]  Let me tell you that all those things that happen are the Lord's raising up the north wind to blow upon you S. S. 4:16 . Instead of asking the Lord to change your husband, pray that the Lord will grow in you: "O Lord, make me willing to accept Your dealing.
[33]  I feel that the great lack we have today in the matter of bringing Christ to the meetings is that our harvest is not rich.
[34]  This is why sometimes when you come to testify, you try to use some gimmicks.
[35]  I am not saying that you should refrain from all kinds of methods, but I am afraid that you have these without content.
