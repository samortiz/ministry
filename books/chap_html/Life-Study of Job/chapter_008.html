Whereas Job was very strong in character and was not easily subdued, Zophar was foolish, not clear in the divine revelation concerning God's economy of dispensing Himself into His people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. JOB'S UNYIELDINGNESS</H2><P>Job's unyieldingness is fully shown in chapters nine and ten.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Boasting in Knowing What His Friends Knew</H2><P>Job boasted in knowing what his friends knew, saying, "I do indeed know that it is so" (9:2a). Job was saying that he already knew what his friends were talking about and that they did not need to speak any more about it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Admitting That He Could Not<br>Contend with God and Resist Him</H2><P>Job admitted that he could not contend with God and resist Him, because He is wise and mighty (vv. 3-12). In verses 5 through 9 Job alluded to God's judgment upon the preadamic universe. After asking how a man can be righteous before God, Job said, "If he is pleased to contend with Him,/He cannot answer Him one thing in a thousand./He is wise in heart and mighty in strength&#151;/Who has ever resisted Him and come through whole?" (vv. 3-4). No one can stop God or say to Him, "What are You doing?" (v. 12).</P>
