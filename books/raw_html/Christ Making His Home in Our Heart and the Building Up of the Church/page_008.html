<h1 class="title">WHAT IS REGENERATION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THAT WHICH IS BORN OF THE SPIRIT BEING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>John 3:3-8 is a record concerning regeneration: &ldquo;Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born, can he? Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born anew. The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must pay special attention to verses 3, 5, and 6. Verse 3 says, &ldquo;Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Then verse 5 says, &ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Verse 5 is an explanation of what was said in verse 3. Verse 3 mentions being born anew, and verse 5 explains what is involved in being born anew. To be born anew, to be regenerated, is to be born of water and the Spirit. When one is born of water and the Spirit, he is regenerated, born again.</p>
<p>The second half of verse 3 says, &ldquo;He cannot see the kingdom of God,&rdquo; and verse 5 explains that &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; is &ldquo;entering.&rdquo; To see the kingdom of God is to enter into the kingdom of God. In spiritual matters, seeing is equivalent to entering. As soon as you see a certain spiritual matter, you enter into that matter. To look at it from another perspective, only those who have entered can see. Hence, to see the kingdom of God is to enter into the kingdom of God, and to enter into the kingdom of God is to see the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Verse 5 explains what is said in verse 3, and verse 6 is a conclusion and summary: &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; These three verses are very precious. Every believer must be able to memorize at least these three verses. Until this day, I can still remember what I memorized before I was twenty-nine years old. While you are still young, learn to memorize the Scriptures. The younger you are, the easier it is for you to memorize. You do not have to memorize the Scriptures chapter by chapter; however, you must memorize the important and precious verses. All the verses in these messages are very important. You should memorize all of them. If you are willing to take the time and make the effort to memorize them, they will make an eternal impression within you and will become a fountain in you to gush out a rich, inexhaustible supply for the rest of your life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REGENERATION BEING TO HAVE GOD&rsquo;S LIFE<br />
IN ADDITION TO MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>Now we will see what regeneration is. Regeneration means to be born again, that is, to obtain the life of God in addition to man&rsquo;s life. Even if man did not fall, he would still need God&rsquo;s life in addition to his own life. This means that a person must have two lives: his own human life and God&rsquo;s life. One life is a created life, and the other is an uncreated life. One life is bound by time, and the other life occupies eternity; it is a life that transcends time and space.</p>
<p>Man not only needs to be saved; he also needs a second life. Today Christianity presents the gospel at a low level. Christianity gives people the impression that they need salvation because they are sinful and destined to perish. Actually, we need God&rsquo;s salvation because we need God to be our life. It is not enough for us to have only our human life; we need God&rsquo;s life. It is not enough for us to be born once; we need to be born a second time. This second birth is regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BORN OF WATER AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>According to the record in John 3, initially Nicodemus thought that to be born again was to enter into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born a second time. However, he could not understand how he could enter into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born again. Hence, the Lord Jesus added an explanation. He told Nicodemus, &ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God&rdquo; (v. 5). To be born again does not mean that a person is born from his mother&rsquo;s womb a second time; rather, it means that a person is born of water and the Spirit.</p>
<p>What do water and the Spirit refer to? When I was young, I read many books concerning this matter, and there are many views. Most of the books said that water denotes the Word and that to be born of water and the Spirit means to be born of the Word and the Spirit. Others said that water denotes something else. We need to carefully consider what it means to be born of water and the Spirit.</p>
