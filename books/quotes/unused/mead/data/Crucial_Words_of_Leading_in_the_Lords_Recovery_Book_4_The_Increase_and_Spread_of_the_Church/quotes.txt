[1]  Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 4:
[2]  Prayer: Lord, we confess that we are still corrupt; hence, we need the cleansing of Your precious blood.
[3]  Lord, we are all willing to open to You; we pray that You would bring us into Yourself so that we may behold Your glorious face in the Holy of Holies.
[4]  God created a man, who became old, and He also prepared a man, who became new.
[5]  In man s eyes there have been thousands upon thousands of people after Adam, including Abel, Seth, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and David.
[6]  In God s eyes, however, there have been only two men throughout the history of man: Adam is the first man and Christ is the second man.
[7]  When I began to serve the Lord, I worked in Chefoo and then went to Shanghai, the largest city in China.
[8]  In May 1949, there was a strong wind from the Lord to go to Taiwan.
[9]  When I looked at the outward conditions then, I did not know why the Lord sent me to Taiwan.
[10]  According to the history of the past two to three hundred years, one out of every twenty believers can be sent out for the gospel, while the remaining nineteen are responsible for supplying his material needs.
[11]  If the condition of the church is very good, one out of every ten can be sent out.
[12]  Recently, the elders in the churches in California met and fellowshipped, and they considered that since there are fifteen hundred saints there, one hundred fifty saints should migrate to other places, and that it would be best if they could support themselves financially.
[13]  According to the principle of one out of every twenty, the church in Taipei, which has five thousand saints, should send out two hundred fifty saints.
[14]  If each of the remaining saints would offer five percent of their income to supply the daily needs of those who are sent out for the gospel, there would be more than enough to meet the needs.
[15]  Through the Economical Spirit Whom the Lord Poured Out upon His Body in His Ascension
[16]  Many Bible readers pay attention only to the receiving of power in the first part of Acts 1:8, but they overlook the part concerning being His witnesses.
[17]  This part is related to being the Lord s propagation unto the uttermost part of the earth.
[18]  The economical Spirit of power is not for our personal living and enjoyment but for God s economy.
[19]  It is only when we enter into God s economy by going out to work for His economy that we can enjoy the economical Spirit.
[20]  I absolutely believe that if some are willing to receive a burden to spread the Lord s propagation as His martyrs and witnesses, they will surely experience the economical Spirit being poured out upon them so that they can testify for the Lord.
[21]  To further the spread of His propagation and because of the faithfulness of the apostles, God caused signs and wonders to accompany them 2:43; 5:12, 15-16; 13:12; 19:11-12 .
[22]  This is not a matter of seeking for signs and wonders; rather, we should believe that signs and wonders from God will accompany us when necessary.
[23]  In the previous chapter we pointed out that the knowledge of the truth and growth in life are for the church s increase and spread.
[24]  The book of Acts not only records the facts related to the church s increase and spread; it also shows four important means of the church s increase and spread.
[25]  The first means is the economical Spirit, the Spirit of power, descending on the lovers of the Lord 1:8; 2:2-4 .
[26]  The Lord can have a way on the earth only through the Spirit of God, through the prayer of the saints, through God s word, through the believers homes, and through living witnesses who are martyrs.
[27]  This is a family matter and a family discussion.
[28]  In 1980 I began to notice that the condition of the church in Taipei was at a standstill.
[29]  Whenever I saw the responsible brothers, I would raise this issue and say, The church in Taipei should not be like this, having no advancement at all.
[30]  Just like a boat that is in a current, the church will either advance or be pushed back; the church must always advance.
[31]  Therefore, after studying our situation, we realize that there is still a need for joint meetings in the church life, which are in the nature of school education, and for small group meetings, which are in the nature of home nurturing.
[32]  Furthermore, if we continue to recover the saints who have not been meeting for some time, the number in the Lord s Day meeting in the church in Taipei will surpass ten thousand.
[33]  If there are five thousand saints meeting in the church in Taipei, there needs to be at least five hundred small groups; if the number of people meeting increases to ten thousand, then we need to form one thousand small groups.
[34]  Based on Acts 2:46, 5:42, and 20:20, small groups met from house to house.
[35]  These three verses show that the church life of the saints in Jerusalem was mainly in the homes; the homes were the base.
[36]  This is not something we invented; we discovered this by reading the Bible, and now we are presenting it to you.
[37]  Since the Bible speaks of these four things, we should study how to break bread, pray, teach the truth, and preach the gospel from house to house.
[38]  Since any plan involves the church corporately, every member must contribute his or her part, including how many people to bring to the Lord each year and how to bring them in. Everything should be planned; we should not lack focus, expressing agreement with the church but returning home to sleep in peace.
[39]  ACCORDING TO LAW MAKING A PLAN BASED ON ACTUAL RESOURCES
[40]  We must have a proper understanding regarding the making of a plan.
[41]  The phrase there was evening and there was morning is used repeatedly in the record of God s creation Gen 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31 .
[42]  This refers to a schedule in God s creation.
[43]  CARRYING OUT THE LAW OF FRUIT-BEARING ACCORDING TO A SET TIME
[44]  As branches of the Lord, bearing fruit is also a matter of law.
[45]  Over the last sixty years, it has been our practice for the Lord s table to be a joint meeting on the Lord s Day.
[46]  The Lord s table meeting is the most important meeting of the church, and it is highly regarded by all believers.
[47]  The first law of the increase of the church is that Christ and the church are a universal vine as the organism of the Triune God, and the believers, as the branches of this vine, are in an organic union with the Triune God.
[48]  In John 15:5 the Lord spoke of a law for the increase and propagation of the church, saying, I am the vine; you are the branches.
[49]  These charges from the Lord show that leading people to salvation through the preaching of the gospel is not merely an outward activity; it is related also to life, showing that the increase and propagation of the church comes out of the operation of the law of life.
[50]  When we go forth to preach the gospel, we need the faith and realization that we are in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus and that we have His authority, because we are organically joined to Him.
[51]  According to John 15, we need to bear fruit.
[52]  Nevertheless, we must realize that the way to lead people to salvation is not merely to lead them to believe and be baptized; it also involves infusing them with the riches that we have received and experienced through the Spirit so that the divine life can grow in them.
[53]  If a person is not saved, does not love the Lord, does not walk in the will of God, and does not bear fruit according to God s will, in God s eyes the time of his life has been wasted.
[54]  In order for the church to increase and spread, there must be a plan.
[55]  The plan for a church should be based on the condition of the believers spiritual life, the social conditions in the church s locality, and the relationship between the believers and those in various social classes.
[56]  CHAPTER FIVE FORMING SMALL GROUPS OUR MEETINGS BEING LIKE OUR HOME LIFE
[57]  We should not imitate the practice of Christianity in our meetings.
[58]  For over thirty years we have encouraged the brothers and sisters to exercise their spirit and to function in the meetings.
[59]  The first realm of our life is our family; the second realm is our meetings.
[60]  When we meet, we should not follow Christianity by keeping religious rituals.
[61]  In a small group we particularly need to avoid pleasures and celebrations.
[62]  When the saints come to the small group gathering in our home, it is normal for our heart to be full of joy.
[63]  CHAPTER SIX THE FUNCTION OF THE SMALL GROUP A FEW MATTERS REGARDING
[64]  Concerning the formation of small groups, a few points need to be explained clearly.
[65]  First, a small group is the gathering of a small number of neighboring believers; it is not a unit of organization.
[66]  In order for a country to be strong, there is the need for strong family units because only strong families can produce strong young people.
[67]  In addition to the nurturing in the family, there is a need for education.
[68]  The way to have the small group gatherings involves six items.
[69]  Second, a small group must hold fast to the fellowship of the apostles.
[70]  First John 1:3 says, That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
[71]  In conclusion, when we study the Bible, we can see that the way to have a small group involves six items: speaking according to the apostles teaching, living in the unique fellowship of the apostles, breaking bread to enjoy the Lord with both love and honor, praying to meet the needs of the saints and the church and for His will to be done, preaching the gospel, and learning the truth and teaching the truth for the edification of others.
[72]  OF A SMALL GROUP READING THE BIBLE IN A LIVING WAY
[73]  In the church life we need to read the Bible in a living way; this requires practice.
[74]  According to our observation of the present condition of the small groups, if there are twelve people in a group, two or three of them may be strong and exercised.
[75]  The other brothers and sisters may have little or no understanding of the teaching and fellowship of the apostles or even of the significance of the small groups.
[76]  If we open to the Lord faithfully, the Spirit of the Lord will lead us to be a member who supplies others.
[77]  Even an elderly sister, who has been saved for many years and who also loves the Lord dearly, can function to supply others with grace.
[78]  We need to believe that the Lord s grace is with us, and we must rise up to faithfully and diligently to offer our portion.
[79]  We all love the Lord and are willing to pay the price because we have a heart; however, we need to take a further step to bear this burden faithfully.
[80]  The arrangement of the small groups allows everyone to function according to his or her measure.
[81]  Today the Lord s grace is with His recovery, and the Lord is continually bestowing grace on His churches.
[82]  Now the Lord is leading us in a further step to initiate small groups in the church in Taipei.
[83]  In this chapter we will consider a point that is crucial to the small groups.
[84]  Since the number of saints in the church in Taipei typically makes up half of the total number of saints in the churches in Taiwan, there should be more than one hundred ten thousand saints in Taiwan.
[85]  Third, we should focus on the preaching of the gospel.
[86]  We not only need to sustain and retain our existing saints and recover dormant saints, we also need to preach the gospel.
[87]  Concerning these three matters, we should not focus only on the first matter with the thought that it must be completed before we address the second matter.
[88]  However, since we have not been adequately trained and lack exercise and practice, we are accustomed to attending worship services and sitting.
[89]  At the same time that we are giving thanks and praise to the Lord, we can let our requests be made known to God, and there can be prayers related to the execution of God s will and the accomplishment of the Lord s work.
[90]  The small group gatherings should also have the supply of the word as their content.
[91]  This is the life pulse of the group gatherings, and while it is the most important item in a Christian meeting, it is often the most difficult item.
[92]  However, the Lord s word among us is not scarce.
[93]  As long as we spend a few minutes every morning to read two or three verses with their footnotes and three to five paragraphs of a related Life-study message, we will be filled with a supply.
[94]  God s New Testament economy is the Triune God becoming flesh, passing through human living, death on the cross, and resurrection from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit to dispense Himself into every believer so that we can become the children of God and the members of Christ as His Body.
[95]  Prayer: O Lord, we come before You and also come to Your Word by Your precious blood.
[96]  Lord, we are truly for You, and we gather around Your Word, looking to You that You may give us light.
[97]  The truth concerning the administration of the church is related primarily to the limitations on the authority of the elders in a local church.
[98]  Similarly, we need to know this fundamental point as it relates to the administration of the church, because the Lord is leading us to have a new beginning, and we need to make a thorough effort to advance the testimony of the Lord s recovery.
[99]  Consequently, we need to know how those who are in these small groups should move in relation to those who bear responsibilities for the practical and even spiritual aspects of the Lord s move, including the elders and deacons and those who function as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.
[100]  Our concept about the order of the various functions in the administration of the church is completely the opposite of what is shown in verse 28.
[101]  At the beginning of this verse the apostle Paul uses the words first, second, and third, but he does not use sequential numbering in the second half of the verse because he is speaking of two categories of service.
[102]  Whether one is in a local church, in a district, or in a small group, those with the function of a prophet or teacher should endeavor to develop this gift to expand their spiritual capacity so that the church can increase and spread the kingdom of God.
[103]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You from the depths of our being.
[104]  Lord, when we see so many brothers and sisters meeting every day, we know that You are doing a work of grace in our heart.
[105]  The Israelites in the Old Testament are a type of the church in the New Testament.
[106]  When the church began in the New Testament, there were only one hundred twenty disciples plus the Lord Jesus.
[107]  On the day of Pentecost three thousand people were added to the church Acts 2:41 .
[108]  Thus, the number of the Lord s believers became three thousand one hundred twenty, and they immediately started to live a meeting life.
[109]  In 1974 I received a burden to write footnotes for all the twenty-seven books of the New Testament.
[110]  The messages released on the Lord s Day mornings related to life and truth are for the purpose of supplying life; the primary emphasis is not on teaching the truth.
[111]  Therefore, we still need a meeting for teaching the truth by expounding the Bible.
[112]  However, our apprehension of the truth depends upon our understanding of these new terms, but there is not much time on the Lord s Day morning to teach these basic truths.
[113]  Regarding prayer meetings, the church cannot be without prayer.
[114]  They should be held in small groups throughout the year so that people will not have to go to the meeting halls.
[115]  In conclusion, there are five kinds of meeting: a meeting on the Lord s Day morning to supply life by releasing the truth, a meeting on the Lord s Day evening for breaking bread, being held jointly in the districts halls on the first Lord s Day of every month and in small groups on the remaining Lord s Days of a month, a prayer meeting on Tuesday night, a meeting for teaching the truth on Thursday night, and then small group gatherings and family gospel meetings on one of the convenient remaining nights of the week.
[116]  Although Hymns, #471 speaks of a saint returning to the Lord, we rarely sing this hymn because we have neglected the matter of restoring the dormant saints.
[117]  I wrote this hymn at the start of the work in Taiwan because I felt a need to help the saints who were weak, backslidden, or cold.
[118]  When we first arrived in Taiwan, we did not have an atmosphere of preaching the gospel, studying the truth, and pursuing the growth in life.
[119]  When we first started the work in Taiwan, we had only a few hundred brothers and sisters, but we very quickly increased to tens of thousands.
[120]  This increase would not have been possible without stirring up an atmosphere of the gospel.
[121]  In order to recover these brothers and sisters, our initial plan is to thoroughly examine the existing information cards.
[122]  Among the fifty thousand names in the church in Taipei, about ten thousand of the addresses are accurate.
[123]  Of this number, there are approximately five to six thousand saints who participate in the church life regularly and about six thousand more who come to an occasional meeting.
[124]  For example, we should not say, We are visiting you because you have not been to a meeting for a while.
[125]  Since the one we are visiting will have some sense of shame related to not being in the meetings, there is no need to remind him of this fact.
[126]  Even when we give a testimony of how we have been blessed, we can inadvertently imply that they are not blessed, and if we speak of how we have been richly supplied by attending all the meetings, they may only be reminded that they have not attended any meetings recently.
[127]  Pastor Yu was truly saved, and even though he was not so clear about the truth, he was a very proper person.
[128]  When he came to visit me, he often would say nothing more than, I am here to see you.
[129]  When we go to visit the saints, it is often better not to speak than to speak, and if we have to speak, we should not speak too much.
[130]  From house to house...announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ means that the gospel can be preached in every home and that the gospel should be preached in every home Acts 5:42 .
[131]  When we see the expression announcing the gospel, our inner being leaps because, as believers, we have a gospel-preaching life in us.
[132]  As long as we believe into the Lord and have the Lord s life, there will always be a response in our inner being when the gospel is mentioned no matter what our condition is.
[133]  When we pray and sing hymns related to the gospel, we also have a feeling that the gospel is glorious.
[134]  We should not only uphold our existing brothers and sisters and restore our lost brothers and sisters; we should also go on the offensive to reach our gospel friends, that is, those who have not yet believed in the Lord, so that they may know the gospel and receive the blessings of the Lord s salvation.
[135]  A brother or sister may say, My meeting life is only now becoming normal.
[136]  I have been greatly blessed by joining a small group gathering, but I am not sure if I am ready to preach the gospel.
[137]  The more we try to merely maintain what we have, the more we will lose it; the more we try to keep it, the more it will leak away.
[138]  When we go out by faith to speak for the Lord, He will be with us, and our spirit will rise up.
[139]  The more we go out, the more active our inner man will become, and the more we go out, the more we will have the Lord s word.
[140]  For example, when we saw saints put on gospel vests, we were scared and even a little embarrassed, but when we put on a gospel vest ourselves, the Spirit and the Lord s word emboldened us.
[141]  Acts 1:8 tells us that our witnessing should be in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
[142]  Today our Jerusalem is our relatives, friends, and neighbors.
[143]  When it comes to preaching the gospel, many of us are willing to go to far-away places, but we are unwilling to go to nearby places.
[144]  However, the Lord s charge does not speak of going from the uttermost part of the earth to Jerusalem but from Jerusalem to the uttermost part of the earth.
[145]  We also need to lead the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel by themselves in their own homes.
[146]  The members of the small groups should pick up a burden to encourage each other to preach the gospel by themselves in their homes.
[147]  When we eat at a good restaurant, we may eat the best delicacies, but we do not have much of an intimate and warm feeling.
[148]  Throughout the year we may not have spoken much to our relatives, friends, and neighbors, but when the New Year s gospel meeting approached, we tried to invite people, often compelling them to come and hear the gospel.
[149]  In some homes there are only husbands and wives because all the children have left home.
[150]  Thus, they may think that there is not enough support for them to preach the gospel in their home.
[151]  In such a case, they can ask others who are nearby to join them; thus, they can have a gospel meeting with two or three families who live nearby.
[152]  Sometimes we need to combine our homes together, but we should not do this in a rigid way.
