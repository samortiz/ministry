<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1><h1 class="title">HANDING OURSELVES OVER<br />FOR THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL<br />BY THE WHOLE BODY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Monday, February 6, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong</h1><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING GOD'S GOAL<br />AS WELL AS HIS MEANS</h2><p>Christians are God's goal, but they are also God's means. Today, we also have to see clearly that the church is God's goal as well His means. Ordinarily, if an object is a goal it cannot be a means, and if it is a means it cannot be a goal. However, God makes His goal and His means one and the same. What do we mean when we say that Christians are God's goal? God's goal is to redeem us. Once God redeems us, He has reached His goal. It is God's intention and goal that we be saved, but God does not stop there. He wants to use us to save others. First, we are God's goal, then we should place ourselves in His hand and allow Him to use us to save others. In this way we become God's means. To God, we are His goal, and to the world, we are His means. If God does not use us, He will have no way to spread the gospel.</p><p>Today every one of us can say that we are God's goal. We have no argument about this. The issue today is that God wants us also to be His means. Do you have a problem with this? God can use many people to be His goal but not many people can be His means. Although they are saved, God cannot get through in them. As a result, He cannot reach His goal in others.</p><p>When the early apostles forsook everything to follow the Lord, their goal was not to go to heaven, but to bring others to the same salvation. They were not only God's goal but also God's means to bring others to salvation. God used other men to gain us and to accomplish His goal in us. Today we should do the same. God first made us the goal and then the means. Do we want to be God's means? God wants to use us in such a way that He can promptly say, "I want to save a certain person, and he only needs to come in contact with you." How many people today can say that they are God's means? If God finds any reservation, any frustration, or any blockage in us, He cannot reach His goal of saving others through us. As a result, many sinners will not receive any blessing from us; they will not hear the gospel from us nor will they be saved through us.</p><p>God does not have many means on earth today. If He wants to save fifty thousand people here in Hong Kong, He does not rely on fifty thousand isolated means. No, God does not work separately one by one. He has established the church and has baptized everyone into one Spirit. The many members have become one new man, one Body. They can no longer be separated; they are all fitly joined together. When we were saved, we were saved individually one by one. When we spread out as God's means, however, we spread out as the Body. When we were saved we became living stones. When we spread out, we are coordinated as a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5). In other words, God's means is the corporate Christian&mdash;the church, not the individual Christians. Let me say a direct word to you tonight. What is the church? In order to save the world, God has instituted a body, an organization, or you may say a group of people, and has made it the very means whereby He saves the world. Our sole purpose of living on this earth is for the gospel. We do not save a few souls here and there when we feel like it. God joins all the believers together into a harmonious whole, like a body, and uses it to preach the gospel and to save others.</p>
