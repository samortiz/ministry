<p>In Philippians 3:8 Paul speaks of counting all things to be loss on account of &ldquo;the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.&rdquo; Paul suffered the loss of all things and counted them as refuse so that he might gain Christ. This indicates that if we want to gain Christ and experience Him, we must know Him, and if we want to know Him, we must pay the price to pursue Him. We must suffer the loss of all things, counting them as refuse. Because Paul pursued in such a way, he was able to know Christ and the power of His resurrection, and he was able to gain Christ in his experience (v. 10). If we truly love Christ, we will recognize the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. We will also despise all things in order to pursue after the knowledge of Christ so that we may gain Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Opening Ourselves to Him</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &ldquo;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; Because we love the Lord and pursue Him, we should open ourselves to Him in order to behold His beauty. If we would remove all our veils and behold Him with an open heart, we will reflect His glory and be transformed into the same image from glory to glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Abiding in Him</h2>
<p>John 15:5 says, &ldquo;He who abides in Me and I in him.&rdquo; If we want the Lord to abide in us, we must abide in Him. Our abiding in Him is the condition for Him to abide in us. Abiding in the Lord means that there is nothing between us and Him and that we are in constant fellowship with Him. When nothing is between us and the Lord and we are in constant fellowship with Him, we will experience Him abiding in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Believing That He Dwells in Us</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:17 speaks of Christ making His home in our hearts through faith. Christ&rsquo;s dwelling in us is related to faith. The more we believe that He dwells in us, the more we will experience His dwelling in us, which will result in His making His home in us. When we love Him, seek to know Him, fellowship with Him, and abide in Him, we often sense that He is dwelling in us. However, there are also times when we do not sense His indwelling, even though we love Him and do not have any barriers between us and Him. At such times we need to believe that He dwells in us. As long as we love Him and do not have any barriers separating us from Him, His indwelling is a reality in our experience. Hence, we must believe in the fact of His indwelling us and ignore our feelings. Even if we do not sense that He is dwelling in us, we must still believe that He is dwelling in us. If we would ignore our feelings and believe that He dwells in us, we will experience His dwelling in us. Eventually, He will make His home in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Walking according to the Spirit of Christ&mdash;Obeying the Anointing</h2>
<p>Romans 8:9 says, &ldquo;If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.&rdquo; This verse shows that Christ and the Spirit are inseparable. The Spirit of Christ is not only Christ&rsquo;s representative but His transfiguration. We experience Christ as the Spirit. When we live in the Spirit of Christ, we live in Christ, and when we walk according to the Spirit of Christ, we walk according to Christ. Therefore, if we want to touch Christ, experience Christ, and live in Christ, and thereby obtain Him, we must walk according to the Spirit of Christ and set our mind on the Spirit of Christ, that is, walk according to and set our mind on the Spirit. When we walk according to the Spirit, we obey the anointing in us, and we abide in Him and enjoy His riches (1 John 2:27).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Acknowledging That<br />
We Have Been Crucified with Him</h2>
<p>Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; In order to experience Christ living in us, we must see and acknowledge that we have been crucified with Him. The Spirit reveals not only Christ to us but also the cross so that we may experience Christ through the cross. Christ died on the cross for us, and the cross enables Christ to live in us. We experience the cross by the Spirit, and we experience Christ through the cross. Only when we stand in the position of our co-crucifixion with Christ can He become our experience. Only when we no longer live can Christ live in us. May we acknowledge our co-crucifixion with Christ and thus deny ourselves, handing all our rights over to Him and letting Him be our life and live in us. May we truly say, &ldquo;It is not longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Walking in Him</h2>
<p>Colossians 2:6 says, &ldquo;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.&rdquo; To walk in Christ is to act and live by Him. Since we have the Lord Jesus as our life and have Him living in us, we should no longer act or live according to ourselves. We should let Him live by taking Him as our life and walking in Him. This is the way that we afford Him the opportunity to be our enjoyment within and our expression without.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Putting On Christ</h2>
<p>Romans 13:14 says, &ldquo;Put on the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This means that we should put Him on outwardly so that He is manifested through us. If we live in Him and act and walk by Him, He will be manifested and magnified through us. We should not do anything that will prevent Him from being manifested through us. Just as we should be filled with Him inwardly, we should put Him on outwardly. Then we will gain Him and even become Him, both inwardly and outwardly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Awaiting Him</h2>
<p>Furthermore, we should await the Lord&rsquo;s coming, when He &ldquo;will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory&rdquo; (Phil. 3:20-21) and will lead us into His glory so that we may fully gain and enjoy Him (Heb. 2:10). As those who love Him, take Him as our life, live in Him, and magnify Him in our bodies, we should await His coming and love His appearing (2 Tim. 4:8). This should be our heart&rsquo;s desire and our living, as those who expect to enter into His glory and enjoy Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Cross &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
