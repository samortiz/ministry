The entire teaching of the New Testament which is the apostles teaching is Gods speaking Gods oracle in the Son to His New Testament people
In Acts 9 when Saul of Tarsus was persecuting the followers of Jesus, he did not realize that he was persecuting Jesus
Acts 9:4-5 says, 'And he fell on the ground and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?
God's speaking in the Son to His New Testament people was firstly the direct teaching of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels
In John 16:12-13 the Lord told the disciples, 'I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now
Godliness is not merely piety, but the living that is the expression of God, the manifestation of God in the flesh
After the Acts are the fourteen Epistles of Paul, followed by the short books of James, Peter, John, and Jude, and the book of Revelation
The entire teaching of the New Testament, the teaching of the apostles, is the unique, divine revelation of God's New Testament economy
Items such as baptism by water, speaking in tongues, head covering, and foot-washing are not the focus of the economy of God
Whether or not our speaking is according to the New Testament economy can be measured by its relationship to these three items
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!
Paul taught us in Romans 12:14 to bless and not curse those who persecute us, but here Paul tells us that some people are to be accursed
All teachings different from the unique revelation of God's New Testament economy were considered by the apostles as winds of teaching
Behind men's sleight, men's craftiness, in teaching things different from the New Testament economy, is the satanic system
The winds of teaching also cause the babes to be tossed by waves and thereby to suffer uneasiness in the church life
A certain teaching may also take away our morale for following the Lord caring for His interest and loving the church and the Lords recovery
If the teachings differing from the unique revelation of God's New Testament economy did not appear to be good, no one would accept them
Teachings may be compared to seafood, but according to the typology in Leviticus, certain foods from the sea are unclean
The fins and scales of the New Testament teaching are the Triune God the allinclusive Christ and the church as the organic Body of Christ
Those who bring the winds of teaching often appear to be very loving, apparently showing care and concern for us
If we are not able to properly discern a teaching, we should fellowship with certain saints to receive some help
In God's New Testament economy, there is only one kind of teaching revealed and recognized by God-the teaching of the apostles
In the same way that our physical body is in such a proper order, there is also an order in the church, which is the Body of Christ
When God's people in the Old Testament became a collective entity, there was a proper situation of order among them
Especially during times of trouble or even at times when something good happens to us, the first thing we often say is, 'O Lord'!
Jesus was also made the Christ in His resurrection and ascension to carry out God's commission, His plan and eternal economy
Acts 5:31 says, 'This One God has exalted to His right hand as a Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins'
He has the authority and power, if He should so desire, to remove a king in order to save even one of His people
The account of Pharaoh and the people of Israel in Exodus is a demonstration of the Lord's authority and power to save
In Egypt, Pharaoh kept all the children of Israel in slavery, and God sent Moses to tell Pharaoh to let His people go
The Lord's authority and power as the Leader over all the rulers can be seen in His control over the world situation
If both the parents and the older children are away, a baby-sitter is left with the remaining children to be a leader for them
If on the other hand the elders do not take the lead to go out but simply exhort the other saints to do it not many of the saints will go
The leadership in the New Testament ministry is in the New Testament teaching more than in the leading ones of the New Testament ministry
The churches followed the apostles' teaching, and they followed the apostles because the apostles had the New Testament teaching
What the ministry in the Lord's recovery has brought to the churches is according to the New Testament teaching of the apostles
He told the elders in verses 29 and 30, 'I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock
From among you yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after themselves'
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice'!
Without delegated authorities, the whole earth would be in anarchy and disorder and would be unsuitable for living in
Today a wind of teaching is blowing in the Lord's recovery, saying that there is no delegated authority in the church
In 2 Corinthians 10:6 Paul said, 'And being ready to avenge all disobedience, whenever your obedience is fulfilled'
Even among the children of Israel in the Old Testament, God had a government for His administration to fulfill His purpose
Humanly speaking, democracy is wonderful, but to bring democracy into the church brings in the opinions of the people
In the United States government, congressmen and senators represent the states to express the people's opinion
The theocratic government among the people of Israel in the Old Testament was through the priesthood with the Urim and the Thummim
God could open Himself to them, and they could open themselves to God so that there could be a mutual understanding between them and God
The high priest wore a breastplate with twelve precious stones bearing the names of the twelve tribes of Israel
The twelve names of Israel on the twelve stones only occupied eighteen of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet
The theocratic government among the people of Israel in the Old Testament was also through the coordination of the prophets
The result of this divine coordination of the New Testament priests and prophets in the Body of Christ is the God-commanded blessing
