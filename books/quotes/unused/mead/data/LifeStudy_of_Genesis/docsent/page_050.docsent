   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a The Case of Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We begin with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This does not mean that before Abraham there was no man who expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There were at least three great men Abel, Enoch, and Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, if we read their history, we find no record that they conquered the enemy or subdued anything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Until Abraham, there is no record of anyone who subdued the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Abraham built an altar that he might contact God Gen 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more you contact God, the more you will bear God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more you look at God, the more you will look like God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To build an altar for the purpose of contacting God means to become more and more transformed into the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Abraham didn't build a tower.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The people at Babel didn't build an altar to contact God; they built a tower to make themselves a name Gen 11:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That is self-pride.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Abraham, however, was called out of that environment; he built a small altar and there he contacted God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more he contacted God, the more he looked like God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible tells us that eventually God became a friend to Abraham and that Abraham was called the friend of God James 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you read Genesis 18, you will see that God did not come to Abraham as the Creator or the Almighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God came to him as a friend.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God and Abraham had fellowship just like two friends talking together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By that time Abraham had become more and more like God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we are told that Abraham conquered and defeated the enemies Gen 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>b The Case of Joseph</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Joseph was the last person whose history was recorded in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He lived a holy and victorious life Gen 39:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He lived a life that was very much like God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God was holy; Joseph was holy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God was victorious; Joseph was victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Joseph bore the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was a man who fulfilled God's intention.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The story of Joseph is the story of a holy and victorious life, a life that eventually became the ruling authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Joseph ruled over all of Egypt Gen 41:39-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Genesis chapter one we see a man made by God in His image and committed with God's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the last few chapters of Genesis, we also see a man who really expressed God, represented God, and ruled over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>c The Case of Moses</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moses was not a great politician.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was a man who contacted God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After contacting God, his face shone with the divine glory Exo 34:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Moses' face shone with the glory of God, he bore the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, Moses became a man with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He had authority to rule over the whole house of Israel Heb 3:2, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He also had authority to defeat the enemy Exo 14:30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He did not fight the battle with machine guns or atom bombs, but with a little rod.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The little rod not only represented power; it represented authority.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moses used that rod and said to the Red Sea, "Open up the way."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The waters were divided.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That was authority.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Moses was a man who bore God's image and represented God with divine authority.</S>
