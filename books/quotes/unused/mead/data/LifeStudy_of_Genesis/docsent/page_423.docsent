   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>c The Oil Poured upon the Stone</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jacob not only set up the stone as a pillar; he also poured oil upon it 28:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no need to talk very much about it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As long as you set up your pillow to become a pillar, the oil will be poured upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What an experience of oil we have had since we came into the church life and our pillow stood up to become a pillar!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What an experience of the Holy Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I can testify that when I say, "Pillow, stand up," I experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit many times.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When your pillow stands up, the oil will be poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not say this in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This can be proved by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we say, "Lord Jesus, I love You," we may be somewhat excited.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when we go further and say, "Lord Jesus, I love Your church," we are so excited that we can hardly contain ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some Christians condemn us, saying that we make the church more important than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why do we talk so much about the church?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because the more we talk about it, the more excited we become.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All Americans love desserts, such as ice cream, pie, and cake.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church life is like a dessert.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you only have Christ without the church, your meal may be like a few slices of Jewish bread.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is solid, but it is not dessert.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church life is the best dessert, a dessert which is even larger than the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why the church people like to say, "Amen, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I love You and I love the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I'm for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I consecrate myself to Christ and the church."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the pillow is set up to be a pillar, it is fully baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In John 1 we also have the baptism, the stone, and Jacob's dream vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>33, 42, 51 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>d The House of God</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After the oil was poured upon the pillar, the pillar became the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The issue of saying, "Lord Jesus, I love You and I love the church," is the house.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before we came into the church, we were individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But since coming into the church and testifying how much we love the church, we find that whenever we are individualistic, we lose the dessert.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead of dessert, we have bitter medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever you enjoy the wonderful church life, you have dessert every day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But whenever you are the slightest bit individualistic, you begin to taste the bitter medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is not even the need to be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even if you say that you don't like a certain brother, you will sense a bitter taste.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you say, "The church life is wonderful, but I don't like that sister," there will be no dessert.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At times, we have sugar-coated medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After a while, however, the sugar coat melts and we taste the bitterness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The genuine experience of Christ becomes the building material, and this building material consummates in the building of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here God has rest and satisfaction, and here we also have rest and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Jacob's dream was first fulfilled when the children of Israel erected the tabernacle after being delivered out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That was the first house of God among men, the first fulfillment of Jacob's dream.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The tabernacle indicated that God and man had found rest, that God's dwelling place on earth was the satisfaction and rest for both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After the children of Israel had constructed the temple in the good land, God had a more solid house on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then, in the New Testament, we have the church as the house of God 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, in the new heaven and the new earth, we shall have the New Jerusalem as God's eternal dwelling place Rev 21:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There God and we shall have eternal rest and enjoy eternal satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today we are all in the fulfillment of Jacob's dream.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We not only have the stone and the pillar; we also have the house.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In fact, we are the house Heb 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This house is the composition of divinity with humanity, the composition of the Triune God with human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here we have the house which becomes the rest for both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now we are not only in the dream but also in the fulfillment of the dream.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thank the Lord for the stone, the pillar, the house, and the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the church life we experience all four of these.</S>
