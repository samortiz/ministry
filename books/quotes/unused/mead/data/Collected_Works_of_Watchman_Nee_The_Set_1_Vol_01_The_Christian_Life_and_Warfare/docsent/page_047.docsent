   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Oppressing Them and Making Them Sick</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 10:38</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The devil is full of deceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If he cannot cause men to rebel in their spirit, he will work on their bodies, oppressing them with sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because of this, men are not able to enjoy the blessing of the resurrection life and lose both their peace in the body and their steadfastness and watchfulness in the spirit, thus fulfilling Satan's wish.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We often see active Christian workers in this world becoming sick through a little carelessness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The devil likes to see Christians become sick, so that they will stop working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>C. His Deceptions against Those in God's Hand</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,...a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Job 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Throwing His Darts</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ephesians 6:16</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Toward the strong Christians, those who are the Lord's best soldiers, Satan cannot easily apply his temptations in the dark or his threats in the open.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These believers are quite strong and tenacious in fighting against Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a result, Satan unleashes his utterly evil murderous nature John 8:44 and attacks with flaming darts, hoping that by so doing he will put the believers to death and cripple them so much that they will not be able to rise again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, we have the way to annihilate him; it is by God's faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Having taken up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one" Eph 6:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Faith is a shield for quenching, not a pair of pliers for removing the flaming darts after they have already struck the body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should place faith between us and the devil in the same way that we would place a shield between ourselves and the enemy in a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the enemy wants to hurt the holder of the shield, he first must pass through the shield.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the shield is strong, the weapons of the enemy will not be able to come close to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, in fighting with Satan we have to take faith in God as our shield.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Satan's flaming darts come close to this shield, they will be quenched by our faith and will not hurt us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who are holding this shield will detect the devil's assault from every direction.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If they trust in God as their protection and do not slacken one bit, the devil will not be able to carry out his scheme.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Setting Up His Snare</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>1 Timothy 3:7</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The believers should advance by running quickly Phil 3:14 ; they should not linger on the wayside.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The devil hates the speed of the believers' advance; hence, he secretly sets up snares to trap them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is very easy for a runner to fall when he comes upon something.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such a fall usually inflicts severe injuries.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Satan's crafty snares are everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their intention is to cause the believers to plummet in their spiritual condition and to remain low forever.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The way of victory is seen in Psalm 25:15: "My eyes are continually turned to Jehovah,/For He will bring my feet out of the net."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When one first comes across this verse, it seems odd.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the ground is covered with nets, while one is running he should look for the nets in order to avoid them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But here the eyes are turned to Jehovah in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If, while there are nets on the ground, the face is turned to the heavens and the feet are running forward, will not such a person fall and die?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We know that the devil's nets do not have to be physical.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not easy for us to find out where they are.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then, even if we know where they are, when we set our eyes on the nets and try to avoid them, we can no longer run a straight course.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why we have to look to God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God knows where the nets are.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He will hold our feet and keep us from falling into the nets, caring for us step by step until we reach the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Exercising His Stratagems</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Ephesians 6:11</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a man chooses Christ and remains in Him all the time, the devil will not be able to inflict his harm.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But as soon as he has opportunity, he will first draw men to leave their position in Christ and then lead them away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here we can apply Ephesians 6:13: "Therefore take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day."</S>
