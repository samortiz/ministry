<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>1</b> There were ninety and nine that safely lay</div>
<div class='line'>In the shelter of the flock,</div>
<div class='line'>But one was on the hills away,</div>
<div class='line'>Far off in the cold and dark;</div>
<div class='line'>Away on the mountains wild and bare,</div>
<div class='line'>Away from the tender Shepherd's care.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> "Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;</div>
<div class='line'>Are they not enough for Thee?"</div>
<div class='line'>But the Shepherd made answer: "This of Mine</div>
<div class='line'>Has wandered away from Me;</div>
<div class='line'>And although the road be rough and steep,</div>
<div class='line'>I go to the desert to find My sheep."</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> But none of the ransomed ever knew</div>
<div class='line'>How deep were the waters crossed;</div>
<div class='line'>Nor how dark was the night which the Lord passed though</div>
<div class='line'>Ere He found His sheep that was lost.</div>
<div class='line'>Out in the bleak desert He heard its cry -</div>
<div class='line'>All bleeding and helpless, and ready to die.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> "Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way</div>
<div class='line'>That mark out the mountain's track?"</div>
<div class='line'>"They were shed for one who had gone astray</div>
<div class='line'>Ere the Shepherd could bring him back."</div>
<div class='line'>"Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?"</div>
<div class='line'>"They're pierced tonight by many a thorn."</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> And all through the mountains, thunder-riven,</div>
<div class='line'>And up from the rocky steep,</div>
<div class='line'>There arose a cry to the gate of heaven,</div>
<div class='line'>"Rejoice! I have found My sheep!"</div>
<div class='line'>And the angels echoed around the throne,</div>
<div class='line'>"Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!"</div>
