Even in Christianity many teachers tell people again and again that they need to do something for God, to work for God
According to Romans 9 God desires that we be vessels unto honor, vessels unto glory, and vessels of mercy to contain Him
After the enjoyment of all the material things, after the experience of all the things invented in human culture, they get nothing
Genesis 27 says that when God created man He formed mans body of the dust of the ground and breathed into mans nostrils the breath of life
The Hebrew word for breath in Genesis 2:7 is the same word for spirit in Proverbs 20:27, which refers to the 'spirit of man'
It says that the Lord is the One who stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
According to Zechariah 12:1 it seems that God created only three prominent things: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man
We think that we have to worship God, serve God, do something good for God, glorify God, and be nice, loving, and humble
No one would teach a Coca-Cola bottle to worship the Coca-Cola, serve the Coca-Cola, and do good to please the Coca-Cola
Ezekiel tells us that in God's salvation the first thing God does is to renew our deadened spirit, to make our spirit a new one
He puts a new spirit within us and then following this He puts His own Spirit, that is, Himself, into our spirit
You have to exercise your spirit to release your treasure, to share with others the treasure you have in your spirit
Jesus is the living water, the living water is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of God is God Himself, and God becomes Jesus in the flesh
Isaiah 9:6 tells us that a child is born whose name is called the mighty God, and a son is given whose name is called the eternal Father
He said, 'If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him'
Philip's asking the Lord to show him the Father was like someone saying to me, 'Brother Lee, please show us Witness Lee'
The very 'He' who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 becomes the very 'I' who is the Lord Himself in verse 18
The last Adam includes God incarnated, the seed of woman, and the child begotten of the Holy Spirit and born of a human virgin
The last Adam also includes the human life of Jesus on earth for thirty-three and a half years, His burial, and His resurrection
The Lord told him that he needed to be regenerated, which means that he needed to receive the Lord as the life-giving Spirit
Sometimes the churches have practiced some burnings to give the saints an opportunity to clear up their lives from sinful and worldly things
Regardless of whether you are young or old, if you have never been crazy with Jesus, you are not that qualified to be a good Christian
Some of the Pharisees, the 'reasonable' ones, the 'logical' ones, the 'uncrazy' ones, came to Jesus and told Him to rebuke His disciples
Matthew 21 tells us that when the children were crying out and praising the Lord, the chief priests and scribes were indignant
Jesus said to them, 'Have you never read, Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings You have perfected praise''?
When He makes His home in your heart, He is now not only revealed in your spirit, but also taking full possession of your whole being
Do not think that you need some training about how to serve the Lord, how to preach the gospel, and how to work for the Lord
Your feeling your will your decision your intention your motive your intent and everything within you will be fully taken over by Jesus
He was trying to keep all the laws made by Moses, all the rules made by Judaism, and all the desires and intentions set up by himself
While he was trying his best to keep all the laws, the light and the voice came from the heavens, and he fell to the ground
That day on the way to Damascus the one who was trying his best to keep the law and persecute Jesus fell on the ground and called, 'Lord'!
He was stopped from the Moses-made law; he was stopped from the Judaism-made law; and he was stopped from his self-made law
As long as you have so many doings, this proves that you are short of the gracious visitation of the Lord Jesus
You do not need someone to bring Christ down from the heavens for you or to bring Christ up from the abyss for you
Romans 10 does not say that the Lord is rich unto all that believe in Him, worship Him, meditate on Him, or pray to Him
Ananias was concerned and told the Lord, 'He has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon Your name'
While Saul was on the way to Damascus, he wanted to bind all of the ones who called on the Lord Jesus day by day
He descended from the heavens to become a man as the last Adam and ascended from the abyss to be the life-giving Spirit in resurrection
If we would open up our mouth, deep from our heart and with our spirit, to call 'Lord Jesus,' He would get into us
The way for us, the containers, to take Him in as the content is to exercise our mouth to call upon His name: 'O Lord Jesus!
In 2 Corinthians 3 to be veiled means to be covered by old religious concepts, thoughts, teaching, and knowledge
Paul said in 2 Corinthians 3:15 concerning the Israelites, 'Indeed unto this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart'
The Jewish people were so much for keeping the Sabbath that they sent out some Sabbath-day policemen to arrest all the Sabbath-breakers
Have you not read in the Scriptures that David and his followers went into the house of God and ate something illegally?
We do not realize how much we have been veiled by the so-called Christian religion, by the religious concept we received from Christianity
He said that as newborn babes, we should desire to drink the pure milk of the word that we may grow to become living stones
We all are pieces of clay, but by drinking Jesus, by eating Jesus, by taking Jesus in, we will have a metabolic, organic change
The clay will be changed into stone, and we will become white stones, acceptable and justified in the eyes of God
As we give Jesus the free course in our whole being, we have the growth, and by the growth, we have the transformation
The more Jesus we eat, digest, and assimilate, the more transformation we have, and the issue is the spontaneous oneness
The New Jerusalem will be the corporate, universal, eternal, and unique vessel in the whole universe to contain our God
Everyone who thirsts come to the watersAnd you who have no moneyCome buy and eatYes come buy wine and milkWithout money and without price
There are the shadows given by the Lord through the material things, the physical things, to illustrate the spiritual things
When we receive the proper drink and food, something organic gets into us to cause us to grow and be transformed
By being digested, the nourishment and the riches of what we eat are assimilated into our system to become our cells
The problem is this after your calling on the name of the Lord, after the Lord gets into you, you probably would not be so open to Him
After calling on the Lord, a young brother may eventually have some sense within him that he needs to deal with the way he cuts his hair
If you go along with this sense, you will be joyful and have a better, bigger, deeper, and higher appetite for Christ
You will not be so eager to pray-read the Word, and calling on the name of the Lord will not be so sweet to you
No doubt, in another sense, we all need some education, but the basic thing is the growth, and this growth depends absolutely upon eating
By this you will get the nourishment into your cells, and this nourishment even will become your organic tissues, your very being
We need to assimilate Jesus so that He can become our cells and our organic tissues to become our very essence and element
The last promise given by the Lord is: 'Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life'
You will have a good digestion for a good assimilation, and you will enjoy and absorb all the nourishment of the riches of Christ
We have seen that God's intention is to have a universal, corporate vessel to contain Himself, and this vessel will be the New Jerusalem
In the Bible, Babel, or Babylon, is first mentioned in Genesis 11, but the name of Jerusalem is not mentioned until much later
You have to realize that this confounding from God was a punishment to man due to his trying to make a name for himself
The Scriptures reveal that the local churches are not confounded or confused like Babel but are united as one Body
God told His people that when they got into the good land, they had no right to choose the place in which they would worship Him
The difference between apostate Christendom and the genuine church is that one is a mixture, but the other is pure
It has spiritual persons, some precious stones, like Madame Guyon, Father Fenelon, and Brother Lawrence, who give some outward appearance
The Lord Jesus told them that Moses did this because of their hardness of heart, but it was not so in the beginning
According to the New Testament, there should be only one church for one city and one city with only one church
He said that she spoke the truth, because she had had five husbands and the one she now had was not her husband
The Lord has opened our eyes, and we have seen the principle of oneness: one Head, one Body; one husband, one wife; one Christ, one church
Whenever they had a time to worship God in a corporate way, all of them were gathered together into the unique place of God's choice
In the fulfillment of this type, we all have to come to the ground of unity for the public and corporate worship to God
The more you exercise your mind to reason, to find out what is wrong and what is right, the more unclear you will be
In the New Jerusalem there is only one God with one throne, out of which there is one flow of the river of life
He saw the one river of water of life with the one tree of life flowing out of the one throne of the one Lamb-God
In the New Jerusalem there is nothing but the flow of the living water with the tree of life for everyone to enjoy the riches of Christ
After the destruction of Babylon in Revelation 18, there are joyful praising and shouting of 'Hallelujah' and 'Amen' in Revelation 19
