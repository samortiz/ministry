<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>h. The Building Up of the Church</H2><P>Finally, they have to know about the building up of the church. This is another big subject. In order to perfect the brothers and sisters and to help them to know something concerning the church, at least we have to have these eight points. None of them can be missing. Even if the elders cannot do the job themselves, they have to ask others to help them. If we are knowledgeable in these eight things, how widespread will God's work become on the earth, and how strong will His testimony be among us!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Knowing the Body</H2><P>It seems that knowing the church is the same as knowing the Body, but actually there is a difference. Knowing the church emphasizes the organizational aspect, whereas knowing the Body emphasizes the spiritual aspect. The church has these two aspects, in the same way that a man has two aspects, the body and the soul. A strong man must be strong in both aspects, the body and the soul. The same is true with the church. The church has its organizational aspect and its spiritual aspect as well. On the organizational side, the church is the "ekklesia"; it is the congregation of the called-out ones. On the spiritual side, the church is a body. We must not only help the brothers and sisters to understand the nature, the function, the appearance, the ground, the history, the present condition, the recovery, and the building up of the church, but we must help them to understand that the church is an organism and a body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Life of the Body</H2><P>We have to help the brothers and sisters to know that the life within the Body, the church, is Christ. This requires some who have a special ministry to do this work. Let me say a word in passing: I hope that among us those full-time brothers who are taking more responsibilities in the work would pick up the burden and stretch forth the hand of faith to ask for this kind of gift and would do more specific works among the churches. It is a special work to help the brothers and sisters to know the life in the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Position of the Body</H2><P>The position of the Body is in resurrection and in ascension. The Body of Christ is in resurrection, and it stands on the ground of ascension. Here, death cannot touch it, and all earthly people, matters, and activities are under its feet. Organizationally speaking, the church appears in the different localities. But spiritually speaking, the church is in resurrection and in the realm of ascension. It does not belong to the earth, and it is not on earth.</P>
