   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Discerning Man s Spiritual Level</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To discern a person s spiritual level is to know whether or not his spiritual condition is rich, strong, high, and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, there are some brothers whose heart is pure and whose flesh has been dealt with, but because their spirit is very weak and cannot rise up, they cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning our knowing of people, we need to know man s motives, flesh, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, there are some other points that we should also know, but these three are the most important.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Assigning a person responsibility in the service according to a knowledge of these three points will result in the proper building.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A person who ministers the word and speaks for the Lord must know people according to their genuine condition in order for his words to move them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not know people according to their genuine condition, we cannot know their true need.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes a brother may give a message that is directed to one person because he feels uneasy speaking directly with the person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is giving a message to rebuke a brother instead of ministering the word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who hear the word will know that the brother is being rebuked, and the brother himself will know.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes one person in the audience represents the saints as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, there may be some who do not have the key to prayer, and one of them may be in the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Having been dealt with by the Lord in this area, we can release a message on the key to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way no one will feel that we are speaking about a particular person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although we are clear that we are speaking to him, our word will touch everyone because everyone needs such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the message is strong, the brother will be among the first to testify that he was touched.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such a message comes from knowing people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not speak to God s children without knowing them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This kind of speaking is empty and does not touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God s children do not need such messages.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They do not benefit from our messages if we do not know them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our messages will hit the mark when we know people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we want our messages to hit the mark and to be powerful, we must know people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we want to know people, we must learn the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we have never been dealt with in the matter of prayer and do not have the key to prayer, we will not be able to know when others need a word on the key to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A lack of knowing people makes our messages impractical.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we want our messages to be practical, we must know people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This requires us to learn every day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The elders who administrate the church must continually study to be able to discern the condition of others, know people, and discern the motives, flesh, and spirit of others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A person who ministers the word must learn how to sense the needs of others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>None of the Epistles in the New Testament were written by first receiving God s revelation and applying it to certain needs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, all the Epistles in the New Testament were written after first touching people s need and then receiving a word from God to meet that need.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both Epistles to the Corinthians were written in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul was able to write because he saw the problems and knew the condition of the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This also applies to giving messages.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Unless we know or observe the brothers and sisters, we will not be able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who minister the word must know the genuine condition of those who listen and bring their situation before God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brother Nee once spoke a message particularly to one elder.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we spoke of that brother s problem, Brother Nee told us that the entire Lord s Day message was spoken for him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we want our administration of the church to be for the building, we must know people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The sisters who visit other sisters and fellowship with them should do so based on their knowledge of the problems and conditions of those they visit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This requires us to learn various lessons in a serious way.</S>
