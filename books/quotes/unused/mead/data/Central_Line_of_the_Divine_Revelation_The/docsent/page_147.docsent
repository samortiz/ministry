   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Greek word oikonomia, translated economy, means "household administration" or "household economy."</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to my study of the Bible, the Lord's word here was fulfilled mainly with the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was nearly the unique one who received the Lord's further revelation concerning the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Paul's fourteen Epistles, the first great revelation concerns not God alone but God in His economy.</S>
