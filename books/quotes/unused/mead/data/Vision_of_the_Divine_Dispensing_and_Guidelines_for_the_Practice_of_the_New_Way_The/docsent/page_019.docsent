   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The second point is in Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There it says that the Head, Christ, has given to the church gifts such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These people do not build up the Body of Christ directly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, they perfect the saints that the latter may do the work of the New Testament ministry vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This matter has never been properly carried out by anyone in the practice of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But at this time we are carrying it out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I cannot say that we are completely successful, but I have definitely seen the success.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This also is an undeniable fact.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The third point is covered in Romans 15:16.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There it says that everyone is a priest of God's gospel, offering repentant sinners as sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here in Taiwan we do not see big gospel campaigns, yet hundreds and thousands are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is an amazing thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today on the whole earth, although the Lord's recovery has encountered many weaknesses and shortcomings, it has reached all six continents.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord's recovery has gone to North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australasia.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, I have the definite assurance that the churches in all the continents welcome the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In spite of this, the day of glory has not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the burden in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In these two meetings you will not receive many great doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What we need now is to labor, to be diligent, to strive, and to struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 1984 I came back to carry out the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Taiwan can be considered the first place that responded to this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we were a little slow in the beginning, later we picked up this way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the three years of 1985, 1986, and 1987, the big meeting on Sunday morning was still practiced in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was in October 1987, after we had the gospel festival in Taipei, that we said goodbye to the meeting in which one man speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet not long after that, everyone became relaxed again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the process of our studying, I have found out that the God-ordained way in the Bible is that man must labor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is like a farmer farming in his field.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If he does not labor even for one day, the effect will be evident.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A saying among the northern Chinese is, "The grains are dropping!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that when the grains are ripe, one must hurry and harvest them in the field, even if he has important engagements at home.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once the time is past, the grains will all fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, the farmers not only need to labor, but they must also labor on time if they expect to see a good harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All of you sitting here are either elders, co-workers, or full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would like to ask whether you are laboring like a farmer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The reason I say that our condition is not yet up to the standard is that we are not laboring enough.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moreover, the God-ordained way is not that a few would labor; rather, it is that every one of us would labor.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because our laboring is not sufficient, the result of our work is not very apparent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I saw this situation, I went back to the Bible and considered what it says.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I discovered that in the Old Testament, not much is mentioned concerning laboring and diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only Proverbs speaks about these things a little.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It says that the sluggard sleeps and slumbers, and his poverty comes quickly 6:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It also says that the sluggard will not plow because of the cold; therefore, he will beg during the harvest and have nothing 20:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The New Testament says more concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, the book of Romans is a book on Christian living and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There it says that we should not be slothful in zeal, but burning in spirit, serving the Lord as a slave 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We do have a problem in serving the Lord, and this problem is slothfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps some would say, "Brother Lee, we are not slothful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every week we come regularly to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How can you say that we are slothful?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today I must tell you that if you have only scheduled meetings, you will never be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You must add to this, diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to my observation, the way that we have now is correct and according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The saints have no objection or dissension toward it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Everyone receives it gladly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But we seldom see any response outside the regular meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This says one thing: that in their service, the brothers and sisters are not lacking in regular labor; but there is no exceptional labor.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, the secret to success lies in the exceptional labor.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In addition to diligence, Paul used some very strong words in describing his service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He said that he was laboring, striving, contending, and struggling.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If I remember correctly, these words are borrowed from the ancient Olympic games.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the arena, whether one engages in running, wrestling, high jumping, or any other sport, everything can be summed up in these words.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Everyone gives himself to strive.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Paul said, "I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me" 1 Cor 15:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Furthermore, he said, "For which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power" Col 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At that time Paul was facing opposition from three directions: from Judaism, from the Gnostics, and from the heathen traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All of these opposing things were very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, he was not at all subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>On the contrary, he labored and struggled all the more.</S>
