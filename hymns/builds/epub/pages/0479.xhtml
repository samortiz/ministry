<div class='line'><b>1</b> Oh, what a wonderful place</div>
<div class='line'>Jesus has given to me!</div>
<div class='line'>Saved by His glorious grace,</div>
<div class='line'>I may be even as He.</div>
<div class='line'>When with my Lord I appear,</div>
<div class='line'>Like Him I know I shall be;</div>
<div class='line'>But while I walk with Him here,</div>
<div class='line'>I may be even as He.</div>

<div class='line'>Even as He, even as He,</div>

<div class='line'>Saved by His marvelous grace may be</div>
<div class='line'>One with the Savior, even as He.</div>

<div class='line'>One as He rose from the dead;</div>
<div class='line'>I from the curse am as free</div>
<div class='line'>E'en as my glorious Head.</div>
<div class='line'>One on the throne by His side,</div>
<div class='line'>One in His sonship divine;</div>
<div class='line'>One as the bride-groom and the bride,</div>
<div class='line'>One as the branch and the vine.</div>

<div class='line'>One as I pray in His name;</div>
<div class='line'>All that His worth can command,</div>
<div class='line'>I can with confidence claim.</div>
<div class='line'>One in His faith and His love,</div>
<div class='line'>One in His life I may be.</div>
<div class='line'>Sealed by the heavenly Dove,</div>
<div class='line'>I may be holy as He.</div>
