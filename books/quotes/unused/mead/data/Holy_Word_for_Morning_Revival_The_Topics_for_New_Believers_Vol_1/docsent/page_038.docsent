   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 6 DAY 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Cor 14:3 But he who prophesies speaks building up and encouragement and consolation to men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>4 He who prophesies builds up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>31 For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Building Up the Body of Christ by Prophesying</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The enjoyment of Christ develops the believers' spiritual gifts through the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>139 First Corinthians 14 stresses that the top gift, the gift that excels all other gifts, developed by our enjoyment of Christ is prophesying v. 12 . 140 This is the excelling gift because it builds up the church 14:4b-5 . 141 Without prophesying, there is no possibility of building up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>142</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 is not in the sense of foretelling or predicting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To prophesy is to speak for the Lord, and in our speaking for the Lord, we have to speak forth the Lord and speak the Lord into others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To prophesy is to dispense the very Christ whom we have experienced into others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>143 That it does not denote foretelling or predicting is proven by the words building up, encouragement, and consolation in verse 3; by the words convicted and examined in verse 24; and by the words all may learn and all may be encouraged in verse 31.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Speaking the Lord into people builds them up, encourages them, and consoles them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we speak for the Lord, others are convicted and judged.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fact that all may learn and all may be encouraged also shows that this is not predicting but speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>144</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The apostle Paul taught that we all can prophesy 1 Cor 14:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>145 This verse is one of the clearest verses in the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It says that all the believers have the capacity to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Capacity denotes an ability by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless , many saints among us may feel that all can prophesy except them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, there are no exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may not be eloquent, but we can still prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord wants all of us to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>146 To build up the organic Body of Christ, all of us need to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>147</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to prophesy, there are a few things which are indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, we must love the Lord and have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must live before the Lord and be a person who is joined to Him as one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second, we must spend the effort to learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to read much of the Bible and the spiritual publications.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Third, we must be flexible, walking according to the Spirit, and receiving instant and fresh inspiration all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fourth, we should learn to have a heavenly, enlarged view, to know Christ and the church, and not to have our own opinions or view, but to have the view of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Fifth, we should be prepared to prophesy in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>148</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Consciousness of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the church life, we should learn to have the consciousness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some Christians are like butterflies; they act independently.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Others are like bees; they live and move together.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The butterfly flies from flower to flower, going its own sweet way; but the bee works for the hive.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The butterfly lives and works individually, but the bee has a body-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should all be like bees, having the consciousness of the Body so that we can live together with other members in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Wherever there is Body-revelation, there is Body-consciousness, and wherever there is Body-consciousness, individual thought and action are automatically ruled out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Seeing Christ results in deliverance from sin; seeing the Body results in deliverance from individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not a matter of changing our attitude or conduct; revelation does the work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We cannot enter the realm of the Body by anything other than seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A real inward seeing settles the whole problem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>149</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The real significance is that we have become the members of the Body of Christ, possessing the same one life and needing one another.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, whatever we do must be in the Body, joined to the Body, and regulated by the Body, because we are one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>150</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
