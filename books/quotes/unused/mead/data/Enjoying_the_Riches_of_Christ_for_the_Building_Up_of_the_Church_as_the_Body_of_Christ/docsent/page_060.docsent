   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Recovering the Genuine Oneness by Dropping Everything Other Than Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord's recovery today is the recovery of the genuine oneness, the oneness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord is going to recover us out of the teachings, out of the gifts, and out of the opinions back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Christ we have oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hallelujah for Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not talk to me about the gifts, teachings, or mere opinions, and do not ask me for my opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have only one opinion, that is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To only care for Christ is the way to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How can we keep the oneness?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is by dropping the doctrines and giving up the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you have the gift of healing, would you give it up?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to give it up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Otherwise, the gift of healing will become a dividing factor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This does not mean that we never use the gift of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sometimes, we may use it, but we are not for the gift; we are only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sometimes people have come to argue with me about particular matters, but I have no desire to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If someone asks me whether or not we should have tambourines in the meetings, I have no opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the sisters like to play the tambourine, they can play many tambourines at once and I will not be bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some saints, however, may be so bothered that they cannot come to a meeting with tambourines.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If this is the case, they are right away divided.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Let me ask you, "To what kind of meeting would you go?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps, you may need to take a "church tour," traveling through so many so-called churches in order to find a place that fits your taste.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, if it is suitable to your taste, it may not be suitable to others' taste, so eventually we all become divided.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can we keep the oneness in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord today is recovering the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the divisions are a shame to the Lord Jesus, and they are a real boast to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if we today care for the oneness, this is a shame to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if we have only a small number, we still can boast to the enemy, saying, "Satan, look at us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have all come out of every kind of background.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now we are truly one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Satan, you caused people to say that there is no possibility for Christians to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But now here we are; we are one."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Right away Satan will be put to shame and will be cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The oneness is a real shame to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can boast, "Satan, we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not have natural friendship; rather, we are one in Christ, by Christ, with Christ, and for Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to be attuned by Christ and with Christ, not caring for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Forty years ago, if I saw guitar playing in a meeting, I would have done my best to stop it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Recently in New Zealand, however, I was in a meeting with fewer than sixty people but many guitars, and in addition to the guitars there were also tambourines.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I was happy with all the instruments.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In that meeting nothing bothered us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We were all one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT IN EPHESIANS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ephesians 4:3 says, "Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The oneness of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Spirit Himself is our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should care not for doctrines or for gifts but for the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The book of Ephesians does not emphasize doctrines or gifts because, as Paul says, they are childish things v. 14 . Rather, we all have to know Christ and His Body and care for the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The real oneness is one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not care for the teachings, and do not care for the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only care for the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today under the confusion of Christianity, it is not easy for us to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need the Lord's grace to be emancipated from every kind of division.</S>
