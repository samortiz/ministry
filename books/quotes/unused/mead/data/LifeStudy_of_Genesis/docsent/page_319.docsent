   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e Leaving Others' Spiritual Influence</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because of Material Substance</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lot left others' spiritual influence because of material substance 13:5-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When there was only the spiritual influence, Lot kept himself under it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But when Lot was faced with the choice between spiritual influence and material substance, he chose material substance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The principle is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Material substance, that is, worldliness, is a test to those who follow the spirituality of others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Like Lot, they may be righteous but still choose material substance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible does not indicate that in the strife between Lot and Abraham in chapter thirteen Abraham was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, I believe that in a very deep sense Lot's feelings were hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here I would say a word to the leading brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is a very difficult matter to deal with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Abraham did nothing wrong in dealing with Lot, but simply because he dealt with him, Lot would never return to him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Abraham never forgot Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When he heard that Lot had been captured by Chedorlaomer, he led the fight against the kings and rescued Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Abraham learned that God was about to destroy Sodom, he interceded for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 19:27 and 28, Abraham rose up early in the morning and looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah because he was so concerned for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, because of his hurt feelings, Lot would not return to Abraham, but could say, "I have nothing to do with you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even though you brought me back from captivity, I will never return to you."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Lot was delivered from the city of Sodom, he did not consider returning to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If he had returned, his life would not have had such a pitiful ending.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am burdened that the young brothers and sisters will see that it is dangerous to dissent with and to leave the older generation in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When as a child I was rebuked by my mother, I would turn my face away from her for several days.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I was wrong and I knew that she had rebuked me in love, but simply because she rebuked me, I refused to see her face.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The principle is the same in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although others may love us, we do not like to be rebuked by them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have learned that rebuking others builds up enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I spoke a frank word in love to certain brothers, and my frankness offended them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This might have been the reason why Lot would not return to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no indication in the Word that Lot thanked Abraham for delivering him from captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It might have been that he would not give up his hurt feelings and humble himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not insist upon holding on to such human feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We, unlike Lot, should humble ourselves, lose our face, and return to Abraham and remain with him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The sooner we do this and the more we do it, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>f Drifting into a Situation</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Which Was Wicked and Sinful before God</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lot drifted into a situation which was wicked and sinful before God 13:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once you leave the source of spiritual influence, you will automatically go downhill.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You will never go upward.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Never forsake the proper spiritual influence, for it is your protection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you give it up, you will lose your protection, and, like Lot, will drift downward into Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In spite of the fact that Lot knew Sodom was wicked in the eyes of God, he eventually entered into that evil place and lived there.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Ur of Chaldea was a place of idols, Egypt was a place of worldly riches and pleasures, and Sodom was a city of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These three places form a triangular boundary around the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We, God's called ones, live within this triangle and must be careful lest we fall back to the city of idols, go down to the place of worldly pleasures, or drift into the city of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although Lot stayed away from the land of idols and the place of worldly pleasures, he drifted, like a piece of driftwood, into the city of sin.</S>
