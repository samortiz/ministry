   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Of the Four Hundred Pomegranates,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sixteen Four of Each Hundred Being Hidden</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Of each hundred pomegranates, four were hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because the Bible has no wasted words, there must be some significance relating to our experience in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The only way I can understand it is by experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That four of every one hundred pomegranates were hidden indicates that while our expression of the riches of life is eternal, in resurrection, and in the Spirit, our natural being, signified by the number four, must be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our natural life, our natural being, our self, and our ego must be wholly concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although I have sought to discover how these pomegranates were hidden, I have been unable to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is a mystery known only to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, if we examine our experience, we shall say, "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the riches of Christ are expressed, others can see the eternal expression of the riches of life in resurrection and in the atmosphere of the Spirit, but it is difficult to say where our natural man is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How meaningful it is to see that our ego is covered!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever "I" appears, the big number four will be there, but the ninety-six will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead of air, there will just be the natural life, the old man, and the ego.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But whenever the number four disappears, we shall have the ninety-six pomegranates, the rich expression of the life of Christ in the open air.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>pp.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Pillars Being Hollow</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>and Their Thickness Being Four Fingers</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jeremiah 52:21 says, "The thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Each pillar was a cylinder whose walls were four fingers thick, and within each pillar was a large hollow space.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This signifies that God's building is of the human creature, represented by the number four, filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Undoubtedly, the brass pillar is the condemned and judged human creature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within the judged creature is an empty space that must be filled with an invisible reality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not be muddy, thin, and filled with sand, for then there would be no hollow space within.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, we must be brass, four fingers thick, and hollow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then it will be possible for our hollow space to be filled with reality, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>qq.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Two Pillars Measured</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>with One Height of Thirty-five Cubits</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>with One Cubit Covered</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second Chronicles 3:15 says, "Also he made for the front of the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits long" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The two pillars had a combined height of thirty-five cubits, with one cubit covered.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the last message I said that each of the standing boards in the tabernacle was one and a half cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These boards stood horizontally side by side.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But with the pillars it is not only a matter of being horizontal, but also of being vertical.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The pillars were measured vertically, with one standing above another.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that God's building is not only horizontal, but also vertical with some part hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although it is easy for two brothers to stand side by side, it is difficult for one brother to be under the other.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is also difficult to be above others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the building is to be strong, it must be vertical.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more vertical it is, the more space there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not only stand side by side with one another, but also above one another.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to stand side by side, there is no need of sacrifice or to have any part covered.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if we would stand vertically, there is the need for some part to be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First Kings 7:15 says that each pillar was eighteen cubits high, but 2 Chronicles 3:15 indicates that the two pillars were thirty-five cubits long.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to 2 Chronicles 3:15, one cubit is missing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This cubit must have been covered and sacrificed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One reference book says that half a cubit went into each of the pedestals.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I do not accept this explanation because the Bible does not say that the pillars had a pedestal or a base.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Another reference book says that a cubit was lost in the joint to the capital.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I believe this explanation to be correct.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that in order to be vertical, there is the need of sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you consider your experience, you will see that there is no sacrifice required to be side by side with others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if you would be under someone, like the pillar under the capital, you must sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you do not sacrifice, you cannot have anyone above you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You would either cast others away or leap over them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In order to let others be above you, you must give in and sacrifice a part of yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sisters, you need to sacrifice so that someone can be above you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You should not only be measured horizontally but also vertically.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Throughout the years, I have always been under someone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To be under others is to bear others and to be partly covered by them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is by this sacrifice that we can have the vertical building.</S>
