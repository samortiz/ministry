   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SALVATION NOT BEING THROUGH BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we have to consider another question.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some people say that a man cannot be saved without being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps those among us would not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But some who have been affected by the poison of Roman Catholic tradition may be full of this kind of thought.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Recently, a few co-workers and I met a few western missionaries in Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They all paid much attention to this matter of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a certain missionary in Hong Kong who is very strong about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They certainly have their scriptural basis, which is Mark 16:16: "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some would argue that this means if a man has believed but has not been baptized, he is still not saved, because this verse clearly says that he who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here I would like to ask a question.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What does salvation mean here?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It says: "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But following this it says: "He who does not believe shall be condemned."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From this we see that the salvation here must not refer merely to deliverance from condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must be careful here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord says he who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The corresponding sentence should be that he who does not believe shall not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But it is so strange that it says he who does not believe is condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the salvation in the first clause must not refer to the not being condemned in the second clause.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to see that not only does salvation refer to a man's salvation before God, but it also refers to his salvation before men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before God, it is a question of condemnation or no condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before men, it is a question of being saved or not being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before God, all those who believe in the Lord Jesus are not condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He who does not believe is condemned already.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the word of John 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But one cannot say that he who believes and is baptized shall not be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can say that he who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but not that he who believes and is baptized shall not be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is because condemnation has to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Salvation here does not have to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Salvation has to do with man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That is why the question of baptism comes in. To be condemned or not is a matter before God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That is why there is only the difference between believing and not believing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be saved or not is not before God; it is something for man to see.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That is why there is the difference between baptism and no baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we read the Bible, we have to take care of these distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will take John 3 again as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus said in verse 5: "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then in verses 6 and 8, when it mentions this matter again, it mentions only being born of the Spirit, without mentioning being born of water.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reason for this is that there are two sides to the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One side is spiritual, and the other side is earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Spiritually speaking, if a man is not born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But there is still the human side.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the human side, there is not only the need to be born of the Spirit, but the need to be born of water also.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is the Spirit like?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It says the wind blows where it wills.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can also say that the Spirit blows where it wills.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the original language, wind and spirit are the same word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Both are pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Spirit blows where He wills.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One does not know where He comes from or where He is going.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man cannot control the wind in the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When it comes, it simply comes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When it goes, it simply goes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many times, we only hear the sound of the wind, and know that it is here, or that it is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We cannot control the wind in the sky, but we can control the water on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have no way to control the wind blowing on my face.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But I can determine whether I want to go into the water or not.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The wind blows where it wills, but the water goes where I will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I cannot order the Spirit in heaven to put me into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But I can manage to get myself into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I can have a part in the kingdom of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When I am baptized, no one can say that I do not belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is why the Lord said in Mark 16 that he who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What is the difference between being saved and not coming into condemnation?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Please remember that condemnation is something strictly before God, but salvation is relative; it is something before God and something before man as well.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whether I am condemned or not is a matter before God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But whether I am saved or not has to do with God and has to do also with man.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Salvation is toward God and man; condemnation is strictly toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Once a man believes, he will not be condemned before God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He who does not believe has been condemned already.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Those who are in Christ shall not be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But those who do not believe have been condemned already.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the question before God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But thank the Lord, salvation is with God and with man as well.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>On the one hand we have to believe, so that we can be saved before God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>On the other hand, we have to be baptized, so that we can be saved before man.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If there is a man today who continues to be a Christian secretly, should we acknowledge him as a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He has believed and is no longer condemned before God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But one cannot say that he is saved before man.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Before God we have to be delivered from condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But before man we have to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If there is a person who has genuinely believed in the Son of God and has genuinely believed in the work of the Lord's cross, yet he never confesses with his mouth, nor has he ever been baptized, others will not know if he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There is only one condition to be saved before God and to come out of condemnation before God, which is to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But to be saved before man there is another condition, which is to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I am not saying that baptism is not necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We definitely need to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Baptism has to do with our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But this salvation is not what some people think.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is absolutely not a question of coming under condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It does not say that if you are not baptized, you will be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Rather, it says that if you do not believe, you will be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Before God there is no question of baptism; there is only the question of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Once there is faith, everything is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Baptism is not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Baptism is for man.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It is a testimony among men, testifying of the position that one stands upon.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Are you a person in Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Or are you a person in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This fact is testified by baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Thank God that the thief next to the Lord's cross went to Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>At that time, Peter was not there yet.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Neither was John or Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Right after the Lord went to Paradise, the thief followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>But he was not baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Before God, whoever calls on His name shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Why does a person call on His name?</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It is because he has believed.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>But whether those on earth will say that such a person is saved or not is another question.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>In the next few evenings I will make a clear distinction for you.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>It seems that in the Bible, justification, forgiveness, and coming out of condemnation are all before God.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>But salvation is before God and before man as well.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If you are not clear about these things, you will create many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>In the Bible, many places refer to what happens before man.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Many other places refer to what happens before God.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If we confuse the two, we will fall into error.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>I have said that baptism refers to a man's coming out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>On one side is Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>On the other side is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We have to get out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>How do we get out?</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We were a part of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>How can we now come out of Adam and into Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Let me first ask one question: How did we get into Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>If I ask how we can get out of Adam, some would say that they do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>That is why I ask how we got into Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>The way we enter in will be the way we get out.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>How did we get into Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The Lord Jesus said in John 3:6 that that which is born of the flesh is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>How did I become a part of Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>I was born into him.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Now that you know how you got in, you will know how you can get out.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>If you got into him by birth, you have to get out of him by death.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>This is quite obvious.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>But how do we die?</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>God crucified us when the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Therefore, in Christ we have died to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>How then do we get into Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>The Lord goes on to say that that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>I get into Christ by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Peter said that we are regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Hence, it is His resurrection that has regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Here we see two things: through the death of the Lord, we are delivered from the family of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Through resurrection, we have entered into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Through death, we are delivered from the first Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Through resurrection, we have entered into the second Man.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>All of these are accomplished by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>He has died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>As a result we also have died.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>He has resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>As a result we have entered into the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>The death is spiritual, and the resurrection is also spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>But our baptism is physical.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>What then is baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Baptism is our acting out.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Through His servants, His apostles, the Lord Jesus told us of His work: When He died on the cross, we were also included in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>What should we do after we have heard this?</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>According to history, this happened two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>We were already crucified two thousand years ago on the cross of our Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>His word is now preached to us.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>It tells us that we have died.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>What then should we do now?</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>I once asked a village woman this question.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>She answered, "If the Lord Jesus has crucified me, then I need to buy a coffin."</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>This is altogether right!</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>The Lord Jesus has crucified me.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>Why should I not buy a coffin?</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>Since He has crucified me, I must hurry to bury myself.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>Baptism is my request to be buried in the water because I have been crucified by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>Baptism is a response to God's crucifixion of us.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>God has preached the gospel to you and told you that you are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>Your response is that since you have been crucified, you will find someone to bury you.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>Hence, baptism means that we are dead in Adam already.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>Others are taking me out to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>Now we are on the ground of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>Hence, death is our exit from Adam, and resurrection is our entrance into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>Baptism is our burial.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>Death is the termination of Adam, and resurrection is the new beginning in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>Baptism is the bridge between these two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>Through baptism we pass from death to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>My friends, the Lord Jesus has accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='183' RSNT='1' SNO='183'>There is no condition required for us to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='184' RSNT='1' SNO='184'>All we have to do is to simply believe.</S>
   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>To believe is to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>I need only to receive because the Lord has done everything.</S>
   <S PAR='187' RSNT='1' SNO='187'>I no longer have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='188' RSNT='1' SNO='188'>Baptism is through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='189' RSNT='1' SNO='189'>It is an acting out.</S>
   <S PAR='190' RSNT='1' SNO='190'>Let me ask: If there is no plot, how can we perform?</S>
   <S PAR='191' RSNT='1' SNO='191'>Do we have a plot first and then an act, or do we have an act first and then a plot?</S>
   <S PAR='192' RSNT='1' SNO='192'>All plays exist because there was a plot already.</S>
   <S PAR='193' RSNT='1' SNO='193'>Because there is a spiritual fact before God already, we can act it out through baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='194' RSNT='1' SNO='194'>May the Lord be gracious to us and show us that nothing other than faith can be a condition for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='195' RSNT='1' SNO='195'>Baptism has absolutely nothing to do with salvation or condemnation before God.</S>
   <S PAR='196' RSNT='1' SNO='196'>We come out of condemnation before God through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='197' RSNT='1' SNO='197'>Our acting out at baptism is only for our salvation before man.</S>
   <S PAR='198' RSNT='1' SNO='198'>May the Lord be gracious to us and make us clear about our salvation.</S>
