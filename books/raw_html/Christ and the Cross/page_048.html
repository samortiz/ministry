<h1 class="title">THE CROSS AND SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:14; Rom. 6:6-7; Gal. 6:14; 5:16-17, 24-25; Heb. 2:14; 10:19-20; Gal. 2:20; 1 Cor. 2:2, 4, 14-15; Matt. 16:23-24; Phil. 3:10-11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES<br />
DEPENDING ON THE CROSS</h2>
<p>Spiritual experiences refer to experiencing what God has prepared for us in Christ. In order to experience what God has prepared for us, we must partake of Christ, and we can partake of Christ only through the cross. The cross brings Christ to us. We gain Christ and partake of Him only through the cross. The cross is the only way for us to experience what God has prepared for us in Christ. All our spiritual experiences come through the cross and depend on the cross. This is revealed in the Bible and confirmed in our experience.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament everything in the Tent of Meeting typifies Christ. This indicates that God wants Christ to be everything to us (Heb. 9:1-14). The way that the children of Israel entered into the Tent of Meeting to partake of everything in it portrays how we enter into Christ to partake of everything that God has prepared for us in Him. Those who entered into the Tent of Meeting had to first pass through the altar. They had to deal with their sins and all their problems before entering into the Tent of Meeting and partaking of everything in the Tent of Meeting. The altar typifies the cross. This indicates that we must first deal with our sins and problems through the cross before we partake of Christ. Before entering the Tent of Meeting, a person had to pass though the altar. Similarly, in order to enter into Christ to partake of everything in Him, a person must pass through the cross.</p>
<p>The altar was the largest piece of furniture in the Tent of Meeting (Exo. 27:1). Some scholars say that the altar could contain all the utensils in the Tent of Meeting. This indicates that all the blessings in Christ are obtained through the cross. When we experience the cross, we can partake of all the blessings in Christ. When we experience the death of the cross, we can experience everything that God has prepared for us in Christ. We can partake of the blessings in Christ and experience everything that God has prepared for us only through the cross. All our spiritual experiences depend on the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND REGENERATION</h2>
<p>To be regenerated is to receive God&rsquo;s life into us, that is, to have another life, God&rsquo;s eternal life, in addition to our natural life (1 Pet. 1:3; John 3:16). Regeneration is the beginning of our spiritual experience, and it comes through the cross of Christ. When the children of Israel offended God and were bitten by fiery serpents in the wilderness, Moses lifted up a bronze serpent on a pole, and those who looked at the bronze serpent lived (Num. 21:4-9). We were dead in our sins, but when we looked at Christ on the cross, we were regenerated with God&rsquo;s eternal life (John 3:14-15). To be regenerated does not mean that we have &ldquo;mended our ways&rdquo; or &ldquo;turned over a new leaf.&rdquo; Neither is it a psychological exercise similar to the Chinese saying, which says, &ldquo;Everything in the past died yesterday, and everything is born today.&rdquo; Such a mindset does not require that we look at Christ on the cross; it requires a strong human will. Regeneration, however, is through the cross of Christ. At best, a strong will can change a person&rsquo;s outward conduct, but it cannot change his inner life; it cannot cause God&rsquo;s life to enter into him and regenerate him. Regeneration comes only through the cross of Christ.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the cross of Christ redeems us, and on the other hand, the cross releases Christ&rsquo;s life. We were dead because of sin, but through Christ&rsquo;s redemption on the cross we can receive the life that He released on the cross and be regenerated and enlivened. Apart from the cross we have no way to be regenerated with God&rsquo;s divine, eternal life. The cross frees us from sin so that we can receive the life of God. All sinners have a deadened spirit; therefore, they need to be regenerated and enlivened in their deadened spirit. The cross of Christ is the means for our regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND DELIVERANCE FROM SIN</h2>
<p>Being delivered from sin, that is, overcoming sin, is a spiritual experience that we must have after being regenerated. No regenerated person should continue to live in sin. We must be delivered from sin. This is a commandment in God&rsquo;s Word and a demand of His life within us. God&rsquo;s life demands that we be delivered from sin, and God&rsquo;s nature does not allow us to continue to live in sin. Continuing to live in sin oppresses God&rsquo;s nature in us, making us miserable and uneasy. Being delivered from sin releases God&rsquo;s life in us, making us comfortable and at ease. As those who have been regenerated and who have God&rsquo;s life and nature, we must be delivered from sin. We can be delivered from sin only through the cross.</p>
<p>Romans 6:7 says, &ldquo;He who has died is justified from sin.&rdquo; This means that only a person who has died can be delivered from sin. A person can never be delivered from sin as long as he is still alive. In order to be delivered from sin, we must die. Once we die, we are delivered from sin. Without death, there is no way to be delivered from sin. No matter how much a person resolves, how much he endeavors, how much he afflicts himself, or how much contrition he expresses, he cannot deliver himself from sin. Only death delivers a man from sin.</p>
<p>Even though death is necessary, a believer does not need to try to die, because he has already died. A person who is dead does not need to die again. Romans 6:6 says, &ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him.&rdquo; Those who are joined to Christ through faith are in Him, and therefore, they have been crucified with Him. We do not need to die again. We only need to see and believe that we have died with Christ. It is sufficient for us to confess this fact. The death of Christ has been applied to us; hence, we do not need to put ourselves to death. We have been crucified with Christ in His death on the cross; hence, we do not need to think of ways to crucify ourselves.</p>
<p>On the cross of Christ we were crucified together with Christ, and His death was a deliverance that only such a death can provide. When the cross of Christ crucified our old man, the body of sin was annulled so that we should no longer serve sin as slaves (v. 6), that is, so that we would no longer be bound by sin. To no longer be bound by sin is to be delivered from sin. Thus, the cross of Christ delivers us from sin. We are delivered from the bondage of sin when we believe and accept our death with Christ on the cross. Our experience of being delivered from sin comes from seeing and knowing our co-crucifixion with Christ.</p>
<p>When we confess and accept our co-death with Christ on the cross, when we are joined with the cross of Christ by faith, and when we live in the death of the cross of Christ, we will experience deliverance from sin. The experience of deliverance from sin is only through the cross of Christ. Being delivered from sin does not depend on our doing but on our seeing and accepting Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross. Just as regeneration does not depend on self-improvement but on seeing and accepting Christ&rsquo;s vicarious death on the cross, deliverance from sin does not depend on our resolving but on our seeing and accepting our co-crucifixion with Christ on the cross. When we accepted Christ&rsquo;s vicarious death on the cross, we experienced regeneration. Similarly, when we accept our co-crucifixion with Christ on the cross, we experience deliverance from sin.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
