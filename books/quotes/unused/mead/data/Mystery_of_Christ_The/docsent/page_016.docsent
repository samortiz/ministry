   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FUNCTION OF THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The anointing is so precious because grace flows from the Head to the Body by means of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The function of the anointing is to maintain the link between the Head and the Body, as well as the link between all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The anointing is the operation of the Holy Spirit within man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The relationship between the Holy Spirit, Christ, and the church can be compared to the nerves in the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The nerves direct and coordinate all the members of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The head communicates and directs all the members through the nerves, and through the nerves all the members are related one to another as well.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the members in the body move according to the direction of the nerves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Submitting to the nerves is submitting to the head.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, in the spiritual Body the Holy Spirit carries the thoughts of the Head to all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As members of the Body of Christ, we have to yield to the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we yield to the authority of the Holy Spirit, we are yielding to the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we grieve the Spirit, we frustrate our relationship with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We hold the Head by simply yielding to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Bible the Holy Spirit is symbolized by many things, such as the wind, the living water, and the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the same time, the Holy Spirit is also life, power, etc. However, 1 John 2:27 is particularly sweet in its description of the Holy Spirit as the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the teaching of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Holy Spirit teaches by the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not know the will of God by studying and weighing the pros and cons of a particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We know the will of God by the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Holy Spirit communicates the mind of Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not necessary to continually ask, "Is this the will of God?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"We have the mind of Christ" 1 Cor 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Head wishes a member of the Body to move, He intimates it through the anointing, and as we yield to the anointing, life flows freely from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we resist the anointing, the relationship with the Head is interfered with and the flow of life stops.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many believers miss the leading of the Lord because they are not under the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The anointing does not come directly upon the Body but upon the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Believers can receive the anointing which flows from the Head to the Body only when they are directly under the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The anointing is something very fine and soothing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The teaching of the Holy Spirit is not something rough or wild.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It does not blow on us like the wind or burn us like fire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, it anoints us like oil.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is how the Holy Spirit teaches us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Wherever there is the oil, there is the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His work does not depend on words, biblical interpretations, reasons, judgments concerning right and wrong, etc. God's work and leading within us come by way of a kind of inner sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This sense of life is the anointing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Head does not use external means to control the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"The life was the light of men" John 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In seeking to know the will of God, we cannot arrive at it by asking, "Is this right or wrong?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, we should ask, "Do I have life regarding this?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we feel dead inside, then there is no anointing, and if we act without the anointing, we are acting without the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, sometimes we may want to visit someone, but we feel cold and indifferent within.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As far as doctrines, human affections, or biblical principles are concerned, we should visit him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the more we resolve to go, the colder we become.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that the Spirit is telling us not to go.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At another time, we may visit someone and feel as if we are under some kind of sweet anointing; everything is soothing and comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the teaching that comes from the Spirit's anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more we go along with this anointing, the stronger we will be, and the more there will be an "amen" within.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The teaching of the anointing of the Spirit has nothing to do with right or wrong, what should or should not be done, or what is true or false.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is an inner feeling of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many people still work according to the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the tree from which Adam ate.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is to walk according to the principle of right and wrong; however, God's work in Christ is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a matter of the anointing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Where the anointing is, there is life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As long as one has the anointing and the life, everything is right and according to God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Those who are clever and acquainted with Bible doctrines are not necessarily more familiar with God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sometimes a brother or sister from the rural countryside may know more about God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They do not have knowledge, but they have life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If this were not God's way, He would be very unfair.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Illiterate country folk would be doomed because they would not have the mental knowledge and would be unable to know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But our God is not a respecter of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Whether or not we have the mental knowledge and whether we are clever or slow, the teaching of the anointing still abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As long as we walk according to the inner anointing of the Spirit, we will know God's will and be acquainted with God's work.</S>
