   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE NEED FOR THE FOCUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE LORD S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:9, 16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord, how we treasure this time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How we thank You for the fellowship in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We first trust in Your cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We worship You for Your cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, we thank You for Your recovery, and we thank You for Your revelation among us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can never thank You enough for all the mercies and grace You have shown us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We trust in You for the fellowship tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>O Lord, open up Your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Open up Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Open the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And open us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We would like to have a thorough fellowship, a fellowship full of light, transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, give us the freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anoint us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Give us the clear anointing with the holy anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thank You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thank You, You are now the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We look unto You not only for ourselves, but for all the churches, for all the leading ones in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We pray desperately that they all may see Your vision, that they all may see Your heart, that they all may see the desires in Your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Speak a clear word to us tonight that we all may be brought in, into Your desire, into Your move today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lord, do cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You know the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Defeat Your enemy, and destroy the power of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord, we would reject him in Your mighty name.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Satan has to be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He has to be under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Cast him under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the day for You to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Release Your truth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Release Your recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Release Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the Lord s recovery came to this country, I had a strong burden as to what I should do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And I did according to the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I had no liberty from Him to speak on other subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From the beginning I have always been in the Lord s central lane, His focus for His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord s recovery among us is absolutely different from any kind of reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are not here for a recovery of any doctrine or any practice.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because of this, in the twenty years that I have been here with you all, I have given messages only on the central lane, on the focus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because of my observation, I have become really burdened for some of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It seems some of you do not have the clear vision about this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You may be satisfied just to have a church raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is a danger ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the elders lack a clear vision as to what the Lord is doing and this vision must be very strong we are doing things in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>ARE WE BETTER THAN THE BRETHREN?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I strongly stressed this need when I gave the messages on The World Situation and God s Move.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In those messages I pointed out very clearly that it is not enough to have the best gospel preaching, the best exposition of the Bible, and the most scriptural way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These three things are respected by all Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are what the Brethren practice.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In their early days, as their writings at Darby s time indicate, the Brethren were clear about something higher and deeper than these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But by the time I got into the Brethren assembly, there were only these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I can recall when I was with them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They did not even stress gospel preaching that much.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Mainly they emphasized Bible teaching, the exposition of the types and practices and the teaching of the different books.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It was a help to me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They also insisted that everything, every little thing, be according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Why didn t they celebrate Christmas?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It was not according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The same with the Chinese New Year.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Brethren assembly in my home town did not celebrate any holiday, including even the Chinese New Year.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It seemed very strange.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But I can recall also that there was no center, no focus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christ as God s mystery, how He was processed to be the Spirit, they never mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They had no idea of it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Nor did they have any idea about life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even regeneration they could not define.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I asked them to tell me; they had no proper definition.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As for the church as an organism to be the Lord s Body, this also was never mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>That they did not speak of the church ground there is no need to say.</S>
