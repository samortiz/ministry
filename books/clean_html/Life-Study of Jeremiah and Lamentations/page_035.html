<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah's Promise</H2><P>In asking Israel to return, Jehovah made promises to her.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Not Drop His Countenance on Her</H2><P>In verse 12 Jehovah promised that He would not drop His countenance on her; for He is merciful and will not preserve, that is not exercise, His anger forever. He may be angry temporarily but not forever.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Take Her and Bring Her to Zion</H2><P>Being a Husband to Israel, Jehovah promised to take them, one from a city and two from a family, and bring them back to Zion (v. 14). This means that He would still receive them, that He would still take them back.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. To Give Her Shepherds according to His Own Heart</H2><P>Jehovah also promised to give Israel shepherds according to His own heart (v. 15). Such shepherds would feed her knowledge and understanding. Israel was foolish and did not know anything, but these shepherds would give her the proper knowledge and understanding of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. A Revival Being Promised to Her by Him</H2><P>In verses 16 through 18 we see that a revival was promised to Israel by Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. She Being Multiplied and Increased in the Land</H2><P>In the promised revival Israel would be multiplied and increased in the land (v. 16a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Ark of the Covenant<br>No Longer Being Cared For by Her</H2><P>"They will no longer say, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah! And it will not come to mind, nor will they remember it or visit it; it will not be made again" (v. 16b). At that time the ark of the covenant will no longer be cared for by Israel as God's meeting place with her, as His meeting place with His people, for Christ will be present with her and reign in Jerusalem.</P><P>In Samuel's time, when the children of Israel went out to fight, they brought the ark out to fight for them. Of course, the ark was a type of Christ as the embodiment of God Jehovah. However, they became superstitious concerning the ark, and it became for them a kind of idol. They had no heart for God, yet they treasured the ark. Eventually, this ark did not help them or fight for them. They were defeated and captured, and the ark also was captured (1 Sam. 4:10-11). In their view God was defeated. Actually, He was not defeated but prevailed over Satan.</P><P>Today many Christians consider the Bible in a superstitious way, making it an idol. They treasure the Bible, yet they may care little for the very God revealed in the Bible. Such Christians have made the Bible something separate from God, when actually the Bible should be one with God. Today is a time of degradation, but a time will come when Christ, the embodiment of God, will be with us, and we will have no need for the Bible. Likewise, when Israel is revived, no one will care for the ark because Christ will be present with Israel and reign in Jerusalem.</P>
