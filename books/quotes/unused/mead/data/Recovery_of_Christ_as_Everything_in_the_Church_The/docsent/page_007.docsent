   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sanctification is closely related to holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Holiness is objective and refers to God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s doings are righteousness, and His nature is holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When objective holiness becomes our subjective experience, it is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Holiness is an objective nature, and sanctification is a subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be sanctified is to have God s nature and to be separated unto God from anything other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our living may be righteous but not yet sanctified, for we may be right with God and with man but still not separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we grow in Christ, our life will first become righteous, and it will eventually become sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A young sister may have been dishonest before she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Perhaps she took something from a department store without paying for it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This may have even become a habit of hers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After she is saved, however, she stops stealing and becomes completely honest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is righteousness; it is Christ within her as the power and the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After a period of time, when she goes to the department store, the Lord may inwardly bother her when she considers buying a certain item.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Something within tells her that it is not holy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although she would be acting righteously by purchasing the item rather than stealing it, Christ within her as sanctification convicts her that it is a worldly item.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This illustrates the difference between righteousness and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We enjoy Christ as power and wisdom not only for righteousness but also for sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way we become righteous and sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to be not only righteous and sanctified but also redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Redemption is necessary because we were created as God s possession, but we were lost in the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, God had to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, our redemption was once for all in a general way when we first believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, because we were all born in a completely fallen condition, we still need to be redeemed in all the areas of our being, including our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our every thought needs to be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although I have been saved for over half a century, even today I still need to be redeemed in some areas.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is the power and the wisdom for us to be righteous, sanctified, and redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our life may be righteous but not fully sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our life also may be sanctified but not fully redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose I buy a necktie from a department store.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If I pay in full, I am righteous, but if the tie is worldly, I am not sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, I may be sanctified if I buy a tie that is not worldly, but if my thoughts then become proud because my mind is natural, I still need to be redeemed in my thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to be righteous, sanctified, and redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These are three aspects of our Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every Christian should live a life that is righteous, sanctified, and redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even if we are righteous and sanctified, we still need to be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For instance, we may love others in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may be kind to our neighbors but in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because we have not been fully redeemed from our fallen condition, we should pray, Lord, I need You as my power and wisdom to be righteous, sanctified, and redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I do not want to remain in a fallen state, living naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I do not want to remain in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God has transferred me into You, and I want to abide in You to be redeemed from my natural way of thinking, my natural way of loving others, and my natural way of making decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do not want to express myself, Lord; I want to express only You.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I need to be redeemed from my natural attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Several good Bible teachers have pointed out that righteousness, sanctification, and redemption refer to three stages of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First, Christ became our righteousness for our past.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now Christ is sanctification for our present living.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the future, when Christ comes, our body will be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I agree with this, but I believe that righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are also three aspects of our daily Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every day we need Christ as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Day by day Christ is the power and the wisdom for us to have such a proper Christian living that is righteous, sanctified, and redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>CHRIST BEING THE DEPTHS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In 1 Corinthians 2:9-10 Paul says, As it is written, Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man s heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ is the depths, or the deep things, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Everything in human society is superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, we enjoy something deep Christ as the deep things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ is deeper than scientific knowledge; He is the deepest thing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Unbelievers may have education and wealth, but these things are shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As those who love the Lord, we enjoy something deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our joy and our inner strength are deep.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are often a mystery to our unsaved friends and relatives because we have something within that is deep.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is easy to see what unbelievers have, because it is superficial, but what we have is mysterious because it is deep.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They may wonder why we are joyful when we are outwardly suffering loss.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are joyful because we have Christ, the depths of God.</S>
