<h2 class="head1">TEACHING PEOPLE<br />
TO SING THE HYMNS AND SONGS</h2>
<p>We also should learn to teach people to sing a hymn or a song. Some would say that they are not good singers, but not many people are. I have published five hymnals, but I am not an accomplished singer. Good singing may only provide amusement for people&rsquo;s ears. You may sing poorly, but if you sing in life, you will stir up people&rsquo;s interest to consider the spiritual things. Simply go to the home meetings to teach people to sing hymns. You should not sing a long hymn, mostly just one or two stanzas with a chorus. Most children and young people like to sing. Therefore, you must learn to use some hymns and songs and how to sing with people. To learn the Bible, to learn the truths in our publications, and to learn the hymns all need time and labor.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TEACHING PEOPLE TO PRAY</h2>
<p>Presenting people written pages and teaching them to sing will lead them to prayer. You must learn to never let a person go without prayer. You yourself must be a very prayerful person, a praying person. You must learn to pray all the time. Then you will lead people to the point of prayer. The most effective way to close the deal in your speaking with people is prayer. It is by prayer and through prayer that people spontaneously exercise their spirit. In their spirit they will meet the Spirit. That means they will touch the Lord. When they touch the Lord, they will be touched. That is good enough. The worst thing that could happen is that in your visit you would have too much talk without the spirit of prayer. You must lead people into prayer. Often many persons will say that they do not know how to pray. Then you must pray, and tell them to follow you in the way you are praying. You must open and begin the prayer. Then you may say, &ldquo;Will you please follow me? What I say, you say.&rdquo; To bring people into the spirit of prayer always requires much practice. If you would give me a hammer, I may use it in a wrong way because I have not practiced using it. You have to practice using all the points I am giving to you. I believe that many doors will open to you, and you will have good opportunities to practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STIRRING UP THE INTEREST<br />
OF ALL THE MEMBERS IN THE HOME<br />
TO SHARE IN THE ACTIVITIES IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>You must also learn how to stir up people&rsquo;s interest in sharing, in participating, in the meeting activities. In the past we always had meetings in the way of some gifted ones doing everything in them. They prayed, sang, read the Bible, and did mostly everything. That was absolutely wrong. First, you can stir up the members of the home to be very much interested in singing. Let them sing spontaneously. Do not make a schedule for the home meeting&mdash;when to sing a hymn, when to pray, when to talk, and when to read the books. That is too dead. If in a home a young girl or boy would sing what they heard you sing, take the opportunity to follow their lead. Then the meeting will begin, and the child will be stirred up with an interest to participate in the activities of the meeting. Sometimes you may even ask a little boy to read a paragraph. You may ask the wife to read a note. Do not do everything by yourself. Always try your best to bring people into the activities. After three or four weeks all of them will be knowledgeable about the activities in the meeting. Do not explain to them beforehand how to meet. When they do something, confirm that it is right and tell them that all the meetings will be their responsibility. This will be a very good training to them. They will learn how to carry on a meeting. Maybe after two months, some of them will go to their relatives to set up meetings in their homes. What you do will be very productive. Learn to use the written word, learn to use singing, and learn to stir up people&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD, THE SPIRIT, SINGING, AND PRAYING</h2>
<p>For going into the homes of the new contacts to set up meetings, you need four items: the Word, the Spirit, singing, and praying. A meeting could always be stirred up or carried on by the Word of God, by the Spirit, by your singing, and also by your praying. Ephesians 5:18-19 and Colossians 3:16 show us that to have a Christian meeting, we need these four elements. For this reason you must become familiar with the Recovery Version and with the booklets. You must also be persons daily filled inwardly with the Spirit.</p>
<p>You must have these four elements&mdash;the Word, the Spirit, singing, and praying. Then you can stir up a meeting. Without these four elements, what could you do? You must give others the Word. When you give them the Word, the Spirit is working. Likewise, you must exercise in singing. You should sing spontaneously, call on the Lord, and pray in the meeting. Such a meeting will be rich. As long as you are there, everything should be stirred up with these four elements. Have a meeting of about thirty to forty minutes, and go back the next week to do the same thing. You will see the result. We all have to treasure the homes. Regardless of how they respond, do not give them up. Pray for them, nourish them, and care for them so that they always keep their home open to you.</p>
