   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE GENERAL ATTITUDE FOR UNITY Scripture reading: Romans 14:1-6; 15:7 TODAY'S PROBLEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The problems most prevailing today in Christianity are mostly due to our different opinions regarding certain things, and these different opinions are due to a shortage of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all have our own tastes and our own concepts in so many matters; but if we are in our opinions and our concepts, we only cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For instance, regarding the matter of baptism, there are many different opinions, and they have caused much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, if we are full of Christ, we will not care for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE APOSTLE'S ATTITUDE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The attitude of the Apostle Paul in Romans 14 regarding different concepts of eating and the keeping of days was exceedingly liberal and general.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the teaching of the Bible, it is abundantly clear that today under God's grace, there is no need to make distinctions regarding the things we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All things are good for food, both meat and herbs there is no difference in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can eat herbs, and we can eat any kind of meat.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Apostle Paul knew this better than we.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But in this chapter he said not a word according to the doctrine regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, he said, "Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you eat all things, do not despise those who do not; if you do not eat all things, do not criticize those who do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What a liberal attitude the Apostle tells us that we should take!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As to the doctrine, he said not a word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Concerning the keeping of days, the Apostle said, "One esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Again the Apostle took a very liberal attitude, not saying which was right or which was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the Scriptures, we should not keep any day in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today, under the Lord's grace, every day is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even the Sabbath differs not from any other day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Apostle knew this quite well, but he did not speak concerning the right teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not say whether esteeming one day above another is right, or whether esteeming every day alike is right.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He only said, "He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His attitude was truly liberal!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Could we be so liberal?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must be so liberal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By the Lord's mercy and grace, we must learn to be so liberal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not mean that we should be liberal regarding the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must be absolutely definite concerning the Lord and the church as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But could we be liberal with all other things?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whether or not a brother or sister should do a certain thing depends upon his or her feeling before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they feel they should do it, let them do it unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps they will feel that they need not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then let them not do it unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the Lord wants them to do it, they should not say no to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not have any legal regulations, and we should not attempt to make everyone alike.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we insist upon having certain things in uniformity, we are legal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If one eats herbs and feels that everyone should also eat herbs, it will cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As long as the brothers and sisters do not do things that are sinful, we should not trouble them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should only be definite regarding Christ as life and the church as the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>With all other things, we must learn from the Apostle Paul to be very liberal and general.</S>
