   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE FORTY THE UNVEILING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE KINGDOM S MYSTERIES 6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we consider the parable of the net, I would like to say a further word regarding the treasure and the pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Bible the number seven is composed of four plus three, three plus four, or six plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first time the number seven is mentioned in the Bible, it is composed of the six days of creation plus one day, the Sabbath, for rest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Revelation the seven churches are composed of three plus four.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The seven seals are firstly composed of four plus three, then of six plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The principle is the same with the seven trumpets and the seven bowls.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Matthew 13 the number seven is composed firstly of four plus three, then of six plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first four parables are all related to foodstuff, but the fifth and sixth parables are related to transformation for building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although even the hardest bread can be leavened, pearl and precious stones cannot be leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, although a wafer or even hard bread may be ruined by water poured upon it, this is not true of either precious stones or pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord s word in Matthew 13 is not merely a prophecy or a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is also a vision of the practical situation of today s Christianity with respect to the church and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord s word about the mysteries of the kingdom is not idealistic or ethereal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is practical.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, if we would understand these parables, we must look to the Lord for some practical application of them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our understanding of the parables must match the practical situation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you look at today s Christendom, you will see that the real Christians are the wheat and that the false Christians have been mixed with the real ones to frustrate their growth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everywhere on earth, especially in Europe, we see more false Christians than real ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Catholic countries like Italy and Brazil it is difficult to find one genuine Christian among many so-called Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the interpretation of the tares as being false Christians is not only doctrinal, but also practical according to history and the present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, the big tree stands before us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every day we behold the huge fa ade of Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is neither doctrine nor mere prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In front of our eyes we have the practical fulfillment of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We also see leaven everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Christendom there is leaven in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every aspect and every corner of Christendom has been leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If there is a little truth, there is a great deal of leaven added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the actual situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can interpret the first four parables in a practical way and apply them in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we must do the same with the fifth and sixth parables.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Recently the Lord has shown us the practical way to understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to understand any prophecy in a practical way we need the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only when we see the facts can we understand the prophecy of these parables in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Lord s recovery we have the treasure and the pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the first four parables we have the wheat, the tares, the mustard, and the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are not the tares; we are the wheat and the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, in the Lord s recovery it is not adequate simply to be wheat or fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are just wheat or fine flour, we shall not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Lord s recovery there is also a pearl and the treasure, the precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In His recovery the Lord must have a church that is pure, solid, and genuine like a pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In such a pearl there is no mixture or opaqueness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, it is absolutely pure and bright.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you would know what the church in the Lord s recovery is, look at a pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By looking at a pearl, you will know what the church should be.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although we are not yet completely satisfied, we can say that the churches in the Lord s recovery are like pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No matter how solid bread may be, it is still possible for it to be leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But when the church has become a pearl, it can no longer be leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Who could put leaven into pearl or precious stone?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the Lord s recovery we on the one hand must be like a pearl and on the other hand like precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Concerning life, we are the pearl; concerning our living, we are the treasure, the precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Look at the New Jerusalem: all the gates are pearls, but the walls are built with precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The pearl gates are for entrance, for the beginning; and the walls are for expression.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church is our life, and the kingdom is our living.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As the church, we have been regenerated out of the Satan-corrupted world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But we are not only the pearl for the beginning, the entrance; we are also the precious stone for the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This signifies our living under the heavenly ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As the church, we are the pearl having life, a new start, and an entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As the kingdom, we are the treasure, the precious stone, standing there as something that has been built up to express Christ under the heavenly constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is our living and our expression.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some teachers say that the kingdom is related to Israel, but maybe no one says that the pearl is related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those who relate the kingdom to Israel are too doctrinal and dispensational, not at all practical.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to apply the parables of the treasure and the pearl not only in a doctrinal way or a dispensational way, but also in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In order to apply them in a practical way, we must see that during the period of the existence of Christendom, the Lord is working to gain the treasure and the pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Christendom continues with the wheat, the tares, the big tree, and the leaven in the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But the Lord spoke not only the four parables for Christendom, but two parables for the genuine and proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The churches in the Lord s recovery are in the fifth and sixth parables.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The churches in the recovery today are the treasure and the pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As far as life is concerned, we are the pearl; and as far as our living is concerned, we are the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For life, we are the pearl gates; for our living, we are the walls made of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This latter is the kingdom life, the living of the church under God s dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This enables us to have a fuller understanding of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The twelve pearl gates signify the church as the entrance, and the walls built with precious stones signify the kingdom, the expression of living under the heavenly rule.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When you say, Lord Jesus, how I thank You that I have the divine life, that is the pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But when you say, O Lord, grant me more grace that I may be poor in spirit and pure in heart, that I may be under Your ruling, that I may be dealt with by You so that I will not have any rocks or thorns within me, and that I may live under the heavenly constitution, you immediately become the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>On the one hand, we are the pearl; on the other hand, we are the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The fifth parable speaks of a man finding a treasure and the sixth, of the merchant seeking a pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>For the kingdom, Christ is the man, and for the church, He is the merchant.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This fits in with the concept of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The kingdom requires a man.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In order to have God s kingdom on earth, there is the need of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Christ came as this man, not as the first man, but as the second man.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Firstly this man found the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then, because of the rejection of Israel, He hid the kingdom from the Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For the church, Christ is the merchant, one who is always seeking to gain something of high value.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Regarding the kingdom, the man bought the field, the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The reason he bought the earth is that the kingdom is in the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>However, in order to gain the pearl, the merchant did not purchase the sea; rather, he bought only the pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Christ is the One who bought the pearl directly, but He did not buy the treasure directly.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Instead, He bought the field directly.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Although Christ redeemed the church and the earth, He did not redeem the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The kingdom does not require a redeemer or a buyer.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, the lost earth, the earth created by God and then lost, requires a redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Furthermore, the church as God s chosen and predestinated people also requires a buyer because those people became lost.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Therefore, the kingdom needs only a man, but the church needs a merchant and a redeemer.</S>
