<h1 class="title">The Reigning Christ Recovering the Earth by Watering</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 72</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>At His second coming, Christ will take possession of the earth, which has been given to Him as His possession, and will establish God&rsquo;s kingdom on the whole earth, thus recovering God&rsquo;s right over the earth&mdash;Psa. 24:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Psalm 24:7-10 unveils the victorious Christ as the coming King in God&rsquo;s eternal kingdom.</li>
	<li>The King of glory is Jehovah of hosts, the consummated Triune God embodied in the victorious and coming Christ&mdash;vv. 7-10; Luke 21:27; Matt. 25:31:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Jehovah is Jesus (1:21 and footnote), and Jesus is the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Triune God, who is strong in fighting and is victorious&mdash;Rev. 5:5.</li>
		<li>He is the One who will come back in His resurrection with His overcomers to possess the earth as His kingdom&mdash;Dan. 2:34-35; 7:13-14; Joel 3:11; Rev. 11:15; 19:13-14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Whereas Psalm 69 is on the suffering Christ, typified by the suffering David, Psalm 72 is on the reigning Christ, typified by the reigning Solomon:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Psalm 72 is actually a psalm on King Solomon, who is a type of Christ as the reigning One&mdash;Matt. 12:42.</li>
	<li>Solomon is a type of Christ as the son of David, the One who inherits the throne and kingdom of David&mdash;1:1; 2 Sam. 7:12-13; Luke 1:32-33.</li>
	<li>After His life of suffering on earth, typified by the sufferings of David, Christ ascended to the heavens, where He is now reigning as the King, typified by Solomon&mdash;1 Cor. 15:25; Rev. 17:14.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The reigning Christ is typified in Psalm 72 by the reigning Solomon, the son of David (Matt. 1:1; 22:42), in his prosperous and flourishing time (1 Kings 9&mdash;10), as indicated by the title of this psalm and by the first verse:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Psalm 72 reveals Christ reigning over the earth, with all the kings bowing down to Him and all the nations serving Him&mdash;vv. 8-11.</li>
	<li>Psalm 72 is a glorious picture of what it will be like for the Lord to recover, possess, and reign over the whole earth&mdash;vv. 17-19.</li>
	<li>The reign of Christ, typified by Solomon, will be in the millennium in the age of restoration&mdash;Rev. 20:4, 6; Matt. 19:28.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The reigning of Christ will be in righteousness and in justice, by which peace will be ushered in&mdash;Psa. 72:1-4, 7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When Christ returns, He will be the King ruling over the entire earth with righteousness and justice&mdash;89:14a; Isa. 32:1, 17; 11:4-5; 61:11b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Righteousness is a matter of God&rsquo;s kingdom, for it is related to God&rsquo;s government, administration, and rule&mdash;Matt. 6:33; Psa. 89:14a; 97:2b.</li>
		<li>Justice is righteousness with a judgment; without judgment, there is no possibility of justice.</li>
		<li>Justice comes from judgment according to a person&rsquo;s righteousness, and it declares his righteousness.</li>
		<li>This corresponds with the fact that the foundation of God&rsquo;s throne in the New Jerusalem is pure gold, signifying God&rsquo;s nature in the attributes of righteousness and justice&mdash;Rev. 21:18b; 22:1; Isa. 32:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Peace is a sign that righteousness and justice are present; as a result of Christ&rsquo;s rule with righteousness and justice, the earth will be full of peace&mdash;vv. 16-17.</li>
	<li>There will be no peace until Christ returns; under His rule, peace will begin its reign&mdash;9:6-7; cf. 1 Thes. 5:3; Jer. 6:14.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 72 reveals that in His reigning, Christ will recover the earth by watering&mdash;vv. 6, 8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;He will drop like rain upon mown grass, / Like abundant showers dripping on the earth&rdquo;&mdash;v. 6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ gains the earth not by fighting and judging but by watering.</li>
		<li>In His coming back, the Lord will not mainly exercise His righteous judgment; rather, He will come primarily like showers to water the earth.</li>
		<li>Christ will have mercy on the earth, and He will come back graciously like showers of rain to water the barren land and to satisfy the depressed and empty people&mdash;v. 6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The whole earth is a dry and barren wilderness, and many evil things spring forth from this drought and dryness; people are often sinful because they are disappointed and dissatisfied&mdash;John 4:14-18.</li>
			<li>The Lord Jesus will be the King, not merely by exercising power to subdue others but mainly by supplying living water to satisfy the thirsty ones&mdash;Rev. 22:17.</li>
			<li>In that day all nations will be rained upon by the Lord Jesus and will be happy under His dominion; all will be satisfied by His living water&mdash;Isa. 35:6b-7a; 41:18; 43:19-20; Zech. 14:16-17.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;He will have dominion from sea to sea / And from the River unto the ends of the earth&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 72:8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s kingdom will spread to the ends of the earth by His flowing as a river&mdash;Dan. 2:44; Rev. 11:15; Joel 3:18:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ will have dominion from sea to sea and will flow as a river to the ends of the earth; where the flow is, there His dominion will be.</li>
			<li>The Lord&rsquo;s dominion will be by Himself as the flowing river; He will gain the dominion and recover the earth by His watering.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus will recover the earth by means of the river that will flow from Jerusalem&mdash;Ezek. 47:1-12; Joel 3:18:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In that day the center of the earth will be Jerusalem, and the center of Jerusalem will be the house of God, from which the river will flow.</li>
			<li>This river will reach all the earth in four directions, as in Genesis 2:10-14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In the Scriptures the concept of the divine stream is crucial&mdash;v. 10; Psa. 46:4a; John 7:37-39; Rev. 22:1-2:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Bible reveals the flowing Triune God&mdash;the Father as the fountain of life, the Son as the spring of life, and the Spirit as the river of life&mdash;Jer. 2:13; Psa. 36:9a; John 4:14; 7:37-39.</li>
			<li>The source of the flow is the throne of God and of the Lamb&mdash;Rev. 22:1.</li>
			<li>In the Scriptures there is only one flow, only one divine stream:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) The divine stream, which has been flowing throughout the generations, is uniquely one&mdash;Gen. 2:10-14; Rev. 22:1.</li>
				<li>2) Since there is only one divine stream and since the flow is uniquely one, we need to keep ourselves in this one flow.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>Where the divine stream flows, we have the life of God, the fellowship of the Body, the testimony of Jesus, and the work of God&mdash;1 John 1:1-3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In His kingdom the reigning Christ will recover the earth by means of this river, the unique divine stream&mdash;Psa. 72:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
