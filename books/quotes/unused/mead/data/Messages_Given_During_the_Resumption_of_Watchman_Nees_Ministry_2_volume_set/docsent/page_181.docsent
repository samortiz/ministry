   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I am rich, I cannot be a good Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thoroughly Handing Oneself Over</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Chan Kwang-hsien from Hangchow testified: Those who are entangled with affairs cannot serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are the Lord's soldiers, and we are trained daily for the purpose of going to war.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During the past two years, I saw in Romans 12 that it is a reasonable thing for us to offer ourselves as a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not obey the Lord, we will be in trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If salt loses its taste, it will become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not hand ourselves over to the Lord in a thorough way, what we do will amount to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everything belongs to the Lord, and everything of the Lord is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can never be separated from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If I do not follow the Lord, I will remain in the world, and in the world there is only darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even when we make some money, we will not have peace, and we will not be able to sleep well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May the Lord remove our foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the One who abides forever.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Handing Over One's Riches to Become Free</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brother Chang Yu-lan from Nanking testified: I am quite old already, and I have been saved seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the past, through my work in scientific research, my two eyes were damaged by an explosion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After I prayed, the Lord recovered one of my eyes, which can now see clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have three shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first is that I am short in consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Consecration requires concrete expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without concrete expressions, it is not enough just to have the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now, everyone is handing over themselves with a consecration slip.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I must therefore hand myself over also.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Second, I have been a major general for twenty years, and all the officers have been very good to me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is difficult to cut off this relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Third, there is the problem of serving mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Mammon has put my body and soul under bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I can have twenty million dollars with me, but what good does that do if my mind is in bondage?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If I cannot get through in this matter, money will still exercise its influence on me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If I hand over my wealth and I die, everything will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But to be a living sacrifice is more troublesome, because I still have to live.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am willing to hand over everything I have to the apostles, and I am willing to be without any opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I hand myself over, I become free.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many people have died in the hands of the Communists; their goods were confiscated.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is better that I consecrate everything to the Lord instead.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Brother Witness Lee laid hands on him and prayed for him: Lord, gain our brother within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Your works are eternal works.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May You work more and more in our brother, that his spirit will become stronger and stronger, that his eyes will become brighter and brighter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the Body's prayer, and we believe that the Head affirms it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>May those who touch him see light daily, and may he be able to send others away in blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Accomplish for him what he purposes in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Prepare for him a job that exceeds all that we ask or think.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May You cover him much with Your blood for Your testimony's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Strengthen our brother's inner man, until the day we see You.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brother Hsia Wen-tsao testified: In the past, I was always bound.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Two years ago today, I had a thousand mou Chinese acre of land and a fabric store.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although I was strong outwardly, I was weak inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today, all these things are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I should have consecrated everything then, and I would have saved so many souls.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today, if we do not give ourselves to the Lord, Satan will not let us go; he will try to gain us.</S>
