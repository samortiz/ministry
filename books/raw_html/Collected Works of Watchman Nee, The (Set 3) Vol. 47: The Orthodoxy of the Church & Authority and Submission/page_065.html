<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE PROPER LIMIT<br />OF SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 11:23; Exo. 1:17; Dan. 3:17-18; 6:10; Matt. 2:13; Acts 5:29</h1><h2 class="head1">SUBMISSION BEING ABSOLUTE,<br />BUT OBEDIENCE BEING RELATIVE</h2><p>Submission is a matter of attitude, but obedience is a matter of conduct. Acts 4:19 says, "But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you judge." The apostles, however, were not rebellious in their spirit; they were still submitting to all those who were in authority. Obedience is not absolute. Some authorities we have to obey, but others we cannot obey. The latter include those who touch on basic matters of the Christian faith, such as our belief in the Lord and the liberty of preaching the gospel. A son can say anything to his father. But there cannot be any attitude of rebellion. Our submission should always be absolute. In some matters we can be obedient at the same time that we are submissive. In other matters we cannot be obedient, but we still have to remain submissive. All these are a matter of attitude.</p><p>Acts 15 is an example of a church conference. In a conference we can suggest or debate. But when the decision is reached, everyone should be submissive.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIMIT OF OBEYING THE DEPUTY AUTHORITY</h2><p>If there are parents who force their children to stop attending church meetings, the children should be submissive in their attitude, but they must not obey. This is like the apostles preaching the gospel. When the Jewish synagogue stopped them, they were submissive in their attitude, but in practice they went on according to the commission of the Lord. They chose to preach the gospel rather than be restricted by the synagogue. It was not a defiance with quarrels and shouting, but a defiance with calmness. At any rate, there must never be any attitude of stubbornness or words of contradiction against those in authority. Once a man meets authority, he becomes soft and pliant. The submission of a person in heart, attitude, and words must be absolute. There must not be any stubbornness or rebellion.</p><p>When the deputy authority (the one representing God's authority) clashes with the direct authority (God), one must be submissive to the deputy authority but must not be obedient to it. We will summarize the matter in three points:</p><p>(1) Obedience is a matter of conduct; it is relative. Submission is a matter of attitude; it is absolute.</p><p>(2) Only God is the object of unlimited submission. Man, who is less than God, should only receive limited submission.</p><p>(3) If the deputy authority gives an order that is obviously contrary to God's order, we can only submit; we cannot obey. We must submit only to the authority of God. We do not obey the orders that are contrary to God.</p><p>If parents ask their children to go to places that the children do not like to go to, and if there is no sin involved in the matter, we have a borderline case. Submission is absolute. But obedience is another matter. If your parents force you to go, then you have no choice but to go. But if they do not force you to do it, you do not have to go. If all children have this attitude, God will release them in their environments.</p>
