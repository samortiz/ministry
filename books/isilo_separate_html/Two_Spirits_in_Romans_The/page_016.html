<h1 class="title">THE SPIRIT OF LIFE SUPPLYING LIFE<br />
TO THE THREE PARTS OF THE BELIEVERS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:6, 10-11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT AND LIFE IN ROMANS 8</h2>
<p>Romans 8 is a rich, mysterious, and abstract word. The first eighteen verses are especially abstract and mysterious because the main components of these verses are the Spirit and life. We may know that this chapter covers the two spirits&mdash;the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers&mdash;but these two spirits are mysterious and abstract. The Spirit, who indwells us as the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the resurrecting One, is altogether mysterious and abstract. Furthermore, our spirit is the most abstract and mysterious part of our being. First Peter 3:4 says that our spirit is the hidden man of the heart; therefore, it is something within our heart. Our heart is quite mysterious and abstract, but within our heart is our spirit, which is more abstract and mysterious. Life also is abstract and mysterious. Even our physical life is difficult to comprehend. Scientists and medical doctors cannot adequately define the human life. Romans 8 speaks of the divine life, the uncreated life of God, that was given to us at the time we believed in Christ. Such a life is much more mysterious than the human life.</p>
<p>The first half of Romans 8 concerns mainly the Spirit and life, which are critical, central, and practical. However, most Christians rarely consider the Spirit and life. Even when we are revived and stirred up to love the Lord, we usually do not consider the Spirit or life. Instead, we spontaneously consider our behavior, deeds, and conduct. When we are cold toward the Lord, we do not care much about our conduct. However, when we have a heart for the Lord and begin to care for the spiritual things, we immediately begin to consider our behavior, conduct, and deeds. We often make up our mind and pray for the Lord&rsquo;s grace and mercy to help us behave better and improve our conduct. Perhaps we make up our mind to be kind, respectful, and loving toward our family members. To consider behavior and conduct rather than the Spirit and life shows that we are superficial and childish in the spiritual things.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s way is the way of life. Life is not conveyed to us by teaching or doctrine but is imparted to us through, by, and with the Spirit. Romans 8:2 uses a unique title for the Spirit&mdash;<em>the Spirit of life.</em> The threefold Spirit mentioned in verses 9 and 11&mdash;the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the resurrecting One&mdash;is the Spirit of life. In a phrase such as <em>the Spirit of life,</em> according to Greek grammar, the nouns are in apposition. Thus, the expression <em>the Spirit of life</em> indicates that Spirit is life, that the Spirit and life are one. In the same principle, the expression <em>the Spirit of God</em> means that the Spirit is God, and the expression <em>the Spirit of Christ</em> means that the Spirit is Christ. Likewise, the expression <em>the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead</em> indicates that the Spirit is the resurrecting One. Therefore, the Spirit is life, God, Christ, and the resurrecting One.</p>
<p>Verse 2 also reveals that the Spirit conveys life. Just as the current of electricity conveys electricity, the Spirit of life conveys and imparts life into our being. The Spirit who indwells us infuses the divine life into every part of our being. Our concept is that we need to improve our behavior, conduct, and deeds, but God&rsquo;s concept is to infuse Himself into us as our life supply. Therefore, we must have a change in our concept. When we are revived, we should not think about our behavior but should pick up God&rsquo;s concept to consider the inner life supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING SUPPLIED<br />
TO OUR SPIRIT, MIND, AND BODY</h2>
<p>Our spirit needs the supply of life. Our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;our entire soul&mdash;also need the infusion of the divine life. Our body also needs the life supply. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness.&rdquo; Christ is in us, and He is the life supply to our spirit. Verse 10 does not say that our spirit is living but that our spirit is life. Living is a condition, but it is not life itself. Our spirit is life because Christ, who is within us, supplies our spirit with life, causing our spirit to become life. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;The mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo; Thus, our mind also is life. Verse 11 says, &ldquo;He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies.&rdquo; Life is supplied to our spirit, mind, and mortal body.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
