   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT ISAAC IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD'S PROVISIONS IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: Gal 3:26-29; 4:6-7, 28, 31; 5:1; John 15:4a; Rom 6:5-7, 11; Eph 2:4-6; Gal 2:20; Phil 1:21a; 1 Cor 1:30 THE INHERITANCE GOD HAS PREPARED IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We know that a man is saved by grace and not by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But this does not mean that grace is limited to our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, the book of Romans tells us that a sinner is saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the other hand, the book of Galatians tells us that after a man is saved by grace, he should go on in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans tells us that a Christian begins by grace, while Galatians tells us that a Christian continues in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Galatians 3:3 says, "Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, a Christian should not depend on grace just for his beginning; he should depend on grace continually.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When a man is saved, he does not need to do anything by his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All that he has to do is trust in God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As he progresses, he still does not need to do anything by his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Again, all that he has to do is trust in God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the characteristic of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is continuing in the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not only is our beginning a matter of grace, but our continuation is also a matter of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From the beginning to the end, it is a matter of receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament our Isaac is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is God's only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He has become Isaac for us so that we can enjoy God's inheritance in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Two Aspects of Grace</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible shows us that there are two aspects of the inheritance which God has given to us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the other hand, Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, there are two aspects of God's joining us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, we are in Christ, and on the other hand, Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We cannot confuse the order of these two unions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First we are in Christ, and then Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why the Lord's Word says, "Abide in Me and I in you...He who abides in Me and I in him..."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John 15:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our being in Christ has to do with the facts that are in Christ, while Christ being in us has to do with the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, our being in Christ touches Christ's work, while Christ being in us touches Christ's life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we are in Christ, all the facts that are in Christ become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Christ is in us, all the power that is in Christ becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we are in Christ, everything that Christ has accomplished becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Christ is in us, everything that Christ can accomplish becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we are in Christ, we receive everything that Christ has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Christ is in us, we receive everything that Christ is today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we are in Christ, all the works that Christ accomplished in the past become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Christ is in us, all that Christ is and can do today becomes ours.</S>
