<h1 class="title">LEAVING THE ORDINANCES OF RELIGION<br />
TO LIVE BY CHRIST AS OUR PERSON</h1>

<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S INTENTION CONCERNING<br />
CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is to impart Christ, the wonderful One, into His many believers so that He may have the church as a Body for Christ. His goal is to have a great universal man with Christ as the Head and the church as the Body (Eph. 2:15; Col. 2:19). He does not care for circumcision, the Sabbath, or ordinances concerning eating. He also does not care for methods of baptism, manners of head covering, whether or not we wash one another&rsquo;s feet, or whether we use grape juice or wine for the Lord&rsquo;s table. God cares only for Christ and the church. In the Old Testament, God commanded His people to practice circumcision, to keep the Sabbath, and to eat only clean things. On the eighth day after a Hebrew male was born, he had to be circumcised. Then every seven days a Jew needed to keep the Sabbath, and every day he had to follow the regulations concerning eating according to Leviticus 11. All these were required by the holy Word, and to keep these practices in the Old Testament age was absolutely right. Eventually, however, the Jews paid more attention to these matters than to God Himself, thus creating the outward religion of Judaism.</p>
<p>God had no intention to form a religion of circumcision, the Sabbath, and regulations concerning eating. His intention was to use circumcision as a type of dealing with the flesh, the Sabbath as a type of Christ being rest to people, and the regulations about eating as a type of our holy living in Christ in our contact with others (see Lev. 11 and footnotes in the Recovery Version). Not knowing this, however, the Jews received these outward items in the Word of God merely according to their human mentality and religious nature and formed them into a religion, while forgetting God Himself and neglecting His purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JESUS COMING OUTSIDE OF THE JUDAISTIC RELIGION</h2>
<p>In the fullness of times God came in the flesh, and He did not come in a religious way. The religious way of Judaism was a matter of the temple, the altar, the offerings, the priesthood, and regulations. The Jews supposed that these things were the way for them to contact God and the way for God to come to them. However, God came in an altogether different way. He came not in the temple but in a little manger, a crib where cattle are fed (Luke 2:7). Moreover, there were no priests present at His birth, nor were there the offerings of the altar. After His birth, this little babe did not go to Jerusalem. Instead, He went into Egypt, and after coming out from Egypt, He went to Galilee of the Gentiles, to the small town of Nazareth where He was raised (Matt. 2:13-15, 23). Nevertheless, this Jesus was none other than Jehovah God Himself. When Jesus was in Nazareth, God was there. If we were to seek God and worship Him at that time, we would have needed to go to Nazareth, not to Jerusalem. However, the religious people continued to go to Jerusalem because that is where the temple, the altar, the offerings, and the priests were. Moreover, when the Lord Jesus came out to work at the age of thirty, He did not go to the temple in Jerusalem but to the Jordan River to be baptized by John the Baptist, who lived outside of religion, wearing a garment of camel&rsquo;s hair and eating locusts and wild honey (3:1, 4, 13-17).</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING SAVED FROM<br />
THE PRESENT EVIL AGE OF RELIGION</h2>
<p>The Jewish religion was built upon the three pillars of the Sabbath, regulations concerning eating, and circumcision. In the Gospels, when God came in the man Jesus, He tore down the first pillar by not observing the Sabbath in a religious way and even working on the Sabbath (12:1-2, 10-13; Luke 6:6-10). The Pharisees kept the Sabbath in a religious way, but Jesus abolished the outward observance of the Sabbath in a divine way. Then after the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit annulled the regulations concerning eating. When Peter went up on the housetop to pray, a trance came upon him in which a vessel like a great sheet descended, containing every manner of four-footed animals, reptiles, and birds (Acts 10:9-16). The animals symbolize men of all kinds, and the Lord&rsquo;s command to Peter to eat them indicated his need to contact every kind of unclean (sinful) man through the gospel; this began to be fulfilled at the house of Cornelius (vv. 15, 24, 27-28; Luke 13:29). The apostle Paul tore down the third pillar of Judaism by saying, &ldquo;In Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith avails, operating through love&rdquo; (Gal. 5:6; 6:15). In this way all three pillars of Judaism were torn down. Thus, Judaism in its entirety was finished, and now God is building up the church.</p>
<p>Not long after this, however, Christianity was formed as another religion with ordinances and regulations. In the ancient times the Jews paid their full attention to the things of Judaism and not to God and His purpose. Now, in the same principle, many people pay attention to Christianity as a religion rather than to Christ and the church. In these days the Lord desires to recover our experience of Christ and the proper practice of the church life. He is bringing us back to the beginning to have only Christ and the church. At the beginning of the church life, for example, the apostles baptized people, but there was no ordinance of baptism. Likewise, the New Testament does not give us ordinances and regulations related to the way to meet. However, religion has come in to frustrate people from God&rsquo;s purpose concerning Christ and the church. This religion is a strong veil that covers people, blinds them, and keeps them from a clear view of God&rsquo;s purpose. Even the knowledge and gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians have been utilized by the enemy to veil the New Testament believers. For this reason, 2 Corinthians speaks of the veil of religion being taken away so that we may behold and reflect the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face (3:16-18). Then after 2 Corinthians comes the book of Galatians, which deals with religion and reminds us that God&rsquo;s intention is to have a pure and proper church life for Christ.</p>
<p>Galatians 1:4 says that Christ gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age. As we have seen, the present evil age refers to the religion of the present age, which today is Christianity. In Matthew 13:33 the Lord Jesus spoke of a woman who took leaven and hid it in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened. The unleavened fine flour signifies Christ as food to us, which is pure, holy, and divine. The woman signifies the Roman Catholic Church, which took in many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ, leavening the whole content of Christianity (16:6, 11-12; 1 Cor. 5:6-8; Rev. 2:20). Not only the leaven but also the act of leavening are evil. This woman is seen again in Revelation as Jezebel (vv. 20-23) and ultimately as Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and abominations of the earth (17:1-5). Jezebel was surely evil, harlotry is evil, and from its beginning as Babel in Genesis 11 to its destruction in Revelation 17&mdash;19, Babylon is always considered as something evil. For this reason, we can definitely say that apostate Christianity is evil.</p>
<p>Although some may object to this teaching, we are simply burdened to speak the truth. We realize that within the Catholic Church and the denominations there are many real Christians, servants of the Lord. However, Revelation 17:4 tells us that Babylon is gilded with gold, precious stone, and pearls. Satan in his subtlety has utilized many saints to gild, to outwardly adorn, the evil woman. The New Jerusalem is not gilded but built up with these precious materials. The city proper of the New Jerusalem itself is gold from within to without (21:18-21). Babylon the Great, however, is merely gilded with gold as a pretense, presumption, hypocrisy, and falsehood, and the golden cup in her hand is full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication (17:4). An abomination is an insult to God, and fornication damages the humanity made by God. This is truly evil.</p>
<p>Both the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches help people to know God and, to a certain extent, to be saved. However, God&rsquo;s purpose is not merely to gain a group of redeemed people. It is to gain the reality of the Body of Christ here on the earth today, expressed in the localities in which we live. In today&rsquo;s Christianity we cannot find the genuine work that cares for the present, practical building up of the church. Rather, many Christian teachers and leaders purposely do not touch the matter of the church. In a certain place to which I was invited to speak, my hosts told me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, the believers in this city are very young and do not understand things clearly. We hope that you will simply minister life to them and not say anything about the church.&rdquo; For the first few days, I went along with this advice, but before the last meeting with them I was troubled. I realized that in order to be a faithful servant of the Lord, I should follow the Lord and speak concerning the church. Therefore, that evening I spoke concerning the Body of Christ in Romans 12. As a result, my hosts were grieved, and others too were offended. Nevertheless, one brother in the audience was captured; that brother is now a leading one among the churches in that area.</p>
<p>Christianity helps people to know God and even to be saved, but it does not help them to be saved to the fullest extent for the Body of Christ. After people receive this incomplete help from Christianity, it becomes a hindrance to them, frustrating them from going on in a fuller way to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. For this reason it is not the unbelievers or indifferent ones but certain religious Christians who criticize, condemn, and persecute the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. This too demonstrates that the present age of religion is evil.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Enjoying Christ as the All-inclusive Spirit for the Practical, Genuine, and Real Church Life &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
