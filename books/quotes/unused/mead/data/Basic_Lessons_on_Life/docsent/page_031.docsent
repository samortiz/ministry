   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIFE IS NOT POWER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We also need to see that life is not power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit has two aspects: the aspect of life within us and the aspect of power upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the New Testament talks about the Spirit's power, it uses the preposition upon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Upon means outside.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the New Testament speaks concerning the Spirit as life, it uses the preposition in. The Spirit is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The New Testament says that the Spirit of reality will be with you and even in you, and the rivers of living water will flow out from within you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is the aspect of drinking the Spirit and the aspect of being baptized in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To baptize a person is to put him into the water, but to drink is to take in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 12:13 covers these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we all have been given to drink of one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These are the two aspects concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in today's Christianity the life side is nearly neglected and the power side is overemphasized wrongly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we have to point out that life is not power.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Acts 1:8 shows that the Spirit of power coming upon the disciples enabled them to carry out the work of spreading the gospel from Jerusalem to the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This verse shows us that power is for work, and John 6:57b shows that life is for living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this verse the Lord said, "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>LIFE IS NOT GIFT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Life is not gift.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Gift is the ability for function Rom 12:6 , but life is the divine Being in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John 1:13b says that we believers are begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be begotten of God is to have God's being in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Life is God Himself, the divine Being, in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>V. LIFE IS NOT THE GROWTH IN KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The growth in knowledge is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The growth in knowledge is the increase of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may accumulate a lot of biblical knowledge by reading books or by studying in a seminary and yet not know life at all.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Life is the increase of God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Colossians 2:19b reveals that the church grows with the growth of God, with the increase of God as life.</S>
