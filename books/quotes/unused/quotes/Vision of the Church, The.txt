We will be delivered from wrong and distorted concepts, and our entire Christian service will be revolutionized
The New Testament does not give much doctrine concerning the church, but it does give us a full picture of the practice of the church
Most Christian teachers in the past century and a half have taught that it is impossible to have the real church today
The real church, they say, is invisible and in the future; what we have today is just the visible church, and that is not real
We do have the church in Jerusalem the church in Antioch the church at Cenchrea the church in Corinth and the church in so many other cities
Eventually at the end of the New Testament, in the book of Revelation, we have a picture of seven churches in seven cities
Read the simple words of the New Testament the church in Jerusalem the church in Antioch the church at Cenchrea the church in Corinth etc
It must be the general ground which makes it possible for all the believers in one locality to gather as the one church in that place
If you read carefully, you will see that in every case these simply refer to the home in which the entire church in that city met
If we are not clear regarding the unique ground of the church, we have no way to go on for a practical, local expression
They have talked much about the church, but they did not take the unique ground of the church, the ground of unity
You may protest that if you take the definite standing of the ground of the church, you will be involved in trouble and problems
We must take a definite stand upon the original ground of the church, the local ground of unity in the city in which we live
Regardless of how much we talk about the Body life or the church life, without this vision, we will not know where we are
