<h1 class="title">SEEING THE ONE NEW MAN</h1>
<p>There is only one Bible, but as a result of differences among Christians in their understanding of the Bible, there are different kinds of Christians. As an example of the different kinds of Christians, I will explain how the Lord led me level by level in my experience until I saw that the church is the one new man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEVEL ONE&mdash;<br />
BEING UNSAVED IN CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>I am Chinese, and I grew up in a Christian family. My mother&rsquo;s maternal grandfather was a zealous member of the Southern Baptist Church, and my mother studied in a school established by the Southern Baptist Church. This was during the Ching Dynasty when there were only old-style private schools. The modern educational system of elementary school, middle school, and college did not exist. The schools established by the missions taught the Bible in addition to the regular courses taught in the old-style private schools. As a result, my mother also joined Christianity, but she was not saved. She was influenced by Christianity, and she was a devout follower of Christianity. In those days the Western missionaries who went to China to preach the gospel were called &ldquo;foreign devils&rdquo; or &ldquo;primary devils,&rdquo; and the Chinese people who accepted Christianity were called &ldquo;secondary devils.&rdquo; Therefore, during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the Boxers killed not only the foreign, or primary, devils but also the secondary devils. When the Boxers reached my hometown in Shangtung Province, my mother hid all the books concerning the Bible that were in our family&rsquo;s home, and they had to escape and hide in the hills.</p>
<p>Under my mother&rsquo;s influence, the children in my family met in the Southern Baptist Church from our youth. I studied at an elementary school operated by the Southern Baptist Church; I also went to church services and attended Sunday school. Therefore, I became familiar with the routine practices of Christianity. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning our mother would make sure that we put on clean or new clothes to attend the church service. After the service she would cook a delicious meal of noodles. The Lord&rsquo;s Day was a day for going to the church service and eating delicious food, not for doing any work. We were a Christian family.</p>
<p>I was in Christianity for nineteen years. As a result of my mother&rsquo;s influence, I did not contact other religions, nor did I worship idols. Everyone in my family was a church member in Christianity, but none of us were genuinely saved. Nonetheless, when someone criticized or opposed Christianity, we would rise up to defend it. I once went on an excursion with my teacher and some classmates. When we arrived at a temple, I stood in front of my teacher, classmates, and a Buddhist monk, pointed at the idols, and said, &ldquo;These are all false gods. They are like the mud under my feet because they are merely gilded with gold and are placed here on display. The true God is invisible and intangible. He is omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent. Only He, the Lord who created the heavens and the earth, is real.&rdquo; At the time I was not even saved; I was merely a nominal Christian and had never prayed or confessed my sins. Nevertheless, I loved Christianity and was able to speak convincingly concerning the true God versus idols.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEVEL TWO&mdash;BEING GENUINELY SAVED<br />
AND LOVING BIBLE KNOWLEDGE</h2>
<p>One day my second sister turned to the Lord and experienced salvation. She went to Nanking to study in the best women&rsquo;s seminary in China; she was determined to serve the Lord her whole life. Afterward, she began to pray for my mother and me to be saved. As a result of her prayer, God&rsquo;s salvation came to me. One Lord&rsquo;s Day morning it was announced that a young lady evangelist would be coming from Shanghai to preach the gospel. In the past I had heard older pastors or older women preach the word, but I had never seen a young lady evangelist. Therefore, I decided to attend. There were over a thousand people in the audience that day. The message spoken by the young lady evangelist was powerful; I had never heard a message as powerful as hers. I was somewhat familiar with the stories of the Bible, but I had never heard such a message. She did not speak about sin. Rather, she spoke about Satan being the Pharaoh of the present age who keeps people under his authority and about God sending Christ to release all who are kept under Satan&rsquo;s oppression, just as Moses released the children of Israel from Pharaoh&rsquo;s oppression. I was captured by her words and decided that I would no longer be under Satan&rsquo;s hand or be usurped by the world. On my way home I looked up toward heaven and said, &ldquo;O God! Save me. I do not want to be held by Satan. I want to belong to You for my whole life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I was young, I was occupied with amusements and sports. When I was older, I realized that my future would depend on my education. Therefore, I made up my mind to no longer be absorbed by amusements and sports but to pursue my education and to also diligently study the Chinese and English languages. It was at this time that I heard the gospel: &ldquo;Do not be held by Satan in the world.&rdquo; As a result, there was a definite change in my human life.</p>
<p>After I was saved, my greatest delight was to pray and to read the Bible. During one summer vacation, I spent two months to speed-read through the Bible in order to know its contents. I was determined to understand every chapter, verse, sentence, and word in the Bible. However, I realized that I did not understand the Bible. When I asked the pastor for instruction, his answers did not satisfy me. So I saved every penny in order to buy spiritual publications. I came across the Christian periodical <em>The Morning Star</em> and enjoyed reading the articles under the byline of Watchman Nee. Later, in an issue of <em>The Morning Star</em> it was announced that Watchman Nee would publish his own paper, <em>The Christian.</em> I immediately subscribed to this magazine.</p>
<p>From 1925 through 1927 Brother Nee published twenty-four issues of <em>The Christian.</em> It was read all over China by young Christians who loved and pursued the Lord. The circulation of this periodical grew to ten thousand copies every month. The primary content of <em>The Christian</em> was a meditation on the first three chapters of Revelation. Brother Nee spoke of the seven churches in Asia in chapters 2 and 3, exposing the condition of Christianity at that time. As a result of his writings, I believed that he must be very experienced. Hence, I wrote and asked him to recommend a book that would help me understand the Bible. This was the first time I corresponded with Brother Nee. He answered that, according to his knowledge, the book that would be of most help in understanding the Bible was <em>The Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</em> written by John Nelson Darby, a great teacher of the British Brethren. Brother Nee also said that this set of books was very difficult to read and that I needed to read it four or five times in order to understand it.</p>
<p>When I heard that there was a Brethren assembly in my city and that the people there were very good at expounding the Bible, I joined them. I was attracted to them. The Brethren were well known for their knowledge of the Bible. They specialized in expounding the Bible. They studied the types and prophecies in the Old Testament. In particular, they studied the great human image in Daniel 2, the four beasts in chapter 7, and the seventy weeks in chapter 9. They also studied the prophecies in the New Testament concerning Christ&rsquo;s second coming and the rapture. I treasured this Bible knowledge. I was in the golden period of my youth, and I had an alert mind. I listened to at least five messages every week, wrote notes, and kept a record of everything I heard. I listened to their Bible exposition for seven and a half years and was very satisfied.</p>
<p>At that time I always criticized other denominations for not knowing the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament or the intricate matters in Genesis and Exodus. Because I was taught in a Brethren assembly, I knew the difference between Genesis and Exodus. I also understood the significances of the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering and the significances of the feasts of the children of Israel. I committed most of the types and prophecies in the Bible to memory.</p>
<p>One day in August 1931, while walking down the street, I was deeply convicted by the Lord. He said, &ldquo;Although you have gained a great deal of Bible knowledge, you have not borne any fruit; you have not brought one person to Me. You are dead.&rdquo; I felt condemned. Other than going to work, I read the Bible, went to meetings, listened to messages, and wrote notes. I had a good income, and I did not love the world or the enjoyment in the world. Nonetheless, the Lord condemned me for being dead. Early in the morning of the next day I climbed to the top of a small mountain near my home. There I wept loudly, &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy on me! I am dead and dry.&rdquo; From August of 1931 through March of the following year, for more than half a year, I went up to the mountain and cried out loudly, prayed, sang, and shed tears before the Lord every day. As a result, I often came down from the mountain inwardly filled with the Holy Spirit. My whole being was enlivened. This was the sweetest period in my fellowship with the Lord. The things on earth had no place in my heart; I was completely gained by the Lord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
