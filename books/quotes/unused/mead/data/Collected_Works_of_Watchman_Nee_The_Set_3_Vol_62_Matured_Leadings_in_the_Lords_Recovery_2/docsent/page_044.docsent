   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING DELIVERED FROM HUMAN ARTIFICIAL SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Watchman Nee: During the past few days Brother Lee has been urging me to speak, but I do not know what kind of thoughts are within him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today I feel to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Please forgive me for saying a frank word to you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the past ten days at least, I have been in a quandary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not a matter of whether or not the brothers and sisters have handed themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I feel that a basic problem is still unresolved in all those who have handed themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can even pinpoint the problem: Too much of our service is human and artificial; it does not have its source in the life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have been speaking for the Lord for about thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I know that no sinner can be saved without confessing his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Similarly, I can say that no Christian can know the reality of the church without making confession for his artificial and human service in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There were three brothers a co-worker, a brother, and a leading one who were dissatisfied with the church in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They often criticized many things in front of me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am not saying that the critical ones are right.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if we do not let go of one or two things and if we would not deal with them, our service and coordination are equally wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Unless we deal with these basic issues, our coordination and service will be nothing but an outward show.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose I make a model of a bee out of wax.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It may look exactly like a real bee, but even a child can tell that it is not a real bee.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A real bee has life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the coming days, what we need is not to make a bigger wax bee but to have some real bees.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not think that we can justify ourselves once we have handed ourselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is true that our sins are to be condemned, but our righteousness is equally ragged before God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>George Whitefield said once that even our tears of repentance need the washing of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not just our evils that must be condemned and dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What little bit of good that we possess must be destroyed also.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not think that we have the real thing as long as we have the proper, outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I beg you to believe that we know what is artificial service and what is genuine service of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I had no thought of saying such a word, but during the past few months, I have felt that many of the services in the church are artificial and manmade; they are void of any spiritual touch.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many people are paying too much attention to activities.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They do not have a basic understanding of service, yet they come to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It seems as if all of us have become wax bee makers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am not saying that we have a problem with our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a matter of nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The issue is whether something is human or spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have been waiting for one kind of prayer, but I have not heard it during these days.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must all admit that many of the past messages were wax-like, and the services were wax-like.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many of the services and the coordination were false.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the world we can be false about anything because the flesh has a place in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But in the church there should not be any falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can be false in a very honest way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>During the past few days, I have felt extremely terrible about many things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I read your consecration slips over ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On top of the pile are those from the co-workers and the responsible ones.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Following these are the slips from all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every time I look at them, I ask myself whether or not they handed themselves over because of the urging of the Spirit or because they were going along with some outward activities.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No dealing in the course of the remission of sin is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Similarly, no service of the flesh is to be boasted of.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let me repeat: This is not a matter of changing any methods but a matter of the very nature of things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I ask that the brothers and sisters not care so much for their "face"; they should go to the Lord for shining and dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the one hand, I am very happy that the brothers and sisters have handed themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the other hand, I feel sad that they are not able to differentiate real things from false things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I hope that in these days you will learn to have the genuine service, that is, service that issues from the Holy Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Weigh Kwang-hsi: Lord, we admit that we are not qualified to take the lead among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We cannot meet their needs, much less Your demands.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the past we had many thoughts and concepts which we deemed right and good.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We ask that You forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We admit that our consecration is behind that of many brothers and sisters, and the dealings that we have received are much less than what they have learned.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need Your special mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Lord, we are no better than the other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We admit that we have made the ground useless Luke 13:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is a small thing that we have offended You personally, but, Lord, we have offended the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is too serious.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have been appointed as the responsible ones.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The burden is too heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We truly need Your sufficient grace and Your empowering.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Lord, we do not know where our confession should begin.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We ask Your light to shine on what we have confessed and on what we are too slow to understand and confess.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Forgive us for all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We ask that You accept anything in our service that is from You.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are willing to tear down all wood, grass, and stubble in our services.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We want to have services that are gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We admit that there was no release of the spirit and of life in our services in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We admit that we did many things, but we forgot that we were serving You.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have done much, but we have not learned the lessons of service.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Gracious Lord, be merciful to us!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Lord, we believe that since You have begun this good work, You will finish it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Today You have spoken through Your two servants.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is Your grace and great mercy to the church in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is also Your mercy and grace that You have given us a spirit of repentance tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Your servants have not held back one thing that they should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is Your great grace that they have not withheld their speaking from us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If Your servants were to become silent, we would be like dead persons.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Since You have spoken, fulfill Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>May our prayer tonight count towards Your plan of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Grant us a fresh turn, a new beginning in the church in Hong Kong tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>May You work on us anew.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We all give ourselves to You in a fresh way as a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Lord, although we are the overseers, we need Your mercy more than the other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Your servants have spoken strong words, and this is a sign of Your love to Your church.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Lord, even our repentance needs the cleansing of Your blood.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We need more revelation and shining to expose our corruption and natural constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>May our service and coordination in the church issue from the spirit, and may they bear the element of life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>May You be fully satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Amen!</S>
