        <h2 class="head1">TAKING GOD AS LIFE AND LIVING BY HIM</h2>
<p>We can take God as life and live by Him by eating, drinking, and enjoying Him. In John 6:57 the Lord said, &ldquo;As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo; When we eat and enjoy the Lord, He will carry us in our living and in our service, and we will spontaneously do His will.</p>
<p>God became the Spirit so that He can enter into our spirit. He knows that this matter is too vague for us to comprehend; hence, He has given us the Bible. In other words, in addition to entering into us as the Holy Spirit, He is also present in His Word so that we may contact Him. As Christians, we have the Bible without and the Spirit within; we have the Bible in our hand and the Spirit in our spirit. Now we can contact God as the Spirit and in the Word.</p>
<p>When we use our spirit to contact the Bible, God&rsquo;s Spirit will touch our spirit. The more we contact the Word, the more the Spirit will move in our spirit. The move of the Spirit within us is the divine life in us. We should simply follow His move and cooperate with His anointing. If He wants us to weep, we should weep, and if He wants us to rejoice, we should rejoice. When He wants us to preach the gospel, we should preach the gospel. When He does not want us to speak, we should stop speaking. If He does not want us to go to a certain place, we should not go. We should cooperate with and obey His move. This is what it means to take God as life and live by Him.</p>
<p>I hope that all the saints will practice taking God as life and living by Him. We should set aside some time daily to contact God&rsquo;s Word and allow the Holy Spirit to touch our inner being through the Word. We cannot contact the Word merely by reading the Bible in an ordinary way or by studying the Bible with our mind. We should use our spirit to contact the Word. We need to spend time before the Lord and contact God&rsquo;s Word with our spirit. Then the Holy Spirit will touch our spirit.</p>
<p>The Word is the expression of God, and the Spirit is God entering into us. The Word enters into us as the Spirit. The Word is the Spirit, and both the Word and the Spirit are God. The Word is outside of us, and the Spirit is inside of us. When God&rsquo;s speaking enters into us and when we touch the Spirit, God becomes our life. If we learn this secret, we will experience and enjoy Him as life every time we contact the Word.</p>
<p>This is not doctrine; it is a practical way to take God as our life. Hence, we should practice contacting the Word and the Spirit with our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONSECRATING TO TAKE GOD AS LIFE</h2>
<p>Let us be more subjective. In order to take God as life by contacting His Word and letting His Spirit touch our spirit, we must take another step: we must consecrate ourselves. Consecration does not mean that we should do something for God. Rather, consecration means that we should cooperate with God to let Him live in us and be our life. I must proclaim to all God&rsquo;s children, &ldquo;God has no intention for us to do anything for Him!&rdquo; He wants us only to cooperate with Him to let Him live in us. Nothing is more pleasing to God than our cooperating with Him by letting Him live in us.</p>
<p>It is one thing for a believer to have the divine life, but it is another thing for him to let God live in him. These are two different things. About twenty years ago I lived in Chefoo in northern China. In those days not many houses had electricity; many homes still used kerosene lamps. After electricity was installed in my home, I would often light a kerosene lamp out of habit. One night I returned home and immediately went to look for matches. My family asked me, &ldquo;What do you want the matches for?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;To light up the kerosene lamps.&rdquo; They laughed and said, &ldquo;We have electric lamps now.&rdquo; I realized that this is similar to our experience: God is in us, but we are not used to applying or enjoying Him. Rather, we are accustomed to living by our own life. Hence, after we are saved, we forget that God has come into us to be our practical living. Even after hearing many messages concerning God as life, we still live by ourselves, just as I had the habit of lighting a kerosene lamp instead of switching on the electric lamps.</p>
<p>May God open our eyes to see that there are two lives within us. We have our human life and God&rsquo;s life. We have been habitually living by our human life. Hence, we know that we should not do what is wrong, bad, or evil. However, we spontaneously try to do what is good and right because we are used to doing such things. For example, a brother may have the concept that he should not use bad words. However, he does not practice contacting God to know whether or not he should speak, even if he wants to use good words. He does not know what it is to deny the self and forsake the natural life. He does not know the difference between speaking by himself and speaking by the life of God.</p>
<p>We are not asking whether a certain thing is good or bad. We are asking whether we are doing things by our human life or by the divine life, that is, whether we are living or whether God is living. There is a big difference between our doing something alone and God doing it in us. Most of the saints still desire only to forsake evil and do good. They are content with doing good things. This is the concept of an ethical or a religious person, but it is not taking God as life. This is a matter of ethics and religion, not of life. The matter of life requires that we take a step further and ask whether we are doing a good thing by our human life or by God. Are we the ones living, or is God living in us? Are we doing something independent of God, or are we doing it together with Him? There is a big difference here.</p>
<p>When we learn to discern between such matters, we will know what it is to take God as life practically and what it is to express the divine life. In order to live by God and let Him live in us, we need to have a thorough and definite consecration. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, I see a fact: You want to be my life, and You want to live in me. This requires that I cooperate with You. Hence, I consecrate myself completely to You. Although I have the human life and live as a man, I am willing to learn to forsake myself and take You as my life. I am willing to cooperate with You and let You live in me. I am willing to give myself to You as a vessel for You to fill me, to move in me, and to be expressed through me. Lord, I reject my will, my mind, and my views. I want to take Your will as my will, Your mind as my mind, and Your views as my views. I do not want to take myself as the standard; I want to take You as the standard and as my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How many saints have consecrated themselves in such a way? I first consecrated myself because I did not want the world, but I wanted to serve God. Hence, I prayed, &ldquo;Lord, from this day onward I give myself to You. I want to be used by You and to serve You.&rdquo; On another occasion I felt that I needed to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Hence, I had a thorough consecration in which I gave myself completely to the Lord. However, when I saw that God wants to live in me and that He wants me to take Him as life, my consecration was much more thorough. After seeing God&rsquo;s desire, I said, &ldquo;O God, I give myself to You, not to work for You or to be filled by You but to let You be my life. You are the glorious, bountiful, and holy One, and I want You to live in me. Therefore, I give myself to You as a living vessel. I would no longer live by my own life. I give myself to live by You and to take You as life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a consecration is deeper than a consecration with the purpose of being used by God or of being filled by the Holy Spirit. Many saints still have not had this kind of consecration. I encourage these saints to have a definite consecration. They should find a quiet place and from the depths of their being give themselves to God in a specific way. They should say, &ldquo;Lord, I have seen that You want to live in me as my life and that You need my cooperation in this matter. For this reason, I am consecrating myself to You as a living vessel. I have a strong desire to move with You when You move and to stop with You when You stop.&rdquo; This is not a matter of being guided or led by Him but of our letting Him live in us as our life so that we can live by Him.</p>
<p>In order for the messages that we have heard in the past to become our experience, we need the work of the Holy Spirit. However, we also need to cooperate by consecrating ourselves. Without such a consecration, it will be difficult for the Spirit to work in us. The Spirit is willing to operate in us, but if we are passive and not absolute, lacking the standing of consecration, He will not be able to do anything. If we are willing to consecrate ourselves, it will be easy for the Spirit to move in us.</p>
<p>Suppose I would like to shake hands with a brother. If he does not cooperate by lifting up his hand, we cannot shake hands. If he understands my intention and reaches out for my hand, we can shake hands. This is the way that the Spirit works in us. He needs our cooperation. The Spirit earnestly desires to work in every one of us, but He cannot do anything if we do not give Him the opportunity by cooperating with Him. The Spirit can be compared to air or the wind, which is able to enter through an open door or window. He can also be compared to water, which is able to flow into any crack. The worst situation is for a believer to be like a room without any openings; the wind cannot blow in, air cannot seep in, and water cannot flow in. Some saints are like a room with iron walls toward God. They are saved, but they are not concerned about God being their life. They have heard messages and understand that He wants to be their life, but they remain the same because they have not exercised their spirit to receive what they have heard.</p>
<p>This message is vain if a believer remains indifferent and noncommittal, being unwilling to have an absolute, definite, and thorough consecration. I hope that every brother and sister will have a thorough consecration. We should not give ourselves once to the Lord; we should renew our consecration daily, just as the Israelites offered the burnt offering every day. We should say, &ldquo;I am a normal human being, but I do not live according to my human life. Lord, I let You be my life and live in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we will consecrate ourselves in such a way, the next time we come to the Bible, it will be living, bright, and fresh, and we will touch God with our spirit. Not only so, we will experience Him moving in us and anointing us; we will sense that God is living. If we maintain our consecration, we will have unceasing fellowship with God. This unceasing fellowship is what John 15 describes as abiding in the Lord. In such a fellowship the Lord abides in us, and we abide in Him, just as branches abide in the vine. The branches that abide in the vine take the vine as their life, and the sap of the vine becomes the element of the branches. As a result, the branches grow leaves, blossom, and bear fruit.</p>
<p>The fruit borne on the branches is the expression of the life of the vine. The fruit is not the result of conduct, work, or self-cultivation; rather, fruit is the issue of the growth of life, an expression of life, and a flowing out of life. This is a picture of what God wants to gain in us. He does not want us to work for Him or to merely carry out His will. He wants us to let His life be lived out of us, to be expressed through us. On His side, He has done all that He needs to do. He became flesh, died, resurrected, ascended to the heavens, and became the Spirit. Furthermore, He has mingled Himself with man and mingled man with Himself. He has done everything.</p>
<p>He is now waiting for us to cooperate with Him. He needs us to have a definite response of letting Him be our life. If we are willing to respond by consecrating ourselves thoroughly, He will spread and gain ground in us, item by item, until He occupies our entire being. He will motivate us to live according to Him. When we live according to Him, we are letting Him live in us; that is, we are taking Him as our life practically. This is what God desires.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
