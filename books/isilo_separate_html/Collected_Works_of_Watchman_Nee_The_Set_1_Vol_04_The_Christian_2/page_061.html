Now persecution has stopped, but Satan's wiles have prevailed. If he cannot persecute us outwardly, he will try to deceive us inwardly and will corrupt God's children. Oppression and temptation are two tools the enemy uses to oppose God. These two things are manipulated dexterously by Satan's hand. If he fails in one, he will use the other. This is the way he dealt with our Lord. First, he led Him into the wilderness. When his plan failed, he was forced to kill Him on the cross. Still, he failed, and his Adversary, our Lord, won the full victory. He dealt with Paul the same way. He wanted to collaborate with Paul to damage the Lord's holy work, and when that failed, he cast Paul into prison (Acts 16). He is dealing with the church the same way. When he persecuted Smyrna, it became more zealous. Therefore, he changed his strategy and tried to entice Pergamos with the worldly snare. It is a pity that Pergamos fell into his trap and lost its separation from the world.</P><P>The church in Pergamos reveals to us the condition after Smyrna. God cares for His children. This is why, when He sees them departing from their first love, He allows persecution to come upon them so that they would not backslide. This goal was accomplished for a brief while, but not long after this, the reviving power of the church was lost again! It degraded again, and the degradation became more severe than before. The church has become worldly! There are many similarities between the situation at the time of the judges and the condition of the church now. The book of Judges is a book of revivals. The Israelites failed in Canaan and were overcome by the enemies. Yet God in His grace constantly delivered them. But the amazing thing is that after every deliverance, which can be considered a revival, God's people failed once more. Their resulting condition was far worse than before their revivals! Is this not the same with the history of the church? In His love and mercy God would time and again revive His children with the Holy Spirit so that they would receive life once more and would grow in spiritual stature and that they would obey God's word more. But it is a pity that no sooner does the tide of revival pass away than a renowned church falls back once again. Hence, although God halted the backsliding of Ephesus, in the church in Smyrna this did not last for long. Now Pergamos is before us.</P><P>Here, though the matter is not our subject, I would mention in passing the type of the Israelites and how it can be applied to the condition of the denominations today. The confusion at the time of the judges can be seen from the expression "every man did that which was right in his own eyes" (Judg. 21:25). After this period of doing everything right according to one's own eyes, we see the people taking Saul as king. After this there was David and then Solomon. In the current denominations everyone indeed does "that which was right in his own eyes." Man's tradition, psychology, preference, theology, creed, ordinance, and choice become the goal of all denominational organizations. God's word is cast behind or is relegated a position equal to human work. Many would not obey the "thus saith the Lord" but would rather concede that ordinances for the preservation of order in the denominations be maintained. We are not surprised that this is the natural consequence of apostasy. In the end, as a whole, the people will accept Antichrist as king. This is Saul of the Old Testament. However, our David, the warring Christ, will come again, will war, and will win. In the end He will be like Solomon and reign as the King of peace for a thousand years. Now is the time for us to be faithful.</P><P>If the church has not left the first love, no temptation will make it slide back. However, when the first love is lost, there is no degradation that the church cannot experience.</P><P>The word "Pergamos" has two meanings in the original language. The first is "complete marriage." This means that the church has dropped its present sojourning nature and has instead married the world. The church is supposed to be a virgin espoused to Christ. How can the church be so if it is married before Christ comes? This must be the marriage between the church and the world. It is not a surprise though, because it is the result of a long period of romance. According to the Lord's word, Christians and the world should be diametrically opposed to one another. Our remaining in the world is for the purpose of testifying to the wrongdoing of the world that has crucified Christ. This is why the Lord said that "in the world you have affliction" (John 16:33). If the believers maintain their stand of being out of the world and against the world, they will enjoy an eternal Smyrna. If the world has not persecuted the Christians, it must be for one of the two following reasons: either the world has become the church, or the church has become the world. The present world may be prosperous materially speaking, but is its attitude toward Christ different from that of twenty centuries ago? If the world has not changed for the better to become the church, we have to admit that the church has joined hands with the world and has married it. Hence, the church has become the world!</P><P>This word has another meaning, which is "high tower." The result of the church being married to the world is the gaining of an honorable position. This was its goal anyway. Now this goal is reached. How could cross-bearing followers of the humble Nazarene ever have seen the good that man now enjoys? "We have become a high tower for the whole world to admire. Is this not a great boost to the Lord's truth?" But then, the position of a high tower puts the student higher than the teacher and the servant higher than the master. Since the world calls our master one who is demon-possessed, what mockery should we receive? If all that our Lord received were the thorned crown and the wooden cross, what should we have? If the manger was His birthplace, should the high tower be our dwelling? Those who love the Lord should know how to answer these questions. The high tower cannot be compared to the spirit of the rejected cross. Can the high tower and the cross go parallel one to the other and not clash with each other? In reality, those who marry the world can hardly bear the spirit of the humble, painful, common, and poor cross. The high tower is but a symbol of all the great things. The church can bounce and rejoice on the broad way of the world. However, the Lord will judge.</P><P>We have mentioned before that the way the Lord addresses each church is intimately related to the condition of that church. Since the church in Pergamos is worldly, the Lord revealed Himself as "He who has the sharp two-edged sword." Man opposed Smyrna with his sword, but the Lord opposed Pergamos with His sword. Formerly it was Nero who was drawing the sword. This time it was Christ who was drawing the sword. The Lord Jesus wanted them to know that as much as the sword of the world was fearsome, His sword was even more fearsome. If man is fearsome, is not God more fearsome? As His messenger had dealt with Balaam, in the same way He Himself would deal with the church who followed Balaam. This is the tool He uses to deal with the apostate church. How different this letter is from the last! There the believers were going to die, and the Lord revealed Himself as the resurrection. Here He was the judge with the two-edged sword. In Smyrna He had the authority of life. Here He had the authority of death. To those who did not love their life, He demonstrated His tenderness and loving sympathy, but to those who loved their life and who were joined to the world, He showed His sharp sword. If a man tries to avoid the enemy's persecution, he will instead find the punishment of Christ.</P><P>The first church tells us of the forsaking of the first love. The second church tells us of the enemy's persecution. The question now is not persecution but the enemy's welcome. The smile of Satan is more dreadful than his anger. What a pity that many Samsons have braved the fierce Philistines on the battlefield only to find their locks of power shorn through sleeping on the lap of Delilah and thus becoming no different than an ordinary man. If God chastises, it means that He is still doing something. If God gives up, though the flesh can enjoy comfortably and the conscience is set to rest, danger is near! "Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone" (Hosea 4:17). This is most tragic! Now we have the finer judgment of Christ. These ones utilize their evil teachings to support their walk with the world and cover their evil deeds with false holiness. The word on the removal of the lampstand is no longer suitable here. God did not call them to return to their first love. This was impossible already for the whole church had become lost. Other than the promise for the individual lover of the Lord to take pleasure in the Lord, there was no other promise given.</P><P>This church no longer had the ability to differentiate that which needs differentiation. This is why the Lord told them that He is the One with the two-edged sword. The meaning of the two-edged sword can be seen from Hebrews 4:12-13: "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And there is no creature that is not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are to give our account." The reason the Lord spoke to the messenger of Pergamos in this way was to show the church that its spiritual condition is naked before Him and that His word will expose our true condition.</P><P>Moreover, this sword also symbolizes judgment. The Lord's word pierces through all hidden things. At the same time, His word also judges, condemns, and executes judgments. Later the Lord used the same sword to smite the nations (Rev. 19). Hence, the meaning is obvious. This is the weapon with which the Lord Jesus judges and executes judgments. As man's sword is used for cutting away, in the same way the word of God is used to exterminate all opposers. Naturally, the Lord will not use this to kill His own people. Yet, the Lord called those who were in the same position as the Nicolaitans to repent, or else they would face war (2:16).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_060.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_062.html">Next</a> </body></html>
