[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE MYSTERY OF THE UNIVERSE Scripture Reading: Gen 1:1; Rom 1:20; Psa 19:1-3; 8:1-4; Heb 1:3; Isa 40:22; Job 26:7
[3]  Praise the Lord that we brothers and sisters who are scattered in the United States and Canada can have a happy reunion here today.
[4]  In these days there is a group of Christians who are scientists and who love to say, "We will use science to prove the Bible."
[5]  Furthermore, the record in the Bible concerning God's creation occupies only one and a half chapters, Genesis 1 and the first half of Genesis 2.
[6]  According to the record in Genesis, God first created the lifeless things and then the living things.
[7]  Among the living things, God first created the life on the lower level, then the life on the middle level, then the life on the higher level, and eventually the life on the highest level.
[8]  There must be a meaning to the existence of heaven and earth; all things have a meaning for their existence.
[9]  The meaning of heaven and earth is the mystery of heaven and earth, the mystery of the universe.
[10]  In the previous chapter we saw that in the Bible there are the five great mysteries: the universe, man, God, Christ, and the church.
[11]  The Gospel of John and the first Epistle of John also contain many mysteries, such as the mystery of eternal life and the mystery of God becoming flesh.
[12]  GOD USING DUST AND THE BREATH OF LIFE TO CREATE MAN
[13]  In Genesis 2 we are told what kinds of material God used to create man and how He created man.
[14]  Today, our spirit is the most important part of our entire being.
[15]  The human spirit is the organ for receiving God as life.
[16]  CHAPTER THREE THE MYSTERY OF GOD Scripture Reading: Col 2:2, 9; 3:4, 10-11; John 1:18, 16; Heb 1:3
[17]  In this chapter we want to see the third great mystery in the Bible.
[18]  CHRIST AS THE CREATOR AND THE ONE IN WHOM ALL THINGS COHERE
[19]  Colossians 1:16 tells us that Christ is the Creator of all things.
[20]  All things in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities, were created in the power of Christ's person, in the power of what Christ is.
[21]  Colossians 2:9 says, "For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."
[22]  As God, Christ had the divine life and nature and was able to dispense God in His life and nature to man, enabling man to live out God's attributes to express and glorify God.
[23]  In order to accomplish God's eternal redemption and plan, Christ as God's Anointed took two great steps.
[24]  First, as God He was incarnated to become a man John 1:1, 14 , the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45b , that He might die and accomplish redemption for us Heb 9:26-28; 10:12 .
[25]  Second, through death and resurrection He as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b that He may enter into us John 14:20 to be our life Col 3:4 and to live in us Gal 2:20 that we may live Him out Phil 1:20-21 .
[26]  The incarnated Christ is in this Spirit; the resurrected Christ is in this Spirit; even all of the Triune God is in this Spirit for us to experience.
[27]  However, before we fellowship about the mystery of Christ, I feel that I have the responsibility to fellowship in detail with you the truth concerning the person of Christ.
[28]  It is only when we see this truth that we can enter into the subjective experience of Christ and live out the mystery of Christ, which is the church.
[29]  In 1963, I began to compile an English hymnal with the help of an American brother, and I wrote a hymn that says, "O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now."
[30]  CHRIST COMING FROM THE POSITION OF THE CREATOR TO THE POSITION OF THE CREATURE
[31]  In 1934 Brother Nee held the third Overcomer Conference in Shanghai on Christ having the preeminence in all things.
[32]  THE CHURCH BEING THE BODY OF CHRIST AS THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST
[33]  This Christ was God who became flesh and who passed through death and resurrection.
[34]  His resurrection was a work of God's power because it was God's power that raised Him from the dead and brought Him into ascension in the heavenlies, highly exalting Him to be far above all and giving Him to be Head over all things to the church.
[35]  This resurrection power of Christ not only enabled Him to ascend to heaven, to be far above all, and to become Head over all things; it also operates within us today.
[36]  Because the Spirit of God operates in us, this power operates in us along with the Spirit of God.
[37]  As such, we have the life of God within us and the Spirit of God sealing us, step by step, with all that God is in Christ, that we may be sanctified and transformed and that we may experience the power that enabled Christ to rise from the dead, ascend to heaven, transcend all things, and be Head over all things.
[38]  THE CHURCH ENJOYING THE RICHES OF CHRIST TO BECOME THE FULLNESS OF GOD
[39]  Ephesians 3 shows us that God wants to dispense the unsearchable riches of Christ into us to be our enjoyment day by day.
[40]  Therefore, the apostle Paul prayed that God would grant us, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.
[41]  Verse 19 shows us that when we enjoy all the riches of Christ by being strengthened into our inner man and allowing Him to make His home in our hearts, the result is that we are filled with everything of God so that we become the fullness, the expression, of God.
[42]  CHAPTER FIVE THE MYSTERY OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; 1 Tim 3:15-16; Rev 1:11, 20; 2:7; 19:7, 21:2, 9-10; 22:17
[43]  Prayer: O Lord, we prostrate ourselves to worship You.
[44]  We have already seen that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all Eph 1:23 .
[45]  It is correct to say, according to the Greek word ekklesia for church, that the church is a group of people called out by the Lord to meet in the Lord's name, but this is too superficial and shallow.
[46]  Revelation 1:12 says, "And when I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands."
[47]  Revelation 19:7 says, "Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready."
[48]  When we are saturated by the Triune God so that He flows out of us, we are completely built and fitted together to become the glorious church, the beloved bride of the Lord Jesus.
