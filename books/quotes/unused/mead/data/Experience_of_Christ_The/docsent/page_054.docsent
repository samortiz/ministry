   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING THE SPIRIT BY EMPTYING OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many Christians today do not know the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They have the terminology, but not the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When you are about to worship God or do something for God, you must be reminded not to do these things in yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then you should repudiate yourself and set yourself aside.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If there is nothing left after you put yourself aside, then there is nothing of the Holy Spirit in what you are about to do.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if there is something left after you put yourself aside, what remains is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This understanding of the Holy Spirit does not come from theology; it comes from experience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose a bottle is filled with dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more the bottle is emptied of the dirt, the more air will get into the bottle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The amount of air depends upon the degree of emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Likewise, in order to be filled with the Holy Spirit, we need to empty ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we empty ourselves, the Holy Spirit will fill us immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we put ourselves aside when we are about to pray, worship, or do something for God, we shall find that the Holy Spirit will be there as the remainder.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no need for us to speak in tongues in order to have the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as we have a heart for God and the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in order to experience the Spirit, we need to empty ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BEING "DOGS" IN THE EYES OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not worship God in your natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One who does this is called a dog by the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A dog is someone who tries to worship God apart from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we see this, we shall be fearful and pray, "Lord, have mercy upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I pray, I don't want to be a dog, someone who prays in himself."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some may wonder how anyone can pray to God and still be considered by God as a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Have you never accused others in your prayers to God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the past I have done this many times.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I prayed, but as I prayed I accused others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This kind of prayer is certainly not by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Saul of Tarsus was persecuting those who called on the name of Jesus, he certainly must have prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He might have said, "O God, I am zealous for You and for Your law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Help me to arrest everyone who calls on the name of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Saul's prayer was like the barking of a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, Paul knew what it meant for the Jewish religionists to be dogs, for he used to be one of those dogs himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In fact, he was a "top dog" in the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Like Saul of Tarsus, many times our prayers are not by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that we also can be praying dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When some hear this, they may say, "No, I am a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every time I pray, I pray to my heavenly Father."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the question is by what do you pray, by your natural life or by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you pray by your natural life, you are a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not pray without the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Neither should we worship God apart from the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to be careful regarding our prayer and our worship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to pray and worship not by our natural life, but by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He did not deal mainly with the Gentiles, but with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Moreover, He mainly dealt with them concerning their worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On one occasion the Lord even called them vipers, something worse than dogs Matt 23:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not think that as long as you worship God or pray to God everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Everything is all right only if you worship and pray by the Spirit of God.</S>
