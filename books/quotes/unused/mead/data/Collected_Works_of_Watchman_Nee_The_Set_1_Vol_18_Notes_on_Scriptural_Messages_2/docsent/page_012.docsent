   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>During the European War World War I , a preacher led a young lady to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Later she went to Paris and became a nurse for the Red Cross.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, she became backslidden.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then one day she went to church, and the same preacher was preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She was determined to say something to hurt his feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After the sermon was over, he came up to shake hands with her.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then she said, "I am going to tell you one thing you may not like to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I do not need Jesus anymore, and I can still be happy."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The preacher replied, "Maybe you can be happy in the world without Jesus, but the Lord Jesus in heaven cannot be happy without you."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is true.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everyone who knows God's Word can testify that God can only be happy when He has us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is not only merciful to us, He not only cares for us and is concerned about us, He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's love for us is more than the love of a mother for her son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's love for us is more than the love of a couple for each other; His love is more than the love between husband and wife.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may never have thought about God's feeling towards men.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But I am here to say that God loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since God is love, the Lord Jesus did two things as He passed through His years on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God knows that the only reason that men on the earth cannot love Him or worship Him is that men have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sinners are doomed to perdition and hell.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, He came to die on the cross for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He bore our sins so that we should not perish but have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may have frequently heard us say that sinners are doomed to go to hell and that the Lord Jesus came and died on the cross for men and bore men's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do you know why we are preaching this message to you?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let me tell you: it would be enough for a person to go to hell if he only had one sin or sinned for one second.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do you think that you can be without sin for a month or a year?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you think that you have never done anything bad or said any bad word?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may have had an improper thought for just a second or a minute; such thoughts may be unknown even to your parents or your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as you had such a thought, you are qualified to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God hates sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No matter how much we hate sin, our feeling cannot be compared to the feeling that God has toward even a small sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if we could feel the sins of the whole earth, it would not compare to the feeling that God has toward the evil of one lie.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God knew that all men had sinned, and He had only one way, which was to come to this world, become a man Jesus Christ , and bear men's sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was the first big thing He did.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This shows God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the same time, God knows that you have sinned and that you still may sin even though the Lord Jesus died for you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, God gives you the Holy Spirit His own Spirit to live in you and strengthen you to not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the second thing that God did.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This also shows His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God gives us two great graces: one is to send the Lord Jesus to die for us so that our sins are forgiven; the other is to send the Holy Spirit to dwell in us so that we can have the strength not to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Friends, do you know how difficult it is to overcome sin?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, in the matter of honesty, I do not know how many among us are truly honest men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have been to many places, but I have not met many honest men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not speaking enough is a lie; speaking too politely is also a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you have tried to be an honest man, you will know that it is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A friend of mine ran into some bandits in Canton one day, and they asked for his money.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He thought that since he was a Christian, he could not lie.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if he told the truth, his money would be taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the end he reluctantly told the truth and showed the bandits the few dollars in his pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this case, lying could have saved him from some losses.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But in order to be honest, one cannot tell a single lie.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many times one has a bad thought in his mind which will not go away.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He may hate others and not forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He may be fond of criticizing and spreading rumors about others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We tell lies all the time and like to be clever.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But God knows all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God will not only forgive all of our sins but will also have His Spirit live inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Spirit can empower us to overcome sins and become clean.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is God's heart!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What God wants to do, He has already done.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I can boldly say one word concerning salvation: there is no problem on God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The problem is on your side.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Are you willing to believe?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I can boldly say that God wants you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I have many friends who are in their fifties and sixties; they can also boldly testify to you that God loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Let me read you some more words that Jesus said while He was on the earth:</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How often I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!"</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Matt 23:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God is willing, but man is not willing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Jerusalem is a city, and the Lord Jesus was crying over her.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord was more than willing to protect her and love her, but the children of Jerusalem would not.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Is there anyone here who knows that he is a sinner?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord says that He loves you and wants you to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Do you want to be saved today?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There is no problem with God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>How about you?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you have heard the gospel today, can you blame God for your going to hell?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God is willing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You are the one that is not willing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God is willing, will you be willing?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I am saying one thing today: God wants you, and God loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He says, "How often I desired...and you would not."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>First Timothy 2:4 says, "Who desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God desires that all men be saved; this is God's heart!</S>
