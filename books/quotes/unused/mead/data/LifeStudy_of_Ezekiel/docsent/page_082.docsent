   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EZEKIEL CHARGED TO BEHOLD, HEAR,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND SET HIS HEART</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ezekiel 40:4 says, And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall show thee; for to the intent that I might show them unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While God was showing the vision of His building to Ezekiel, the prophet needed to have keen sight and to listen intently.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Also, in order to absorb the things that would be shown to him, he had to set his heart upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then he would be able to declare to God s people all that he had seen and heard.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE HOLY BUILDING OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The holy temple is the place where God is, God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we want to seek God, contact God, fellowship with God, and serve God, we need to realize that God has His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the one hand, God is omnipresent; on the other hand, God has His particular place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we want to meet Him, we must know His exact location, His definite habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, we need to consider the vision of God s building in Ezekiel, for this vision describes the place where God dwells His holy temple.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us first consider a general sketch, or plot plan, of the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please consult figure 1 , which is the plot plan showing the temple and the inner and outer courts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The building is square, with each of the four sides being five hundred cubits long.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Three of the four sides have an entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are gates on the east, the south, and the north, all leading to the outer court around the walls.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the outer court are six pavements made of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On each pavement are five chambers built as places for the people to eat and enjoy the sacrifices and offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that the thirty chambers are places for us to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Within the outer court there is an inner court, which also has gates on three sides, on the east, south, and north.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This makes a total of six gates three to the outer court and three to the inner court.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Regarding this, we need to realize that the building which Ezekiel saw has two walls, the wall outside the outer court and the wall outside the inner court.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With each wall there are three gates.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The measurement and design of the walls and the gates are exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Within the inner court is the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This altar is the center of the whole compound of the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The altar is a type of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, the altar at the center of the compound indicates that the cross of Christ is at the very center of God s economy and of God s interests.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Ezekiel 40 48, a section on God s building, three main things are covered: the holy temple, the holy city, and the holy land.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The temple, the city, and the land are all holy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is significant that Ezekiel begins not from the outside but from the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the way of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In His economy God always begins from the inside, not from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We see an indication of this in 1 Thessalonians 5:23, which speaks of our spirit and soul and body, not of body, soul, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This reveals that God begins from within, from our spirit, not from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God s economy always begins from within, whereas human movements are always outward.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In light of this, we need to learn in the church life not to have anything that begins in an outward way but always to have something that begins from within.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is to apply what is revealed here concerning God s building first the temple, then the city, and then the land.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE WALL</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first item we need to see concerning the temple is the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The temple has a wall on all four sides.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The wall is for separation, separating what belongs to God from what cannot belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It separates what should belong to God and what should never belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The wall is thus a separating line.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The measurement of the wall indicates that it signifies Christ Himself as a separating line.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whatever is within Christ belongs to God s interests and to God s building, but whatever is outside of Christ is excluded from God s interests and God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In a city of millions of people, we can know who is of God and who is not of God by Christ as the separating line.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whoever is in Christ belongs to God, and whoever is outside of Christ is separated from God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words, whoever belongs to Christ is within the wall, and whoever is outside of Christ is outside of the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The measurement of the wall is quite unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do not think that through all the centuries of human history, there has ever been such a wall.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This wall is six cubits high and six cubits thick.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we could look at a cross section of the wall, we would be looking at a square six cubits by six cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The number six refers to man, who was created on the sixth day.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since the wall is six cubits high and six cubits thick and since six is the number of man, we may say that the wall signifies the Lord Jesus as a square, upright, perfect, and complete man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a square, upright, perfect, complete, and even resurrected man, Christ is the separating line.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because He is square and upright, He is fully qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Him there is no imperfection; with Him there is nothing lacking and nothing crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Rather, with Him everything is straight, upright, perfect, and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Again I say, such a man is the separating line.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If only the Lord Jesus were such a man, we would be excluded.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are not square, straight, or upright.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We surely are not perfect or complete.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although we are so short, we should not try to imitate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is impossible for any fallen human beings to imitate Christ, the One who is square, upright, perfect, and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we come to the Lord Jesus and compare ourselves with Him, we are exposed and condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For example, in Luke 2 we see that when the Lord Jesus was a child of twelve, no matter how much He was for His Father, He still obeyed His parents.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Young people, you are not obedient to your parents while you are seeking after your Father s interests, but the Lord Jesus was obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>From this one example we can realize that the life history of the Lord Jesus is a condemning factor to us.</S>
