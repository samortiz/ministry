<h2 class="head2">Breaking the Self</h2><p>The best way for the deacons to deal with the self is through handling business affairs in the church. A deacon experiences the greatest dealing in his self and his flesh; through the service, the self receives the most merciless breaking. The church is the best place for the self to be broken. Some people have said that the family and marriage are the best means of breaking the self. Actually, these things do not break the self that much. When we are with our own children, we are in control of everything. But in order to serve as a deacon and fulfill our duty, we have to hand ourselves over; we cannot do as we please. If we have an opinion concerning a matter, we cannot be silent about it. We may think that it is polite to retreat and keep quiet, but if we do this, our spiritual life will come to a standstill. If we do not behave politely, however, we will clash with the brothers and sisters. Problems only arise because our self is not yet broken. From the day we accepted our assignment as a deacon, we have to be ready to take the "suicide" way; we have to be ready to sacrifice the self on the deacon's altar.</p><p>God's requirement for the deacons is that they not hold on to any opinion, idea, or feeling of their own. They should only know to obey God's leading in a simple way. This is a very severe demand. Please consider if there is any group of people on earth who is without any opinion or feeling. If you want to be a deacon, you have to make up your mind the first day to put the self in God's hand. You have to learn to humble yourself, to come under, and to reject all self opinion.</p><p>The problem of the deacons is with their very own person; the problem is not with others. If you will not answer His call and take the lesson of the breaking of the self, you may become a deacon on February 18, but I guarantee that you will quit by March 18. If you make up your mind to answer the Lord's demand from this point onward, you will not have any problem with your assignment. Once you are willing to accept the breaking, you will not have any problem. If you do not have the self, how can you have any problem with the other brothers and sisters?</p><p>Let me tell you a story. In 1936 I was working and living in a certain place. Almost every month I had to travel twice to another locality to settle disputes arising from service in the church. All the brothers loved the Lord very much, and all of them were for the Lord. More than once when I spoke with them, they would kneel down and repent in tears. But the same thing would happen again. They argued about their opinions because their self had not been stripped away by God. They did not allow God to put their self on the altar. If you want to serve as a deacon, you have to make up your mind from the first day to offer the self to God and allow Him to deal with it.</p><h2 class="head2">Bridling the Tongue</h2><p>In serving the Lord in the church, the deacons' tongues have to be bridled by God in the strictest way. If a deacon's tongue is not dealt with, he will render as much trouble to the church as he renders help. He will tear down as much as he builds up. In the past when we asked a person to be a deacon, we asked him to speak little. Now when we ask a person to be a deacon, we ask him not to speak at all. As deacons your job is to exercise your hands and your feet, not your mouth. This is the reason 1 Timothy 3:8 speaks of a deacon not being double-tongued. A deacon has much contact with the brothers and sisters; he knows the saints more than others. He may know something others do not know. He may be aware of private embarrassments of the brothers and sisters which are hidden from others. If he wanted to gossip, he would have much material to gossip about. If your tongue is not bridled, you will be the top telegraph operator or communication officer in the church; you will easily broadcast news to your entire city.</p><p>In the world everyone likes to exaggerate a subject in order to satisfy the lust for sensationalism. A deacon should find excuses to extricate himself from any conversation. He should not make any comment concerning the church. Even when others ask, he should not be tempted to speak. He should always look for ways to extricate himself. After a fellowship meeting, a deacon comes home and faces temptation immediately. As soon as his wife asks him something, he may spill out everything that transpired in the fellowship. He may argue that his wife is probing, but actually, he wants to tell. A wife is not the only one who likes to ask questions; other people like to ask questions as well. They like to hear something from you. When your wife or husband asks anything, you should answer in a gentle way, "You should not ask this, and I should not say anything about this." I answer my wife this way all the time. If we treasure God's church and work and if we consider them high and noble, how dare we talk about affairs and decisions in a light way? Even if the information we have is correct, we must consider the paramount question: "Am I allowed to speak of this in the first place?"</p><p>I often ask the brothers and sisters what they would say when others ask them about the subject of the deacons' meeting. You have to say, "I am a deacon. I can listen and I can ask questions in such a meeting. I can even speak in such a meeting. Once I walk out of the door, however, I have no right to say anything, and others do not have the right to ask me anything." I hope that no brother or sister will discuss church affairs in private. I hope that none will discuss the work under any circumstance. We should only build up, not tear down. We should only edify, not destroy. If anyone has any feeling at all, he should speak up in the meeting. Once he steps out of the meeting hall, he cannot express anything to anyone. It is hard to find a brother or sister who speaks the same thing inside and outside the door. When you ask for his opinion inside the door, he has nothing to say. He nods his head to everything, but once he steps out of the building, he talks loudly and expresses many things. The deacons have to learn to speak properly when it is their time to speak but remain quiet when it is not their time to speak. If they are not in the right place, touching the right things, and before the right people, they should not speak anything.</p>
