<P>He is also the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land (v. 2). A wasted land is a desert, but not a natural desert. A natural desert was not made that way by human hands, but a wasted land has been touched by some, wasted by some. Because this wasted land is full of heat, there is the need of a shadow. This shadow in a land full of heat functions like today's air conditioner. We need Christ as such a shadow to be a canopy over us. Our Christ is wonderful! As the man Jesus, He is our King, our refuge, our covering, our streams of water, and our shadow, our shade. He is so practical to us in our daily life.</P><P>Isaiah 33:22 says that He is our Judge, our Lawmaker, and our King to save us. In His divine government, He is such a person of three aspects. The United States government is divided into three sections in a similar way. This government has three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. In the past I thought that the United States invented such a marvelous government with the balance of powers. Eventually, I found out that according to Isaiah 33:22, God had already practiced this. Christ as the King is the executive branch of the divine government. He is also the Lawmaker, the Legislator, as the legislative branch. Finally, He is our Judge as the judicial branch. He is in these three aspects to exercise His divine government in saving His people. In the United States government these three branches are always balancing one another, but many times they fight against one another. The Lord Jesus in His divine government, however, is perfectly balanced in every way. The three sections of the divine government are one person. Our Jesus is the executive, legislative, and judicial branches in His divine government.</P><P>Whatever is in the Bible is much superior to man's invention. The system of communism was formulated by Karl Marx according to the biblical practice in Acts 2 of the believers having all things common (v. 44). But history has shown that the practice of communism does not work. God gave the children of Israel a way to balance the wealth in the Old Testament, and He does this in a spiritual way in the New Testament (2 Cor. 8:14-15), but fallen man has no way of practicing this in the flesh. Nothing in human culture can exceed what is mentioned in the Bible. Nothing can compete with the divine revelation in the Bible because the Bible is the writing of our God, who knows everything.</P><P>The Bible shows us all the riches of the all-inclusive Christ. Isaiah tells us that our Savior, Christ, is a King to reign according to righteousness and to rule according to justice. He is also a man as a refuge, a covering, streams of water, and a shadow. Furthermore, He is the judicial, legislative, and executive branches in His divine government. He is everything. In addition to these items, He is the stone. He is also our glory as a crown and our beauty as a diadem. He is our wonderful, all-inclusive Christ.</P>
