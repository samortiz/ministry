   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE PAUL S VINDICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 10:7-18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 10:7-18 Paul speaks concerning the measure of God s rule.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us cover this portion verse by verse.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ASPECTS OF APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 7 says, You look at things according to appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If anyone has confidence in himself to be of Christ, let him account this again as to himself, that even as he is of Christ, so also are we.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a frank word, quite different from the words in chapters six and seven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No doubt, the Judaizers were those who had confidence in themselves that they were of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although these Judaizers were Christians, they were not willing to be one with Paul in his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They claimed to be of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, Paul sought to make it clear that the apostles were surely of Christ also.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that to be of Christ is an important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is vital to the Christian life and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verses 8 and 9 Paul says, For if ever I should boast somewhat more abundantly concerning our authority, which the Lord gave for building up and not for your overthrow, I shall not be put to shame; that I may not seem as if to terrify you through the letters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 8 indicates that in the past Paul did say something to the Corinthians concerning his apostolic authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Apostolic authority is not for ruling over the believers, as in the natural sense, but for building them up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 9 Paul speaks of the believers being terrified through letters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This may refer to Paul s first Epistle to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In that Epistle Paul did refer to his apostolic authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some of the Corinthians may have regarded that word as terrifying.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But here Paul indicates that it should not be terrifying to them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 10 Paul goes on to say, Because his letters indeed, he says, are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This confirms what we said in a previous message about Paul being lowly when present with the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was meek and not at all strong physically.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, his speech, his utterance, was contemptible, or of no account.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Greek word rendered contemptible means literally made nothing of.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 11 Paul continues, Let such a one account this, that such as we are in word by letters when absent, such also we are when present in deed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although Paul seemed different in presence from what he was in his letters, actually he was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should learn from him not to be political or naturally polite, but to be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we are present with others, we should not be that bold or strong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This, however, does not mean that we really are weak or unknowing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, we may want to keep from offending others unnecessarily.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, at times we may need to utter something which seems bold or strong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes we need to be strong in writing, but we are not willing to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At other times we should not be so bold in someone s presence, yet we are bold.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that we are not wise, flexible, or forbearing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Let us all learn to be real, not political.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the same time, we must learn to be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, we should try not to hurt others feelings; on the other hand, we may need at times to speak frankly in truth with some degree of boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 12 Paul says, For we do not dare to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves; but they, measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves with themselves, do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who are entangled or ensnared in themselves do not have a proper understanding.</S>
