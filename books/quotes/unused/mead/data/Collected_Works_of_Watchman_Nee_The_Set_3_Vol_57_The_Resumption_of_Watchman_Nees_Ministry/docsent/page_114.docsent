   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Extent of the Outward Man Being Broken</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Determining the Amount of Ministry One Has</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A clever man, who is capable of thinking and scheming, is not very useful in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may speak something with a smile, or you may speak the same thing with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The issue is not how you speak; the issue is how much of your inward man is released.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today the extent that a man is broken determines the amount of ministry he has.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all have to be dealt with by the Lord in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We love to meet some whose outward man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once we see such people, we touch their inward man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The purpose for which we are disciplined and restricted is that our outward man may be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A man can be talking about sad things on the platform, yet not feel sad at all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He can be talking about happy things, yet not feel any joy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This kind of person can only perform; he cannot preach.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some people are so hard in their outward man that they have no response no matter what is said.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are like the men at the time of John the Baptist, who would not dance when others played the flute and would not mourn when others sang a dirge Matt 11:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No Short Cut</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The basis of a man's ministry is his knowledge before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But whether or not the ministry can be released depends on whether the outward man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we began to learn to be a minister of the word, we learned to have the proper knowledge before God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the more we go on, the more we have to see that there can be no real ministry unless the outward man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the rubber tree is not cut, the sap will not flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is impossible for a person who has no wound to have a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no short cut.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even today some people still do not know what it means to utter something from their inward man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Never forget that a man can only have a certain ministry if he is dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After a man has been dealt with, his spirit will be more pure.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether or not a man's spirit can be released depends fully on whether he has been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the same time whether or not a man's spirit is clean depends on whether he has been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once the outward man is broken, the inward man can be released, and a person's word will be able to reach others' hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people think that as long as a person can help others become excited and bring in an exciting atmosphere, everything will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But those who have never been cut open in their outward man will not be of much use.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christian service is based on brokenness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The degree of brokenness and the amount of wounding determine the amount that will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How should a man speak in order that his spirit can be released?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The only way for his spirit to be released is for his outward shell to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whether or not a man's outward shell is broken determines whether his inward spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a man wants to have a spirit that can be used, his outward man must be smitten.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the time we are regenerated, the Lord comes into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that time our spirit is like the Holy of Holies; it is full of light and life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, whether or not the Lord can be released depends on whether our outward man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the outward man is broken, outward things will no longer be a hindrance to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the contrary, they will all become outlets for the spirit to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If our mind and emotion are broken, they will no longer become a hindrance to the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the contrary, they will become the channels for the inward man to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After a man has been broken, his mind and emotion will become the gateway for his inward man to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every city in the world has only four gates.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only the New Jerusalem has twelve gates Rev 21:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether Christ can be released from us depends on whether or not we have been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Need for the Strongest Point to Be Broken</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The nose is the most conspicuous part of the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a man bumps into the wall, the first thing that hits it is his nose.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For many people, when they express themselves, the strongest and most obvious things that come across to others are their cleverness or their thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order for a person to serve the Lord, the strongest part of his outward man must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only then will his inward man be released.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not be Christians for so many years and yet still remain whole and unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You can say that you have not received great revelations before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But you cannot say that for all these years you have not received the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The goal of the discipline of the Holy Spirit is for you to be a broken man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One day, when you receive God's mercy, you will be able to say that at last you understand what it is to be a broken man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By that time, you will realize how easy it is for your spirit to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In order for the inward man to be released, there is the need for severe dealings from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who have never been dealt with cannot afford the Lord a way to go on.</S>
