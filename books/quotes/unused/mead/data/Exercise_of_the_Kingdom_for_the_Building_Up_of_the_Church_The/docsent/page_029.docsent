   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXERCISE AND THE REWARD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we are filled, saturated, and permeated with Christ, we shall spontaneously be under the exercise of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we read Paul s Epistles, we see that he was constantly denying himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His life was also a life of bearing the cross and losing the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was not done by asceticism, but by the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit living within Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul enjoyed Christ as the life-giving Spirit to the uttermost; he hungered after Him and constantly enjoyed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul s enjoyment of Christ spontaneously brought him into the exercise of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This enabled him to fulfill all the requirements of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul was in the exercise of the kingdom for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is only one class of people with whom the church can be built: those who are in the exercise of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we mean business with the Lord for the building of the church, we must be hungry to be saturated with Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By being saturated with the life-giving Spirit, we are brought under the exercise of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we have the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The exercise of the kingdom is the actuality of the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To a great degree, what we have is still the appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are yet void of the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reality of the church life is the exercise of the kingdom, and the genuine exercise of the kingdom comes through the adequate enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through this enjoyment and exercise, we are built up together as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is Christ building His church with Himself through the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Matthew 5:3 says, Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens ; and Matthew 5:10 says, Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are poor in spirit and are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, the kingdom is ours, and we are in it today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But what aspect of the kingdom are we in, in the aspect of reward or the aspect of exercise?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are in the aspect of the exercise of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Matthew 5:20 says, For I say to you, that unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens ; and Matthew 7:21 says, Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father Who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both of these verses speak of entering into the kingdom of the heavens in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, the kingdom is ours, and we are in it already; on the other hand, the kingdom is coming, and we shall enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With respect to the exercise of the kingdom, we are in it today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But with respect to the reward of the kingdom, we shall enter into it in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE WILL OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After saying that only those who do the will of the Father will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord said, Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name do many works of power?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And then I will declare to them, I never knew you; depart from Me, workers of lawlessness Matt 7:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here the Lord seemed to be saying, Get away from Me, you lawless ones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whatever you did was lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You were not doing the will of God, and you were not hungry for Me. Here we see that it is not a matter of doing things or of working, but of enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The will of God is that we enjoy Christ and be built up so that the church may exist on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A WARNING AND AN INCENTIVE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have seen that, on the one hand, we are in the exercise of the kingdom and that, on the other hand, we shall enter into the reward of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This fact must be both a warning and an incentive to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It must compel us, attract us, and encourage us to seek Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, we still may not have a sufficient appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may not yet be hungry for Christ, and we may not take this warning and incentive seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead, we may be indifferent or negligent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But we need to say, Lord, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am hungry for You, and I want to gain You more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I want to gain You so that I may arrive at the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This resurrection from the dead, mentioned by Paul in Philippians 3, is the reward of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I hope that we shall be stirred up to realize that this is not an insignificant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this message you have heard a warning and an incentive.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whether you will accept it or not, whether you will be hungry for Christ and seek Christ or not, is your responsibility.</S>
