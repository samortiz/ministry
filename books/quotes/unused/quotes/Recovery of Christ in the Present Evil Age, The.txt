Eventually, the Sanhedrin, which was the supreme court of Judaism, the religious world, sentenced Christ to death
When we went to Rome and saw all the religious tradition, superstition, and falsehood, we were stirred up to stand against religion
We went to Switzerland, which has Protestant religious centers in cities such as Zurich, Neuchatel, and Geneva
Protestants initially rejected the images of Catholicism but now in these centers there are large statues of John Calvin and other reformers
There is the ancient age of the religious world, the present age of the religious world, and the coming age of the religious world
When the apostle Paul wrote the Epistle to the Galatians, he called the religious age in which he was living the present evil age
The Gospels show that Christ came first to the religious world and that the religious world opposed Him and sentenced Him to death
Following this, Acts and the Epistles show that it was mainly the religious world that persecuted the apostles
We all agreed that the Lord was right to bring His followers out of the heavy, dark religious atmosphere in Jerusalem
In chapter 6 there was no religious debate, for the Lord and His disciples were at the Sea of Galilee, far from religion
After the Lord revealed that He was the bread of life to be eaten by His believers the disciples said This word is hard who can hear it
In chapter 8 it was again in Jerusalem that the Pharisees brought a sinful woman and questioned the Lord according to religion
When the Lord visited Jerusalem the last time, He remained in the city only during the day, and every night He left to stay in Bethany
He also told them I will ask the Father and He will give you another Comforter that He may be with you forever even the Spirit of reality
As one who is God, Christ, and the Spirit, Christ is altogether different from the religious world, which lacks God, Christ, and the Spirit
In addition to the major religions of Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Islam, there are hundreds of other Christian 'isms'
Argument among Christians concerning the form of baptism is a matter of religion, just as circumcision was in the early church
Corinthians 14 speaks of certain principles related to functioning in the meetings, but it also speaks of functioning in the spirit
If a sinner is persuaded to repent so that he will be saved from going to hell, he receives only a religious salvation
Real salvation, which is a living salvation, occurs when a sinner contacts, receives, and believes into Christ
Some may have contacted Christ at the time of their initial salvation, but they do not experience the living Christ day by day
In Galatians 5:1-4 Paul tells us that if we are in the religious world, we have been separated from Christ and have fallen from grace
Grace is not a matter of religion but altogether a matter of Christ, not in a doctrinal way but in the living way of the Spirit
If we ask questions in our mind, even about spiritual matters such as the way to have proper meetings, we are in religion
Nicodemus came to the Lord at night ; he did not follow Him openly, probably because of his religious concepts
The Lord did not call anyone who was older or from Jerusalem, because such ones were drugged with religious concepts
We should care not for doctrine, knowledge, regulations, or forms but only for Christ, who is the living Spirit
We need to love Him, contact Him, fellowship with Him, and take Him as our life, our person, and our everything
When this is our life, our living, and our testimony, we will come together as the church that the Lord desires
We need to be attached to Christ, always enjoying Him as our grace and rejecting any religious forms, dead knowledge, or traditions
Every time He went to Jerusalem, the center of the religious world, He encountered nothing but debating, fighting, and opposition
After the Lord resurrected, He appeared to the disciples and charged them to stay in Jerusalem for a number of days
Just before the time of His birth, a census took place, which forced Mary and her husband, Joseph, to go to Bethlehem
According to Deuteronomy 16:16, all the males of Israel were required to go to Jerusalem three times a year for the ordained feasts
Because Jerusalem had fallen to become the center of a traditional religion, the Lord could not initiate the testimony of God there
When the Lord was about to begin His ministry, He first went not to Jerusalem but to John the Baptist in the wilderness
At that time, the Lord immediately changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which is interpreted, Peter, meaning 'a stone'
Peter was first brought to the Lord and had his name changed not in Jerusalem or Galilee but in the wilderness
The Lord also returned to Galilee, and while He was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Peter fishing with his brother
The Lord trained His disciples mostly in Galilee, but when the feasts came, three times a year, the Lord and the disciples went to Jerusalem
The Lord purposely brought them there, far from the religious atmosphere of Jerusalem, to give them the revelation of Christ and the church
Through baptism we are put into the Triune God to be members of the organism of the divine economy on the earth
After the Feast of Passover, on the first day of the week, when the firstfruits were offered to God, Christ was resurrected
After these forty days, the Lord brought the disciples to the Mount of Olives and charged them to stay in Jerusalem
While they were looking at this, two angels appeared, saying, 'Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven?
These one hundred twenty Galilean men and women stayed in Jerusalem, as the Lord had charged, and prayed for ten days
Although the physical temple with the priests, scribes, and elders was still in Jerusalem, God was now dwelling in the church
While he was on the way from Jerusalem, the Lord appeared to him and said, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me'?
Paul wrote in Galatians 6:15, 'Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters'
According to Galatians 2, Peter and Barnabas continually ate with the Gentile believers, which was contrary to Jewish customary practice
Although the Lord had a new start with the young Galilean fishermen and Saul of Tarsus even these ones eventually became mixed with religion
The last time Paul was in Jerusalem, he went to James and told the elders what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry
These ones whom the Lord had gained from Galilee had become people of Jerusalem; they were mixed with religion
It is difficult to comprehend how Paul could accept their word after having written the Epistles to the Romans and the Galatians
Because the Lord would not tolerate this mixture, in His sovereignty He allowed Paul to be arrested and imprisoned
He forsook Jerusalem and went to Galilee, where He trained a group of young people to be the leaders of His new move with the church
There Paul was truly purified and later wrote the Epistles to the Ephesians, Timothy, and Titus, Epistles of purification
The church in Jerusalem became a mixture of the Old Testament economy and the New Testament economy, a mixture of the law and of grace
Because the Lord could not tolerate this mixture, He sent the Roman army under Titus to destroy Jerusalem in A
The recovery of the proper church life did not begin until the 1700s with Zinzendorf and the Moravian brethren in Germany
A further recovery of the church life occurred a hundred years later, in the late 1820s, when the Lord raised up the British Brethren
Now many years later, local church has become a popular term in the Christian market, appearing in radio broadcasts and printed materials
Some opposed our teaching concerning the practice of the church life; then others received it and mixed it with denominational practices
The Lord will use the United States to train a group of young people and then send them to Europe, especially to the college campuses
We need to see that the Lord has no way with today's religion, just as He had no way with Judaism, the old religion
Those who migrate may go as students, enrolling in a master's program to study the language of the country they are in
Today the young people need to prepare themselves in three ways to go either to Europe or to a college campus in the United States
In this way they will be prepared to take the lead and be responsible ones in the churches that are raised up where they go
The young people need to learn all the truths-the truths concerning such matters as the gospel, the church, the kingdom, life, and grace
The young people need to be prepared in these three ways-learning languages, gaining the church life experience, and learning the truth
Although the Lord came directly to the religious world, He did not have rest when He was in Jerusalem, where the temple of God was
Eventually, the Lord appeared to Saul, knocked him down, and turned him from religion to Christ, causing him to have a radical turn
Galatians 2 tells us that some time after Paul was converted, the apostle Peter became weak, timid, and afraid of religion
Peter was eating with the Gentile believers, but when some Jewish believers came, Peter withdrew from eating with the Gentiles
Although Peter was originally a Galilean, one outside the realm of religion, he eventually compromised with religion
In Galatians Paul says that Christ 'gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age'
The religious age of the apostle Paul was evil, and our age, our section of the religious world, is perhaps even more evil
The Church of England is the eldest 'daughter' of the Catholic Church; the second 'daughter' is the Lutheran Church

A certain Christian leader teaches that Christ cannot be in us because He resurrected with a physical body and ascended to the third heaven
If our outward environment begins to bother us, we need to be reminded by the Spirit that in reality we are living in Christ
Christ living in us and our living in Christ and putting on Christ should not be doctrine to us but our daily experience
As a result of Christ living in us, our living in Christ, and our putting on Christ, we live Christ and magnify Christ
Because the human mind today is filled with religious concepts, there are endless questions about our practice of the church life
Such religious questions are related to matters such as head covering, pray-reading, physical appearance, and the eldership
In 5:4 Paul says, 'You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace'
Christ is more real and practical to us than He was to His disciples, for He is within us, but He could only be among them
If we are Christ-conscious, we will not be bothered by something in our environment such as a troublesome roommate
We need a vision and a revelation to see that God desires nothing but Christ and that Christ today is living, real, and practical
Galatians 6:15 says, 'Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters'
He will come back when He can tell the enemy, 'You have set up many religious things, but look at My church, My bride
As the Lord is going on, we need to be clear about the nature, position, and function of the church as well as the history of the church
The word Nicolaitans is composed of two Greek words meaning 'to conquer' and 'the common people,' indicating that hierarchy had come in
Church history confirms that at the end of the first century a system of hierarchy began to creep into the church
The hierarchy did not develop much in the first two centuries because the church was under the persecution of the Roman Empire
Every member in our physical body is living and therefore functions as it should without needing to be told what to do
The unification of Christianity with the Roman Empire brought many dead ones into Christianity, creating the need for organization
Due to the papacy and the hierarchical organization of the Catholic Church, the earth became increasingly dark
His writings show that his intention was only that the doctrine of justification by faith would be made clear to the people
After the state churches were formed, seeking saints began to see certain aspects of the truth through their reading of the Bible
Those who saw baptism by immersion in the Scriptures stood up for this truth and even suffered persecution for it
Because he did not want to see religious fighting in his empire, he summoned all the great teachers to a council in Nicaea in A
That council produced the first creed, which is recognized today by the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches
God's purpose is to have a proper church-full of life and constituted with Christ-to be the expression of God on the earth
In Matthew 13:33 the Lord likens this mixture to leaven, 'which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened'

One hundred years later, in 1827, the Lord raised up the British or Plymouth Brethren under the leadership of John Nelson Darby
The British Brethren were raised up in 1827 with a more complete vision but were damaged by emphasizing doctrinal knowledge
He started a meeting at a sister's home in his hometown of Foochow, and that was the beginning of the church life in China
When Brother Nee refused to agree with this brother's ordination, the other members signed a paper to excommunicate Brother Nee
In those times Brother Nee was learning the lesson of the cross-not to fight for himself and not even to vindicate himself
Throughout China hundreds of young people were enlightened and raised up to follow the Lord through reading The Christian
A large number of believers left the denominations, but few were clear about the proper practice of the church life
Many of the groups that were raised up met in a way that was still influenced by the denominational background
When a man is saved and comes into the church, he already has certain concepts about how things should be done
Throughout the years of Brother Nees ministry there were at least three or four times when he saw a further revelation concerning the church
The Lord's move was forced from mainland China to Taiwan, and from Taiwan it eventually spread to the United States
According to this rumor, there is a difference between Watchman Nee's teaching concerning the church and my teaching
Those who believe this accept Brother Nee's ministry related to life but condemn his ministry related to the church
Because Brother Nee's ministry has been diluted in this way, today it needs to be strengthened and intensified
Some Pentecostal Christians have adopted the writings of Brother Nee and invented new ways to define the local church
Among Christians in the United States there are at least three or four different ways in which the term the local church is used
The pure bride will not be the Roman Catholic Church, the Protestant denominations, the independent groups, or the charismatic movement
He will take the same way that He took when He began His ministry in Galilee-He will gain a group of young people
After three and a half years the great tribulation will begin when Antichrist breaks his covenant with the Jews and begins to persecute them
He will cause the offerings to stop and will set himself up as God, putting an image of himself in the temple to be worshipped
The young people must prepare themselves to go either to Europe or to the college campuses in the United States
The saints should not be concerned about outward matters such as the eldership, head covering, or foot-washing
Human beings seemingly cannot stay away from trying to do good or from keeping forms, rituals, and regulations
The Christ who is versus religion is not the objective, doctrinal Christ but the subjective, experiential Christ
Every part of our inner being-our mind, emotion, and will-needs to be saturated and possessed by Christ so that He can be one with us
Verses 2 through 3 speak of receiving and being perfected by the Spirit, and verse 14 speaks of receiving the promise of the Spirit
Galatians 4:6 says, 'Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father'!
Because God is righteous and holy, He could not do anything to be one with man until Christ had accomplished a full redemption
He transcended everything and ascended into the heavens, where He was made the Head over all things to the church
Similarly, Christ, who today is the Spirit, still possesses His incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
To love others apart from the Spirit is religion, and not to love others apart from the Spirit is also religion
Husbands make up their minds to be nicer to their wives; saints make up their minds to function in every meeting
When we begin to pray, we may not be in the spirit, but if we keep praying, after a short while we will be in our spirit
We may be stirred up, burdened, and ready to go for the Lord's move to Europe or to a college campus in the United States
Before we go, we have to learn to pray to stir up our spirit, turn our being to our spirit, and call our being back into our spirit
When we are in the spirit, we will know the right time to speak at length and the right time not to say a word
Galatians 6:18, the last verse of the book, says, 'The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers
We all need to be delivered from the evil religious age, and we all need to enjoy the grace of the Lord Jesus in our spirit
