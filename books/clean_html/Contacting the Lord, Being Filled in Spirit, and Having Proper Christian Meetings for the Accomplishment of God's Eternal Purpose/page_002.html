<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S MOVE IN THE UNITED STATES</h2>
<p>Before I moved to the United States, I had no thought that I would ever do so. When I visited the United States, I came simply as a visitor with no intention to stay, but while I was here, I carefully observed the situation. One night while I was in San Francisco, I told the brother with whom I was staying that I had the definite sense that the Lord wanted to do something on the West Coast of the United States. After staying with this brother for two or three nights, I left the United States and had no plans to return. My thought was that if the Lord wanted to do something in America, He would surely raise up some saints in America to do this work. After a while, although I still had no thought to move to America, I felt that the Lord was urging me to visit again. Because of this, I came to the United States for a third time. My intention was to stay for three months and then to return to the Far East. When the three months were nearing an end, I made arrangements to visit Taiwan and Manila. Everything was ready for my departure, but the Lord would not allow me to leave. The Lord simply kept me here. This was a great suffering to me. I desired to leave, but the Lord would not allow me to leave. Eventually, I became clear that I had no other choice but to submit myself to the Lord. I told the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I have to go along with You. I give up. I will go along with You, and I will stay here.&rdquo; Then I became very clear, and I immediately sent a cable to the Far East, telling the brothers there that I would not be able to return. I also made a call from Seattle, where I was staying at the time, to San Francisco. I told the brother there that I had the burden to visit Sacramento and then to go to Los Angeles. Shortly after this, I visited Sacramento. That was the first time I visited a place without first being invited.</p>
<p>At that time the Lord greatly used two books written by Watchman Nee&mdash;<em>The Normal Christian Life</em> and <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em> Prior to the publication of these two books in America, I visited place after place and saw that the Lord had raised up seeking ones. I also observed that nearly all these seeking ones had been raised up by the Lord in the preceding two to five years. Because the Lord had prepared all these seeking believers, when these two books were published, the hungry Christians devoured their contents. These two books were published at exactly the right time. In fact, <em>The</em><em> Normal Christian Life</em> was published in the very same month that I became clear that the Lord was leading me to stay in America. At that time, in addition to observing the tremendous response to the writings of Watchman Nee, I received letter upon letter and call after call from believers all over the country. These things have confirmed to me that the Lord truly desires to do something wonderful in the United States in these days.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE GREAT MATTERS IN THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<p>In this message we will consider three great matters in the Scriptures. The first matter is God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, God&rsquo;s ultimate intention. God is a divine person with a mind, emotion, and will and is full of wisdom and desire. Thus, in His divine mind there must be a purpose, and this purpose must be both divine and eternal. Ephesians 3:11 says, &ldquo;According to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; In light of this verse we need to ask, &ldquo;What is God&rsquo;s eternal purpose?&rdquo; The second matter that we will consider in this message is the way that God takes to accomplish His eternal purpose. Once we have seen that God has purposed something according to His own desire, we need to find out how He accomplishes this purpose. The third matter that we will consider is the way in which God applies what He has accomplished to us. First we will consider God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, then we will consider how God accomplishes this purpose, and finally we will examine how the accomplishment of this purpose is applied to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Eternal Purpose</h2>
<p>The entire Bible reveals that in eternity past, according to His own desire, God purposed to do something. He purposed to do one thing&mdash;to gain a group of people who would be His living Body and would express God the Father in God the Son as God the Spirit. God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to have a living, corporate Body through which He can express Himself as the Triune God. God the Father in God the Son as God the Spirit will be expressed and manifested through a corporate Body composed of human beings.</p>
<p>God is mysterious, infinite, and unlimited, yet He desires to be expressed and manifested. To this end God created man. Man was the last item of God&rsquo;s creation. This indicates that everything that God created prior to creating man was in preparation for man. Once God had made everything ready, He created man. This reveals that man is the center of God&rsquo;s creation. God created man as the center of His creation in a very purposeful way. Man was created in the image of God and committed with God&rsquo;s divine authority over all creation (Gen. 1:26). The fact that man was created in the image of God reveals that man was created to express God, for an image is an expression. For example, if I take a picture of you, the picture will capture your image and will be an expression of you. The fact that man was given authority over all the earth means that man is to be God&rsquo;s representative on the earth. From the way in which God created man, we can see that God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man was that man would express Him and represent Him. This is God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
