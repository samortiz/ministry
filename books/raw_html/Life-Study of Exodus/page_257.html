<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE SEVENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE ENACTMENT OF THE COVENANT</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 24:1-8; Heb. 9:18-20, 22; Jer. 31:33-34; Ezek. 36:25-29a</h1><p>This message is a continuation of the foregoing message on the enactment of the covenant. We have seen that when Moses enacted the covenant, he built both an altar and twelve pillars. The altar indicates that we need to be redeemed, terminated, and replaced. The pillars signify that we need to become a living testimony of God, a reflection of what He is.</p><h2 class="head1">III. WITH BURNT OFFERINGS AND PEACE OFFERINGS</h2><p>Exodus 24:5 says, &ldquo;And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto Jehovah&rdquo; (lit.). It is not difficult to understand the significance of these offerings. The burnt offering was for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. We were created by God for His satisfaction. However, because of the fall man has failed to satisfy God. Eventually Christ came as the second man and fully satisfied God. Thus, He could be the burnt offering to satisfy God.</p><p>After God was satisfied through the burnt offering, there could be peace between God and man. This peace depends on the peace offering. When man and God together enjoy Christ, there is mutual satisfaction and peace. Christ first became the burnt offering offered to God to satisfy Him, and then He became the peace offering to make peace between man and God. Eventually, Christ became a feast for God and man to enjoy mutually. This is the Christ who has redeemed us and terminated us and who is now replacing us. The more we are replaced by Christ in our experience, the more we become the burnt offering and the peace offering. Day by day we satisfy God and enjoy peace with Him as we feast on Christ with God and enjoy Him with God.</p><p>By our own efforts to keep the law it is impossible for us to satisfy God, to have peace with God, or to enjoy Christ with God. I say again that God did not give the law to His people with the intention that they observe it. God&rsquo;s intention is for the people to be replaced by Christ and to become a reflection of God. This is God&rsquo;s economy. We thank Him that in the recovery this has been made clear to us.</p><p>According to the natural concept, the almighty God, the Creator, the holy One, has given us the law that we may observe and keep it. Although this religious concept is common among Christians today, it is far off from God&rsquo;s economy. We in the recovery may still be under the influence of this concept, perhaps subconsciously, to some degree. After listening to a particular message, we may pray, &ldquo;Lord, I make up my mind to live according to this message. Please help me carry out my decision.&rdquo; This kind of prayer exposes the fact that we are still under the influence of the natural, religious concept. It takes a long time to be fully free from this influence. When we read a certain requirement in the Bible, it is easy for us to make up our mind to fulfill that requirement ourselves. Like the children of Israel at Mount Sinai, we promise the Lord that we shall do whatever He says. However, if we are enlightened by the Lord, we would no longer make up our mind to do what He requires. Instead, we would pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me, for I am not able to do what You require. Lord, I praise You that You have redeemed me and terminated me and that You are in the process of replacing me with Yourself and making me Your reflection.&rdquo;</p><p>Praise the Lord that we have the cross to terminate us and Christ to replace us! Christ is our burnt offering and our peace offering. As we experience Him, He makes us a living burnt offering and peace offering. This does not come from trying to keep the law; it issues from experiencing the altar and the sacrifice, the cross for termination and replacement to become God&rsquo;s testimony. If we experience Christ and the cross in this way, we shall have not only the altar and the sacrifices, but also the twelve pillars. Hallelujah for Christ&rsquo;s marvelous redemption and replacement that can transform fallen, corrupted sinners into pillars!</p><p>Do not strive to keep God&rsquo;s law. Christ has redeemed you, and now He is in the process of replacing you, reconstituting you, and rearranging you to make you a living testimony of God, His reflection. If you walk according to spirit and set your mind on the spirit, automatically the righteous requirements of the law will be fulfilled in you and you will become a testimony of God.</p>
