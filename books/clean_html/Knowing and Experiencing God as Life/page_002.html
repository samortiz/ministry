<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING BY THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:57, 63; 14:19-20; Gal. 2:19-20; Phil. 1:20-21</h1>
<p>There are several important verses in the Bible that contain the word <em>live.</em> For example, John 6:57 says, &ldquo;As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo; The word <em>live</em> is used twice in this verse. The first time is concerning the Lord living because of the Father, and the second time is concerning our living because of the Lord by eating the Lord. In 14:19 the Lord said, &ldquo;Because I live, you also shall live.&rdquo; The word <em>live</em> is used twice here also. The first use speaks of the crucified and resurrected Lord living in the believers, and the other speaks of the believers living by the Lord. In Galatians 2:19-20 Paul says, &ldquo;I through law have died to law that I might live to God. I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; In Philippians 1:21 Paul says, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; In these verses the word <em>live</em> is related to the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IMPORTANT WORDS IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>If we can commit these verses to memory, the Holy Spirit will speak to us and will also shine in us. For two thousand years these words have been buried in the Bible and neglected by God&rsquo;s children. I hope that we can now uncover these words.</p>
<p>These verses are very important. Most brothers and sisters highly regard the more common speaking in the Bible, such as, &ldquo;Wives, be subject to your own husbands&rdquo; (Eph. 5:22); &ldquo;husbands, love your wives&rdquo; (v. 25); &ldquo;children, obey your parents&rdquo; (6:1); and &ldquo;fathers, do not provoke your children&rdquo; (v. 4). Most believers regard these words highly and can recite them. However, these words, though precious, are merely like the &ldquo;watermelon rind&rdquo; of the Bible. When we eat watermelon, we do not eat the rind, but we eat the precious part inside. Although the Bible contains many precious words concerning God being life to us, it is regrettable that these words have been neglected by many Christians. Innumerable messages are being given to believers every Lord&rsquo;s Day, but it is not common to hear a message concerning God living within the believers or concerning His desire for the believers to live by His life. Some preachers speak about &ldquo;living for God,&rdquo; but the word <em>for</em> causes us to think that we should do something for God. The Bible does not stress our living for God but our letting God live in us, that is, our living according to God, our living by Him, and our living because of Him.</p>
<p>I hope that we would commit these verses to memory. Please do not think that I am bothersome because I ask you to memorize these verses. People who mine precious gems expend great effort in order to cut through rocks and dig deep in the earth. Hence, it is worthwhile to spend a few days to dig out these verses, which are like diamonds.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD GIVING US LIFE<br />
SO THAT WE WOULD LIVE BY HIM</h2>
<p>The precious words in the Bible speak of the Lord coming to be our life. God&rsquo;s children neglect the matter of life. Some who speak of life give the impression that to believe in the Lord is to receive eternal life in the future. They regard eternal life as the blessing that believers will receive in the future. Others think that to believe in the Lord is to receive a life that never perishes. Based on John 3:16, they say that people are destined to perish but that after they receive eternal life, they will not perish. They link eternal life to salvation from perdition.</p>
<p>It is true that those who have eternal life will not perish, because they have received a life that is eternal and cannot perish. However, the divine life does not merely save us from perishing, nor is it merely a promised blessing for the future. The Lord gives us His life so that we may live by Him today. This is the central teaching in the New Testament. Many verses in the New Testament show that God&rsquo;s purpose in entering into us as life is not merely to save us from perishing, nor is it for us to enjoy the blessing of eternal life in the future. He intends that we would live by Him today. God has entered into us to be our life; hence, He needs to live in us. He is not waiting to be our life in the future. He has entered into us to be our life today. Hence, from the moment we were saved, we should live by the life of God. We do not receive the divine life merely to be delivered from perdition, nor do we receive this life merely to receive a blessing in the future. These things are supplementary, not primary. The primary matter is that God is in us so that we would live by Him. Now we will consider how to live by the Lord.</p>
