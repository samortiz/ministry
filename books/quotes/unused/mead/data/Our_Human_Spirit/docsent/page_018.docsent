   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX OUR HUMAN SPIRIT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:17; 2:22; 3:5; 5:18; 6:18; 4:23; Col 1:9-10; Phil 2:1; 2 Tim 1:7; 4:22; Heb 12:9; Rev 22:6; 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10; 1 Thes 5:23; Heb 4:12; Luke 1:46-47; Phil 1:27; 1 Cor 6:17 A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 1:17 says, "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To know God, to know Christ, and to know the church needs a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This could only be possible if we are willing to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are four verses in Ephesians with the little phrase "in spirit": 2:22; 3:5; 5:18; and 6:18.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter two, "in spirit" is for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In chapter three, "in spirit" is for seeing the revelation of the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in chapter five you have the infilling of the indwelling Spirit in your spirit: "And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled in spirit" 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In spirit we have the filling not the outpouring, not the outward filling, but the inward filling of the Holy Spirit in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just as the drunken people are filled with wine in their body, we have to be filled with God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their body becomes a container of wine, and our spirit, in the same way, becomes the container of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is our divine, spiritual wine John 2:10; Matt 9:17; Psa 104:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We contain this wine with our spirit, so we have to be filled with God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians 6:18 charges us to pray "at every time in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church life is absolutely a matter in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's habitation, the church, is in our spirit Eph 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To see God's mystery about the church, the Body of Christ, is in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be filled with God in His economy is in spirit and to pray to God is in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church life is absolutely a matter in our spirit, so we all have to learn how to be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>ONENESS IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we would take care of our spirit we would not argue, but we would be one in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If six brothers came together and forgot about their spirit, right away they would fight.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The southerners would fight against the northerners, and the older would fight against the younger.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But, praise the Lord, we have a place to go!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have the means to use.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we get into our spirit and exercise our spirit we all will be one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Unity is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church life is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A RENEWING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ephesians 4:23 tells us that we need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Usually with the worldly people, their mind is absolutely separate from their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Ephesians 4:23, however, the spirit is one with the mind and becomes the spirit of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When our spirit is one with our mind, when our mind is subject to our spirit, our spirit becomes a renewing spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are being renewed day by day in such a spirit that is one with our mind.</S>
