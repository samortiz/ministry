<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Throughout the centuries God&rsquo;s unique goal has been to join Himself to man and through that to destroy Satan. After Satan fell, God immediately pronounced His judgment on Satan. Satan was judged and sentenced to be cast into the lake of fire and perish there. Hence, God&rsquo;s children should have a strong enmity toward Satan, the devil, and should be clear concerning the destiny of Satan ordained by God so that, through their oneness with Christ, they might withstand all the works of the devil. In this lesson we will cover the prophecies concerning the end of Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. SATAN&rsquo;S FALL AND GOD PRONOUNCING<br />
HIS JUDGMENT OVER SATAN</h2>
<p>Before God created the earth, Satan was an angel created by God. From the day that Satan was created, he was perfect in his ways (Ezek. 28:15). He was even called &ldquo;Daystar, son of the dawn&rdquo; (Isa. 14:12). He was the cherub anointed to cover the Ark (Ezek. 28:14). However, his heart was lifted up (v. 17). He wanted to exalt himself to be equal with God and to overthrow God&rsquo;s authority and throne (Isa. 14:13-14). Thus, he rebelled against God.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s rebellion against God ushered in God&rsquo;s judgment upon him. Ezekiel 28 contains God&rsquo;s judgment on the rebellious Satan: &ldquo;You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, until unrighteousness was found in you. By the abundance of your trading they filled your midst with violence, and you sinned. So I cast you out as profane from the mountain of God, and I destroyed you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness. I cast you to the ground; I presented you before kings that they may look at you. By the multitude of your iniquities in the unrighteousness of your trading you have profaned your sanctuaries. Therefore I sent forth fire from your midst; it consumed you, and I reduced you to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all those who look at you&rdquo; (vv. 15-18). Isaiah 14:15 says, &ldquo;You will be brought down to Sheol, / To the uttermost parts of the pit.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE EXECUTING OF<br />
GOD&rsquo;S JUDGMENT OVER SATAN</h2>
<p>At the time that Satan rebelled against God, God pronounced His judgment on him. However, God&rsquo;s judgment over Satan is being executed over a very long period of time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In the Church Age</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Lord Jesus Being Manifested in the Flesh<br />
to Destroy the Works of the Devil</h2>
<p>First John 3:8 says, &ldquo;He who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.&rdquo; Satan, the devil, has sinned continually from ancient times, and he begets sinners so that they might practice sin with him. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might undo and destroy the sinful deeds of the devil, that is, condemn, through His death on the cross in the flesh (Rom. 8:3), sin initiated by the evil one; destroy the power of sin, the sinful nature of the devil (Heb. 2:14); and take away both sin and sins (1 John 3:5 and footnote 1, Recovery Version).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_076.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_078.html">Next</a> </body></html>
