   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. Two Sets of Five Curtains Each</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 3 says, Five curtains shall be joined one to another, and the other five curtains joined one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus, there were two sets of five curtains each.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Five is the number of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Five curtains joined one to another signify a continuous life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These sets signify the responsibility shown in the continuous life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A set was not composed of just one curtain, but was made up of five curtains, with each continuing the other.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This portrays that the life of the Lord Jesus as revealed in the four Gospels was a continuous life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all agree that in the life of the Lord there were not any gaps.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, two groups of five curtains indicate a testimony of a continuous life, testifying that the Lord Jesus is a complete and perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>J. Blue Loops</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verses 4 and 5 tell us that on the edge of the outermost curtain in each set, there were fifty loops of blue.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Loops signify availability for joining, and the color blue points to that which is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fact that these loops were on the edge of the outermost curtain on each set indicates that they were the issue of the life of responsibility for a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These loops apply to our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, a certain brother may have the virtues of boldness and stability.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, there may be a gap between these virtues which makes it difficult to connect them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But with the Lord Jesus boldness is connected with humility, humility with patience, and patience with kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the virtues of the Lord Jesus are connected; there are no gaps between them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, because there are gaps between our virtues, it is difficult for us to be joined to others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If there is no connection between a brother s boldness and stability, it will be difficult for him to be joined to others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There were fifty loops at the edge of each set of curtains.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fifty is composed of ten times five and denotes a complete responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ten is the number of human completion, and five is the number of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, fifty composed of ten times five means complete responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, since there were fifty loops on each set of curtains, there was a total of one hundred loops, indicating a full testimony of the complete responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This reveals that the life of Jesus satisfied the requirement of the Ten Commandments ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to verse 5, the loops on each set were opposite to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This signifies confirmation for testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the humanity of the Lord Jesus there is much confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All His virtues His kindness, His righteousness, His patience are confirmed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This confirmation is for the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>K. Fifty Clasps</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Exodus 26:6 says, And you shall make fifty clasps of gold, and join the curtains to one another with the clasps, and the tabernacle shall become one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Clasps of gold signify the joining power of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The number fifty here signifies full responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The joining of the curtains to each other makes the tabernacle one, signifying that it makes the testimony one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The joining power of Jesus humanity is of His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Likewise, in the church life today we have the joining power only in the divine nature; we do not possess it according to our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The four Gospels reveal that all the virtues of the Lord Jesus form one testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the significance of the joining of the curtains that makes the tabernacle one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result of this joining, there is one perfect, complete, and whole testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In light of all the points covered in this message, I would like to say a word concerning our need to know the Lord Jesus in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From the time we were very young, many of us heard about the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, because we are familiar with the stories in the Bible about Christ, we should not think that we have a proper and adequate knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you consider all the matters signified in 26:1-6, you will realize that you actually have very little knowledge of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In these verses we see a detailed portrait of the complete and perfect humanity of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because many aspects of Christ s humanity are indescribable, we need the portrait afforded by these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to see the picture of the Lord s humanity portrayed by the first covering of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although we do not have words to describe the details of Christ s humanity, we can gain some understanding of them by praying over these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more we consider the significance of the details here, the more we shall realize what a wonderful Person the Lord is in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We see Him in the fine twined linen, in the colors of blue, purple, and scarlet, in the cherubim, and in all the loops and clasps.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all need to know the Lord Jesus in such a detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As we consider the first layer of the covering of the tabernacle, we shall see that the curtains clasped together are not simply a covering, but are a protective covering.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This covering protects everything underneath it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The tent, the tabernacle, is not simply a dwelling place; it is also a container.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It contains the ark, the table, the lampstand, and the incense altar, and it covers all the standing boards.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since we are typified by the boards and the boards are covered by the curtains, we may say that the first layer of covering covers and protects us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This covering also embraces us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, the humanity of the Lord Jesus covers us, protects us, and embraces us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Daily I am under the covering of God s tent and protected by it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Furthermore, I am embraced by this covering and even contained within it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Here, under the covering, protection, and embrace of the Lord Jesus, I enjoy Christ as the ark, as the table with the bread, and as the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not gain an adequate understanding of Christ by reading only the Gospels and the Epistles in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We also need the types, the pictures, in the Old Testament, especially the types related to the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I hope that all the saints will come to appreciate the fine points of the Lord s humanity signified by these types.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we come into the tabernacle, we see that the ceiling, the first of the coverings, is the inward expression of the Lord Jesus in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The linen, the blue, the purple, and scarlet, the cherubim, the loops, and the clasps are all parts of this expression.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Those who have not come into Christ cannot behold Him in such beauty and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As we shall see in the next message, outwardly Christ has the appearance of tough porpoise skin, something which can withstand all the storms and weather all the elements.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But when we see Christ from within, we know that He is heavenly, He is kingly, He is the redeeming One, and He is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Praise the Lord for the portrait of Christ in the first covering of the tabernacle!</S>
