   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Trying to Make It</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I met a sister yesterday who spent two hours telling me her history of failure.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While she was speaking, I was smiling.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Finally, I asked her, "Are you willing to concede now?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do you still have some hope in yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Have you failed enough?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She admitted that she could not make it, but she still lacked one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first thing that God shows us is that we cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to lose hope in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But this alone will not bring us to victory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is one thing for us to acknowledge that we cannot make it, but it is another thing for us to not try to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I said to her, "Your realization that you cannot make it is good and right.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But you have not realized that you are still trying to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Don't you see that you are still trying to make it?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since you know that you cannot make it, you should have stopped your own work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Don't you see that you are still trying even though you say that you cannot make it?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She admitted that she could not make it, but at the same time, she did not see that she was working and hoping that she could make it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I asked her a few times, "Don't you realize that you are still working?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Don't you realize that you are still trying to overcome?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She was struggling and trying.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why she could not overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She asked me what she should do.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I told her that she only needed to accept the cross, acknowledge her weakness, and stop trying or expecting to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I said that the minute she tried to do anything, she would fail.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She asked, "If I fail in spite of doing everything, won't I fail even more if I don't do anything?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is where the problem lies with many people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They know very well that they cannot do anything, and they know very well that they are absolutely powerless, yet they are still struggling and striving.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The result is that there is still no victory, and they still cannot overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In experiencing the overcoming life, there are two very important conditions in regards to surrendering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, we have to acknowledge God's appraisal that we are not able in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second, we should not try to become able.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, we should lose hope in ourselves completely.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A brother once told me that he could not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I told him that he should give up trying to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He remarked, "What kind of teaching is this?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I said, "All you have to do is tell God that you cannot believe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is waiting for you to acknowledge that you cannot believe."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What does it mean to be crucified with Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It means that henceforth I am not responsible for my own victory and I am not responsible for my own failure.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>My things are in Christ's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose a sister serves a cup of tea, and while you are picking up the cup, she holds on to it and will not let go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On your side, you are trying to drink the tea, but on her side, she is still holding on to the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though she says that she is serving you the tea, she will not let go of it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without her letting go, you cannot drink the tea.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What does it mean to be crucified with Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first meaning of being crucified with Christ is to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The second meaning is to not try to take control.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You should tell God, "From now on, I offer myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From now on, victory is Your business, and patience is Your business."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A brother once asked what it means to be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I told him that being victorious is resigning, and resigning is expiring.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It means that victory is no longer his business.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once I met a sister and told her, "You only have to do one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Just say to God that from now on, you can do nothing, and that you are not responsible for anything."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We cannot stop losing our temper, we cannot suppress ourselves, and we cannot surrender.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>From now on, we should give up and not worry or care about anything anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we come before God, we often tell Him that we cannot make it, or that we cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, when we walk away from His presence, we pick up everything ourselves again.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Brothers and sisters, whatever we bring to God when we come before Him must be left with Him when we leave His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Those who know how to leave things with God will experience deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once I delivered a manuscript to a sister and asked her to make a clean copy of it for me.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But when I left, I took the manuscript with me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although she was willing to do the copying work, there was no way that she could do it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is how we pray today.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We say with our mouth, "God, please help me."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But after we pray, we take up everything ourselves again.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, the most important thing is to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to say, "God, I cannot overcome, and I do not intend to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Neither will I try to overcome."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is being crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>"I am crucified with Christ!"</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When you wake up in the morning, Satan may tell you that you are not good, that you are the same in this and that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You may become sad.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, what are you going to do?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You should say, "I have known for a long time that I am utterly corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I have given up hope in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I do not intend to make any more headway in myself."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If you say this, you will immediately become well.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is very amazing!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is not a matter of a change but of an exchange.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You have to grasp hold of God's accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If there were any usefulness in you, God would not have crucified you on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God has put you to the cross and put you in Christ because you are utterly corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, you should let go.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>What should you do practically?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You should say, "God, I cannot improve myself, and I do not intend to improve myself.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Lord, from now on, I am through; I will not try to make it anymore, nor do I intend to make it anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Brothers and sisters, do you dare to let go?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I have mentioned the story of the doctor who smoked cigars.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He was over seventy years of age and had been struggling with cigars for years.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>One day in a meeting, he began to talk about his struggle with smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>A young man who knew the Lord said, "If I were you, I would not struggle."</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The old man said, "If I cannot quit even if I struggle, wouldn't it be more difficult to quit if I did not struggle?"</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The young man said, "No!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If I were you, I would say to God, I cannot stop smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>You quit for me.'"</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The old man thought that there was some sense to the young man's word, and he did so accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He told God, "I cannot quit smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I will not struggle to quit any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Lord, I commit this matter to You.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I will not take control any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Please quit for me."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Every day he smoked twelve to twenty cigars and had been doing this for fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>He surrendered on that day, and the next day he told others that he had woken up for the first time without thinking about smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Brothers and sisters, if you think that you can become holy, you will surely fail.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If you think that you can become perfect, you will surely fail.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If you think that you can become patient, you will surely fail.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>God sees us as being beyond any possibility of repair or improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Can you say with Paul that you are crucified on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>You are utterly corrupt and useless, and you only deserve to be nailed to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This is what Paul meant.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>When I was in Peking, I asked a brother if he was through.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>He said, "Thank and praise the Lord, I am through!"</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This is a basic qualification: We must see before God that we are completely useless and that there is no way to improve or correct ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>All we have to do is to tell the Lord, "From now on, I commit everything to you.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>You do everything for me."</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Some brothers and sisters acknowledge that they cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>They acknowledge that they are through and that they have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>But why have they still not overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Why do they still fail?</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Why have they not yet realized victory?</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Brothers and sisters, there is another word which we must not forget.</S>
