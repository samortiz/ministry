   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR A VISION OF GOD'S GOAL THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the negative things we have mentioned crept into the church throughout its history.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some of the saints fought against these things and defended the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ignatius, a great defender of the truth, was martyred at the beginning of the second century.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that although Ignatius was such a defender of the truth, he made a mistake because he was short of a clear vision, a complete view, of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nearly all the defenders of the truth made mistakes for this reason.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ignatius made a great mistake that turned into the establishment of the episcopal system.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He did it unintentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His heart was good, but he made a mistake because he did not have a clear vision of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By the end of the sixth century, the papacy was fully formed and established.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During the five and a half centuries before the establishment of the pope, many so-called puritans were raised up by the Lord to fight for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They loved the Lord, loved the Bible, and stood for the Lord according to what they had seen, but nearly all of them made some mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the second century the term Catholic Church was used.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The so-called Catholic Church became very worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some of the faithful saints did not agree with this, and they fought against the worldliness in the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was very positive, but they did not have a clear vision of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were just for not being worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were fighting against worldliness and stood so much for not being worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a sense, that was good, but in another sense, they made a mistake in that they became a mere free group of unworldly Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They did not care for the Body, the church, the new man, or for the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They did not care for God's goal but only for not being worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are many Christians today who are acting in the same principle of caring for other things besides God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to church history, human power, human rule, hierarchy, and human organization crept into and prevailed in the so-called church, but there was not much place or ground left to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A group of puritans were raised up who were very much against this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They declared that the church should be under the authority of the Holy Spirit, and they fought against human rule in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Regretfully, however, they did not care for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They only cared for being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first group I mentioned cared for not being worldly, and the second group cared for being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, neither group cared for the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They did not care for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, these kinds of free groups gave up the Catholic Church, the general church, and began to meet by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>History tells us that these groups even began to exclude one another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They left the Catholic Church for different reasons and they stressed different points, and sadly they began to exclude one another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They became different free groups who did not receive one another.</S>
