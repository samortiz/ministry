   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our general subject is the crystallization of the gospel of God in the Epistle to the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have studied the verses concerning grace in Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we have gone on to see more concerning grace in Paul s Epistles from 1 Corinthians through 2 Thessalonians.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now we want to see the grace of God from 1 Timothy through Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may wonder why we are considering grace in other books of the New Testament, since we are on the crystallization-study of the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is because although all the writers of the New Testament touch the grace of God, except Matthew and Mark, Romans is the center and the framework of God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is in Romans that we are told grace is God personified.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Romans 5:21 says that grace reigns, and this grace is God.</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sin is an evil person, Satan, and this personified Satan reigns.</S>

   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The New Jerusalem is grace reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Grace as God will reign in the New Jerusalem, so the New Jerusalem is the consummation of God reigning as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The New Testament is a history of grace as God moving and living in and among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Jews and Muslims think that they understand God, but they do not really know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even though you read the Bible many times, you still cannot fully know God until you get the crystallization of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Who can know God to the depths of what He is without knowing the crystallization of the important items in the New Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The New Testament shows us that grace first is God conceived in Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God came to Mary in visitation as grace, which was the very factor of Mary s conception of the incarnated God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>She found this grace Luke 1:28, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we do not know all the verses concerning grace in the New Testament in a crystallized sense, we cannot know God in a complete way.</S>
