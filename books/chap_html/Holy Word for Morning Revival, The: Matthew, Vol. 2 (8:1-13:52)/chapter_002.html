Hence, the record in this section has a dispensational significance, as did the record in 8:1-17. The daughter of the ruler of the synagogue represents the Jews, and the woman with the hemorrhage represents the Gentiles. When the daughter died, the woman was healed. After the woman was healed, the daughter was revived. Subsequently, two blind men and one dumb man were healed. This is a type, showing that when the Jews were cut off, the Gentiles were saved, and that after the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, the Jews will be saved (Rom. 11:15, 17, 19, 23-26). After that, the millennium will begin, in which all the blind and dumb will be healed (Isa. 35:5-6).</p><p>As the Lord was on the way to the ruler’s house, a woman who had been sick of a hemorrhage for twelve years “approached from behind and touched the fringe of His garment.”…The woman had been sick for twelve years, the age of the ruler’s dead daughter (Luke 8:42).… The woman here and the centurion in 8:5-10, both representing the Gentiles, came to contact the Lord in the same way—with faith. The woman was healed while the Lord was on the way to the ruler’s house. This signifies that the Gentiles are saved while Christ is on the way to the house of Israel. Christ’s garment signifies His righteous deeds, and the fringe signifies the heavenly ruling.…Out of Christ’s heavenly-ruled deeds issues the virtue that becomes the healing power (Matt. 14:36).</p><p>In verses 23 through 26 we have the healing of the synagogue ruler’s daughter. The daughter here and Peter’s mother-in-law in 8:14-15, both representing the Jews at the end of this age, were healed in a house by the Lord’s coming and His direct touch. This indicates that at the end of this age all the remnant of the Jews will be saved in the house of Israel by the Lord’s coming and His direct touch (Rom. 11:25-26; Zech. 12:10).</p><p>Immediately after the raising of the ruler’s daughter, two blind men and a dumb man are brought to the Lord (vv. 27-33).…These two blind men called the Lord the Son of David. In the millennial kingdom, that is, in the restored tabernacle of David (Acts 15:16), the Messianic kingdom, the Jews will recognize Christ as the Son of David, and their blindness will be healed. This is typified by the two blind men recognizing Christ as the Son of David. The two blind men were healed in the house by the Lord’s direct touch (v. 29).…The opening of [their]…eyes signifies the recovery of inward sight, by which we see God and spiritual things (Acts 9:18; 26:18; Eph. 1:18; Rev. 3:18).…In verses 32 and 33 we see the healing of the demon possessed dumb man. Dumbness caused by demon possession signifies man’s inability to speak for God (Isa. 56:10) and praise God (Isa. 35:6) because of his worshipping of dumb idols (1 Cor. 12:2).
