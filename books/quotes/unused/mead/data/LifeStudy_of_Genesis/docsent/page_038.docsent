   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a With the Image of God Inwardly</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 1:26 says, "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness..."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here we find two things the image and the likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All of the good Bible students agree that the image refers to something inward and the likeness refers to something outward.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all have something inward the intellect, the will, and the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Outwardly, we have the likeness, the body-form.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1 The Image of God Is Christ</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second Corinthians 4:4 and Colossians 1:15 both say that the image of God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is invisible; yet He has an image.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The invisible God has a visible image.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No one has ever seen God, but Christ has declared Him John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all, more or less, have seen Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Peter saw Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John saw Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After His resurrection, five hundred brothers saw Him at the same time 1 Cor 15:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is really the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hebrews 1:3 says that Christ is the express image of God's Person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2 Man Was Created in Christ's Image</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since man was created in the image of God and the image of God is Christ, man was created in the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Genesis 1:26 God said, "Let us make man in our image..."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But verse 27 says, "God created man in his image."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Surely here "his image" means the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So, man was made in the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>3 Adam Was the Type of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans 5:14 says that Adam, the first man, was a type, a figure of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we take a photograph of a person, that picture is the figure or type of the person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Adam was a photograph of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ was the image of God and Adam was a picture of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a photograph is the expression of a certain image, so man was made to be the expression of the image of God which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I may use the illustration of a glove.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The glove was made in the image and according to the form of the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Both the hand and the glove have five fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The glove was made in the image of the hand that one day the hand might enter into the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The hand fills up the glove, and the glove expresses the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why was man made in the image of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because God's intention was that someday Christ would enter into man and be expressed through man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Romans 9:21, 23 tells us clearly that man was made as a vessel, that is as a container.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man is not a knife, a hammer, or any instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man is a vessel, a container.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Romans 9:21, 23 further says that man was made a vessel of honor to contain God, to contain God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Second Corinthians 4:7 says that we have this treasure in earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This vessel is like the glove: one day the hand gets into it; the contents get into the container.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are simply a vessel to contain Christ.</S>
