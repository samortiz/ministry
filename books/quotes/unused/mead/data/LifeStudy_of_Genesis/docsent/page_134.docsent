   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Overcomers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This conquering seed also makes us overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are the co-overcomers with Christ because we have the over-coming seed within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Romans 16:20 we have the promise that God will soon crush Satan under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nevertheless, as co-overcomers with Christ, we are attacked and accused by the serpent 2 Cor 12:7; Rev 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The serpent will also try to devour us Rev 12:4 , but we can overcome him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not overcome by our merit; we overcome by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of our testimony Rev 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must declare the word of our testimony, telling the serpent, "You have been bruised."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not only preach the gospel to human beings, but must also declare to the serpent the facts regarding the conquering seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you are tempted to lose your temper, do not try to overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Simply speak to Satan, "Satan, don't tempt me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Don't you know that you have been bruised?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Say this the next time Satan entices you to lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not pray, but remind the serpent that he has been bruised.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Say to him, "Satan, read your Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Read Hebrews 2:14.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I want to remind you that you have been destroyed."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We overcome him by the word of our testimony, by declaring what Jesus has done.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, the overcomers do not love their soulish life even to the death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, we will be co-rulers with Christ, ruling over the nations with a rod of iron Rev 2:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Revelation 2:26-27 is a quotation from Psalm 2, a prophecy concerning Christ that predicts His rule over the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, the fulfillment of this prophecy concerns the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By this we can see that the Bible actually combines Christ and all His overcomers as one body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This gives us further ground to say that the manchild in Revelation 12 is not only Christ Himself, but Christ as the Head and all the overcomers as His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the prophecy of Psalm 2 Christ is prophesied as the One who will rule over the nations with a rod of iron.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the fulfillment in Revelation 2:26-27 the overcomers are revealed as the ones who will rule over the nations with a rod of iron.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The prophecy and its fulfillment bring together Christ and His overcomers as one manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, Revelation 12:5 says that this manchild will rule all nations with a rod of iron.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are co-rulers with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to Revelation 20:1-6, we will also be co-kings with Christ to rule with Him in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE RESULT</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now we come to the result.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The seed is in Genesis 3:15, and the result, the harvest, is in Revelation 20 through 22.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Each of the three items has grown from a seed into a highly developed form.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The serpent has grown into a dragon Rev 12:9; 20:2 , the individual woman has grown into a corporate woman, and the individual seed of the woman has grown into a corporate manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A. The Serpent to Be Cast</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>into the Lake of Fire</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Revelation 20:10 declares that the serpent ultimately will be cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the harvest of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Satan's destiny and destination is the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>B. The Woman to Issue in the New Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The woman herself will issue in the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2, 9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the harvest of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The destiny and destination of the woman is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>C. The Seed of the Woman to Be the Center</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>of the New Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What about the seed of the woman?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The seed of the woman will be the center of the New Jerusalem Rev 21:22-23; 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the harvest of the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The destiny and destination of the seed of the woman is to be the center of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I believe that the Lord has shown us clearly the serpent, the woman, and the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The seed of these three items is in Genesis 3:15, and the harvest of them all is in Revelation 20 through 22.</S>
