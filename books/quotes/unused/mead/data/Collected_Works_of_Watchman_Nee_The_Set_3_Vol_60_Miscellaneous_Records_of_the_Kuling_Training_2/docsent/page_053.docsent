   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE A CHANGE OF CONCEPT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING VALUE Scripture Reading: Matt 23:16-26</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A person often measures the value of something according to the amount of knowledge he has of it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Matthew 23:16-26 we find some people whose eyes were on the splendor of the temple and how it was built mostly with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They considered the temple to be most valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some saw the altar and compared it with the oxen, lambs, and turtle doves offered on it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They reckoned the altar to be of little value but the oxen and lambs and turtle doves to be of much value.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some offered a tenth of the mint, anise, and cummin, yet they neglected the weightier matters of the law justice, mercy, and faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some were very careful about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They strained out the gnat, but they swallowed the camel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some were in a hurry to use the cup and the dish.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They cleansed the outside of them, but inwardly there was filth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can ask a new believer, "How would you evaluate these different kinds of people if you met them?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What do you think of their concept of value?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Matthew 23:16-26 the Lord Jesus called these people fools, blind men, and hypocrites because they did not know the true concept of value.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Their concept of value was all wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A GENUINE BELIEVER HAVING A CHANGE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>IN HIS CONCEPT OF VALUE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before a person believes in the Lord, his concept of value is perverted.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But once a person is saved, his concept of value changes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He no longer cherishes what he once cherished, and he treasures what he once despised.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a change in his concept of value.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Anyone who has not witnessed such a change in concept is not a genuine Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE CHANGE IN CONCEPT OF VALUE IN A BELIEVER</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible has much to say concerning a change in one's concept of value.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such passages on this change can shed light to the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These passages show us the proper concept of value for a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us consider a few examples to prove our point.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Valuation of the Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Psalm 118:22 says, "The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a change in valuation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the eyes of the builders, they rejected what they considered to be a useless stone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the eyes of the Jewish leaders, Christ was something redundant, and they wanted to get rid of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet this rejected stone was chosen to be the cornerstone of the newly enacted salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A cornerstone must be flat on at least two or three sides.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually it should be flat on all six sides.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God treasured the cornerstone which was rejected by the Jewish builders and used it for the building of His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How different are these two kinds of valuation!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to bring new believers to such a change in valuation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to ask how they viewed Christ before and how they view Christ now.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to show them that what was once worthless is now priceless.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What was once untrustworthy is now trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Others have rejected Christ, but we treasure Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Concerning the Word of the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First Corinthians 1:18 says, "For the word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The cross is despised by those who are perishing; it is considered foolishness by them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet it is held precious by the saved ones and received by them as the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This speaks of the great change in valuation of the cross, from the time before a person is saved to the time after he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before a person is saved, he considers the cross useless.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After he is saved, he sees it as the power of God, something precious and valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once a person believes in the Lord, his concept of value changes immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The salvation of the cross becomes something very precious.</S>
