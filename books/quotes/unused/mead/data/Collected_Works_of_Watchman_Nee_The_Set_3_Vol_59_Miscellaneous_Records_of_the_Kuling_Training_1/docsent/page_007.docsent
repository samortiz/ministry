   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT 2 Date:May 26, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Customs Lane, Foochow The Ability to Know Men Touching Spirit with Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second result of the breaking of the outer man is that one begins to know men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is very important for a worker to know men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a person comes to us, we have to know his spiritual condition; we have to know where his problem lies.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do not know men or their spiritual condition, we will not be able to render them any help.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A doctor needs many instruments to diagnose a patient.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even with many instruments, he sometimes cannot determine the illness of his patient.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When a person comes to us, he may not tell us everything that is within him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A sinner often does not tell the truth, and believers often skip important things that we need to know.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is impossible to know men simply by their words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot know a person simply by our ears or our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only those whose soul and spirit are separated and who are able to exercise their spirit can know men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a very basic principle in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We know men by the spirit, because the spirit discerns all things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must learn to know others' spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must learn to sense their spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We measure a person not by the words he speaks but by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We touch others' spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is what it means for deep to call unto deep and for deep to respond to deep.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order for the senses in our spirit to be acute, the outer man must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every saved person should be inwardly clear about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If he is not clear, it is because his outer man has choked the way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We know a person's spirit by his words.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As such, we have to touch the spirit behind a person's word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not know men just by our ears or eyes; we know their spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, their spirit follows their words.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, we have to touch the spirit behind the words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A proud person sooner or later will betray a proud spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He may say many humble things with his mouth, but others will touch his proud spirit sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What he says at the beginning is merely a kind of imitation or performance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His last few words determine his true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to touch others' spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the only way to know their true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Identifying Artificiality and Falsehood</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The only parts of man that can be improved are his thoughts and attitudes; a man cannot change his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Young brothers should be as simple as possible; they should not be pretentious in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No pretense has any spiritual worth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some young people are very flippant; others are very solemn.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Both the flippant and the solemn ones are off the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is a brother in Shanghai who was saved only a year ago, but he is neither flippant nor solemn.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is good.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No outward embellishment will do us any good.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a man's spirit has learned the proper lessons before the Lord, others can tell the difference as soon as he opens his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order for a Christian to advance, he has to break down all outward, artificial humility, calmness, and godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He can deceive those in degraded Christianity, but he cannot deceive us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should never pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When God breaks us through the discipline of the Holy Spirit and purges our emotion and destroys our stubborn will through the environment, we will be built up spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we will touch others' spirit and come to know other men.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The problem with the young people is that they seek to build up their behavior instead of their spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All outward things will be destroyed one day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is possible to lie not only with our words but with our behavior as well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Job was upright in everything and eschewed evil.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But he eventually repented of his own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before the Lord we have to be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not pretend or perform in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First, we have to realize that we maintain God's presence by separating the outer man from the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Second, through the separation of the outer man from the inner man, we also acquire a knowledge of men.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We come to know men only after our outer man and inner man have been separated.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We cannot know men with the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once our outer man is separated from our inner man, we are ready to listen to others and to touch their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As a result, we will discern any falsehood in others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Anything artificial is false and deceptive.</S>
