   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT WIDER THAN A LOCALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have just seen that the boundary of a church cannot be narrower than the locality to which it belongs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the other hand, its boundary cannot be wider than the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Word of God we never read of the church in Macedonia, or the church in Galatia, or the church in Judea, or the church in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because Macedonia and Galilee are provinces, and Judea and Galatia are districts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A province is not a scriptural unit of locality; neither is a district.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both include a number of units; therefore, they include a number of separate churches and do not constitute one church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A provincial church or a district church is not according to Scripture, since it does not divide on the ground of locality, but combines a number of localities.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is because all scriptural churches are local churches that there is no mention of state churches, provincial churches, or district churches in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Then had the churches rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria" Acts 9:31, KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy Spirit did not speak here of the church, but of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because there were a number of localities, there were also a number of churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was not God's plan to unite the churches of different places into one church, but to have a separate church in each place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There were as many churches as there were places.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"He passed through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches" Acts 15:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Again the reference is not to one single church, because Syria and Cilicia were vast districts, each comprising a number of different places.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is permissible in political circles to unite many different places into a district and call it Syria or Cilicia, but God does not unite the believers in a number of different places and call them the church in Syria, or the church in Cilicia.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There may be unions or mergers in the commercial or political world, but God sanctions no combinations among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Each separate place must have a separate church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"All the churches of the Gentiles" Rom 16:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The churches of God were not formed on national lines but on local lines; therefore, there is no mention of the church of the Gentiles, but of the churches of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"The churches of Asia greet you" 1 Cor 16:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"The churches of Macedonia" 2 Cor 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"The churches of Galatia" Gal 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"I was still unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which are in Christ" Gal 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Asia, Macedonia, Galatia, and Judea were all areas comprising more than one locality-unit; therefore, the Word of God refers to the churches in these areas.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A church according to the divine thought is always a church in one locality; any other kind of church is a product of the human mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God sanctions no division of the church within any one locality, and He sanctions no denominational combination of the churches in a number of localities.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Scripture there is always one church in one place, never several churches in one place, nor one church in several places.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God does not recognize any fellowship of His children on a basis narrower, or wider, than that of a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nanking is a city, and so is Soochow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because each is a separate unit, each therefore has a separate church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The two places are both in the same country, and even in the same province, but because they are two separate cities, they must form two separate churches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Politically Glasgow and Nanking do not belong to the same province, or even the same country; yet the relationship between Nanking and Soochow is exactly the same as between Nanking and Glasgow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nanking and Soochow are as truly separate units as Nanking and Glasgow are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the division of churches the question of country or province does not arise; it is all a question of cities.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Two cities of the same country, or the same province, have no closer relationship than two cities of different countries or different provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's intention is that a church in any one locality should be a unit, and in their relationship one to the other the different churches must preserve their local character.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When God's people throughout the earth really see the local character of the churches, then they will appreciate their oneness in Christ as never before.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The churches of God are local, intensely local.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If any factor enters in to destroy their local character, then they cease to be scriptural churches.</S>
