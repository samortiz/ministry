<h2 class="head1">THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN LONDON</h2>
<p>The visit by T. Austin-Sparks at the end of 1955 was a notable event among us. Before his visit we did not have official fellowship or contact with any Christian group in the West. Brother Nee visited the West, but almost no Christians from the West visited us. Brother Sparks&rsquo;s visit and his fellowship gave us many impressions that caused us to pay attention to the direction and the work of the Lord in the present age.</p>
<p>In July and August of last year, Brother Sparks called an international conference in London and insisted that I attend. My absence disappointed him. The conference began in London, then it went to Denmark, and finally to Scotland. Only twenty-five to twenty-nine people attended the meeting in Scotland, which was a meeting of workers from various places. It was not a gathering of all the saints. America, Europe, India, and other places in the world that know something of the way that the Lord is taking were represented in the international conference. But there was no one from the Chinese-speaking areas of Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. This disappointed Brother Sparks because he wanted some believers from these areas to attend the conference.</p>
<p>A brother with whom I labored previously sent me a substantial amount of information concerning the conference. Brother Sparks also sent me a detailed letter about their meetings and about his feeling concerning the meetings. In addition, I also received a letter from a Western sister who is a co-worker. Hence, I know what took place in the conference from these three sources.</p>
<p>Brother Sparks led the attendants to see and to study the way that the Lord is taking in this age. He said that the churches and even the work in every place should be the same and that we should have the same vision and know the way that the Lord is taking in this age and the work that He is doing. He also said that if we see the way that the Lord is taking and the work that He is doing, the churches and the work will be the same. In his letter to me, Brother Sparks did not write about the result of the meetings, but he clearly said that very few among the brothers have a large capacity. The brother who labored with me in the past wrote that Brother Sparks spoke of Taiwan numerous times during the conference. Brother Sparks hoped that the workers from some places, particularly from India, would pay more attention to the work in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The Western sister described the meeting that took place in Scotland. Her letter indicated that the attendants felt that the work at Honor Oak needs to be balanced. Her words were rather strong. She said that Honor Oak &ldquo;only gives and does not receive&rdquo;; that is, they only give to others; they do not receive from others. If they do not receive, they are not balanced. We should not have the thought that the goal of my travel is to balance others. This is not my intention. I am merely fellowshipping concerning the spiritual condition of different places.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN GROUPS IN THE WEST</h2>
<p>The majority of Christian groups in the West, except for Catholicism, are fundamental. Two Christian groups are quite influential. One group is represented by the Keswick Convention, which is renowned among Christians in the West. This convention may be the largest gathering of Christians from all over the world. Besides the Brethren and us, who take the way that the Lord is taking, zealous Christians and Christian workers from all over the world, including Africa and Australia, are desirous to attend the convention. Any preacher who becomes a speaker at the Keswick Convention is considered to be very good, because this opportunity is not given to many. This shows how influential the Keswick Convention is among Christians in the West.</p>
<p>The other influential group is the evangelicals. The Christians in this group are concerned with the spread of the gospel. They are content to labor together for the spread of the gospel, but they do not stress the truth. The evangelicals can be subdivided into three groups, the largest group being the missions. The most influential mission has been China Inland Mission, which focuses on preaching the gospel in foreign countries. After the political situation changed in China, however, China Inland Mission ceased its work in China and is no longer as influential. It is a top mission that was highly esteemed in the hearts of Christians during the past fifty to sixty years. Another mission is the Oriental Missionary Society founded by Charles E. Cowman, whose wife wrote <em>Streams in the Desert.</em> Other mission groups are the Christian and Missionary Alliance, which was founded by Dr. A. B. Simpson, and the Baptist denomination. These are very good missions that send missionaries to preach the gospel overseas. They are admired and respected by Christians in the West.</p>
<p>Another evangelical group focuses on domestic gospel campaigns. The believers in this group do not belong to any mission; instead, they act individually. There are at least ten evangelical revivalists in America, and the most famous is Billy Graham. These brothers are mainly concerned with preaching the gospel domestically. Once in a while they may travel abroad, but their primary work is within their country. They feel that they should not evangelize foreign countries when their own country is a land of Gentiles. They feel that since the number of believers in their country is decreasing and the number of unbelievers is increasing, they should preach the gospel to their countrymen instead of in a foreign country. Hence, they promote gospel campaigns in their country.</p>
<p>Just like the mission groups that go abroad, these brothers do not care about anything else. They make a concerted effort to preach the gospel. Wherever they go, they require all the Christians, regardless of their denomination or sect, to cooperate, work, and pray together. Before they go to an area, they send a team to prepare the atmosphere by advertising their gospel event on billboards and in newspapers. When the atmosphere is ready, they arrive with a support group and hold a large gospel meeting. They do not emphasize the truth, the ground of the church, or the way of the church, nor do they discern these matters. They only make a united effort to preach the gospel. This group is prevalent in America.</p>
<p>A third evangelical group uses healing to preach the gospel. However, in most cases this is not divine healing. Most of the people whom this group claims to heal are not really healed. When I was in Manila, I attended this type of meeting because many brothers and sisters went there to be healed. Divine healing must not be based on feeling. It must be based on medical facts. A person who is sick with a fever may claim to be healed because he feels better after a preacher lays his hands on him. Feelings, however, are not sufficient evidence of healing.</p>
<p>A brother in Manila had a Christian neighbor who had a stomach disease and therefore went to a &ldquo;divine healer.&rdquo; After the healer laid his hand on the neighbor, he felt better and stood up to testify that he was healed. When he went home, however, the pain in his stomach returned. Some among us may have gone to be healed by these preachers, but they were momentarily healed psychologically rather than physically. In conclusion, the evangelistic groups send missionaries to foreign countries, unite to preach the gospel to their countrymen, and preach the gospel through &ldquo;divine&rdquo; healing.</p>
