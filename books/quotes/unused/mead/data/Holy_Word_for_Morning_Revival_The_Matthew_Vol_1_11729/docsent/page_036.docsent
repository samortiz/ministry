   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 5 PROPHECY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Outline The King's ministry 4:12 11:30 The decree of the kingdom's constitution 5:1 7:29 Concerning the righteous deeds of the kingdom people 6:1-18 Concerning the material riches of the kingdom people 6:19-34 Concerning the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others 7:1-12 Concerning the ground of the kingdom people's living and work 7:13-29 Crucial Points</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The fourth section of the King's decree on the mountain, Matthew 6:1-18, concerns the righteous deeds of the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here the Lord uses three illustrations the giving of alms, praying, and fasting to reveal how we are filled with the self and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must do our righteous deeds in secret, for our Father is in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all need some secret growth in life, some secret experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Following this, we find the pattern of prayer vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>9-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, it is not the pattern for all prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The prayer in John 14 17 is related to life, whereas the prayer in Matthew 6 is a prayer of warfare against God's enemy for God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The fifth section of the King's decree vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>19-34 concerns the riches of the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, the Lord is dealing with the underlying matter of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In ancient times, the children of Israel had to labor by tilling the ground, sowing the seed, watering, and harvesting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was their duty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But whether or not they received the harvest depended on God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Their responsibility was to labor without having any anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Likewise, we must fulfill our duty, our responsibility, but not for the sake of our anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our duty is to give, to lay up treasures in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sixth section of the new King's decree on the mountain 7:1-12 concerns the principles of the kingdom people in their dealings with others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, His intention here is to encourage us to forget ourselves and to take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we take care of others, we will not judge them, criticize them, measure them, nor impose requirements on them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To help them we must be blind, considerate, sympathizing, and full of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The seventh and last section of the King's decree vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>13-29 concerns the ground of the kingdom people's living and work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this section, there are four crucial words that reveal the consummation of the kingdom's constitution: gate, way, will, and house.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No one can fulfill the requirements of this constitution unless he has been regenerated and possesses the life and nature of the heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To enter in through the gate is simply to begin walking on the way, a way that is lifelong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our way is full of limitations, restrictions, and constrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the limitations are not a frustration; rather, they will speed us on our way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Remember two things are needed for our entrance into the kingdom of the heavens: to call on the Lord and to do the will of the heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through calling on the Lord, we have been regenerated with the divine life, whereas our doing the will of the Father is to live that life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Finally, the kingdom's people living and work must be founded on the word of the new King.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hearing His words and doing them, we are likened to a prudent man, who built his house upon the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The house built upon the rock will not fall because it is built according to the constricted way, the way of doing the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, to build with our opinions, human concepts, and natural ways is to build upon sinking sand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When tested, this house will fall.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is to build with wood, grass, and stubble, a work that will be burned by the testing fire 1 Cor 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the Lord's conclusion of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
