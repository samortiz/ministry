   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord s Promise to Never Leave Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the Lord s charge in Matthew 28:19, He promised in verse 20, Behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the Lord comes into us by our calling on His name, and after we are put into Him through baptism, He will never leave us, and we can never get away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even if we regret receiving the Lord and ask Him to leave us, He will not leave.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are involved with Him for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may get away from Him outwardly, but we can never get away inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord has come into us, and we have been put into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Being Baptized into the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Matthew 28:19 reveals that we are baptized into the name of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 6:3 and Galatians 3:27 reveal that we are baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, we are baptized into the name of the Triune God, into Christ, and into the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the proper baptism in the proper church life, not an empty formality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When a person calls upon the name of the Lord Jesus, we should baptize him into the Triune God, into the living Christ, and into His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the day a person is baptized, that person is in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Wherever he goes, he brings the Triune God, Christ, and the Body with him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For over forty years I have been experiencing this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have been put into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>An Error Regarding Baptism</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Most Christians agree that Matthew 28:19 refers to water baptism, but there is argument about Romans 6:3 and Galatians 3:27.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some say that these verses refer to water baptism; others say that these verses refer to Spirit baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the Bible, however, there is no such distinction in our experience; water baptism is Spirit baptism Acts 8:35-38; 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the church baptizes people properly, the baptism is in water and in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should explain to every new believer, Now that you have called on the Lord and He has entered into you, the church will baptize you into the Triune God, which is also to baptize you into Christ and into the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is both water baptism and Spirit baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If it were only water baptism, the Body would not go with each member wherever he goes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Water alone would not be that effective; such a reality requires the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The proper baptism involves both the physical element, water, and the spiritual reality, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Spirit honors this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE BODY-CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now that we have seen that we have been baptized into the Body, we need to see what the Body is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First Corinthians 12:12 says, Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse does not end, as we might expect, by saying, So also is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It ends with the words so also is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Christ at the end of this verse is the Body-Christ, Christ as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First Corinthians 12:12 clearly reveals the fact that Christ is a Body with many members.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the Body-Christ, the incorporated God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>ENJOYING THE BODY-CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because we are in the Body and are part of the Body, we are enjoying the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some believers may feel that there is no need to go to a meeting in order to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If they stay by themselves, they may enjoy a small portion of the individual Christ, but they will never enjoy the riches of the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the meetings of the church every member of the Body has a portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For this reason, we each need to open our mouth to release the riches of Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do not come to the meetings and open up our mouth to release the riches of Christ, we will have only our individual portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all need to share our portion of Christ and enjoy the portion of others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This mutual sharing of Christ by all the members in the Body can be compared to the circulation of blood in our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If any member of our body does not participate in the circulation of blood, that member will eventually become unpleasant and infected.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more a member sends out blood to the rest of the body, the more blood comes into that member.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The more we open up our mouth to release Christ, the more Christ comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, we all need to release our portion of Christ in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Body-Christ is full of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Each member may have only a small portion, but all the portions added together become a great sum of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not keep our portion to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we do, our portion will become stagnant.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Regrettably, many brothers and sisters are old because they do not release their portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because each of us is a member of Christ s Body and has a portion of Christ, we all need to release our Christ to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the way we can all enjoy the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Jews know only the bachelor God, the God of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The fundamental Christians know only the incarnated God and the redeeming God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more advanced Christians know the indwelling God, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, in the Lord s recovery today, we not only know the bachelor God, the incarnated God, the redeeming God, and the indwelling God, but we also are enjoying the incorporated God, the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to be in the Body, in the church life.</S>
