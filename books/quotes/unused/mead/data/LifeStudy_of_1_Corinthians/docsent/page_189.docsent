   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. For Women</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The last part of verse 33 actually introduces verse 34 and reads: As in all the churches of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word as indicates that all the local churches should be in the same practice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Corinthians 1:2 and 10:32 mention the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But here we read of the churches of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church of God denotes the constituent of the church; the church is constituted of the element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The churches of the saints denotes the components of the churches; the churches are composed of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 34 says, Let the women be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but let them be subject, as the law also says.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The phrase in the churches means in the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to 11:5, women can prophesy of course, in public with their head covered, and Acts 2:17 and 18 and 21:9 confirm that there were women prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But in 1 Timothy 2:12 women are not permitted to teach, that is, to teach as an authority there teaching is related to the exercising of authority , defining doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, according to the New Testament principle, for women not to be permitted to speak in the church meetings means that women are not permitted to teach with authority concerning the defining of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this sense they should be silent in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are not permitted to speak because they should be subject to man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is related to the matter of authority ordained by God in His government.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In God s governmental ordination, women are not permitted to speak with authority over man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They may pray and prophesy, that is, mainly to speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, they must do this under the covering of the brothers because they are charged here to be subject.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The law in verse 34 refers to the books written by Moses Matt 5:17; 7:12; 11:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Moses writings, Genesis 3:16 charges the woman to be subject to man s rule.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is God s ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Corinthians 14:34 should not be understood in isolation from the rest of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, we need to interpret the Bible by the Bible and with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the teaching of the entire New Testament, sisters may prophesy, but they do not have the authority to define doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This must be left to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, it is a fact of history that some of the most serious heresies have come in through women.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1933, after giving up my job to serve the Lord full time, I visited Brother Nee in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While I was there, he told me that, under the influence of the Brethren practice, they did not allow the sisters to pray in the meetings, much less to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He told me they had followed that practice for eleven years.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, Brother Nee realized that if the sisters did not pray in the meetings, half of the church would be paralyzed and out of function.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That would be a damage and loss to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, Brother Nee was considering how to adjust the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then he referred the matter to me and asked what I thought about it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I said that I thought we needed to have the sisters pray in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is an example of making a decision related to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a decision involves authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such a decision with authority is the kind of speaking Paul is referring to in verse 33.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He does not agree that sisters should speak in the church meetings in a way to exercise authority over the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do not understand the verse in this way, we have no way to reconcile it with chapter eleven, where Paul speaks of the sisters praying or prophesying with their heads covered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a strong indication that the sisters can speak in the meetings, as long as they have a covering on their head.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 35 Paul says, But if they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once again in the church means in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 36 Paul asks, Or was it from you that the word of God went forth, or did it reach only to you?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This strong, frank word indicates that a local church should follow the other churches in its practice.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the local churches should submit to the universal order of the Spirit according to the word of the apostles, from whom the word of God goes forth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In verse 37 Paul goes on to say, If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him know clearly that the things which I write to you are a commandment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul here was speaking with authority, uttering a commandment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul s word in verse 37 indicates that to be a prophet or to be spiritual is highly esteemed in the church for the carrying out of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A prophet is one who is second to the apostle in God s administration in the church 12:28 , who speaks for God and speaks forth God, and who has received revelation of the mysteries of God concerning Christ and the church Eph 3:5 as the foundation for building the church Eph 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A spiritual person is one who lives according to his spirit, which is mingled with God s Spirit, and who is able to discern all the spiritual things 1 Cor 3:1; 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such spiritually knowledgeable persons should know clearly that the Apostle Paul s teachings are the commandment of the Lord, and their speaking should correspond to his teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul s spirit is strong and his word is frank in dealing with the disorderly Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He charges them to know definitely that his teachings are a commandment of the Lord, and they are authentically authoritative of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since the apostle s teachings are according to God s ordination, they are the commandment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 38 says, But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sometimes Paul is polite, but here he is strict and frank.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 39 says, Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Here Paul softens his tone a little in order to calm down the turmoil among the disorderly Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Actually, this entire chapter deals with prophesying and speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since prophesying is the most profitable gift in building up both the saints and the church with the rich ministry of Christ, it is highly evaluated and promoted by the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because speaking in tongues does not afford any profit for such building, the apostle is faithful to expose its lesser value.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Both the apostle s evaluation and exposure are according to his concern for the fulfilling of God s purpose in building up the church with the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At the conclusion of this chapter, he still charges us to desire earnestly to prophesy for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, he also charges us not to forbid to speak in tongues in order to keep the all-inclusiveness and oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In verse 40 Paul concludes, But let all things be done becomingly and in order.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The apostle s concern for the church is that Christ as God s center and the church as God s goal may be carried on and carried out with all things done becomingly and in good order before men and angels 4:9; 11:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our natural life is useless in fulfilling such a high purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The experience of Christ crucified 1:23; 2:2 for the termination of our self and the experience of Christ in resurrection as our daily sanctification and redemption 1:30 are needed for a proper church life.</S>
