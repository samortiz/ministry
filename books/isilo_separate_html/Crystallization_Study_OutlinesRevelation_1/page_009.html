<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 4:1&mdash;5:14</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>It is crucial for us to see a vision of God&rsquo;s sovereignty&mdash;Dan. 4:1-3, 34-35; Rom. 9:19-23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Sovereignty refers to God&rsquo;s unlimited authority and power&mdash;Rev. 4:11; 5:13.</li>
	<li>As the sovereign One, God is above everything, behind everything, and in everything&mdash;1 Kings 22:19.</li>
	<li>God has the full capacity to carry out what He wants according to the desire of His heart and according to His eternal economy&mdash;Dan. 4:35.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The book of Revelation is a book of God&rsquo;s administration, unveiling the throne of God for the divine administration throughout the universe&mdash;4:2; 5:1; 6:16; 7:9; 8:3; 21:5; 1 Kings 22:19; Isa. 6:1; Ezek. 1:26; Dan. 7:9:

	<li>The throne in Revelation 4 and 5 is the throne of divine authority:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s throne is related to His administration, which is a matter of His economy&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4; Eph. 1:10; 3:9.</li>
		<li>Apparently the throne is invisible and is not realized by man, but actually it is behind the scene ruling over everyone and everything&mdash; Isa. 6:1.</li>
		<li>Everything in today&rsquo;s world situation is decided on the throne; no one can do anything and nothing can happen outside the rule of God&rsquo;s throne.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The throne of God is not only for God to reign but also for God to accomplish His eternal purpose&mdash;Eph. 1:9, 11; 3:11; Rom. 8:28; Rev. 4:11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In His economy God administrates the universe to fulfill His purpose&mdash;2 Tim. 1:9.</li>
		<li>God is a God of purpose, having a will according to His good pleasure&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God created all things for His will that He might accomplish and fulfill His purpose&mdash;Rev. 4:11.</li>
			<li>Revelation, the unveiling of God&rsquo;s universal administration, shows us that the will, the purpose, of God in His creation is to have an eternal habitation&mdash;the New Jerusalem&mdash;for His satisfaction and expression&mdash;21:2, 10:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) In the New Jerusalem God&rsquo;s will in His creation will be completely revealed and fulfilled.</li>
				<li>2) Through the New Jerusalem God will be fully satisfied and completely expressed.</li>
				<li>3) The New Jerusalem is God&rsquo;s will in His creation and the goal of the book of Revelation, which proceeds toward and brings us to the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God&rsquo;s will.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>There are seven lamps of fire&mdash;the seven Spirits of God&mdash;burning before God&rsquo;s administrative throne&mdash;4:5:

		<li>The burning of the seven Spirits of God is to bring forth the golden lampstands, the churches, for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;1:12.</li>

<li>As the One enthroned to be the heavenly Administrator in God&rsquo;s universal government, Christ is the worthy Lion-Lamb, the overcoming Redeemer, opening the scroll of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Rev. 5:1-14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">

	<li>In the divine administration Christ is the worthy Lion-Lamb&mdash;Rev. 5:5-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the Lion He is the Fighter against the enemy, Satan; as the Lamb He is the Redeemer for us&mdash;Gen. 49:9; John 1:29.</li>
		<li>Because Christ has solved the problems of the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man, He is worthy to open the scroll of God&rsquo;s economy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lamb, the Redeemer, the One slain on the cross for our sins, is now on the throne carrying out God&rsquo;s administration over the entire universe:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord Jesus has been enthroned to execute God&rsquo;s governmental administration in the universe&mdash;5:6.</li>
		<li>We need to see that the Lord is on the throne as a man and realize that the Lord of the universe is a man, the God-man, the Man-God&mdash; Ezek. 1:26.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The enthroned Lion-Lamb has received the commission to carry out God&rsquo;s economy, symbolized by the scroll&mdash;Rev. 5:7-9:

		<li>The scroll of God&rsquo;s economy has been put into His hands, and now He holds God&rsquo;s economy and carries it out.</li>
		<li>By opening the seven seals Christ unlocks the secret of the universe&mdash;6:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lamb has seven eyes for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration&mdash;5:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The way Christ carries out God&rsquo;s administration is by the seven Spirits as His eyes.</li>
		<li>The seven eyes are for transfusing all that the Lamb is into our being so that we may become the same as He is for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;Zech. 3:9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The seven eyes of the Lamb are Christ&rsquo;s expression in God&rsquo;s move for God&rsquo;s building.</li>
			<li>As the Lord looks at us, His eyes transfuse His inner being into us and transform us for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Administrator, the worthy and enthroned Lion-Lamb, is administrating the universe through our prayers&mdash;Rev. 5:8; 8:3-4.</li>
	<li>We all must worship Christ as the divine Administrator, as the One in the heavens administrating all things for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;5:9-14.</li>
