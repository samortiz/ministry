   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Satan might say to you, "If you have decided to believe in the Lord Jesus as your Savior, I have no way to stop you.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, why do you have to confess the Lord Jesus as your Savior before men?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This will cause too much turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why not just believe stealthily and be a secret Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you do this, you can believe in the Lord Jesus and no one will mock you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Will this not serve both purposes?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But, the Bible says, "For with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation" Rom 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we want to be a Christian, we must confess Christ as our Savior before men.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot be a secret Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sinning is indeed a shameful thing; but what is the shame for one to believe in Christ and be rid of his sins?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is truly a shame to be a slave of the devil and do the things of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the shame to be a child of the heavenly Father and put on the garment of light?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If it is right to believe in Christ, then we ought to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If it is right to confess Christ, then we ought to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How can we not believe in the One we ought to believe in and not confess the One we ought to confess just because of our fear of men?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not be cowardly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not be afraid to testify that Christ is our Savior just because many people, ones both familiar and new to us, are here.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you truly love your household, you should be the pioneer in believing in the Lord Jesus so that they might also have the opportunity to believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you hide yourself and refuse to be an open testimony, how long will they have to wait until another member of your household chooses to be a pioneer and leads them to believe?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I remember a story of a bookseller who went to the countryside to sell Bibles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When he went into a house, he would speak some of the stories in the Bible to the people in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The mother of one family bought a New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She paid for it with money she had earned through her own labors.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She took this New Testament and kept it in her house so that she could read whenever she had some spare time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later her husband came home.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was a foreman.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was often drunk and in poor conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When he saw the new book in the house, he asked his wife, "Where did this new book come from?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After hearing the answer from his wife, he was greatly infuriated because he thought his wife had wasted useful money on a useless book.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His wife responded, "Not every penny in this household belongs to you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As your wife, at least half should be mine."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Her husband then said, "Well, in that case, half of the book is mine."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So he tore the book in half and kept it in his pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then he angrily went back to his work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Soon, he was dispatched to work in a remote mountain area, and he was depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He remembered the book in his pocket, took it out, and started to read.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He had taken the first half of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He started to read from Matthew 1 and continued chapter after chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Finally he came to Luke 15 and read the story of the prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He saw how pleasant the prodigal son's original condition had been.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then he saw how the son left home, sinned, suffered, repented, and finally decided to come back home.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He read the story with great interest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But just at this place, the book was torn in two.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The last sentence in the final page was the first half of verse 20: "And he rose up and came to his own father."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There was nothing after this!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He wanted to know the end of the story.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He did not know whether or not the father accepted the son.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He wanted to know how the son's story ended, but he was afraid to ask his wife for the second half of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was afraid that she would scorn him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the same time his wife was reading this story at home.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She knew that there was a father with a loving heart toward his prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But why did the son leave?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What happened to him?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why did he finally come back home?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She knew none of the answers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>She wanted to ask her husband for the first half of the book but she was afraid that her husband might reject her.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Each of them was afraid of the other.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He dared not ask her, and she dared not ask him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Daily they saw each other, but neither dared to speak the words within them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Finally her husband could not stand it any longer and he asked his wife, "What is the conclusion of the story about the prodigal son?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Immediately his wife asked him, "How does the story of the prodigal son begin?"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After their discussion the Holy Spirit opened their eyes, and they saw that they too were prodigal sons.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They had spent all that they had and were afflicted by their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, they needed to quickly come back to the father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The couple, with tears in their eyes, then knelt down before God, confessed their sins, and received the salvation which God had prepared in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Are not many of your fears vain fears?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God is working in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How do you know that he is not also working in the hearts of your family?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I know of many stories where both the husband and wife decided to believe in the Lord Jesus, but neither one had the courage to speak to the other about their faith in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Later when they did speak to each other, they found that their spouse had been waiting to approve them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even if the other side does not approve, the Lord Jesus has died for you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He has suffered immeasurable pain for you and borne your sins so that you might receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At the very least, you have a duty to confess Him before men!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I think all of us have heard the story about an ungrateful daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Over ten years ago, there was a family that was quite rich.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The family consisted only of a mother and her daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>One day while the daughter was still a baby, there was a fire in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The mother was outside, helplessly watching the house burn down.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>All her wealth turned to ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Suddenly she remembered that her daughter was sleeping upstairs.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Because of her love for the daughter, she rushed into the house in spite of the fierce fire and threw her out safely.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The daughter was unharmed but the mother's hair was scorched and her whole body seriously burned.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>She was bedridden for several months because of her injuries.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>She lost all of her former attractiveness and her wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>She was forced to do menial work, washing clothes and embroidering, to support herself and her daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Eventually, however, she was able to send her daughter to school.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Even though she was poor, she adorned her daughter with new clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>One day when she was going to the place where she washed clothes, she met her daughter walking with her classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>She called to her daughter and talked to her.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Then the daughter and her classmates started to walk away.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>While the mother was standing there watching her daughter's back with pride, the friends asked her daughter, "Who is that woman you talked to?"</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Just imagine.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>How could a dignified student admit that a woman with shabby clothing, a bald head, a scar-filled face, and clothes in her hands to be washed was her mother?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Would she be ridiculed by others if she admitted it?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>She replied, "She is my housemaid."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But her mother heard this word!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>She could no longer continue to wash clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>She went home, laid down on her bed, and became very sick.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Later when her daughter came home, no matter how the daughter tried to comfort her mother, the mother's heart had been broken, and she could not be comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Who can comfort a broken heart?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>She remained sorrowful until she eventually died.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Do you know that the Lord Jesus died for you?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If not for the purpose of saving us, why did He need to be born and to be called illegitimate by others?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Why did He experience indescribable sufferings in the world?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Why was he accused of being demon-possessed?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Why was His sweat like drops of blood?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>As the Son of God, why was He judged by man?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Why was He mocked, struck, and slapped, suffering unspeakable humiliations at the hands of men?</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If not for sinners like you and me, why did He wear a thorny crown, and why was he nailed to the cross to die?</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>What men now attack and mock is the truth of Christ's redemption by the blood and the truth of His death for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If not for the purpose of saving us, why on the one hand was He crucified on the cross and shed His blood, and why on the other hand was He despised and scorned by others?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Was He not full of wisdom and able to speak on matters of ethics, philosophy, and principles of morality like no one else?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If He had chosen to speak such things He would have been a most welcome person.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Why was He unwilling to be welcomed, but willing to suffer and be humiliated to the point of death?</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If not for the purpose of saving us, He gave up His life in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Truly there is no reason, except for the reason of saving you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Therefore, He condescended to a lowly state and bore the pain that no one else in the world has ever suffered for the sake of saving you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Today, regardless of your philosophy, you take pride in declaring it.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>But if you say that you confess the Lord Jesus as the Savior, you will see that others will despise you.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>It seems that the name of Jesus is inseparable from humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Confessing the Lord Jesus is not an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Yet how can we hardheartedly deny the One who died for us in order to temporarily save our face?</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>He humbled Himself to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>How can we hardheartedly refuse to testify of Him as our Benefactor because we want to keep our temporary glory?</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>How hardhearted are we?</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>We detest the ungrateful daughter, but we should not forget ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Yet, human feelings often tell us that it is all right for us to deny Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>The devil sees that he has failed.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>But in the matter of keeping people in fear, he often triumphs.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>I do not know how many people just like you have perished.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>They knew that they should believe in and confess the Lord Jesus as their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>However, they did not dare believe and confess because of the fear of men.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>They have perished and left the world.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>They went to hell because of their cowardice.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Why should you make the same mistake?</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>The dead are dead already, but we should be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>How contemptible is a timid person who knows that he should do the things of righteousness but does not move because of timidness.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Is this not contemptible?</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>We despise cowardly people.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>When it comes to believing in Jesus, we should not be cowards and eventually find ourselves in perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Now is there anyone who would like to believe in the Lord Jesus as your Savior?</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>If there are some, please stand up and be a testimony before all men.</S>
