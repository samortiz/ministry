   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE AUDIENCE CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE AUDIENCE OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the fourth section, the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaking involves not only the minister but the audience, that is, those who listen to the word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether or not the ministry of the word is strong depends also on the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The minister of the word has much to do with the speaking, but the audience has something to do with it also.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While the minister of the word bears more than half of the responsibility, the audience bears at least some of the responsibility also.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether or not the word can be released depends largely on the ministers, but the audience has its responsibility also.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The audience can become a hindrance to the release of God's word, and it can also become a strengthening to God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A few examples in the Bible show us how an audience should behave.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We hope to learn something from these passages.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>ONE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First let us consider Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus spoke in parables because God could not reveal Himself to the "wise and intelligent" Matt 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The wise and intelligent cannot expect to see God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For the same reason, they cannot expect to receive supply from the word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A wise and intelligent man cannot receive direct revelation from God, and he cannot receive revelation from the ministers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever the ministry finds wise and intelligent ones among its audience, God's word is immediately frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It can be so frustrated that it is completely blocked, or it can be frustrated to the extent that it is released only in a mild or weak way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more a man considers himself to be wise, the harder it is for him to receive light from God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more a man trusts in himself, the more God's word is closed to him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should remember that, according to the Old Testament, God sometimes seals up His prophecy to men Dan 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This shows us that the word can be opened up, and it can also be sealed up after it is released.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are not here to explain the meaning of sealing up or the number of years the word was sealed up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are pointing out a spiritual principle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A man can hear God's speaking and yet find the word sealed up to him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A man can touch God's word and yet find this word sealed up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Daniel shows us the fact of the sealing, while the Lord Jesus shows us the reason for the sealing being wise and intelligent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord shows us how the word was hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God wants to hide things from the wise and intelligent so that they cannot get through.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once a man becomes wise and intelligent, the Holy Spirit, in accordance with God's counsel, hides the word from him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible gives us a basic principle: After man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the way to the tree of life was blocked.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From that time forward, the tree of life was sealed up by the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned every way Gen 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once man acquired the knowledge of good and evil, he could no longer touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This separation is related not only to man's own inability but also to God's prohibition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the meaning of sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It has nothing to do with man's ability.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even if man were able, God would seal it up anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever man pays attention to knowledge, life flees from him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever man boasts of his own wisdom and intelligence and takes pride and glory in himself, he has to remember that the revelation of God's word is hidden from him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He will not see anything; what he sees will only be clouded forms.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is God's sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord said, "I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants" Matt 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God does this purposely.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the ministry of God's word, we must pay attention to the condition of the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we speak to new believers, we may not have to exercise our spirit that much; there may not be that much need for light and words.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But in preaching the gospel, we find that we have to exercise much spirit and use many words.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sometimes we have to touch the higher revelations of God, things that are spiritually higher and more real.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At these times, we find that we need more words, more light, and more spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose a man thinks that he is wise and intelligent.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God will hide Himself from such a man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He will not give him any direct revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When such a person is present, even the minister of the word cannot function properly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the need for the release of the spirit is not too demanding, the frustration may not be that serious.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if the demand for the release of the spirit is great, the frustration is also great.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If there is a big demand for the release of the spirit, such a person will become a great frustration to the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's high revelations are blocked because God has hidden these things from such men.</S>
