   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ABANDONING YOUR NATURAL CAPABILITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But suppose you are Bezalel: you have the willingness to do something for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But you must realize that your natural capability has to be altogether abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Your willingness is worthwhile, but your ability is worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God treasures your willingness, which He initiated, but your capability what you can do, what you know in God s estimation means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you will reject your ability, this abandonment will give God the ground to come in and fill you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First you need the willingness; then God needs your openness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to my observation, some of the elders by the Lord s mercy have had the willingness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in the eldership they brought in their capability, their knowledge, their education, and their strength.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This damages the entire job.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, willingness is really valuable; but on the other hand, the natural capability must be discounted, even entirely abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE EXAMPLE OF MOSES</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Moses was young, he had the willingness to be used by God to do something for his people, who were under the tyranny of Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moses willingness was initiated by God, perhaps while he was still a teenager.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when he grew up, he went out and by his own hand killed an Egyptian.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He acted from his own ability.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God could not use him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He had the willingness, but he didn t have the openness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God, as we all know, spent forty years to empty or unload him, until he was fully deprived by God and was absolutely empty.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He became just a shepherd in the wilderness, thinking he did not know anything and could not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But God came in. God came in to give the unique vision.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As you know, he saw a bush burning but not consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That bush was Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The vision meant that God would use him, but that He would not burn the fire with Moses fuel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whatever you have God will not use.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>EMPTYING YOURSELF</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God will use only you, not what you have or can do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, you must empty yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To empty yourself means to have an absolute openness to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The real openness to God means emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may say you are open, but you are filled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A jar may be open, but it may be filled with sand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may say that you are open to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may be open, but you are not empty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There has never been an unloading.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What part of you needs to be unloaded?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Your capability, your knowledge, your wisdom, your education.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is only when you are empty that God can come in to fill you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When God fills you, it is His Spirit who fills you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We in the leadership of the church life do have the willingness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is no problem with this point.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The problem is that we are not emptied and therefore cannot be filled with the Triune God as the filling Spirit today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The problem is our education, our knowledge, our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some of you have been in the leadership for over fifteen years; you have had many experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But even real experiences of the church life have to be emptied out.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every day, all the time, you and I in the leadership of the churches need to be freshly filled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do you believe that the Spirit of God filled Bezalel and Oholiab just once for all?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I believe that all the time, every minute, they were being filled.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words, they were really one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God cannot build His dwelling place by Himself; He can do it only through willing and empty vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether the church is living and fresh and enriched depends on this one thing: that we are being filled continuously with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For this, dear brothers, we need firstly the willingness and secondly the emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>PRAYING CONTINUOUSLY</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The third thing we need is the instant, constant prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we are able to do things, we don t need to pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have confidence, we have knowledge, we have a way, we have ability, we have strength: we are certain we can handle the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to empty ourselves, knowing that whatever we can do is not counted; it is not only rejected but even condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whatever the old man can do is condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have to realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then we shall see our need of God and will pray constantly and instantly.</S>
