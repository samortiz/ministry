   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is true of the Spirit is also true of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is both a killing factor and a nourishing factor in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I was raised in China, where the teachings of Confucius were widespread.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His book, The Highest Learning, aims at developing the natural virtues, even the conscience, which he terms "the bright virtue."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I remember hearing missionaries say that the teachings of Confucius were just like the teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As one who had been reared and educated in Christianity, I was troubled; why did we need the Bible if its teachings were already in the writings of Confucius?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After some comparative study, I concluded that the ethical teachings were the same: Honor your parents, love your neighbor, be kind, and be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time I could not distinguish between the virtues advocated by Confucius and those revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now I am clear.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Highest Learning is just a cultivation of the natural virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible, on the other hand, kills your natural virtues and then brings in the divine virtues of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more you read the Bible, the more killing you will get.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From my experience the killing is first of the negative things, like pride, hatred, and jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once these are dealt with, the finer killing begins of your love, humility, patience, and niceness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may protest that the Lord is killing such desirable qualities, but these must be dealt with until eventually you yourself are also killed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everything in our natural make-up must be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I saw this, I fell before the Lord and said, "Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I will take the killing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I want You to cut this poor self into pieces."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And He did.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By the Word in the Bible I was killed and cut into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the Bible not only kills; it also resurrects.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here rather than a cultivated bright natural virtue, we have the resurrected Christ living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Day by day we must contact the Word and touch the Spirit; both do the same work of killing us and then resurrecting us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must live this way during the week, then bring this crucified and resurrected life to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When our meetings are such a show case of the riches of Christ, thirsty ones will be attracted and all the members will grow, be knit together, and be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE VANITY OF "A GOOD TIME"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In some of the churches an atmosphere has come in encouraging the young people just to have a good time singing, shouting, playing guitars.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If this is your aim, how can the young people be solidly built up?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Within a few years the Lord's recovery will vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church should be 1 a home with a family, 2 a school, 3 a hospital, and 4 a camp to train an army.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Lord's recovery we do not want our meetings to be places of entertainment; that is the way of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the young people are built up with the Word day after day, week after week, other serious-minded young ones will be attracted, and the future of the recovery will be bright.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>WHY BE STARVING?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man must not "live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God" Matt 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible is likened to food.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Food is not for you to understand but to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you go to a restaurant, you don't just read the menu and then feel you have finished your meal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How much have you been eating of the Word?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am afraid many of you are starving!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is a necessity that you have a "breakfast" of the Word daily.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not say that you are too weak to do this regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not quote Romans 7:18: "To will is present with me, but to do the good is not"!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Romans 7 is referring to the overcoming of sin; we are talking about a necessity of life, like breathing or eating.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This "breakfast," though you may have no sense of it, will nourish, enlighten, water, and strengthen you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not be casual about your Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul said, "I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway" 1 Cor 9:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you are a loose Christian, you may become a castaway.</S>
