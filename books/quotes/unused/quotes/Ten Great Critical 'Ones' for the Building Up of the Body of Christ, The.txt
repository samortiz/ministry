There are another five 'ones': the one salvation, one living, one testimony, one Body, and one city, which is the one consummation
They believe that their Bible, the Old Testament, is the pure, holy Word of God and that nothing should be added to it
In 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul said, 'Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth'
When the apostle Paul was on earth, he was contending with the unbelieving Jews and correcting them by cutting the word rightly, straightly
The Baptists stress baptism by their kind of immersion, whereas the Presbyterians and others practice sprinkling
The Bible should not be interpreted according to man's own concepts-understandings, logic, philosophies, views, and fanciful imaginations
Peter indicates that we do not have the freedom to interpret the prophecy of the Bible by our natural concept, because it is revealed by God
When some of the students of Confucius in China became Christians, they understood the Bible according to the teachings of Confucius
The Bible should also be interpreted by discerning the differences in the dispensational progress of the divine revelation
The Seventh-Day Adventists did not discern this dispensational difference, so they insist on keeping the Sabbath
Ephesians is deep, but the Pentecostal understanding concerning speaking in tongues and miraculous things is superficial and outward
We should stress the trunk, the central revelation of the Bible, but we should not forget the 'branch' revelations, the minor revelations
Head covering reminds us that we all have to be under the headship of our Head, as Christ is under the headship of God the Father
Today our interpretation of the Bible is according to the proper interpretations throughout the past nineteen centuries
The Recovery Version actually is not my version because my understanding of the Bible depends absolutely on Watchman Nee's interpretation
Brother Nee's interpretation depended upon the proper interpretations of all the saints in the past nineteen centuries
He died an all-inclusive death and resurrected to produce the firstborn Son of God and become the life-giving Spirit
The apostle Paul experienced the same Christ as millions of Christians, but the extent of his enjoyment of Christ reached the top
He is the Creator , and all things were created through Him , cohere in Him , and will be an inheritance unto Him as the Heir
On the one hand, Christ is the Creator, but on the other hand, He is the means through which all things were created
Christ was crucified about two thousand years ago, but the Bible says He was crucified from the foundation of the world
Christ lived in His humanity on the earth to express God for thirty-three and a half years-He is God manifested in the flesh
Through His death He also released His divine life from the shell of His humanity to be dispensed into His believers
Christ rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority that the environment might be fit for Gods chosen people to receive His salvation
In ascension He was appointed to be many items, first as the Lord of all, the Christ, and last as the surety of the new covenant
Christ is the Shepherd of God's flock, the door for them to come out of Judaism, and the pasture for them to feed on
Christ is the power of God and the wisdom to His believers from God: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
He is God's allotted portion to the saints , typified by God's allotted portion of the good land to the people of Israel
At the end of the church age, after He has been so many items to take care of the church, He will be the coming One
He will come secretly as the morning star who will appear to His overcomers before His coming back to the earth
At that time we will be completely a new man; we will be a new man in our spirit, a new man in our soul, and a new man in our body
Christ, the General, will be the Bridegroom, and His army will be His spouse, His corporate bride, composed of all the overcomers
Most of the nations will follow Antichrist in his rebellion, and most of them will be killed in the battle of Armageddon
Revelation 14:20 says that the blood from this battle will be 'up to the bridles of the horses for a thousand six hundred stadia'
He will judge the living, the sheep and the goats, at His throne of glory at the beginning of the thousand-year kingdom
After the thousand-year kingdom, He will be on the white throne to judge all the dead and sentence them to the lake of fire
We have to spread the recovery's creed concerning the all-inclusive Christ from eternity past to eternity future
Lord, give us the revelation and give us the utterance, the new utterance, the up-to-date utterance, to speak forth You, the wonderful One
The first point concerning the Spirit is that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Third of the Divine Trinity
All genuine Christians admit that in Christ there is humanity, because He became a man and partook of the flesh and blood of man
Chapter five of Andrew Murray's masterpiece, The Spirit of Christ, is entitled 'The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus'
These elements typify Christ's death with its effectiveness and His resurrection with its power which are in the life-giving Spirit
The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the all-inclusive compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30
The Father made the economy, the Son accomplished it, and the Spirit applies to us what the Son has accomplished
He regenerates the people who have received Christ as their Savior with His resurrection life to be the sons of God
He as the Spirit of life and the Spirit of God indwells the believers imparting life and peace to them and even life to their mortal bodies
The one Spirit intercedes with groanings for the believers who are transformed by God under the working together of all things
He, who searches all things, even the depths of God, reveals all the things that God has done for the believers
He, as the life-giving Spirit, gives life to the word of God, through whom the new testament ministers minister the word of God
As the dispenser of what God is in Christ as grace to the believers, He dispenses the reality of God as grace to them
He, as the reality of the speaking Christ, speaks to all the churches, calling for overcomers in the degradation of the church
Now in His ascension, Christ poured out the Spirit as the violent wind, not for their life but for their ministry to spread the gospel
The consummated Triune God is married to His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified people
They are regenerated in their spirit, transformed in their soul, and glorified in their body to match the marrying God
God and His wife are thus exactly the same in life, in nature, and in expression, just as Eve was the same as Adam
Prayer: Lord, we worship You for Your oracle, Your speaking in Your recovery for the past more than seventy years
We have the assurance that You are continuing to speak to us in order to enrich Your recovery and strengthen us
For everything mentioned in these outlines on the ten 'ones,' we have to go to the Life-study Messages for the details
They heard it, saw it, beheld it, touched it, and handled it because this life became a man, and that man is the embodiment of God
Most Christians know they were saved by Christ's death, but very few know that we are saved much more by His life
Romans 5:10 says that since we have been reconciled through His death, we shall be saved much more in His life
Eventually in Romans 5, we reign in this life through Christ's bountiful grace and His bountiful gift of righteousness
Not only grace reigns, but also we, the seeking ones, the overcomers, reign in this life by the abundant grace and gift of righteousness
They will not be the early overcomers who will enter into the kingdom, but the later overcomers who will enjoy the New Jerusalem in eternity
Our salvation is based upon God's love, the source of God's grace, and God's grace, the expression of God's love
Eventually, this life works to conform the transformed believers with the divine element of the life of the firstborn Son of God
Finally, this one kind of living is by the growth in the life of Christ unto maturity for the building up of the Body of Christ
Jessie Penn-Lewis saw the subjective death of Christ, and Brother Austin-Sparks saw the principles of resurrection for the Body
We continue Christ to be witnesses, witnessing the all-inclusive Christ for the spreading of the gospel to produce His Body
All the golden lampstands are identical in nature, in shape, and in function to be the one expression of Christ
If the seven lampstands were put before us, we would not be able to distinguish them, because they are identical
All the local churches should be identical in the same nature of God, form of Christ, and function of the Spirit
A person's fingers, toes, and nose are his parts, and all the parts of a person added together equal that person
The one Body, the one organism, is the accomplishment of God's economy according to the good pleasure, the heart's desire, of His will
The one Body is also built up with the mature believers as its constituents through their growth in the life of Christ unto maturity
The Body is joined together through every joint of the rich supply and knit together through the operation in measure of each one part,
It is holy because it is separated and sanctified unto God as something belonging to God according to His holy nature
Its throne is the throne of the Lamb-God upon its golden base joining with its golden street as its center for its government
The one city is the wife, the counterpart, of Christ who is the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God
These ten 'ones' tell us that if we do not take the Lord's way for the building up of the Body, we have no way
