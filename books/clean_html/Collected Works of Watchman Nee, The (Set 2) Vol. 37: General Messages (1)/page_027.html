<h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>There are two difficulties in the church. First, those who do not "have" think that they "have." In many instances, a child of God is not the kind of person he wants to be, yet he insists on speaking as if he were such a one. In reality, God has never said anything to him or worked in him. He has nothing within him, yet he likes to talk, and he likes to express himself. When this happens, the church is not built up. Second, some people are unwilling to follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The Lord may have spoken to a brother or a sister, yet he or she waits and holds back from speaking. In this way the church is deprived of the supply it deserves. If you find that you are empty inside, you should keep silent. If you know that you "have" something, you should supply the church. The Holy Spirit dispenses life to the meeting through what you have, making it possible for God's children to touch life. God may put a word within you; the same word may be in you while you are at work and while you are walking on the street. You realize that God has spoken to you. You should realize that this word is not for you alone but also for the church. When you "have" something, you should supply the church with what you have.</p><p>At the time the tabernacle was built in the Old Testament times, the people dedicated their gold and silver to God. The same is true with us today. We should give what we have. Some have a revelation, some have a teaching, and some have a hymn. Let everyone bring what he has. At the time of the building of the tabernacle, the Spirit of God gave wisdom and understanding to men to make fitting utensils out of the gold and the silver and a tabernacle from all kinds of materials. The materials themselves were offered up by the Israelites, while the completion of the tabernacle was brought about through the arrangement of the Holy Spirit. Today we bring in the materials, and the Holy Spirit arranges them. In this way, the church is built up.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>In our daily walk, we should have constant communion with God and look to Him for His work in us, so that we will "have" something and be able to supply the church with what we have. We should remember that God guides us in the meeting according to what we already have&mdash;a hymn or a revelation. We must first have something that we can share with others. Since we have learned and accumulated something during our daily walk, we can be guided in the meetings and render a supply to others. What we give to the church should not be something that we come up with on the spur of the moment or something that is according to our own good idea but something we have in our daily life, that is, something God has given us during our daily life. During this time, God brings us forward in a certain way, and He makes us a certain kind of person. As a result, you supply others with what you have. Ideas do not count; doctrines are of no avail; what is of value is what we really have. If we supply the church with what we have, the church will be built up, and the brothers and sisters will receive help. If everyone supplies the church with what they have, the result will be living and rich.</p><p>Under normal circumstances in the church, the Holy Spirit will not guide a person to give what he does not have. God used an ass only to deal with Balaam (Num. 22). If we really live a life that befits the children of God, our meeting will become God's sanctuary. Let us pray that we may "have" and that we may use what we "have" to supply the church.</p>
