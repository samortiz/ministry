   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not that we have loved God but that He loved us 1 John 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If our salvation was because of our love for God, it would not be reliable because our love easily changes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But our salvation is because God loved us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It comes out from His love for us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s love, like His person, is unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, our salvation is secure and unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eternal love ; He loved...to the uttermost Jer 31:3; John 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s love for us is an eternal love, a love that is to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s salvation, which is out of His love and because of His love, is also eternal and to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It will not change or cease because of a change in our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His love, which will not forget, being stronger than a nursing mother s love Isa 49:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God s love for us is a love that does not forget.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even a mother may forget her nursing child, but God will never forget us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His love is stronger than a mother s love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This love makes Him unable to change, to cancel, or to rescind the salvation that He has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God Rom 8:35-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since God loves us, what can separate us from His love?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nothing!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creature can separate us from the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The love of God from which we cannot be separated secures His salvation in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>GOD S GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For by grace you have been saved...and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works Eph 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our salvation is not of ourselves or our works but by God s grace; this grace is the gift of God and is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If it were of ourselves or our works, it would be changeable; however, it is of God and His grace, so it will not change.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We and our works fluctuate and are undependable, but God s grace is stable, immovable, and eternally secure.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Who has saved us...not according to our works but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages 2 Tim 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God has saved us according to the grace that He gave us in Christ before the times of the ages, not according to our works.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This grace was given to us by God in Christ before the times of the ages; it was not given to us in the present because of our works.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, it cannot be influenced or changed in the future by our works.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since God gave grace to us in Christ, it does not depend on us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regardless of our condition, we can never change God s grace that has saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have redemption...according to the riches of His grace Eph 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our salvation is according to the riches of God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The riches of God s grace are His all-sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since we are saved by God s all-sufficient grace, this grace is fully responsible for us, it meets our every need, and it saves us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This grace is without any lack or deficiency that could cause our salvation to be jeopardized.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, it is eternally secure and established.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>GOD S RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The gospel...is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes...for the righteousness of God is revealed in it Rom 1:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The gospel of God is His power.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It can save everyone who believes because His righteousness is revealed in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His gospel speaks not only of His love and grace but also of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are saved not only because of His love and grace but also according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Love and grace are related to feelings, but righteousness is a judicial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Emotions can change with a change of the heart, but judicial matters are principles that are eternally unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Matters of love and grace are not bound by law; they are subject to a person s willingness or unwillingness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, judicial matters of righteousness are absolutely bound by law.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are not matters of choice but matters of requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If God came to save us merely by His love and grace, our salvation would merely be a matter of His willingness to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But He saves us not only because of His love and grace but also according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is not only willing to save us; He is required to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although His heart causes Him to love us and to give us grace, His love and grace cannot bind Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The only thing that binds God is His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we believe, His righteousness leaves Him no choice but to save us; it requires that He save us eternally and to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This righteousness is of Him, not of us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is not only powerful but also secure.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>With a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness...who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus Rom 3:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Out of His love God gave us His only begotten Son, the Lord Jesus, as our Savior John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because of God s grace, the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption for us Heb 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When the Lord Jesus went to the cross and bore God s righteous judgment in our place, He satisfied the requirement of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Now God justifies those who believe in the Lord Jesus, according to His righteousness and with a view to demonstrating His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If the Lord Jesus had not satisfied God s righteous requirements for us, even though He wanted to give us His forgiving grace because of His love, He would not have been able to forgive and to justify us without falling into unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, since the Lord Jesus satisfied God s righteous requirements on our behalf, God must forgive and justify us according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If He did not, He would fall into unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Before the Lord Jesus resolved the problem of God s righteous condemnation of us, God could not have forgiven us without being unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After the Lord Jesus satisfied God s righteous requirements on our behalf, God would be unrighteous if He did not forgive and justify us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Formerly, if He justified us, He would have been unrighteous; now, if He does not justify us, He would be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Formerly, He could not justify us; now, He cannot but justify us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He must justify us because He is righteous and cannot be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>His righteousness requires Him to justify those who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>His righteousness cannot change; therefore, the justification that He gives us according to His righteousness cannot change.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Who shall bring a charge against God s chosen ones?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is God who justifies Rom 8:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Since God justifies us according to His righteousness, nothing and no one can bring a charge against us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Because God is righteous, the justification we have received is secure, and no one can condemn us again.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Righteousness...the foundation of Your throne Psa 89:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>God s throne is built upon righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If there were a problem with God s righteousness, the foundation of His throne would be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This tells us that His righteousness is extremely secure and solid.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Since our justification is based upon His secure and solid righteousness, it is equally secure and solid.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>His righteousness is the foundation of His throne, and it is the basis for our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Our justification is as secure as God s throne.</S>
