   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The consummated Spirit of the Triune God is "the Spirit" John 7:38-39; Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible progresses through thirty-nine books from Genesis to Malachi, and then from Malachi through the four Gospels altogether forty-three books.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suddenly, in the Gospel of John, in 7:39, we are told, "The Spirit was not yet."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why at that time was the Spirit not yet?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Very few in Christianity would study this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the Bible says that the Spirit was not yet because Jesus Christ had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This tells us that when Jesus Christ was glorified, the Spirit was there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When was Jesus Christ glorified?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jesus Christ was glorified when He was resurrected Luke 24:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His resurrection was His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time the Spirit was there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First Corinthians 15 is a chapter that speaks specifically concerning resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 45 it says that in the resurrec-tion of Christ the last Adam, who is Christ in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit v. 45b . That is to become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit is the aggregate of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit is not only the consummation of the processed Triune God but also the aggregate of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The consummation refers to the completion of the processes that the Triune God went through; the aggregate refers to the sum total of the three of the Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now He is the Father, and also the Son, and also the Spirit Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sum total of the three as an aggregate is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BEING THE REALITY OF GOD, THE REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>OF CHRIST, AND THE REALITY OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This Spirit is the reality of God because He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the reality of Christ because He is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is also the reality of resurrection John 14:17; 1 John 5:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After I had been working with Brother Nee for nearly twenty years, one day he said to me, "The Holy Spirit is the reality of resurrection."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At that time I did not understand how the Holy Spirit could be the reality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Gradually, I began to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If there were no God, no Christ, and no Spirit, there would be no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not that there was resurrection only after the Lord Jesus had resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In John 11:25 the Lord told Martha, "I am the resurrection."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At that time Martha was arguing about the matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She said to the Lord, "Lord, my brother has died and has been buried four days.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He must be stinking by now.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If You had come four days earlier, he would not have died."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord said to her, "Martha, I am the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no earlier or later with Me. If I am not here, there is nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If I am here, I am the resurrection."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, who is this One who said to Martha, "I am the resurrection"?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is God, and God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This Jesus is the embodiment of God, and God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>So, in the universe the Holy Spirit, the consummated Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, is the reality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God is resurrection; Christ is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, wherever God is and wherever Christ is, there is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, the consummated Spirit is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we live in the Spirit, we live in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This resurrection is the substance of God's new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the old creation there is nothing of resurrection because there is no God in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, the new creation is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Spirit is the substance of God's new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You and I were originally in the old creation, but now we are in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the old creation we do not have the element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What we have is neither resurrection nor God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, in the new creation what we have is entirely resurrection, entirely God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence the substance of the new creation is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This Spirit is forever new and never becomes old.</S>
