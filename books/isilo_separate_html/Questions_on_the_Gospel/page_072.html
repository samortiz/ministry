According to God&#8217;s Love</h2><p>We are saved because God loved us, not because we loved God (1 John 4:10). Our love may easily change, but God&#8217;s love is deeper than the love of a mother (Isa. 49:15); it is eternal (Jer. 31:3), to the uttermost (John 13:1), and unchanging. This everlasting love of God assures us that His salvation can never be a matter of concern and never be lost.<h2 class=head3>D. According to God&#8217;s Grace</h2><p>We are not saved by ourselves nor by our works but by the grace of God (Eph. 2:8-9). Our self and works may change, but the grace of God is constant and unchanging. Therefore, our salvation is forever secure. Furthermore, God has saved us according to His grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages (2 Tim. 1:9). Our salvation is according to the riches of His grace (Eph. 1:7). The grace of God is sufficient and superabundant; it is able to bear all our burdens, meet all our needs, and save us to the uttermost.<h2 class=head3>E. According to God&#8217;s Righteousness</h2><p>God saved us not only because of His love and by His grace but also according to His righteousness. The Lord Jesus received the judgment of God&#8217;s righteousness on the cross for us, thereby satisfying the requirement of God&#8217;s righteousness. Consequently, God must save us if we believe. If God did not save us, He would fall into unrighteousness. The righteousness of God is revealed in His saving us (Rom. 1:16-17). We are justified by God, and God must save us because who can bring a charge against God&#8217;s chosen ones? (8:33). Righteousness is the foundation of God&#8217;s throne (Psa. 89:14) and is solid and unmovable. Our justification is based on the righteousness of God and, therefore, is eternally secure and unshakable.<h2 class=head3>F. According to God&#8217;s Covenant</h2><p>God has made a covenant to save us (Matt. 26:28; Heb. 8:8-13). Since this covenant cannot be altered (Psa. 89:34), neither can our salvation be changed.<h2 class=head3>G. According to God&#8217;s Power</h2><p>&#8220;My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&#8217;s hand&#8221; (John 10:29). Since God is almighty, so is His power. Therefore, no one can snatch us out of His almighty hand. Our salvation is secure according to God&#8217;s power.<h2 class=head3>H. According to God&#8217;s Life</h2><p>The life of God is eternal. God has given us His eternal life so that we can become children of God. Thus, we have a life relationship with Him, an eternal relationship (John 3:16; 1 John 3:1). A life relationship can never be broken, and since we have the eternal life of God within us, we shall never perish (John 10:28).<h2 class=head3>I. According to God Himself</h2><p>God never changes, and with Him there is no shadow cast by turning (James 1:17; Mal. 3:6). How can the salvation we received from such a God ever change?<h2 class=head3>J. According to Christ&#8217;s Redemption</h2><p>The Lord has become the source of eternal salvation unto us (Heb. 5:9). &#8220;For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified&#8221; (10:14). What the Lord accomplished is eternal; therefore, our salvation is also eternal. Because of this accomplished fact, &#8220;Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us&#8221; (Rom. 8:34). No one can negate the Lord&#8217;s redemption which He accomplished for us by His death and resurrection, and no one can condemn us. Therefore, our salvation is eternally secure.<h2 class=head3>K. According to Christ&#8217;s Power</h2><p>&#8220;And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand&#8221; (John 10:28). The Lord and God are one. He is equal with God; therefore, His hand is as powerful as God&#8217;s hand. No one can snatch us out of the Lord&#8217;s hand. His mighty hand makes our salvation eternally secure.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> </body></html>
