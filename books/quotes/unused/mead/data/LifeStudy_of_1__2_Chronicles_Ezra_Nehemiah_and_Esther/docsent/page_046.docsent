   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>D. The Final Decision</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Ezra 10:6-44 is a record of the final decision.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of Israel to gather in Jerusalem within three days vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Next, the decision was made to separate themselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign women vv.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>10-14, 16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, a few of the people stood up against the decision, supported by one Levite v. 15 . Finally, there was a list of all the men who had married foreign women vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>18-44 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have pointed out that Ezra emphasizes the matter of God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It was by His hand that God gave the children of Israel into captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It was also by His hand that God brought the children of Israel back from their captivity to the land of their forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Here we see that the same God did two different things: He gave His people to their enemy as captives and He delivered them from captivity and brought them back to their fatherland.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Ezra, a wise man, was clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Ezra realized that the first return was not perfect, not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He realized that there was the need for someone who was skilled in the law of God to help the people to know God not merely in a general way but according to what God had spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Ezra had such a capacity, so he volunteered himself to go to the king and to request a decree from the king permitting the Jews to do everything freely.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Chapter one of Ezra tells us that God stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation concerning the rebuilding of the house of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>1-2 and that He also stirred up the spirit of the heads of the fathers houses of Judah and Benjamin, the priests, and the Levites to go up to build the house of God in Jerusalem v. 5 . God was hiding Himself, but at the expiration of the seventy years, He came in to stir up the spirit of Cyrus.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Cyrus must have been happy that the great empire of Babylon was in his hand, and regarding the Jews he might have wanted to do something that was opposite to what the Babylonians had done.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Humanly speaking, Cyrus took the initiative to make the decree.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Actually, this was initiated by God in a hidden way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, the first return from Babylon to Jerusalem was initiated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The second return was initiated by Ezra, a priest and a scribe skilled in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Ezra came to the king and appealed to him to grant his request 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>From this we see that sometimes God personally stirs us up in our spirit to do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, often God is quiet, realizing that it is better that we do something because we have the capacity, as Ezra had.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In this kind of situation, God is responsible for the things we do.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Whether the things are stirred up by Him or stirred up by us, He will be in them, stretching out His hand to do everything to help us.</S>
