<h2 class="head1">HEBREWS 2:5-10</h2>
<p>Hebrews 2:5-10 quotes Psalm 8; it is also an exposition of Psalm 8. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;For it was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth.&rdquo; God has not given the coming inhabited earth, which is the millennium, to the angels but to man.</p>
<p>Verses 6 through 8 say, &ldquo;For one has solemnly testified somewhere, saying, &lsquo;What is man, that You bring him to mind? Or the son of man, that You care for him? You have made Him a little inferior to the angels; You have crowned Him with glory and honor and have set Him over the works of Your hands; You have subjected all things under His feet.&rsquo; For in subjecting all things to Him, He left nothing unsubject to Him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to Him.&rdquo; This tells us that God has entrusted the millennium to man.</p>
<p>Verse 9 says, &ldquo;But we see Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death on behalf of everything.&rdquo; This indicates that the man spoken of in Psalm 8:4-5 is the Lord Jesus. The first man Adam failed, but the second man Jesus succeeded! This verse says that He was a little lower than the angels. This refers to His humanity. He was a little lower than the angels so that He could die for man.</p>
<p>Hebrews 2:10 says, &ldquo;For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.&rdquo; &ldquo;Through whom are all things&rdquo; refers to the source, whereas &ldquo;for whom are all things&rdquo; refers to the consummation. Man cannot be the one through whom are all things, but he can be the one for whom are all things. Man is unable to have dominion over the universe because of Adam&rsquo;s failure, but the Lord has fulfilled God&rsquo;s will. He is leading many sons of God into glory. This is what God is after.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIRST CORINTHIANS 15:24-28</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:24-28 speaks of the same thing. Verse 24 says, &ldquo;Then the end, when He delivers up the kingdom to His God and Father, once He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.&rdquo; This verse is divided into two parts: (1) destroying the enemy, and (2) delivering up the kingdom to God the Father. Verses 25 and 26 expand the first part, while verses 27 and 28 expand the second part. &ldquo;The end&rdquo; refers to the millennium. &ldquo;Abolish&rdquo; means to destroy forever. &ldquo;The kingdom&rdquo; also refers to the millennium.</p>
<p>Verse 25 says, &ldquo;For He must reign until God puts all His enemies under His feet.&rdquo; The Lord will reign, and God will destroy all His enemies.</p>
<p>Verse 26 says, &ldquo;Death, the last enemy, is being abolished.&rdquo; Death is the last thing to be destroyed. Death will be eliminated from the church before the millennium, but will be eliminated from the universe after the millennium. (During the millennium there will still be death according to Isaiah 65:20.) The Lord has judged death on the cross, and He will execute this judgment in the millennium.</p>
<p>Verse 27 says, &ldquo;For He has subjected all things under His feet. But when He says that all things are subjected, it is evident that all things are except Him who has subjected all things to Him.&rdquo; God is not included.</p>
<p>Verse 28 says, &ldquo;And when all things have been subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to Him who has subjected all things to Him, that God may be all in all.&rdquo; This verse is similar to Ephesians 1:10. God the Father has purposed the eternal will. God the Son has accomplished the Father&rsquo;s purpose, and God the Spirit has joined man to the Son.</p>
