   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PROPER SPIRITUAL EDUCATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have learned that due to certain situations, many young people in China have been deprived of a proper education.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Likewise, many of today s Christians have been deprived of the proper spiritual education.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many preachers are eloquent, knowledgeable, and capable, but they are shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My heart is broken over this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Dear saints, we all need more genuine spiritual education.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christians in this country may have a high secular education, but in spiritual things many are deprived.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They may know a great deal about science, material things, and the affairs of this life, but they are limited in their knowledge of spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But I hope that all the saints in the Lord s recovery will acquire the best spiritual education.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, I encourage you to spend time in the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These messages will help you to be educated spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>BRINGING THE GROCERIES TO THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the meetings of the church we must have the proper content.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not have empty shouting, shouting void of content or reality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not sufficient merely to function in the meetings in an active way or in a so-called living way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need spiritual content.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This content requires that daily we grow Christ and raise Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you do not raise Christ as the animal life, how can you have a bull or a lamb to offer to God?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you do not till the ground, sow seed, and water the crop, how can you have a harvest of wheat?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How can you have oil and wine?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is absolutely necessary that we grow Christ as the vegetable life and raise Him as the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just as we need to raise Christ as a bull for propitiation, we need to raise Him as a lamb to be food offered directly to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that we need to raise Christ as a bull and also as a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we come to the meetings, we shall then bring Christ as a bull and a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We also need to grow Christ as wheat to produce flour, as olives to produce oil, and as a grapevine to produce wine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To grow wheat is to experience Christ daily as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Wheat signifies Christ in incarnation, whereas barley signifies Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For a fuller treatment of these aspects of Christ, see The All-Inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we experience Christ as our life supply, we shall grow Him as wheat and barley.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we live Christ by the Spirit in our spirit, we shall grow Him as olives to produce oil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, if in our experience we pour out the self that lives Christ, we shall grow the grapevine to produce wine for a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, to produce the oil and the wine, we should live daily and die daily.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need a life of living and dying.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul said that daily he was put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Day by day he was delivered into the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This should also be our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Daily we may be put to death by others, perhaps by our family or by different things in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we live such a life of being put to death, we shall produce wine for the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I hope that this brief and simple word will give you some understanding of the spiritual groceries described in Exodus 29.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let us all experience the riches of Christ and gain the proper spiritual education so that we may live a life on a higher plane, not on the low plane common among today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us grow Christ and raise Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we shall have groceries to bring into the church meetings.</S>
