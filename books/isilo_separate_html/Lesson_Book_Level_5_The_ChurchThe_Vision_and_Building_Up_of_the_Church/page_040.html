We must refer to the Bible to see who is qualified to form the church, and to see how the local churches are established.<p>[We need to realize that none of us is qualified to form the church. Only the Lord Jesus is qualified for this. In Matthew 16:18 He says, &#8220;I will build My church.&#8217;&#8217; He is the unique one who is qualified to form the church.]<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> </body></html>
