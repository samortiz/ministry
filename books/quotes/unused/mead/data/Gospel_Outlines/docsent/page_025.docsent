   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Twenty-four DETAINED BY SATAN Scripture: Exo 8 11 The type</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Explain how God called the people of Israel out of Egypt, and how Pharaoh tried to detain them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Serve God in Egypt In the last message, Subject 23, we saw how Pharaoh did not want the people of Israel to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will see how Pharaoh allowed them to worship God, but would not let them leave Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After hearing the gospel, many people today keep struggling until they finally begin to realize that it is hard not to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then Satan would suggest, Do not go overboard.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not leave your attainments.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Stay where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Go on to say that nearly everyone who has received the gospel has afterward had a big change in his life and his position.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here you need to give some examples.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some had held an improper job, such as operating a casino.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once that one believed in Jesus, he knew that he had to give up that job.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another may have had a proper job.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But once he believed in Jesus, his whole concept was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Formerly he cared only for his job and not for God; now his life is changed, and the basic principle of his behavior must also change.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Formerly he was for making a living; now he is for serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many have realized that they had to believe in Jesus, but they hesitate to change their position.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then Satan would suggest, Serve in Egypt!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You can have both heaven in the future and your attainments in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Don t go too far In that day Pharaoh promised that the Israelites could serve God, but he would not let them go too far away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today many want to believe in the Lord, but Satan also suggests to them, Don t go too far.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Don t go too far was a matter of distance in that day, but today it is a matter of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With many people, there is no difference between their situation before they received the Lord and afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, some gave up watching the evil movies, but they continue to watch the good ones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Others quit gambling for money, but still play poker for fun.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Use some examples such as these to show that these are all Satan s suggestions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason Satan does not want man to go too far is that he wants to be able to pull man back into the world easily at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Pharaoh would not let the Israelites go too far, because he wanted to grab them back at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you allow yourself to continue to see the good movies, it will not be too long before you will go back to the evil ones again.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the beginning you might be playing poker just for fun, but before long you would be gambling again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many friends would advise you, saying, There is nothing wrong with believing in the Lord, but don t go overboard.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Others might advise you, You have worked too hard for the whole week.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It would be too much for you to have nothing for your entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All these are Satan s suggestions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The men may go, but not the little ones nor the old ones The type.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After negotiating many times, Pharaoh finally agreed to let the men go, but he would not let the young ones or the old ones go.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today it is the same with many people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They would not believe until their parents are buried.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Nanking there was a college student who was very much touched by the gospel, but his mother was against his accepting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>So he told the preacher that he would not believe before she dies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That preacher said to him, What a good son you are!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After you send your parents to hell, then you will go to heaven in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That student was awakened by the rebuke, and he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is also the scheme of Satan that won t let the young ones or the old ones go.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If your parents and children all stay in Egypt, no doubt you will soon return to Egypt yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Use Acts 16:31, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house, to explain that with the gospel, the household is a basic unit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Each house had to have a passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God wants the whole household saved together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Go serve the Lord; only let your flocks and your herds remain The type.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then Pharaoh would let the whole household go, but he wanted their possessions to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today many who believe in Jesus are doing the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They do not bring everything with them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some are not able to preach such a gospel, because they themselves still have a lot of possessions left in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The reason Satan wants men s possessions to stay in Egypt is that he knows that where their possessions are, there also is their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As long as men have their possessions remaining in Egypt, sooner or later they will return there themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All go The type.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some really bring their whole being, their whole household, and all their possessions to come and believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As a result, they are completely delivered out of the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Smiting Pharaoh Pharaoh would not allow the Israelites to go, so God smote Pharaoh and killed all the firstborn of the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Your wife, friends, or teachers hindered you from believing in Jesus, so God came in to smite them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sooner or later you still have to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Since sooner or later you will have to believe, why not believe sooner, even today?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who suffer repeated smiting and still refuse to believe, not only will be bothered and have no peace, but they will also get their neighbors involved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Use the slaying of the Egyptians firstborn in one night as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is better to believe in Him now.</S>
