   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Garments Plagued with Leprosy</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, Leviticus says that a man can be plagued with leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A house and a piece of garment can also be plagued with leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Much of today's clothing on earth, especially ladies' dresses, are plagued with leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must deal with the subject of clothing in a sober way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Two Different Kinds of Dealings</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Leviticus 13 shows us two different ways to deal with a garment plagued with leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some garments had to be sent to the priest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The priest would examine the leprosy on them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the leprosy grew and spread, the garment had to be burned; it had to be removed completely.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It could no longer be used.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In some cases leprosy may not have spread; the garment merely turned dark.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The priest would then cut out part of the fabric and have the garment washed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the leprosy remained, the garment had to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After the priest washed the garment and cut off the undesirable parts, if the leprosy stopped, the garment could be spared.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Bringing Clothes to the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>and Dealing with Them One by One</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A new believer must pay attention to the matter of clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you have any doubt about any of your clothes, you should bring them to the priest for examination.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord is the High Priest today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You must ask Him whether or not you can wear this clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not think that this is a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Clothing is a big issue to a new believer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you do not know which clothes are plagued with leprosy, you should bring them to the Priest and let the Lord tell you whether they are plagued.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Remember that a person has to separate himself from a leper.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A house plagued with leprosy had to be torn down and a garment plagued with leprosy had to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Of course, today you do not need to burn your clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But at least you must not wear those things anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are many garments which are plagued with leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many of them can be worn again after the sleeves are lengthened and the dress dyed to a different color or changed to a different style.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some clothing can be kept after it is examined by the priest and altered a little.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some clothing has the nature of leprosy even after it is examined and altered.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It must be thrown away.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As soon as a person believes in the Lord, he has to present his clothes piece by piece to the Lord and allow Him to examine each one in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He should let the Lord tell him whether or not the clothing is appropriate for him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All of it must be dealt with piece by piece.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I hope new believers will behave as Christians when they present themselves before men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not want to see anyone doubting a Christian's genuineness because of the kind of clothes he or she wears.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Others will say whether or not we are Christians by the kind of clothes we wear.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A cleansed person would never wear plagued clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our leprosy has been cleansed and our sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From now on, we should not wear any leprosy-infested garments.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>New believers must present everything in their wardrobe piece by piece to the Lord and pray over each item.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not expect others to come and tell you what is good and what is not.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You must bring everything to the Lord yourself and let the Lord judge you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You must ask the Lord, "I have become a believer now.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Is this clothing all right?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Is this clothing right?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some items of clothing have to be thrown away, while others must be altered.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let the Lord teach you what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some garments cannot be altered at all.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You must decide for yourself whether sin is involved in a certain garment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Your clothing has much to do with you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This matter must be dealt with soberly.</S>
