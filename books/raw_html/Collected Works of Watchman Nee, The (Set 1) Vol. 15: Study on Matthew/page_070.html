<H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER NINETEEN</H1><P>Verses 1-2:"And when Jesus finished these words, He departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan. And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them there." Every time, after the Lord finished teaching people, He always did some works such as healing the sick, casting out demons, etc. Here again the Lord healed the sick.</P><P>Verse 3:"And some Pharisees came to Him, testing Him and saying, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?" From verse 3 on, there is another problem: the kingdom of the heavens and the natural relationship of man. The Jews proposed that a divorce could be made for whatever reason a person provided. Among the Chinese there are seven conditions for divorce. The Jews probably have seventy-seven times seven conditions. If a meal was not prepared satisfactorily, that could be an excuse for a divorce. The Pharisees liked to have divorces, yet they still felt constrained. Therefore, they asked the Lord.</P><P>Verse 4:"And He answered and said, Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female." This verse gives us two principles: (1) marriage is ordained by God, and (2) monogamy, the institution of one husband and one wife. There were only one Adam and one Eve. The Lord's answer implied that this is not a question of the law but a matter of looking into the origin of the matter.</P><P>Verse 5:"And said, `For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh'?" The relationship between father and son or mother and son is intimate enough. However, there is still another relationship, that between husband and wife, which is even more intimate. If one cannot separate fathers from sons or mothers from sons, how much more should husbands not be separated from their wives.</P><P>Verse 6:"So then they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has yoked together, let man not separate." In the record of the Bible, the number of the women was not reported; hence, the two had become "one flesh." Before God, husband and wife count as only one unit. "So then they are no longer two, but one flesh....let man not separate." This is the verdict.</P><P>Verse 7:"They said to Him, Why then did Moses command us to give her a certificate of divorce and divorce her?" The Pharisees naturally quoted the law of Moses, assuming that by quoting Moses the Lord could most easily be defeated. They assumed that the Lord's word contradicted that of Moses. "Why then did Moses command?" Moses did not command this, he only allowed it. Only the Lord could discern their fallacy.</P><P>Verse 8:"He said to them, Moses, because of your hardness of heart, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so." In verse 8 the Lord did not deny the reason for the establishing of the Old Testament. However, he pointed out that Moses allowed certain things because of the hardness of heart of the Israelites in not following God's original will from the beginning. This shows that the law cannot regenerate man or perfect man (Heb. 10:1). In the beginning God's will was not like this.</P><P>Verse 9:"But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her who has been divorced commits adultery." Although there are many kinds of legal divorces among different nations today, only one kind of divorce is proper: for reason of fornication. The Bible did not put stress on the wedding or the engagement. Marriage originates out of a voluntary (rather than involuntary) relationship of the flesh. (According to 1 Corinthians 6:16, "the two shall be one flesh.") This relationship of the flesh is most pure, because it is ordained by God. Whenever there is a relationship of the flesh, regardless of the law and the customs of society, before God one becomes responsible and the two are one flesh. This is why in the Old Testament, if a man ruined the virginity of a woman, he had to marry her. This is because the joining of the flesh is a critical element in marriage. Fornication is an act to ruin the fact of "the two shall be one flesh." Divorce is a breaking down of oneness before God. Hence, these are the conclusions: (1) any fornication destroys the oneness before God; and (2) no divorce is permitted except because of fornication. Although we believers are in the world, we ought not to follow the current of the age or the human law. We ought to obey God's will. To marry one who has been put away is to commit adultery because if the woman did not commit fornication and yet was put away, that oneness still exists before God. For someone to marry her would damage the oneness. If the woman was put away because of fornication, then to marry her is to commit adultery with her. What if, before a man believed in the Lord, he had married a woman who was put away? Then whatever was done has already been covered by the precious blood; he cannot put her away any more. Paul talked only about separation if it is because of (1) need and (2) its being profitable. But the believer should not initiate it. Rather, he should choose to be at peace and be patient. Separation is for waiting. Perhaps God will use the separation period to cause the unbelieving one to believe. Suppose a believer has a wife who has committed fornication. According to the law and the Lord's word, she can be put away. However, according to the Lord's grace, if the wife repents, he should still forgive her (cf. John 8:3-11).</P><P>Verse 10:"His disciples said to Him, If the case of the man with his wife is like this, it is not profitable to marry." The disciples had their own inclinations; they agreed with having divorce at will. When they saw that this could not be done, they said that it was not profitable to marry. This also violates God's original plan.</P>
