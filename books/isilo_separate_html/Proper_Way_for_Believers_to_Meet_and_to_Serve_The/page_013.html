Being Types</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s words are simple in meaning yet profound in significance. He is the bread of life, which is of the plant life. Furthermore, His flesh is true food, and His blood is true drink. Both <em>flesh</em> and <em>blood</em> refer to the lamb. Hence, on the one hand, the Lord is typified by the vegetable life&mdash;bread; on the other hand, He is typified by the animal life&mdash;the lamb. The Lord as bread is for feeding and for the multiplication of life, and the Lord as the Lamb is for redemption by the shedding of blood so that we may partake of Him.</p>
<p>The vegetable life typifies the Lord Jesus, showing that He feeds us and is being reproduced in us. He is the grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died in order to bring forth His believers as many grains for His multiplication (12:24). He is bread to feed us so that we may live because of Him (6:57). A grain of wheat that is sown into the ground is for the multiplication of life, and wheat grains that are ground into flour and made into bread are for feeding. Hence, the vegetable life typifies the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>The animal life also typifies the Lord Jesus, showing that He accomplished redemption in order for us to partake of Him. He is the Lamb of God for our sins to be taken away (1:29). During the Passover, the children of Israel killed the lamb, put the blood of the lamb on the doorposts and on the lintel of the house, and ate the flesh of the lamb together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs (Exo. 12). This picture shows that the Israelites were sinful and deserved to be slain. However, through the blood of the lamb they were redeemed by God; He passed over them and did not slay them. As a result, they were able to enjoy peace and could eat the flesh of the lamb.</p>
<p>This was the atmosphere when the Lord Jesus spoke concerning eating His flesh and drinking His blood in John 6. He said that His flesh is true food and that His blood is true drink (v. 55). This means that we should accept everything that has been accomplished through His blood. His blood redeems us so that we are spared from destruction, from God&rsquo;s judgment, and are placed in a peaceful situation for us to enjoy Him as food, as our life supply.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the bread of life. In verse 51 the Lord said, &ldquo;The bread which I will give is My flesh.&rdquo; This indicates that the composition of the bread is not only of the vegetable life but also of the animal life; it is flesh-bread. The New Testament indicates that the Lord is the grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died to be reproduced in us and to be our life supply. He is also the Lamb of God who shed His blood for us and gave Himself to us so that we may partake of Him.</p>
<p>During the Passover, a lamb was slain, and the people enjoyed the lamb peacefully through its shed blood. The Israelites ate the lamb in haste with their loins girded, their sandals on their feet, and their staff in their hands (Exo. 12:11), because they had to leave the land of Egypt immediately after eating the lamb. After the people ate the lamb, it entered into their cells and became their constitution. Hence, they were living by the lamb that they had eaten and were thus strengthened to walk out of Egypt.</p>
<p>The pictures in the Old Testament are types of the realities in the New Testament. The Lord Jesus is the incarnated God becoming the Lamb of God and taking the form of a man with blood and flesh so that He could shed His blood for our sins and accomplish redemption for us. Then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit to enter into us so that we may partake of Him. Furthermore, He is the bread of life, the flesh-bread, so that we may be redeemed, fed, and supplied. Our need today is to eat Him, to drink Him, and to enjoy Him practically.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Eating the Lord in John 6</h2>
<p>In 1958 I held a conference in Taipei concerning eating, drinking, and enjoying God. After the first message a brother who was a college professor told me that although the message was good, some of the phrases that had been used were barbaric. He was referring to the expression <em>eating Jesus.</em> I replied, &ldquo;This way of speaking began with the Lord Jesus, not with me. He said, &lsquo;He who eats Me...&rsquo; He was the one who took the lead to use this expression.&rdquo; Christianity is veiled and has not seen the matter of eating Jesus. We thank the Lord that He has opened our eyes to see this truth in the Bible. John 6:57 in the Chinese Union Version of the Bible reads, &ldquo;He who eats My flesh&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;he who eats Me.&rdquo; The translators added the word <em>flesh</em> because they did not see this truth and dared not translate what was written. However, adding the word <em>flesh</em> changes the meaning. The Lord Jesus did not tell us to merely eat His flesh; He told us to eat Him.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s words are profound and difficult to comprehend. The Jews were therefore puzzled and contended with one another, saying, &ldquo;How can this man give us His flesh to eat?&rdquo; (v. 52). The disciples also murmured, saying, &ldquo;This word is hard; who can hear it?&rdquo; (v. 60). The Lord Jesus then said to them, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing&rdquo; (v. 63a). The Lord first spoke of bread, then of flesh and blood, and then of the flesh profiting nothing because it is the Spirit who gives life. The Lord&rsquo;s words indicate that He is not only the bread of the vegetable life and the bread of the animal life; He is also the Spirit. For the Feast of the Passover the Jews killed a lamb, shed its blood, and then ate its flesh. This lamb is a shadow of Christ. The Lord Jesus is the real Passover lamb who was slain for the shedding of His blood. However, we cannot eat His physical flesh, so He became the life-giving Spirit for our enjoyment. Therefore, He said, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to understand the revelation in John 6, we must consider these key words. The Lord Jesus is the bread of life. This bread is also flesh for the accomplishing of redemption. Furthermore, in resurrection He became the Spirit for us to have life. But even the Spirit is abstract and difficult to comprehend. Therefore, in the second part of verse 63 the Lord went on to say, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; This indicates that as the Spirit, He has become the words that He speaks to us. The words that I speak come out of me, so my words are me. If I stand here for an hour without speaking, there is no way for you to know me. When I open my mouth and speak, my words become my expression because they are me. The Lord Jesus is bread, the Spirit, and the Word. When we receive His words, we receive the Spirit, and the Spirit becomes life to us. This life is our supply and consequently becomes our element. Hence, to receive His words is equivalent to eating Him.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
