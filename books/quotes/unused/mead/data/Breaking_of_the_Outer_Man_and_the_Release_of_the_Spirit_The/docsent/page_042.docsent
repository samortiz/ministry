   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT IMPRESSION AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CONDITION OF THE SPIRIT BREAKING AND IMPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whether or not we can be a worker of the Lord depends not on what we say or do but on what comes out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we say and do one thing, yet what comes out of us is another thing, others will not receive help.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What comes out of us is a very crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes we say that we have a good impression of a certain person, or that we have a bad impression of another person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Where does this impression come from?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The impression does not come from a person's words.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If it does, then we would say that a person is good if his words are good and that he is bad if his words are bad; there would not be the need to talk about impression at all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet in reality there is something inexplicable which gives us certain impressions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The impressions that we receive of a person are something apart from his words and deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As he is speaking or acting, something else comes out of his being which impresses us with an impression.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What generates an impression in others is the strongest spots we have in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If our thoughts have never been broken and are lawless and wild, when we meet the brothers and sisters, they spontaneously will touch our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This will be all that impresses them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may possess an abnormal emotion; it may be exceptionally warm or cold.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If our emotion has never been broken by the Lord, it will spontaneously come out of us when we contact others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The impression others will receive will be of our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our strong spot will be what comes out of us, and it will be the impression that others receive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can control our words and our actions, but we cannot control what flows out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whatever we have will flow out of us spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second Kings 4 gives us the account of the Shunammite woman's reception of Elisha.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible says that "one day Elisha was passing through Shunem; and there was a wealthy woman there, who compelled him to have a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So whenever he passed through, he would turn aside and have a meal there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And she said to her husband, Now I know that this man who continually passes through unto us is a holy man of God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Elisha passed through Shunem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He did not give one message or perform one miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every time he passed through, he turned aside and had a meal there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The woman identified him as a man of God by the way he took his meal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was the impression that Elisha gave to others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today we have to ask ourselves, "What is the impression that we give to others?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is the thing that comes out of us?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have spoken repeatedly that the outer man must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the outer man is not broken, the impression that others receive from us will be nothing but the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every time we contact others, we may give them an unpleasant feeling that we are self-loving, stubborn, and proud.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Or we may give them an impression that we are clever and extremely eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps we give others a so-called good impression.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But does this impression satisfy God?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Does it meet the church's need?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is not satisfied, and the church has no need of our so-called good impressions.</S>
