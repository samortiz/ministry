<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FIFTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">DEALING WITH THE LORD&rsquo;S SUPPER</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 11:17-34</h1><p>In 11:17-34 Paul deals with the matter of the Lord&rsquo;s supper. Let us consider the different points covered by Paul in these verses.</p><h2 class="head1">I. REBUKING BECAUSE OF THE DISORDER</h2><h2 class="head2">A. No Praise in Giving This Charge</h2><p>In 11:17-22 Paul rebukes the Corinthians because of the disorder among them with regard to the Lord&rsquo;s supper. In verse 17 he says, &ldquo;But in giving this charge, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;but&rdquo; here indicates a contrast between &ldquo;I do not praise you&rdquo; and &ldquo;I praise you&rdquo; in verse 2. From this verse through the end of the chapter, the apostle deals with the eighth problem, the problem concerning the Lord&rsquo;s supper.</p><p>Paul is honest and frank. When the believers should be praised, he praises them. But when they should not be praised, he does not praise them. Although Paul does not say in verse 17, &ldquo;I rebuke you,&rdquo; he nonetheless speaks to them in a rebuking tone.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Corinthian Believers Coming Together<br />Not for the Better but for the Worse</h2><p>The reason Paul did not praise them was that their coming together was not for the better, but for the worse (v. 17). This indicates that the meeting together of the believers may be a loss instead of a profit. The expression &ldquo;not for the better but for the worse&rdquo; means that the result of the Corinthians coming together was not profit but loss, that the result of their meeting was not gain but loss. Some Corinthians became weak, others became sick, and some even died. This proves that they lost a great deal.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Divisions Existing among Them<br />in Their Church Meeting</h2><p>In verse 18 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you, and some part I believe.&rdquo; Paul spoke in a rather soft way. He does not say that he fully believed all he heard; on the contrary he says that he believed a certain part. This reveals his soft tone in rebuking the Corinthians. The expression &ldquo;in the church&rdquo; means in the assembly of the church (14:34-35).</p><p>Verse 19 continues, &ldquo;For there must also be parties among you, that those who are approved may become manifest among you.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered parties means sects, schools of different opinions, as in Galatians 5:20. The word approved means tested that the specifications have been met. According to this verse, even the parties, the sects, are useful to manifest the approved ones, those who are not sectarian.</p>
