   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Elder Brothers Who Are before Us</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us read a few verses together concerning the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Corinthians 16:15-16 says, "Now I exhort you, brothers: You know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and they have set themselves to minister to the saints; you also be subject to such ones, and to everyone co-working and laboring."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The household of Stephanas had no other thought in the church in Corinth except to minister to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul told us to be subject to such ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must be subject to the deputy authority of God in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must be subject to those who are like the household of Stephanas and also to everyone who co-works and labors with those who are like Stephanas.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These are brothers more mature than we; they are firstfruits in Christ and were begotten before we were begotten.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are also concerned about our affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should honor them, not despise them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, we should be subject to them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Elderly Ones</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Peter 5:5 says, "In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The passage before this verse speaks of those who are elders.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here is a group of people who have more days in the Lord; they may be the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peter said that the younger men should be subject to the elderly ones, who are patterns to others before the Lord v. 3 . If a young person finds someone taking care of him according to God's will, he should learn to subject himself to such a one before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This one is a pattern to him, and he should learn to subject himself to this pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should pay particular attention to our submission to the elderly brothers; they are clearly qualified to represent the Lord in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those Who Take the Lead Well</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>and Who Labor in Word and Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Timothy 5:17 says, "Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You must render double honor toward those elders who take the lead well in the church and should never despise or criticize them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You should honor the elders, even more those who labor in word and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You should also honor those who have the gift of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some elders can fulfill the ministry of the word and some cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You should honor not only those who can fulfill such a ministry but also those who cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I would like to point out that many brothers hold a wrong concept about submission; they choose the kind of people they will submit to.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They think they should submit to only perfect individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Please bear in mind that this is not the Lord's ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not submit only to those who are perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We submit rather to the authority the Lord has placed over us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If it were up to us to choose a person to submit to, we would never find such a person on earth, because we would always find faults.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even if Peter appeared in our midst, we would still find many faults in him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only one thing is necessary for our submission; if a brother is before us in the Lord, we should listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You can find a million reasons to excuse yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>An elder may know only how to take care of the church but have no ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may think that you do not need to honor him since you can speak better than he can.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But God's Word says, "Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not a matter of choice.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many people cover their lawlessness and disobedience with the excuse of choice.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a person is more mature than you are and is ahead of you, you should submit to him and not criticize him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those Leading Us</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hebrews 13:17 says, "Obey the ones leading you and submit to them."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's Word is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You should submit to all those who are before you and who are leading you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You cannot choose the ones you like and submit only to them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you only listen to one brother's word and refuse another's word, this is not real submission.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not difficult to only listen to one brother.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For a person to learn submission, he must learn to submit to all the ones who are before him, not only to those who are immediately above him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He must learn to submit to those leading him, not only to the elderly who are particularly gifted and used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You must always seek out those who are before you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the coming days, when you go to other localities, three or five of you will be gathered together.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The first question you should ask is: To whom should I submit?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You should submit to those who are before you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When three or five brothers gather together even for two or three hours, spontaneously one will be manifested to be God's appointed leader.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You must submit to this one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The characteristic of a Christian is submission, not work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The characteristic of a Christian is the acknowledgment of all the leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When five or six brothers are together, it is a sweet thing to see them all standing on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As soon as you sit down with ten or twenty brothers, you should immediately identify those who are ahead of you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Once you identify them, you should submit to them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>"Obey the ones leading you and submit to them."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is because "they watch over your souls as those who will render an account, that they may do this with joy and not groaning; for this would be unprofitable to you."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Anyone who is ahead of you is concerned about your soul; he has to render an account for your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You should submit to this person before God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those Who Labor</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>and Take the Lead in the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>First Thessalonians 5:12-13 says, "Furthermore we ask you, brothers, to acknowledge those who labor among you and take the lead among you in the Lord and admonish you, and to regard them most highly in love because of their work."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some people have a responsibility in the Lord to take care of you and to lead you.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You should honor and regard them highly.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They are the ones to submit to.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A Christian who has no one to submit to in this world is a strange person.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Every Christian should find many who are ahead of him, who are weighty spiritually and who can render him spiritual guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He should submit to them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we do this, we will maintain the right principle in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God cannot find this principle in Satan, the world, or the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This principle is the principle of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must all learn this basic lesson in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The world has rejected this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God must now secure it in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The underlying basic principle in the church is submission.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Being Subject to</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>All of God's Ordained Authorities</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We have seen that the oneness of the Body is authority itself.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We have also seen that one person, two or three persons, or a local church, can represent the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Finally, we have seen that the elders in the Lord, those who take the lead among us, also represent the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>All of these constitute God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>They are the deputy authority of God among us, and we must submit to them and honor them.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We must inquire of them and listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we practice this, the Lord's name and His word will be magnified in our midst, and we will be Philadelphia indeed.</S>
