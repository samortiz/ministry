<h1 class="title">THE SAVIOR OF THE UNIVERSE&mdash;CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Gen. 3:15<br />
To explain that Jesus is the Savior of the universe, use these two points: &ldquo;the seed of woman shall bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Lamb that was slain.&rdquo;</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The promise of the Savior<br />
<span class="normal">Describe how Adam and Eve were afraid of God after they had sinned, and how they hated the serpent, Satan. While they were in such a state of fear and hatred, God came in to give them a promise. This promise said that One would come to crush the head of the enemy they hated. This was an explicit promise. On the other hand, God killed a lamb for them, atoned for them by the shedding of the blood, and covered their shame before God. This was a figurative promise.<br />
The explicit promise, to crush the serpent&rsquo;s head, deals with Satan, and the figurative promise, the blood shed for atonement, deals with man&rsquo;s sins before God.</span></li>
<li>The person of the Savior<br />
<span class="normal">First speak of His being born on earth as a man through a virgin; then go on to say that He was the Word becoming flesh, that He was God becoming man to be our Savior.</span></li>
<li>The work of the Savior<br />
<span class="normal">This is to speak of His death.<br />
On one hand, He was the Mighty One. He crushed the head of Satan on the cross. He put Satan to death, and He dealt with Satan. On the other hand, He was a Lamb. He shed His blood on the cross. He washed away man&rsquo;s sins. He nullified the record of man&rsquo;s sins before God.</span></li>
<li>Receiving the Savior<br />
<span class="normal">Just as Adam received God&rsquo;s promise and also received the skins for clothing, today we also should:</span>
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>According to the words of the Bible, receive the Savior.</li>
	<li>According to the work of the Savior, receive Him as Savior.</li>
	</ol></li>
