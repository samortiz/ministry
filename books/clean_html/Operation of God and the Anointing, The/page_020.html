<h2 class="head2">Needing to Accept God&rsquo;s Concept</h2>
<p><em>Question: In the past whenever I suffered or was sick, I would ask the Lord whether I had offended Him or what lesson did He want me to learn. When I received the anointing, it was easy for me to obey and to deal with the mistake. Can this be regarded as living in the anointing?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Although this can be regarded as living in the anointing, I do not wish to answer this question from this angle. I would rather say that our concept of the anointing is different from God&rsquo;s concept. We think that the function of the anointing is to teach us what is right and what is wrong. However, according to God&rsquo;s concept, the anointing is to show us what is of Christ and what is of ourselves. We pay attention to doing things, but the Holy Spirit pays attention to the life that is operating. We ask, &ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How should we do this?&rdquo; The Holy Spirit asks, &ldquo;Who is doing this?&rdquo; There is a big difference between God&rsquo;s concept and ours.</p>
<p>This question is still concerning right and wrong. You check with God whether you have done something wrong when you suffer or get sick, and you are willing to deal with your mistake if you are enlightened. This concept is still related to right or wrong. You do not have the concept of discerning whether it is Christ or yourself.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find a verse in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles that says, &ldquo;You should not do anything wrong,&rdquo; or &ldquo;You must do the right thing.&rdquo; However, numerous portions in the New Testament show that Christ lives in us. In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; In Philippians 1:20 he says, &ldquo;As always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.&rdquo; In Romans 8:11 he says, &ldquo;If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; This teaching is prevalent in the New Testament, but we do not pay attention to it. The New Testament does not say, &ldquo;You should follow the Holy Spirit to do the right thing and not the wrong thing.&rdquo; However, after we read the Bible, we always ask, &ldquo;Is it right for me to do this? Is it wrong for me to do that?&rdquo; The fellowship in this chapter is clear, but your question is, &ldquo;When I get sick, I pray and God enlightens me as to what I did wrong, so I deal with it. Is this living in the anointing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man has not been able to leave the things related to that tree. We even view messages that we hear concerning the Holy Spirit according to right and wrong. Ninety percent of the teaching of the apostles concerns the Holy Spirit. When we read these portions, we cannot find a place where the Holy Spirit is teaching us what is right and what is wrong, nor is He teaching us to do the right thing rather than the wrong thing. On the contrary, the Bible says, &ldquo;If by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live&rdquo; (Rom. 8:13), and &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). This is the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>God does not intend to correct our mistakes, and being right does not increase our standing before the Lord. Instead of correcting our mistakes, the Lord puts us on the cross. Christ is revealed in us through the Spirit so that Christ can grow, live, and be formed in us (1:16; 2:20; 4:19). The Lord also uses the cross to do a killing work in us through the Spirit. This is the teaching of the anointing, the work of the anointing. The teaching of the anointing is not for correcting our mistakes. The anointing is to bring us into the death of the cross so that Christ may have all the ground in us.</p>
<p>In terms of being a human being, it is right to correct our mistakes and wrongdoings, just as parents correct their children. However, as far as being a Christian is concerned, correcting a mistake does not have much value. Being a Christian is a matter of changing our person. In educating our children, it is right to correct their mistakes, but in leading the saints in the churches, we should help change their person. The teaching of the anointing Spirit differs from the teaching that parents give their children at home. We should not think that we are good Christians because we have good conduct. Many saints with good conduct do not understand spiritual matters. They are spiritual novices. The church has only Christ. The Holy Spirit and the cross must put us to death and add Christ to us. This is the purpose of the anointing.</p>
<p>We need revelation. We should not think that we understand the anointing. Tomorrow some saints might still pray, &ldquo;O Lord, please tell me what is right and what is wrong. Tell me what I should do and what I should not do.&rdquo; Such prayers prove that we do not have light. When we are enlightened, we will no longer ask whether a certain thing is right or wrong. Instead, we will ask, &ldquo;Is it Christ or myself who is living?&rdquo; We will hate and detest the self that does wrong and also the self that does right.</p>
<p>We pay attention to things, but the Holy Spirit pays attention to our person. We pay attention to right and wrong, but the Holy Spirit pays attention to Christ. Of course, sometimes the Spirit will correct our mistakes. However, He corrects us with the purpose of changing our person. For example, suppose a sister has a bad temper when dealing with her husband. She may seek the Lord, hoping that He will take away her temper. The Holy Spirit may also show her that her temper is not good. However, the Holy Spirit does not intend to change her temper but to change her person. If her person is not changed, her temper will remain. To soften her temper without changing her person is the practice of Hinduism, Buddhism, or Confucianism. The Holy Spirit does not want to correct our mistakes; He wants to change our person. In the initial stage of being a Christian, we are inevitably concerned about matters of right or wrong. However, gradually the Spirit will open our eyes so that instead of asking whether a matter is right or wrong, we would ask, &ldquo;Lord, are You doing this, or am I?&rdquo; Concerning our temper and our meekness, we would ask, &ldquo;Lord, is this You, or is it me?&rdquo; We must learn to say, &ldquo;If it is of me, I will not do it. If it is the Lord, I will do it.&rdquo;</p>
