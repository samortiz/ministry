	 <h2 class="head2">Being Broad in the Ministry</h2>
<p>If we receive a definite commission from the Lord, we will not be limited in our usefulness. Hudson Taylor is an example. For decades I considered different things related to him. However, it was not until recently that one particular point impressed me. Hudson Taylor was not a person with the gift to preach the gospel. According to his biography, he was not good at preaching the gospel, but he received the burden to preach the gospel. Hudson Taylor was not a powerful evangelist. The messages he preached were mostly related to living in the Lord&rsquo;s presence and fellowshipping with the Lord. Over the past two thousand years no one has spoken a clearer word on John 15 than the word he spoke. He touched the essence of this chapter. However, the commission that he received from the Lord was not to preach John 15. His commission was for something different.</p>
<p>Our problem is that we either receive a burden but lack spiritual learning, or we have the necessary spiritual learning but are trapped in the learning and reject everything else. Either we are trapped in what we know, or we are enthusiastic and attempt to work in an unrestrained way without the necessary learning. These considerations make us useless in the Lord&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Hudson Taylor is one of the few believers who were greatly used by the Lord in the last one hundred years. He was greatly used by the Lord because he was not limited to his learning to live in the Lord&rsquo;s presence. He received a burden and a commission that were beyond his learning. Hudson Taylor was a great person. He had a heart that was truly enlarged by God; hence, he did not desire to be great. His biography shows that he was a humble man. Hudson Taylor was one of the believers who was truly low. He felt that he was useless, but his heart was enlarged by God.</p>
<p>One day as he stood by the seashore and looked over the ocean, he received a burden from the Lord. He considered that in the vast land of China four hundred million people had not heard the gospel. Even though Christianity had come to China, the missionaries mostly worked along the coastal regions. They did not go inland. He considered the thousands of people who died every day without hearing the gospel. Therefore, he said to the Lord that he was willing to receive a burden. He formed the China Inland Mission with the particular burden of spreading the gospel to the interior of China. Initially, he oversaw everything, and there was not much organization. It was only later that it became a large organization. Hudson Taylor was moved by God. Regrettably, when other workers joined him, other elements were added, which weakened the work. The burden that Hudson Taylor received from the Lord, however, was truly a spiritual matter that touched God&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<p>Hudson Taylor&rsquo;s move not only enabled many Chinese people to hear the gospel, but it also stirred up many believers from Europe and America to rise up to spread the gospel, especially to China. Moreover, a large amount of money was given for the gospel. This was a great matter that brought in innumerable blessings to the church of God. Hudson Taylor was a lowly man. He did not regard himself as someone great and important. His heart was enlarged by God. He was not limited by what he knew or by what he was able to do. His heart was enlarged by the Lord.</p>
<p>If we are proud, we are foolish and vain. Our heart needs to be enlarged by God. We should ask God to enlarge our heart. When our heart is enlarged, we will not care only for the work that we are doing; neither will we care only for the church in our locality. We will not say that because we are in Kaohsiung or Keelung, we care only for Kaohsiung or Keelung. Instead, if we are in Kaohsiung, we will care for Kaohsiung more than we did previously, and if we are in Keelung, we will care for Keelung in a better way than we did previously. But at the same time we will care for the churches in other places. This depends on our being broadened.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Inclusive and<br />
Able to Coordinate with Others</h2>
<p>When our heart is enlarged, our spiritual knowledge and learning will not be unbalanced and lifeless. At the same time we will be broad in the ministry and care for the churches everywhere. If we want to be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, our heart must be large. God cannot use a person with a narrow heart. If God gives us a few workers to coordinate with, we might say that there are too many and that they are bothersome. Workers who say this are useless in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. Our heart must be so enlarged that we do not consider it a problem to coordinate with three hundred, five hundred, eight hundred, or even a thousand workers. We should be able to handle the situation, and whether or not the workers are useful, they should be able to work in coordination with us. Our heart must be enlarged so that whether or not the workers are good, they can labor with us. The larger a person&rsquo;s heart is, the more he is able to keep others in the coordination. Therefore, our ability to labor with others depends on our heart being enlarged.</p>
<p>The main reason we cannot coordinate with the brothers in the different places is that we have a small, narrow heart. It is not that the saints are a problem but that we have a narrow heart. We should never blame others and say that their heart is narrow. It does not matter whether their heart is narrow. If our heart is large, we will be able to embrace the saints who have a small heart. As soon as we include them, there will be harmony. There will be a harmonious situation with no disputes. The main reason we cannot get along with the saints and coordinate with them is that we have a small heart. Our heart is not enlarged, and we are limited. Because we are limited, we do not include others. Therefore, we have problems. On the contrary, when we accommodate the saints, there are no problems. This does not mean that we are like people in the world who play politics. We need to go to the Lord in all sincerity to be trained by Him so that our heart is enlarged. Then we will be able to include the saints.</p>
<p>If God can enlarge our heart, there is no way to estimate how useful we will be to Him. Our heart determines our usefulness. A person with a narrow heart is not that useful in God&rsquo;s hand. Our usefulness is related to the largeness of our heart.</p>
