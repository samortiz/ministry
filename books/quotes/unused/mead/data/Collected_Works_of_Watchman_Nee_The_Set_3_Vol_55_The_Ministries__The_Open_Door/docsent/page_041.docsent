   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TODAY'S REQUIREMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING FAITHFUL IN COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, today there is a requirement not only for the co-workers to be coordinated but for the leading ones to be coordinated as well.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>None of us can choose freely.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this way the church will preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every person, no matter where he goes, must go for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Their mouth must be for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to go out as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I believe that the Lord will have His way today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are not trustworthy and faithful, the Lord will choose others to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I believe that it is possible for Him to do this, but it would take at least another twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not say that the Lord will not lay us aside.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord can easily lay us aside, but it would waste another twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We expect to save twenty years for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may catch up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us give our all for this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After passing through very burdensome and difficult experiences, He has shown us this way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May we not forsake it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A message given by Watchman Nee and recorded by Brother Chou on the morning of August 19, 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>SEEING THE REAL CONDITION OF THE SELF</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>UNDER GOD'S LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The days seem to have flown by, and I have been at Kuling for three weeks now.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the start of school is not delayed, I will return to Shanghai around the beginning of September.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I will only be able to stay for two or three more weeks at the most.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>My heart is filled with fear and trepidation; I really do not know how I will live in the coming days!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the light of the Lord's word although I have really understood only a very small portion I deeply feel that I cannot continue to live in the darkness of my previous days.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Oh, I had not even dreamed that my previous days and previous "work" were this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In today's light, almost every matter, word, and attitude were merely the hypocrisy of pride, even though others saw them as "restrained," "spiritual," "humble," and "learned."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even my bones are haughty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not enough to say that my previous "work" was full of man's hands, ways, and thoughts; I do not know how much would remain if all the elements of human lust were removed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During the past months, almost everything has worked to expose me; I realize that I am intensely proud to the very core of my being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet I was in such darkness that I had no feeling of this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although I discovered my pride many times, sought humility, and tried my best to learn to be humble, little did I realize that this "humility" was no purer and better than my pride.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I really have no way to describe the depth of my pride!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am proud when doing something and proud when I am still.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord seems to have brought all of my former conduct to the light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He has shown me the source of all matters and activities and the depth of my evil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He also has shown me the leading of His hand through my circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He has exposed my dark, insensitive condition!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>My deepest parts are full of sorrow and repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I look to the Lord to give me grace and to have pity on me, His lazy and evil servant.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>May He break and smash my pride!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I feel that I am unable to continue in my old way, nor can I continue in my old work!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>My hazy future fills me with fear and trembling!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May the Lord give you a burden to pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May the Lord thoroughly break me and touch me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A sophomore at Nanking Central University Medical College</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>August 15, 1948</S>
