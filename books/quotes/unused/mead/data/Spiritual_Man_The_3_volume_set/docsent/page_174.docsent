   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After the believer has allowed the conscience to work, he should not just remain at this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A certain sin may have been dealt with already but other sins also need to be dealt with progressively, until all the sins have been thoroughly dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the believer is faithful to deal with all his iniquities and walk according to the conscience, then the heavenly light will shine brighter and brighter within him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then he can discover the sins which were not noticed formerly; he can comprehend more and more each day, reading and knowing the law which the Holy Spirit has written in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this manner, the believer will know what is holiness, righteousness, purity, and uprightness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The former things that were unclear will be deeply inscribed in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The intuition will be greatly helped, and its keenness in understanding the intention of the Holy Spirit will be increased.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, when the conscience rebukes, the believer should tell God, "I am willing to submit."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He should let Christ be the Lord of his life again, and he should be willing to be taught and rely on the teachings of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the believer truly follows the conscience, then the Holy Spirit certainly will come to help.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The conscience is the window of a believer's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The light from heaven shines through it so that the believer's spirit and whole being are filled with light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The entire being of the believer and his spirit will see the light of heaven through it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every time we think, talk, and do something not good or not befitting the proper conduct of a believer, the heavenly light will shine through the conscience to expose our wrongdoing and condemn our failures.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we allow the conscience to work, submit to it, and remove everything which it condemns, the heavenly light will shine even brighter the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do not confess our mistakes or remove our sins, the stain of sins will remain and the conscience will be defiled Titus 1:15 because we do not walk according to the teaching of God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then one sin will come after another, one mark will be added to another, causing the window to become darker and darker so that it is difficult for the light to shine through.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Consequently, the believer will sin willfully without feeling uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The conscience will be stifled and the intuition will be dulled by sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more spiritual a believer is, the keener his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no believer who is so spiritual that he does not have to confess his sins anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the conscience is dull and, perhaps, even without feeling, then he must be spiritually degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The greatest knowledge, diligent toil, fervent emotion, and firmness of will, can never replace the keenness of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a believer does not take care of the conscience and, instead, seeks after mental and emotional progress, he will regress in his spiritual walk.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The sensitivity of the conscience can increase and also decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a believer gives ground for the conscience to work, his window will become brighter every time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If he ignores the speaking of the conscience or, as we said before, uses reasonings or other works to replace the demands of the conscience, the conscience will speak again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But after about ten times, it will then stop speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The voice will become softer and softer until it vanishes in the end. Every time a believer does not listen to the voice of his conscience, his spiritual life is damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If he allows his spiritual life to be continually hurt, eventually the believer will definitely fall into a fleshly position.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He will no longer hate sins and aspire for victory as he did in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If he does not face the rebuke of the conscience, he cannot know the importance of listening to the voice of the conscience and walking according to the spirit.</S>
