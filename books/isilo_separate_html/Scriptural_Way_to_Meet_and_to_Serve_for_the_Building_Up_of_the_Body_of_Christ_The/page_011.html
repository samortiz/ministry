OF THE BELIEVERS THEMSELVES</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:25 says, &ldquo;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.&rdquo; The Apostle Paul wrote the book of Hebrews to encourage the hesitating, backslidden Hebrew believers to go forward within the veil and to go outside the camp (6:19; 13:13). To go &ldquo;outside the camp&rdquo; was to go outside of the old Jewish religion, and to enter &ldquo;within the veil&rdquo; was to enter into the Holy of Holies, where Christ is.</p>
<p>We must realize that our proper meeting is the Holy of Holies. To be gathered together in a proper way is to meet in the Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies is wherever the Lord Jesus is. The Lord is dwelling in the heavens (Rom. 8:34). The Lord is also dwelling in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22) which is the Holy of Holies (Heb. 4:12, 16; see note 4:16<sup>1</sup>, Recovery Version). Since the Lord is in the third heavens today, the third heavens is the Holy of Holies (Heb. 9:12; cf. v. 24). Since He is now in our spirit, our spirit is the Holy of Holies. Because the Lord Jesus is in our meeting whenever we meet together, our meeting is also the Holy of Holies (Heb. 10:22, 25). For the Hebrew believers to forsake their Christian meeting was for them to forsake the Holy of Holies and go back to their religious camp.</p>
<p>The book of Exodus shows us that after the children of Israel worshipped the golden calf (32:8), they became a camp. They had the Lord in name, but in reality they worshipped something else and hence became a religious camp among whom it was impossible to have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Moses knew that God, according to His holiness, would no longer stay among the people for the camp had become idolatrous. Therefore, Moses took his tent, which formerly had been in the camp, and pitched it outside the camp. This tent then became the tent of God, the tent of meeting (33:7&mdash;ASV). If the people would not go out of the camp but would remain in it, they would not have the presence of the Lord. The presence of the Lord was no longer in the camp but in the tent (33:9).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, there was a separation between the Jewish religionists, the camp, and the Lord Himself, the real tabernacle (John 1:14; 2:19, 21). The Lord Jesus was the very embodiment of God, and the real Holy of Holies was wherever He was. Outside of and around Christ, there was a religious organization, an old religion, a camp, which did not have God&rsquo;s Holy of Holies. In that religious organization of Judaism, God was not there. At the time the Lord Jesus walked upon this earth, the proper worship was always held in the temple according to the rituals ordained by God. Yet we must ask ourselves who the Lord Jesus is. Actually, He is the very God, the One whom the children of Israel worshipped in their temple.</p>
<p>One day Jesus entered into the house in Bethany (John 12:1-11). He was in that home, yet the Jewish priests still worshipped God in the temple in Jerusalem. During that time, where was God? Was He in the Holy of Holies within the temple at Jerusalem or in the small home at Bethany? No doubt, He was in the small home in Bethany. Because God was in that home in Bethany, that home became the very Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies in the temple was forsaken by God because it had become a part of the camp (Matt. 23:38&mdash;24:2). At that time, if anyone desired to worship God, they had to forsake the temple and go to that little home in Bethany. That little home was the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>The principle is the same today. In order to worship God, you have to go outside of the camp of religion and enter within the veil to enjoy Christ in the Holy of Holies. The Lord Jesus as God is not in the old, religious, human organization which is just a camp. In Hebrews, Paul charged the hesitating, wandering, backsliding Hebrew believers to forget about their old religion, old temple, and old ritual worship, and to go forth outside of the camp to enter into the Holy of Holies to enjoy Christ (Heb. 6:19; 10:22; 13:13). This Holy of Holies is the proper Christian meeting.</p>
<p>The Holy of Holies in Hebrews denotes three things: the third heavens, our spirit, and the Christian meeting. Whenever we come together properly, our gathering is the Holy of Holies. Of the three, which do you prefer, the third heavens, our spirit, or the Christian meeting? The heavens are difficult to reach, and we are often unable to remain in our spirit all day long, day and night. But according to my Christian experience, the meetings keep me in the Lord, in His Holy of Holies. I do not enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence elsewhere as much as I do in the meetings. It is enjoyable to be in our spirit, but the meeting as the Holy of Holies is much better and higher.</p>
<p>After some of us attend a ten day training or a conference, and we are returning to our localities, we may feel that we are in the outer court and not in the Holy of Holies. We may long for the time when we can gather together again. This experience illustrates the reason Paul urged the Hebrew believers not to forsake the assembling of themselves together. If they forsook their assembling together, it meant that they went back to their old religion, their former camp. Thus, Paul charged them to go outside the camp and to enter within the veil. To enter within the veil includes three things: to enter into the heavenly Holy of Holies, to enter our spirit which is linked to the heavenly Holy of Holies, and to enter into the Christian meeting. The Christian meeting is the best because it nourishes, strengthens, edifies, and enlightens us, becoming a great spiritual benefit to us. The meetings are wonderful!</p>
<p>The meeting in the New Testament is referred to as a gathering (Matt. 18:20) and an assembly (Heb. 10:25). The assembling together of the believers, the meetings, should not be in the nature of fulfilling mixed purposes. Frequently, in Christianity, the meetings are not pure in their purpose. The meetings of the believers should be purely in the nature of carrying out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. If we hold a meeting which is not pure and which has a mixed purpose, it would be difficult to have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. The proper Christian meeting must be pure in its purpose. The essence, the nature, of the meeting must be purely to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to get a people through Christ to be the church that God may have a corporate expression in His fatherhood. Every Christian meeting must be pure in nature to carry out this economy of God that God may express Himself as a great Father in all of His children. To have a meeting with such a motive and purpose is really pure.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
