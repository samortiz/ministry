   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KINDS OF MEETINGS The Table Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We gathered together to break bread ; Come together...to eat the Lord s supper Acts 20:7; 1 Cor 11:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first meeting for those who have received the Lord s redemption is the table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whereas other meetings emphasize our receiving, only the table meeting emphasizes the Lord s receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this meeting we break bread, which is to eat the Lord s supper.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Breaking bread and eating the Lord s supper speak of two aspects of one matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Breaking bread emphasizes the fellowship that we have with all the saints through the Lord s bread and cup.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eating the Lord s supper emphasizes our remembrance of the Lord through eating His bread and drinking of His cup.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The First Section Remembering the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He took a loaf and gave thanks, and He broke it and gave it to them, saying,...Do this in remembrance of Me ; Similarly also the cup,...saying,...This do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me Luke 22:19; 1 Cor 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The table meeting has two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first section extends from the beginning of the meeting until the passing of the bread and wine has been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this portion of the meeting, the central point is the remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should think only of the Lord s person and work, that is, how the Lord is God yet man, how He is our Lord, our Savior, and our all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should also consider how He loves us, having accomplished redemption for us, intercedes for us, graces us, upholds us, and cares for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should also remember how He is coming to rapture us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we remember the Lord, we should pray with thanksgiving and praise when we have the inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We also can express our praise through hymns, reading Bible verses, or speaking something so that all the saints would have the same feeling and remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this portion of the meeting our prayers, hymns, and speaking should center on the Lord s person and work and cause people to touch the Lord s person and work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not center on anything else or cause others to think about something other than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes during our remembrance of the Lord, a brother will report on the needs of another brother, or a sister may pray concerning the hardships of another sister.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These things do not relate to our remembrance of the Lord; they should be considered in the fellowship and prayer meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the Lord s table we should forget about everything and concentrate on remembering the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should think only of the Lord Himself and His glory, honor, work, and deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our inward heart and outward actions should be centered on the Lord so that He can gain our remembrance see chapter 20, The Breaking of Bread .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Second Section Worshipping the Father</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>1.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After the bread and cup have been passed and are consumed in the table meeting, we should begin the second section of the meeting, which extends to the end of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The center of this time is the worship of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All our prayers, hymns, and speaking should be focused on the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Lord Jesus finished breaking bread with His disciples, they sang a hymn to the Father before He led them to the Mount of Olives.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now in resurrection He sings hymns of praise to the Father in the midst of the church, leading us, who are sons, to sing with Him in praise to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through death and resurrection, the only begotten Son of the Father has dispensed His life into us, making us the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now He is the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In resurrection He leads us, as His many brothers, to worship and praise the Father with Him in His position as the Firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After eating the bread and drinking the cup, we should willingly follow Him in spirit in the worship of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This worship comes from the many brothers who follow the Firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this worship all prayers, hymns, and speaking should be addressed to the Father and center on the Father.</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In these verses the Lord speaks of prayer in the meeting, the gathering, of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This kind of prayer is more powerful than individual prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It can bind what has been bound in the heavens and loose what has been loosed in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For such power, however, there is a need for harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we desire this kind of prayer, we must come together and pray with one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>2.</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The prayer of the church has special power.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must be in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The moment that we are not in one accord, the prayer of the church is killed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a spiritual law.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>3.</S>

   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These verses refer to a prayer meeting held by the early disciples when they encountered persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Their prayer in one accord caused them to not fear or shrink back in the face of the threat of persecution but to testify more boldly for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>5.</S>

   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When the church encounters significant problems, we should meet together to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This prayer always carries authority.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we attend the prayer meeting, we must remember that we not only come to meet but to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must open and exercise our spirit to receive a burden for our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Once we have a sense of burden in our spirit, we should all open our mouth to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we do not practice this, the atmosphere of the prayer meeting will be very heavy, and little prayer will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Meeting for the Mutual Building Up</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>through the Exercise of Spiritual Gifts</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Let all things be done for building up 1 Cor 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The meeting spoken of in this verse is for the exercise of the spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In this meeting one person does not do one particular thing; rather, everyone should follow the leading of the Holy Spirit in the exercise of spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Some may have a hymn, some may have a teaching, some may do this, and some do that.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The goal of all spiritual exercise, however, is the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two, or at the most three, and in turn, and one should interpret; but if there is no interpreter, he should be silent in the church, and speak to himself and to God 1 Cor 14:27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the meetings for building up, the exercise of the gift of tongues should be in turn and at most by two or three; more than this can cause confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Furthermore, there must be an interpreter; otherwise, the one speaking in a tongue should be silent, speaking to himself and to God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>3.</S>

   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But if something is revealed to another sitting by, the first should be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged.</S>

   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In meetings for the exercise of the spiritual gifts, there should at most be three prophets who speak for God, and they must speak in an orderly manner.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They should not allow their spirits to become unruly and unrestrained; otherwise, the meeting will be in confusion, and the saints will not be edified.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>A person who wants to speak for God as an oracle of God should control his spirit since the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>God is not a God of confusion but of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In a confused meeting people cannot be built up by the word of God.</S>

   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is God s rule for the sisters concerning our meeting to speak for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>God does not allow the sisters to minister the Word in the church meetings because sisters should stand in a position of having their heads covered.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>According to God s arrangement, brothers represent the head, and sisters represent the covered head.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Therefore, when the brothers and sisters meet together, the brothers who represent the head should exercise the headship to speak, and the sisters who represent the covered head should cover their heads and not minister the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>However, this does not mean sisters cannot preach the word in other situations.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Sisters can preach the word at home, to children, and to women.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>However, in the meetings of the church, which are meetings with the brothers and the sisters, there are brothers who represent the head, so the sisters should keep the position of a covered head.</S>

   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The goal of meeting to exercise spiritual gifts is the building up, so everything must be done becomingly and in order.</S>
