   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EVERY LIFE HAVING A LAW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every kind of life has a law.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A law denotes a natural power with a certain tendency and activity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, we breathe because we are alive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As long as we have life, the law of this life causes us to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may use digestion as another example.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After we eat a meal, there is no need for us to try to digest our food.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Digestion is a matter of law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever we eat, the law of our physical life functions to digest the food.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The same is true of animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Birds fly because it is the law of the life of a bird to fly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A bird is not taught to fly; it is born with the life to fly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, it is natural for a bird to fly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You may frustrate the function of this law by putting a bird in a cage.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But once the door of the cage is open, the bird will fly away.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the contrary, a cat can never fly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No matter how much you command a cat to fly, even threatening to punish it, it will still not be able to fly because it does not have a life with a law of flying.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, because a cat has a mouse-catching life, it naturally chases mice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Dogs bark because they have a barking life with a barking law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no need to teach a dog to bark; a dog barks naturally and spontaneously because its life is filled with the tendency and activity of barking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Turning from animal life to plant life, we may take fruit trees as another illustration of the fact that every life has a law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am not very good at distinguishing one kind of fruit tree from another.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, it is easy to discern a tree by its fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>An apple tree will, of course, bear apples, and an orange tree will bear oranges.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What nonsense it would be to command the apple tree to bear oranges and the orange tree to bear apples!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No one would ever be foolish enough to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>An orange tree bears oranges, and an apple tree bears apples.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>An orange tree has the life of an orange tree, in which there is the law that functions in the bearing of oranges.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In like manner, there is no need to teach a carnation to bear carnation blossoms instead of cherry blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In fact, there is no need even to teach it to blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If someone tried to teach a carnation to blossom and a carnation could speak, it would say, Don t waste your time teaching me to blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Simply leave me alone and let me grow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, I will blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Blossoming comes from the law of the carnation life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All these examples show that every life has a law.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THREE LIVES AND THREE LAWS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we Christians have three lives, we also have three laws.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have the human life, which is good.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With this good life we have the law of good.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because of this law, everyone naturally desires to do good; there is no need for anyone to be taught.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We were born with the desire to do good, and every child has a human life with its law of good.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, as we have seen, man has not only the human life, but also the satanic life with its law of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because of this satanic life in man, a child tells lies spontaneously, without being taught.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In fact, Christian parents always teach their children not to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I taught my children not to lie, but they lied anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, I instructed my children not to play with the water that was used for washing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One day I came in and found one of the children playing with the water.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Immediately he put his hands behind his back.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead of rebuking him or punishing him, I said to myself, This is fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What good does it do to rebuke him?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You may command a bush not to produce thorns, but it will bear thorns nonetheless.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the law of the life of a thorn bush.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In like manner, children lie without being taught to lie because the life of Satan with its law of lying is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When they tell lies, children are simply living according to this law of lying.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We may need to be taught how to read but not how to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In principle, for fallen people to lie is the same as for cats to chase mice.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Both are the activity of the law of the life that is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now we can understand why we do the opposite when we will to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have two lives in us, the human life and the satanic life, and each life has its law.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But the law of the satanic life is stronger than the law of the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Praise the Lord that we also have the divine life!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Of the three lives in us, the divine life is the strongest, and the human life is the weakest.</S>
