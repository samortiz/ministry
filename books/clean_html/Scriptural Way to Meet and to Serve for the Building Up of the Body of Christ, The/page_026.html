<h2 class="head1">ABLE TO DEVELOP THE ORGANIC ABILITY<br />
AND FUNCTION OF THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST<br />
AND ABLE TO BUILD UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The scriptural way to meet and to serve is able to develop the organic function and ability of the members of Christ and is able to build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12, 16). Ephesians 4:12 tells us that the gifted persons do their work to perfect the saints that the saints may carry out the work of the ministry for the building up of the Body of Christ. Verse 16 follows to tell us in detail how the perfected saints build up the Body directly. The Body is built up directly &ldquo;through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part.&rdquo; Every joint of the supply refers to the specially gifted persons, and each one part refers to every member of the Body. After we are perfected by the gifted persons, we have to function. One who is a joint, a gifted person, has to render the supply to the Body. Furthermore, as long as you are one part among the many parts of the Body of Christ, you also have a measure of ability, a measure of function. If we all do our duty to function in the Body, there will be an operation in measure of each one part. This operation will cause the growth of the Body for its building up.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:12 and 16 can only be realized and accomplished in the proper meetings. As one part of the Body, how could you have your measure operating to render something to the Body of Christ? It is in the proper meeting that we all can render our portion of Christ. When everyone renders his portion, there will be a rich building up. By this way the saints, one by one, will be built up to grow in life. Regardless of how good a message is given by the speaker in the old way of meeting, there cannot be much growth in life for building up. The old way of meeting does not work in the way to render some particular help in life to each one part of the Body for its building up.</p>
<p>When we meet according to the biblical way, everyone functions. This way of everyone functioning renders the supply in a particular way to each member. By this way each individual believer will grow in life. As long as each part grows in life, this will cause the Body to grow for its building up. Actually, the growth of the Body is the totality of the growth in life of all the members. You have a little bit of growth. I have a little bit of growth. We all have some amount of growth. When we add all this growth together, that is the growth of the Body. Through this growth, the Body is built directly by itself in love. There is no other way to carry out such a building. Ephesians 4:16 can only be fulfilled by the proper meeting according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. We all have to endeavor to reach Ephesians 4:16 by the proper meeting, so we all have to endeavor to drop the old way and to practice the new way.</p>
