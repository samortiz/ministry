	 <h2 class="head2">Fellowshipping, Not Ordering</h2>
<p>The Bible speaks of fellowshipping, not of ordering. The elders should communicate in the way of fellowship, instead of taking a superior position to speak to a saint who is serving as a deacon. An elder should be willing to be lower than the deacon. First Corinthians 12:28 speaks of helps and administrations. No one can deny that those who help are the deacons and those who administrate are the elders. In this verse Paul places the deacons before the elders. If the elders are higher than the deacons, why did Paul put the deacons before the elders? Paul purposely arranged the order in this verse. He says, &ldquo;God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers,&rdquo; and then he mentions helps and administrations. Therefore, based on the divine revelation in the Bible, we cannot have levels. Without levels everything can still be accomplished. This is coordination.</p>
<p>It is the elders&rsquo; responsibility to determine how the meetings should be conducted, but this decision should not be made only by the elders. They should fellowship with the saints and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading. In principle it is the elders who make decisions concerning matters, and their decisions should be carried out through fellowship. For example, the elders should inform the brothers responsible for cleaning which facility will be used for a certain meeting and ask the brothers to take care of the cleaning. The elders should also inform the saints responsible for set-up and for ushering. This should all be done in fellowship and not by giving orders. Then everyone can carry out his portion side by side.</p>
<p>If we do not function in this way, we cannot explain Matthew 20. There it says that those who want to be great should be servants, and whoever wants to be first shall be a slave (vv. 26-27). Therefore, we should not be according to the order in 1 Timothy 3, where the elders are mentioned first, before the deacons. We should not think that the elders are higher and that the deacons are lower. Otherwise, we will not be able to explain Matthew 20. This is the answer we have found after many years of studying the Bible, consulting other books, and passing through painful experiences. We cannot have levels or ranks, but with regard to responsibilities, there should be distinction. Everyone functions according to his portion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EACH MEMBER OF THE BODY FUNCTIONING ACCORDING TO HIS PORTION</h2>
<p>The Epistles speak of each member of the Body functioning according to his portion. Each member of the Body has a place and a function (1 Cor. 12:18). Hence, we should remove the concept of rank, which we received from society. An elder should not feel that he is higher than others, nor should a deacon feel that he is lower than others. An elder makes decisions concerning certain matters and asks the deacons to cooperate, but an elder does not ask in the way of a boss giving orders to his subordinate. Those who clean the hall are not subordinates listening to the command of their boss. They are serving the Lord in coordination with the church.</p>
<p>In this way we can keep the word in Matthew 20:26-27, which says, &ldquo;Whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave.&rdquo; We are brothers one of another; no one can be a master over others. This also corresponds to Peter&rsquo;s word. He says, &ldquo;Elders...shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God;...nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock&rdquo; (1 Pet. 5:2-3). This also corresponds to what Paul said in Acts 20:28, &ldquo;Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we do not keep this in mind, whenever we think of administration, we will be haughty, as if we were a general manager ruling over a company. In other words, the thought in the Bible is absolutely not according to the way of society. The Bible says that the church is Christ&rsquo;s Body (Eph. 1:22-23). In the Body no member can come forth to rule over other members. Instead, the many members in the Body are coordinated, and each member operates according to its measure and function. According to 1 Corinthians, even the head is a member (12:21). This does not refer to Christ as the Head of the Body, because Christ is the unique Head. No member in the Body rules over other members; rather, every member keeps his position and exercises his function.</p>
<p>Therefore, this abnormal way of doing things among us must change. Instead of forming a special class of people, we are to serve the saints by giving messages and teaching them. If we are a special class, we are in degradation and have become a degraded religion. There is no special class in the church. Paul says, &ldquo;In nothing am I inferior to the super-apostles, even though I am nothing&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:11). However, he also says, &ldquo;To me, less than the least of all saints&rdquo; (Eph. 3:8). This is the kind of heart and attitude that we should have. The elders should never have the concept that is in society and think that they are the first, the elders, the &ldquo;president.&rdquo; Such a concept must be completely removed. Likewise, other saints should not think that they are nobody in the church, since they are neither elders nor deacons. In the church each of us must function according to our portion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NO MANPOWER AND NO RESOURCES BEING WASTED</h2>
<p>Since we are not able to make arrangements for every saint, we have listed the various categories in the work, such as the small groups, the gospel in the homes, in the schools, and in the community, and the children&rsquo;s work. Our hope is that every saint would participate in one category. Nevertheless, every saint should participate in promoting and strengthening the small groups, and every family should participate in the gospel in the homes. Although we are not elders or deacons, we should still participate. The concept of levels or rank must be removed. Every saint should function according to his portion and do what he can to the best of his ability in his place. No one can limit others, rule over others, or restrict others.</p>
<p>In this way, no manpower and no resources will be wasted, and we will not hinder the Lord&rsquo;s business or waste His time. May the Lord have mercy on us. We hope that all the brothers and sisters will have the heart to enter into such a burden.</p>
