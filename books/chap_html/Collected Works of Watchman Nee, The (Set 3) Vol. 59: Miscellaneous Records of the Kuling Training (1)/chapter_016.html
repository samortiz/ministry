<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: June 23, 1948<br />Place: Kuling Mountain</h1><p>In the past few days we touched on the matter of authority. Today we will "hit home" on this subject: God's authority in the church. Two falls occurred in this universe, and both have great repercussions. First, there was the fall of the angels; second, there was the fall of man. In both cases God's authority was overthrown. Although both the angels and man fell, God did not withdraw His authority in the universe. God can withdraw His presence, but He will never withdraw His authority. He does not compromise His authority with anything. Where His authority is, there His presence is. When He withdraws His authority, He withdraws His presence as well. The fall of the angels did not cause Him to turn away; He did not give up His creation as a result of the angels' fall. Nor did man's fall turn Him away. He did not give up the man whom He created. He is still in control of this world, and He is still upholding the system of authority through government, family, and other human relationships. Of course, none of the authorities within these relationships can be compared with the authority in the church. God asserts Himself through asserting His authority. Where authority is, God's presence can be found. In fact, the best way to prove God's existence or presence is through the demonstration of His authority.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE PLACE<br />WHERE GOD'S AUTHORITY IS MAINTAINED</h2><p>I would like the brothers and sisters to know one thing: Even though God has not withdrawn His authority, and even though His authority is still felt throughout the world and the universe, man daily trespasses against this authority. Every day we find lawlessness operating on earth. Every day man is under rebellion, plotting against God's authority. In addition, fallen angels, evil spirits, and Satan himself offend God's authority daily. Such a situation cannot go on forever; God's authority cannot be challenged forever. According to His desire, plan, and work, God will establish a kingdom on earth. Within the realm of this kingdom, His authority will rule. Every person within this realm will submit to His authority; no one will trespass it. This realm defines the kingdom of the heavens, that is, the kingdom of God, which is the church. God intends to bring order into the chaotic world and chaotic universe. Within the realm of the church, there should be submission everywhere; everything should be under God's almighty rule and should be joined to the heavens. This is the church. This is the kingdom of the heavens, and it is here that God establishes His kingdom. How great the responsibility of the church is! In the midst of chaos and rebellion, God is upholding His authority. If the church joins in this rebellion, God will have no way to go on.</p><p>In the past few days we have seen Israel's rebellion. We have seen how the children of Israel rebelled against Moses and Aaron. By the time of Judges, the people of Israel were in a state of total collapse and confusion. Then God established the kingdom of Israel, asserting His authority through David. Even before David died, however, rebellion had already broken out. After Solomon passed away, the rebellion grew worse. From the time of Rehoboam's idolatry to the dividing of the northern and southern kingdoms, the people were in constant rebellion. This rebellion continued until the time of their captivity. His attempt to establish authority among the Israelites failed. Four hundred years later, starting with John the Baptist, the kingdom of the heavens was preached, and those who were violent took it by force. The prophecies of the prophets and the law ended with John (Matt. 11:12-13). First God sent Elijah, and then He sent His own Son to be a model of obedience to His people. After this God began to build up the church. The church should continue the line of obedience; it should be a vessel of obedience. Yet the church failed; it did not fully obey God's authority nor fully submit to His direct will. God has yet to recover His authority on earth.</p><p>In spite of this, God's will must go on; it must go on until it reaches perfection as recorded in Ephesians 4 and 5. The Lord has to do great things in the church in the end times. Otherwise, a glorious church will not be ready for God. A man has to touch God's authority. He must not fight against any authority, and he must not have a spirit of rebellion. This is the way to serve God according to the divine principle. Unless one serves this way, his work, preaching, and service will be worthless because he will be operating according to Satan's principle. This matter is too crucial. Perhaps some among us will not be able to take this word. Today I am only touching the subject briefly. What is the kingdom, and what is the church? The church as the kingdom is a group of people who uphold God's authority on earth. God's authority is established in the church. The church is the firstfruit. If the church rebels against God's authority, His authority will never be established. Let me give an illustration. When General Chiang Kai-shek had the thought of unifying China, he first established the Whampoa Military Academy. Through it he trained an army and unified the country. What would have happened if the academy had turned against him before he was able to complete the unification? The unification plan would have collapsed. God's will begins with the church. Through the church He establishes His authority. According to God's plan, His authority is established directly and indirectly through the church. One day the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdom of our Lord and our Christ. If the church rebels and fails to be a testimony of obedience, God's plan will be totally frustrated.</p>
