This is very mysterious, but it is definitely revealed in the Bible. Christ, the person, and His death and resurrection are one entity. This is logical, but it is not easy to understand. Why is it that Christ's resurrection and His death are one with Himself?</P><P>If we had only Christ without His death and resurrection, we would have a Christ without a way of application. Christ's riches, Christ's contents, are altogether wrapped up with His death and resurrection. We saw in the previous message that Christ, His death, and His resurrection are compounded together in the Spirit. This compounding makes Christ, His death, and His resurrection one entity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REAL HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE</H2><P>In order to see the great importance of the compound Spirit and of its application, we need to see the major items in the history of the universe. In the universe, first there was God, the Triune God. Even in eternity past, God was triune. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist eternally. The Bible shows us that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God and that They are eternally coexistent.</P><P>The eternal Triune God created the universe, but the universe was altogether outside of God. God still remained by Himself in His divinity. God and the universe were fully separated. God was in the universe, but God stood alone, by Himself, leaving His universe also alone by itself.</P><P>Then God created man. Man was made in God's image and according to God's form (Gen. 1:26). After creating man, however, God still existed apart from the universe and from man. Even though man was bearing His image and form, God still existed by Himself. God and man were separate. Man lived apart from God, and man was not united with God.</P><P>About four thousand years after the creation of man, God became a man. He was conceived in the womb of a virgin. Conceiving is a mingling, a blending. About two thousand years ago, the unique God, who had been existing for a long time, came into man. That was the incarnation. Incarnation brought divinity into humanity. Through incarnation the Triune God was not only united with man but also blended with man. The issue of this blending is a man in the universe who is the mingling of God with man, and His name is Jesus. Jesus is the complete God and the perfect man. He is God and man mingled together. God, in Christ, is mingled with man.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> </body></html>
