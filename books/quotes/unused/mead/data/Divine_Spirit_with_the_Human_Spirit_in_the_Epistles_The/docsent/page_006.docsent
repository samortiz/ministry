   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FOURFOLD WORK OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ROMANS The Liberating Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the book of Romans, the Spirit of life is doing a fourfold work within us, a work of four aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, the Spirit of life liberates us; that is, He sets us free.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 8:2 says, The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit of life within us today is liberating us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christians speak of identification with the death of Christ according to Romans 6.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then they learn to reckon that they are dead vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>6, 11 , believing that it is by this reckoning that they will be freed from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, this does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our liberation is not in our reckoning; it is in the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we walk in the Spirit of life, we are freed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no need merely to try to identify with the death of Christ or reckon that we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>More than thirty years ago I reckoned in this way very much.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, I found out that this simply does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Liberation is not in identification or in reckoning but in the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, liberation is not in any kind of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not even in the doctrine of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not doctrine or teaching that liberates us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, it is the Spirit of life Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must walk and have our being in the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether or not someone knows this doctrine, as long as he is in the Spirit of life, he is freed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may compare this to electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whether or not someone knows the power of electricity, if he simply touches the electricity, he will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not knowledge that liberates us; it is this Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we need to pray, not that the Lord would liberate us but pray ourselves into the liberation, that is, to pray ourselves into the liberating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Spirit of life liberates us from every kind of bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we are in the Spirit of life, we are released.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Delivering Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, the Spirit of life is the delivering Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be delivered is different from being liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, we are bound, and on the other hand, we are fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because we are bound, we need liberation, but because we are fallen, we need deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be delivered is to be saved from the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In one sense we have been saved already, but in another sense we are still in the process of being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even up to the present time I still need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many times I realize that there is still the element of the fall in my motives, thinking, and feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>My way of thinking, my mentality, still needs to be delivered from the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Also, our physical bodies need deliverance from the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have been saved in our spirit, but we still need to be saved in our soul and in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Romans 5:10 says, We will be saved in His life, having been reconciled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we walk in the Spirit of life, all day even every hour we will have the sense that we are being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In our emotion, in the way we love, and in our conversation there is the element of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Simply consider our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are in the Spirit of life and in the light, we will realize how much deliverance we need concerning our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The element of the fall still remains in our attitude, motives, intention, thinking, loving, hating, decisions, and in many other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although many things may not seem wrong, there still may be the element of the fall in them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are in the Spirit of life, we will have a deep conviction that in all these matters we need more and more deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not simply a matter of being set free from besetting sins, such as a bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even within our good temper there is still the element of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We all need to be delivered from our good temper.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We truly need deliverance!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to be delivered out of our temper, disposition, way of thinking, way of loving, way of hating, and many items.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Throughout the day, whenever I pray, I spend more time to confess to the Lord than to ask the Lord to do something for me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever I am in the Spirit of life, there is an ever-deepening conviction within me that I need deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Spirit of life liberates and delivers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Sanctifying Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Third, as the Spirit liberates and delivers, He also sanctifies.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the book of Romans to be sanctified means to be saturated through transformation with all that God is 6:19, 22; 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Originally we were worldly; we were common without anything of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, now God has come into us, and our whole being is being permeated and saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this way we are becoming holy; that is, we are sanctified by being saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the correct meaning of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Spirit of life not only liberates us from bondage and delivers us from the fall but also saturates us with God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Certain Christian teachers have taught that to be sanctified is to be set free from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is not the proper meaning of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In Romans, sanctification is to be saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Thus, sanctification equals transformation in 12:2, which says, Be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To be sanctified is to be transformed by being saturated with God s divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A cup of plain water may be clean, but it is colorless.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, if I permeate the water with orange juice, it becomes orange.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is an illustration of the proper meaning of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even if we are clean and pure, we are still not holy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To be clean and pure is one thing, but to be holy is another.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To be holy is to be sanctified, to be saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Glorifying Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Eventually the Spirit of life will glorify us 8:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>On the negative side, the Spirit of life within us sets us free and delivers us, and on the positive side, He glorifies us through sanctification and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Eventually He will saturate us with and bring us into the glory of God, not in an objective way but in a very subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We may illustrate glorification with electric lights.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>All the lights in our meeting room are glorified with electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We may say that they are saturated with electricity until they shine in the glory of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>One day the Spirit of life will saturate us with the glory of God to the extent that we will be glorified in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Spirit of life liberates, delivers, sanctifies, and eventually glorifies us.</S>
