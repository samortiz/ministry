   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MERCY REACHING THOSE WHO ARE FALLEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we were not degraded and fallen, we would have no need for God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, in our degraded and fallen condition, we need God s mercy, which reaches us and brings us into a situation in which He is able to favor us with His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the younger son in Luke 15 had not become the prodigal son vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>13-14 but instead had stayed at home and enjoyed all that his father had, he would have been in a situation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, even though he fell into trouble, the father received him and then gave everything he had for the prodigal son to enjoy as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since we are degraded and fallen, our enjoyment of God begins with mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even though Peter experienced many failures, he stood up and enjoyed God on the day of Pentecost because of His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without mercy, perhaps only Adam, in the garden of Eden prior to the fall, could have received grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Peter, who denied the Lord three times, would not have been able to receive grace without God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Grace can reach only the people who have a proper standing before God, not the people who have an improper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Grace can come to fallen man because of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose I have something that I treasure and would like to give it to a brother who has not made any mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My gift to him is not related to mercy; rather, it is a gift of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, if this brother makes a mistake or even offends me, any gift to him would be related to mercy because his status has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My giving him a gift, even though he has lost his proper status, is mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>DAVID BEING BROKEN</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>IN ORDER TO RECEIVE GOD S MERCY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>David was able to build the temple of God through his seed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was not because of David s strength but because of God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God intended that His grace would reach David so that David s seed would build the holy temple.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Prior to his great failure, David was a man who did not know grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He knew how to be pious and strong and how to accomplish things for God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can see this particularly in Psalm 1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>David, however, was short of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There was no way for God s grace to be manifested in him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In his fall David s piousness, strength, and accomplishments were nullified.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, he was broken.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After David fell, his piety, strength, and accomplishments came to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s intention was to give him grace, but God could not bestow grace on him because of his piety, strength, and accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God was willing to grace David in spite of his failure, but this willingness was based on His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God gave David a son who was born of Bath-sheba, the wife he took when he sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Matthew 1:6 says, David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not a nice word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Solomon should have been given to David as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, since David lost the position to receive grace, Solomon became a gift of God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By God s mercy David had a son who was to build the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By God s mercy David obtained the land on which the temple was to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the record in the Bible, David had two serious falls in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first fall was his taking Uriah s wife 2 Sam 11:2-27 , and the second was his numbering Israel 24:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When he took the wife of Uriah, he was condemned by God and repented.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The result of his repentance was that he was given a son who would build the holy temple.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>David also numbered Israel, which offended God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The result of David s dealing with this sin was that he obtained the site for the building of the temple the threshing floor of Araunah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>18-25 who was also called Ornan, 1 Chron 21:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This site was on Mount Moriah 2 Chron 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If David knew God s grace instead of relying on his piousness and strength, God would still have given him Solomon as well as the site for the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That would have been God s grace to David, according to God s doing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It would have been something manifested by God in David, not something that David did.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>David s piousness and strength were a problem to God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They became an adversary and enemy to God s grace, frustrating God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God could not give David grace, because David thought he did not need it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, God had no alternative but to allow the inability of David s piousness and strength to accomplish His intention to be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After his failures, David realized that he needed God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He even fell to such an extent that grace could not reach him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God s mercy was needed in order to bring him to a position where God s grace could reach him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>David had many concepts concerning piousness that are expressed in the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we read the Psalms, we are moved by them and are touched by David s piousness and perfection before God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are also inspired by his strengths and accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the problem we have in reading the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Humanly, David was pious, strong, and capable.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His psalms show that he was exercised to live this way before God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we read the Psalms, we are moved by the sentiment expressed in them, and we likewise want to be pious, resolve to love God, and desire to do something for God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Little do we realize that these sentiments prevent us from receiving grace.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>David s fall was the result of his own actions; however, God was willing to let him fail in order that he would know God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If God had not loosed His hand, David would not have fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, David fell, but God allowed him to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In his fall, David lost confidence in everything other than God, including confidence in his piousness and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He saw that his piety and strength were worth nothing before God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then he learned to receive both God s mercy and His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This does not mean that we should seek to fall in order to receive grace Rom 6:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Rather, it means that sooner or later God will bring us to the point where all that we have is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>One day our ability to give messages, our wisdom in administrating the church, our methods in the work, and everything else will be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I am afraid that our zeal, faith, love, power, patience, and purity do not have much grace in them; they are mostly of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God allows this and tolerates it, just as He did with David.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God allowed David to live a life of piety for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, David s piety was not necessarily the issue of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It was out of his own strength and his self.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It was not until David fell that something changed.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>His later psalms show that he became a different person.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>David became a person who knew grace.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Psalm 51 shows that David touched grace.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Before his fall, his living reflected his piousness, strength, and his desire to accomplish things for God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He said that he had clean hands and a pure heart before God, that he walked in his integrity, that he trusted God, and that he would not waver 24:4; 26:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The psalms written by David have many expressions of this kind.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>David often said that he was upright and that he wanted to accomplish things for God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>After David fell, he wrote Psalm 51.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This psalm is different.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In it David said, Create in me a clean heart, O God, / And renew a steadfast spirit within me...</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>/ Do good in Your good pleasure unto Zion vv.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>10, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Verse 16 says, You do not delight in sacrifice; / Otherwise I would offer it.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>These words are different from David s usual expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Before his fall David spoke of the sacrifices he would offer to God, but after his fall he realized that God did not delight in sacrifices or burnt offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He understood that the sacrifice God wanted was a broken spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He said, A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise v. 17 . He also asked God to do good in His good pleasure unto Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>David was asking God to have mercy on Zion and to build the walls of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Verse 19 says, Then You will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, / In burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>First David said that God does not delight in sacrifices, because they had become mere human activities.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Then he said that God will delight in sacrifices that are according to God and that are the result of God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Sooner or later we will be brought by God to the point where we know what mercy is and what grace is.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Only the pathway of faith can keep us; if we do not live in faith, none of our good situations will last.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We must declare that only in God s mercy can anything last.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The Lord has a way to break all our piousness, strength, and accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Lord has a way to break every one of His followers.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The Lord will break all of our strong points.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If we are strong in our will, the Lord will break it, and if we are particularly good in being patient, the Lord will break it too.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we are capable in administrating the church or in giving messages, sooner or later they will be broken by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Even our moral virtues will be broken by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>All the breaking is for us to learn what mercy is and what grace is.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We need to see that our morality, endurance, strong will, ability, and knowledge of how to administrate the church or how to give messages do not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We have these things because of the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>However, we often do not recognize or acknowledge God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Therefore, God will allow us to fall into a pitiful state so that mercy can bring us to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Then even though we are still the ones living and serving, our eloquence will be God, our morality will be God, and our strength will also be God.</S>
