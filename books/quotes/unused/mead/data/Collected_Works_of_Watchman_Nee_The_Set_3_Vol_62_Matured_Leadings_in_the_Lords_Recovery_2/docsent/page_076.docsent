   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us consider this matter from our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man's spirit is very unique.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Bible man's spirit is neutral.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Its characteristics take on that of the outer man, that is, the characteristics of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The spirit itself transcends good and bad, right and wrong, yes and no, and good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The spirit is the new capacity that God gives to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is special in the sense that it bears no characteristics of its own.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It takes its characteristics from other things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the self life is added to the spirit, the spirit manifests a certain characteristic.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In one sense it does not have any characteristics of its own, but in another sense it does have its characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Its characteristics are the characteristics of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We judge the characteristics of the spirit by the characteristics of the things that are attached to it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, water is colorless; it is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if we add colored sugar to it, it will have a certain color and taste.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The same can be said about our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is pure in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the kind of person we are produces the kind of characteristics our spirit carries.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times the brothers and sisters are right in their words and conduct, but their spirit is wrong because their very person is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 3 says that our spirit needs to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 4 follows by saying that we have to worship God with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A wrong spirit cannot serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>D. L. Moody was a shoemaker's apprentice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was an inexperienced and uneducated person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His sermons were patched together from what he heard here and there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He took note of these things and made them the content of his sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once, in a gospel meeting, about five to six hundred people stood up to accept the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A middle-aged lady came to him later and criticized him for saying the wrong thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Moody heard this, he said to her with tears in his eyes, "You know me the best.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You should pray for me."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She only knew how to criticize.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While her words to Moody were right, her spirit was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moody was the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His words might have been wrong, but his spirit was right.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time Moody was at the height of his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His humility was an outflow of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some people are humble, but they are still soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moody was a person who was always ready to deal with his soul and purify his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the reason God greatly used him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Shanghai there was a brother by the name of Lee who did something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Another brother by the name of Chow learned about it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was sad and sorrowful and prayed desperately for Lee with fasting and tears for a whole week.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Afterwards, he went to Lee to exhort him, intending to recover him with love, tears, and a meek spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He persuaded Lee to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Lee was convinced and repented, but it was only an outward repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Within he was still not subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After two years Chow committed a mistake similar to Lee's. When Lee found out, he wrote a letter to Chow immediately with only three words in it: "What about now?" If a man has the right spirit, he has tears, and he can rebuke others and recover them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But here was a person who could only exhort others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although he only said three words, his spirit was wrong; it was an evil spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After Chow received Lee's three-word letter, he replied immediately, saying, "From this experience I have learned that man is weak and prone to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without the Lord's mercy and grace, no one can stand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, we have to fear God."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here we see a right spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A right spirit is something that God gives us; we do not have it in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When God gives us a word, we will not be self-assuming or proud.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we accept and obey such a word, we acquire a right spirit on that point.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I hope we will learn to open up our spirit to receive the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If there is any mixture of our soul-life, our spirit will be defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Saint Jials ? was a simple man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was a cook in a monastery in northern Italy in the Middle Ages.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He was not educated and did not have much Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But he loved knowledge and was very fond of learning.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He requested of the abbot that he be allowed to listen in on the sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The abbot did not grant him his wish and told him to be satisfied with being a cook.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One year later there was a special conference.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He requested of the abbot again but was turned down again.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Later, he prayed to the Lord that he be allowed to attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He came up with an idea.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He had been baking bread and preparing food on a daily basis.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He gathered the food he would need for two months, such as potatoes and ducks; then he cooked them ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When the mealtime came, he took the cooked food and warmed it up in a big pan.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The monastery had never tasted food with such a strange taste.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When the abbot heard about this, he rebuked the cook.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That night Saint Jials could not sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord shone on him, and he realized that every circumstance is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He saw his mistake, and he repented.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He knew that the abbot had lost his voice, and he felt sorry for him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He prepared a bowl of porridge with sugar, took it to the abbot, and said to him, "I was wrong with the food.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Please forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You have lost your voice.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I have prepared this porridge for you."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The abbot was greatly touched by Saint Jials's word.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He touched the spirit of self-denial in Saint Jials.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>That was the greatest supply the abbot had received in his whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Humanly speaking, when Saint Jials was rebuked, he could have resented it, but he did not have such a feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Instead, he felt for the abbot's pain and loss of voice.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He volunteered to prepare food for him in the middle of the night.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is a clean spirit before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Its quality is very high.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Before the Lord, we must not only ask if we have a spirit but must pay attention to the quality of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>From church history we find many brothers and sisters who had an excellent spirit, something that no ordinary men and women possess.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we learn our lessons thoroughly, and if we fellowship with God often enough, it will be easy for us to have a right spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But if we have not lived before the Lord all the time, our words will convey a defiled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The quality of every person's spirit is very much related to his cumulative experience before the Lord during ordinary times.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Here I would like to say a word to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In dealing with the young people, we should not ask whether or not they are smart.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Human intelligence is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>You do not have to deal with their gifts and functions either.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>All you need to do is consider if their spirit is clean.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When disputes arise among the brothers and sisters, the issue is not who opens his mouth first or what the terms of settlement are, nor is it a matter of the rightness of words or conduct, but a consideration of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If you try to base your judgment on man's word, you will find it hard to determine if it is accurate or exaggerated.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If you base your judgment on his conduct, you will find that the standard of right and wrong differs in different people.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The law courts in the world are concerned with facts and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>However, our emphasis is not on words and conduct but on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In dealing with the young people, we have to see if they have a strong spirit and what kind of spirit they have.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Sometimes they have a strong spirit, but such a spirit is also a defiled spirit, a coarse spirit, and an arrogant spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we would pay attention to man's spirit more than to his words and conduct.</S>
