[4]  Thank the Lord that since the publication of this book in the fall of 1928, believers from various places have put in orders for it.
[5]  I give thanks with all my heart to the Lord whom I serve, for He has given me the privilege to write this book.
[6]  Recently, due to the special experience which my physical body has undergone, I have come to realize, on the one hand, the reality of eternity, and on the other hand, my indebtedness to the church of God.
[7]  I thank God the Father, and I also thank a few of my friends in the Lord, who have prepared a quiet place for me according to the need of my body.
[8]  Here, it would be well if we remember God's way of redemption.
[9]  God's goal is to deliver us, through the new life which He gives to us at the time of our regeneration, from 1 sin, 2 natural things our nature , and 3 supernatural things the sinful aspects .
[10]  This book is not only written for ordinary believers, but for those in the Lord's work who are younger than I am.
[11]  Those who are responsible for leading others in their spiritual pursuits should be clear what we are leading others out of and what we are leading them into.
[12]  When I wrote this book, I did not try to group the same kind of truths in the same place.
[13]  I have mentioned one thing in my preface, which, due to its extreme importance, I would like to mention again here.
[14]  I have a few words to say particularly about the last section.
[15]  It seems that I am not worthy to write it because of the weakness of my body.
[16]  Genesis 2:7 says, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."
[17]  In the beginning, God created the figure of a man with the dust of the earth and then breathed into his nostrils "the breath of life."
[18]  Man's spirit is the noblest part of man; it dwells in man's innermost part.
[19]  The apostle said in 1 Corinthians 3:16, "Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?"
[20]  CHAPTER TWO THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL THE SPIRIT
[21]  Further on, we will see that all communications between God and man lie within this spirit.
[22]  If a believer does not know what his spirit is, he will not know how to fellowship with God in the spirit and will substitute the work of the spirit with soulish activities such as that of the mind and the emotion.
[23]  The spirit contains the function of the conscience, although this does not mean that the spirit is the conscience.
[24]  From these verses we see that the spirit includes at least three parts the conscience, the intuition, and the fellowship.
[25]  Although an unregenerated person has not received life, he still has his conscience, intuition, and fellowship.
[26]  In addition to the spirit, the organ with which he communicates with God, man also has a soul.
[27]  The soul also includes the intellect or the mind:
[28]  Some who have studied the Bible have pointed out that there are three words for life in Greek: 1 bios, 2 psuche, and 3 zoe.
[29]  Now that we have seen the soul as our personality, our organ of deliberation, and our life, we can conclude that this soul is the true "I"; it is the self.
[30]  After observing the way God commanded man in Genesis 2 concerning what to eat and what not to eat, we can see that the man God created is not a dead machine under God's manipulation.
[31]  The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the fruit that uplifts man's soul and dampens man's spirit.
[32]  The knowledge of good and evil constitutes the work of the soul in this world.
[33]  God forbade man to eat of this fruit, not only for the purpose of testing man, but because He knew that within man was the spiritual life and the soulish life, and that if man were to eat of this fruit, his soulish life would develop, and his spiritual life would die.
[34]  The work of the enemy begins with the need of the body.
[35]  Satan gained Adam's will through his emotion, and caused him to sin.
[36]  When man's will, mind, and emotion were poisoned by the serpent to follow Satan and to rebel against God, the spirit with which man communicates with God received a fatal blow.
[37]  Adam existed by the breath of life, which is the spirit.
[38]  The spirit has God-consciousness; it knows God's voice, fellowships with God, and has a very keen knowledge of God.
[39]  Although this spirit is dead to God, it still works as actively as the mind and the body.
[40]  It is indeed dead to God, but it is still active in other areas.
[41]  Sometimes a fallen one can have a spirit that is stronger than his soul or his body and that can still rule over his whole being.
[42]  Even in matters of religion and in the most zealous pursuit of God, man exercises the power of his soul and decides on his own to seek after God and to please God apart from the revelation of the Holy Spirit.
[43]  Even when a man is soulish, many times he still realizes the uncertainties of this life and seeks for eternal life in the coming age.
[44]  However, man can never find the truth of life through his mind or by theories.
[45]  CHAPTER FOUR THE WAY OF SALVATION THE JUDGMENT AT GOLGOTHA
[46]  This death, which is a spiritual death, a death which separates man from God, came through sin.
[47]  Because human nature must suffer judgment, God's Son, the man Jesus Christ, bore on the cross in His spirit, soul, and body the punishment mankind deserved.
[48]  No one can actually comprehend how His soul suffered on the cross.
[49]  Often we only consider the suffering in His body and neglect the feeling of His soul.
[50]  "And He who sent Me is with Me" v. 29 . Therefore, He was able to pray, "Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. And I knew that You always hear Me" 11:41-42 . However, while He was on the cross if ever there was a day He needed God's presence, it had to be that day probably no other day exceeded that day He cried, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" Matt 27:46 . His spirit was actually separated from God.
[51]  Since death means to be separated from life, and God is life, then to be dead is to be separated from God.
[52]  Therefore, in the Bible we see that only spirit can serve Spirit Rom 1:9; 7:6; 12:11 , only spirit can know Spirit 1 Cor 2:9-12 , only spirit can worship God who is Spirit John 4:23-24; Phil 3:3 , and only spirit can receive revelation from God who is Spirit Rev 1:10; 1 Cor 2:10 .
[53]  How can man obtain this regeneration of the spirit?
[54]  The sinner spirit, soul, and body with all his sins, has been completely judged in the Lord Jesus on the cross.
[55]  We must avoid the thought that man ought to have the experience of dying and resurrecting with the Lord before he can be born again.
[56]  According to the Bible, once a person believes in the Lord Jesus, he is born again.
[57]  There is another point we ought to pay attention to.
[58]  That is, regeneration not only restores us to the condition of Adam before his fall, but it also affords us something additional.
[59]  As the angels were called sons of God, Adam was also called a son of God Luke 3:38 , because he was created directly by God.
[60]  The Lord Jesus has said that every unregenerated man, born but once of man, is flesh and is in the realm of the flesh.
[61]  During the time of unregeneration, men live in the lusts of their flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and are by nature children of wrath Eph 2:3 for "it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God" Rom 9:8 .
[62]  But since at this time man is dead unto God Eph 2:1 , being dead in his offenses and in the uncircumcision of his flesh Col 2:13 , he is not in the least conscious of his being in sin and is perhaps still proud of himself, thinking that he is still better than others.
[63]  Romans 8:3 says, "For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh...."
[64]  God's salvation, which saves people from the deserved punishment of the flesh and the power of the flesh, was accomplished in the cross of His Son.
[65]  Therefore, when a man believes that the Lord Jesus died for him and receives the Lord Jesus to be his personal Savior, God gives him a new life, that is, His own uncreated life.
[66]  After a believer has been regenerated, it is most important for him to know how much he has received from his regeneration and how much is left of his natural endowment.
[67]  If a believer understands the full salvation of the cross, then at the time of his regeneration that is, when he receives Jesus as his Savior , he can, on the one hand, be completely delivered from sin and, on the other hand, receive a new life.
[68]  When young believers discover such an inward conflict, they are really baffled.
[69]  Every believer can, like Paul, be filled with the Holy Spirit at the time he believes and is baptized Acts 9:17-18 .
[70]  However, many believers do not truly believe as an accomplished fact that Christ has died and been resurrected for them, nor do they sincerely apply in practice the principle of death and resurrection which they are called by the Holy Spirit to obey.
[71]  Hence, they still remain subject to the control of the flesh, just like those who have not died and been resurrected, although in fact, they have died and been resurrected according to what has been accomplished by Christ, and they should die to themselves and live to God according to their duty as disciples.
[72]  The time required for a believer to progress from the state of being fleshly to the state of being spiritual is not so long as some imagine today.
[73]  Although not many years had passed since the Corinthian believers had become Christians, the apostle already considered them to have been babes for too long, to have been of the flesh for too long.
[74]  As regenerated believers we should yearn for a completely spiritual life, and in everything we should let the Holy Spirit be the Lord and Master so that He may in the least possible time lead us into what God has prepared for us.
[75]  One reason is that those who watch over the believers only pay attention to the grace of God and the position of the believers in Christ without encouraging them to pursue spiritual experience, or these overseers, not knowing the life in the Holy Spirit, are unable to lead those whom they watch over into a more abundant life.
[76]  The second characteristic of a fleshly person is the inability to receive spiritual teachings.
[77]  "Brothers...I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it.
[78]  A believer should allow the Holy Spirit to search his heart so that he may be enlightened by God to know what things are forbidden by the law of the Holy Spirit and the law of nature, what things are obstructing him from the exercise of temperance and self-control, and what things are restricting him from serving God freely in the spirit.
[79]  On God's side, we have seen how it is at enmity with God and how it cannot possibly please Him.
[80]  Nevertheless, unless it is revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, neither the believer nor the sinner can know that the flesh is so worthless, so hateful, and so defiled in the eyes of God.
[81]  The more a believer is enlightened by the Holy Spirit, the more will he see the pitiful state of the flesh, and the fiercer will his battles against the flesh be, but all the more frequent and evident will his failures become.
[82]  Whenever he suffers a defeat, the Holy Spirit will further reveal to him the sin and weakness of his flesh and generate in him a deeper sense of self-reproach and a determination to battle against the sin of the flesh.
[83]  If the believer faithfully and sincerely believes the words of God and in all sincerity beseeches the Holy Spirit to reveal to him God's holiness so that he may, in the light of God's holiness, be able to see the true condition of the flesh, the Holy Spirit will certainly do so.
[84]  In this way, he may be spared some of the agonies of the war he has gone through.
[85]  There are many believers you can say the majority of the believers who were not filled by the Holy Spirit when they believed in the Lord.
[86]  If we do not first understand what the death mentioned in this verse is, we will still not be able to receive salvation.
[87]  "For when we were in the flesh, the passions for sins...operated in our members to bear fruit to death.
[88]  The death in which the believer is joined with the Lord has already become a reality in his spirit.
[89]  Now the believer should bring that definite death out of his spirit to deal with all the activities in his members because the lust in his members can operate at any moment.
[90]  If the believer wants to have his whole being conformed to the Lord's death, he must often put to death the deeds of his members so that that which is in the spirit can also reach his body.
[91]  We need to realize that even though we can put to death the flesh and cause it to be annulled original Greek meaning for "destroyed" in Rom 6:6 KJV , it nevertheless still exists.
[92]  In view of this, we know that a person who is a new creation in Christ is not recovered in this life to the position of Adam before his fall, simply because of, not to mention other things, the fact that his body has not been redeemed Rom 8:23 .
[93]  Even a man in the new creation still has a sinful nature and still has the flesh.
[94]  A believer should realize that, on the one hand, he is a new creation in Christ, having the Holy Spirit dwelling in his spirit, having the death of Jesus working in him, and having the sanctifying life, but that, on the other hand, he still has the sinful flesh and can still sense the existence of the flesh and its filthiness.
[95]  However, the believer should not lower God's purpose and his own expectation.
[96]  It is possible for the believer to sin, but he must not sin.
[97]  The Lord Jesus has died for us and has crucified our flesh with Him on the cross, and the Holy Spirit has indwelt us in order to manifest in us the reality of what the Lord Jesus has accomplished.
[98]  CHAPTER FOUR THE BOASTINGS OF THE FLESH THE OTHER ASPECT OF THE FLESH
[99]  The flesh is at enmity with the Holy Spirit not only in the matter of sinning against God but even in the matter of serving God and pleasing God, for it is done out of its own strength, not by being led simply by the Spirit and depending entirely on the grace of God.
[100]  We can find many people around us who are by nature very good, very patient, and very loving.
[101]  What believers hate is sin, and if they could be delivered from it so that they would no longer have the things of the flesh as mentioned in Galatians 5:19-21, then that would be good.
[102]  It has no need to depend on the Holy Spirit, no need to be humble, no need to wait upon God, and no need to pray and beseech God, but only has to decide by itself, think by itself, and perform by itself.
[103]  The goodness of the flesh which centers on the self is always evil in the eyes of God because it is not the work of the Holy Spirit, and it does not issue from the life of the Lord Jesus.
[104]  It is not that we do not proclaim the truth or that we do not confess the person and work of Christ as our only hope or that we do not want to glorify His name, but that, because our confidence is in the flesh, many of our works are dead before God.
[105]  Self-confidence and self-reliance are the nature of the good works of the flesh.
[106]  If the believer is so self-confident as to perfect the work of the Holy Spirit with the strength of his flesh, he not only will not be able to attain a perfect spiritual living but also will always be drifting about.
[107]  But how can the believers see what God sees?
[108]  God hates the flesh and the conduct of the flesh so much, yet, except for the evil acts of the flesh, the believers still are lenient with the flesh and cannot be as absolute as God is.
[109]  Moreover, the believers still do many things in the flesh with self-trust, self-reliance, and self-confidence, considering that they have received God's grace to the full and are able to utilize the flesh to have righteous acts.
[110]  Because of this, the Holy Spirit of God must lead the believers through the most shameful pathway that they may know the flesh and thus have God's view.
[111]  At best, it still has some mixture of corruption; perhaps God often permits the believers to experience Romans 7 so that they will finally be willing to say as Paul said, "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells" v. 18 . How difficult it is to learn to say this word! Unless the believers have gone through many painful failures, they are always self-dependent and always think that they are capable.
[112]  If we read the following verses, we will see how humble he was: "Not having my own righteousness" v. 9 ; "If perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead" v. 11 ; "Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue, if even I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus" v. 12 . If the believers want to attain to the state of being completely spiritual, they must have the thought of not having obtained and not have the slightest self-confidence, self-satisfaction, and self-pleasing, which are the proofs of trusting the flesh.
[113]  Because the flesh is very subtle, the believers must moment by moment have the deeper work of the Holy Spirit through the cross.
[114]  Once the believers see the standing of their own flesh before God, the cross and the deeper work of the Holy Spirit are indispensable.
[115]  Colossians 2:18 speaks about the "mind" of the flesh.
[116]  All the self-confidence that Christians have is actually their trust that they have wisdom and that they know how to serve God and understand the teaching of the Scriptures.
[117]  It is very dangerous for a man to receive the truth of the Bible with his wisdom because this is the most hidden and subtle method which causes the believers to perfect the work of the Holy Spirit by their flesh.
[118]  If we let the Spirit do a deeper work by the cross, then the circumcision which we have received will become more real day by day.
[119]  "For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh" Phil 3:3 .
[120]  When the Lord Jesus went to the cross, He not only brought our sin there, but also brought us, our beings, there.
[121]  Once a believer has the understanding of the truth of co-crucifixion and the experience of being freed from sin, he is in a very dangerous stage.
[122]  If he can have proper guidance at this time and rely on the Holy Spirit to do the deeper work of the cross in him, then he can enter into the state of being completely in the spirit.
[123]  However, if he becomes complacent, thinking that living a life of overcoming sin is the highest living and does not allow the cross to terminate his soul-life, he will remain in the realm of the soul and consider the experience of the soul as the experience of the spirit.
[124]  Therefore, we see in Romans 6:6 that the Holy Spirit calls our body "the body of sin," because before we experience the dealing of the cross, before we yield our members as weapons of righteousness to God, our body is simply "the body of sin."
[125]  After reading these verses, we should know how much God pays attention to our body.
[126]  We have already seen that the soul is our inherent life.
[127]  It is because, even though the cross has worked and dealt with the sinful nature of the believer, the soul-life is still existing!
[128]  Thus, the danger at this time is that he tries to please God with his own power and does not know how to exercise the life of the soul, which is given to him by God and is already in him, to increasingly strengthen the life of the spirit through the Holy Spirit in order to follow the dictates of the new nature.
[129]  These are simply a few examples to illustrate how sin and self differ from one another.
[130]  If we go on further in the spiritual journey, we will know that in many things sin has no way to gain a footing, yet the self somehow can be manifest.
[131]  Since the believer has long been under the bondage of sin, once he is delivered from the power of sin, he considers this to be the highest walk of life, not knowing that once he has been freed from sin, he still has to overcome self daily throughout his entire lifetime.
[132]  If a believer knows only what it is to be delivered from sin but not what it is to "deny the self," to "lose the soul-life," then the danger is that at this time he will use the strength of the self, that is, the soul-life, to accomplish all of God's will in him, to do God's work, and to live out God in his daily living.
[133]  If the believer does not apprehend this or is not willing to obey God in this way, henceforth his living will be serving God merely by the soul-life and the power of the self.
[134]  Therefore, a spiritual Christian is one who lets the Holy Spirit operate in his spirit.
[135]  By appropriating the power of the Holy Spirit, he lives on this earth not seeking his own will but the will of the Lord.
[136]  Such a teaching is extremely important because if the believer were to focus only on the problem of the old man, considering that overcoming all the external, filthy sins is the entirety of a Christian's spiritual walk in life, this would deprive him of the opportunity to advance beyond living in his soul, which God hates as much as He hates sin .
[137]  We do not mean that the experience of a soulish believer is entirely of the soul, though believers of this type are many.
[138]  Because the spirit is surrounded by the soul, as if buried inside the soul, it is often influenced by the stimulus of the mind.
[139]  A regenerated person inherently has an unspeakable peace in his spirit, yet because the spirit and the soul have not been divided, even a slight stimulation will disturb the peace and tranquility of his spirit.
[140]  Such an experience of a mixed spirit and soul indicates that there are two sources within the believer: one is of God, the other is of man; one is of the Holy Spirit, the other is of self; one is intuitive, the other rational; one is spiritual, the other is natural one is of the spirit, the other is of the soul.
[141]  Unless a believer is taught by God Himself and receives the revelation of the Holy Spirit in his spirit, he cannot know how abominable the soul-life is and be willing to live entirely in the spirit.
[142]  A very common mark of soulish believers is talkativeness.
[143]  It is not that they do not know that they should be taciturn, but when they are emotionally excited, they have a great urge to get into endless speaking.
[144]  After soulish believers have learned the doctrine concerning the differentiation between the spirit and the soul, they can easily understand such a teaching with their natural mind.
[145]  Spontaneously they can find many soulish activities in other people's lives and easily understand other's soulish acts and thoughts, but they do not realize that they are as soulish as the ones whom they accuse of being soulish and that they are actually no less soulish than others.
[146]  Soulish believers are not behind others in the matter of works.
[147]  Naturally, in such preaching, one relies on the message more than on the Lord.
[148]  The entire heart of these believers depends on what they preach to move human hearts instead of on the Holy Spirit to reveal to men their need and the Lord's supply to fill up their lack.
[149]  Soulish believers love to learn to use spiritual terminology.
[150]  CHAPTER THREE THE DANGERS OF SOULISH LIVING THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SOUL-LIFE
[151]  We have mentioned before how the soul-life is manifested.
[152]  In conclusion, the work of the soul is to cause the believer to live by his own natural life; to work and to serve God by his own ability and will; to seek to know the Lord, draw close to the Lord, and know the Lord's presence by his feelings; and to use the ability of his mind to understand the Word of God, to calculate, to plan, and to infer.
[153]  If a believer does not receive God's revelation of Himself and thus serves God and does work for God through the ability of his created life, he will cause himself to suffer the greatest spiritual loss, and what he does will lack true spiritual fruit.
[154]  The Holy Spirit will let such a one realize that all his work and life are merely centered on and motivated by his "self," and that he does not allow the Lord to be Lord over all things.
[155]  When believers have not reached or are not willing to reach what God wants them to reach, they are inevitably in danger.
[156]  Since God's goal is for the believers to live in the spirit, not in the soul, neither in the body, if they do not live in the spirit, they will suffer loss.
[157]  Therefore, if a believer only seeks to overcome his sinful nature but does not seek to overcome his natural life, then, even though he might have the experience of temporarily overcoming his sins, it will not be too long before he again falls into the sphere of the body and of sin.
[158]  If a child of God has received grace and experienced deliverance from sins but does not go further and seek to overcome the natural life, and continues to live in his soul-life, he will see that his soul once again joins together with the body, leading him to go backward and causing him to again commit the sin from which he was once delivered.
[159]  The emotion part of the soul-life of a believer is also very likely to be pushed by the enemy into doing his work.
[160]  Because a believer is eager to have a feeling of happiness and anxious to have feelings of the Holy Spirit, of the love of the Lord Jesus, and of the presence of God, the evil spirit lets him have many strange feelings, exciting him in his natural life.
[161]  CHAPTER FOUR THE CROSS AND THE SOUL THE CALLING OF THE CROSS
[162]  In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus at least four times called His disciples to renounce their soul-life, to put it to death, to follow Him.
[163]  The Lord knew that renouncing the soul-life is an absolutely indispensable requirement if man is to follow Him, to attain to perfect status, to be like Him in serving men, and to do the will of God.
[164]  In Matthew 10:38 and 39 the Lord Jesus said, "And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it."
[165]  If this is to be the case, the soul-life must be rejected.
[166]  Such a loss of the soul-life's natural love on the cross enables the soul-life to let the Holy Spirit pour God's love into its heart before God, thus causing all the soul's love to be through God and in God.
[167]  In Matthew 16:24-25 the Lord Jesus also spoke about the relationship of the soul-life and the cross: "Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it." In these verses, our Lord again called His disciples to take up the cross, to be willing to put the soul-life to death so that they might lose their soul-life.
[168]  It is as if he were thinking, "You, Lord, are going to the cross to suffer in such a way, although You are doing the will of God, although You are accomplishing the purpose of God, and although You are acting according to the plan of God.
[169]  Herein we see the utter uselessness of the soul-life.
[170]  At this particular time, Peter's soul-life was aroused not for himself but for the Lord Jesus.
[171]  THE CROSS AND THE SOUL'S LOVE OF THE WORLD
[172]  In Luke 17:32-33 our Lord has a similar word, but what is pointed out there is concerning the things of the world: "Remember Lot's wife.
[173]  In John 12:24-25 the Lord Jesus again talked about the problem of the soul-life: "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.
[174]  He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life."
[175]  Here we must not misunderstand, thinking that we should no longer use our mind and ability.
[176]  This verse of the Bible explains clearly: "He who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life."
[177]  To put the soul to death is not to destroy or give up the function of the different parts of the soul, just as "that the body of sin might be annulled" Rom 6:6 is not to destroy the hands, feet, ears, and eyes of the human body.
[178]  CHAPTER FIVE THE SPIRITUAL BELIEVER AND THE SOUL THE DIVIDING OF THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL
[179]  The reason we have made the effort to speak so much on the distinction between the spirit and the soul and their activities is to bring us to this point.
[180]  What a God-seeking believer should fear the most is the activity of the soul beyond the limitation set up by God.
[181]  Even when one is willing to consecrate himself to God, he still may hold the thought that it is his work now and that he has to complete what he is consecrating in order to please God.
[182]  If we do not reject our self and lose our soul-life, but instead follow its idea, opinion, and suggestion, and if we do not constantly deny its right and unconditionally and unreservedly put it in the ashes, without longing for what we have lost, we cannot expect to have a spiritual life and work that pleases God.
[183]  This natural soul-life of ours is an obstacle to our spirit-life.
[184]  It will never be satisfied with God alone; it always wants to add something other than God.
[185]  When the believer allows his spiritual experiences to be mixed with his soul-life, his experience often becomes unstable so that he is not qualified to be a leading one.
[186]  It is simply that, first, God by His Word and through His indwelling Spirit can differentiate experientially the function and expression of the soul from that of the spirit, teaching the believer to know what is the move of the spirit and what is the move of the soul.
[187]  Likewise, the word of God now works as a sharp sword inside of us through the Holy Spirit to distinguish the spirit from the soul, so that the dwelling place of the most noble God can be completely separated from base feelings, and we may know how much our soul should submit to the One who is above.
[188]  In the past the priests used knives to cut open the sacrifices.
[189]  Today's High Priest employs the word of God to divide the soul from the spirit of the believer.
[190]  As we have said before, the High Priest is working because we have accepted the cross.
[191]  Now we want to talk about how, in practice, the Lord Jesus divides our soul and spirit.
[192]  The believer must ask the Lord to show him the detestableness of a life of the spirit and soul mixed together and must know that in God there is a life that is both higher and deeper, completely of the spirit, and not affected by the soul.
[193]  If the believer is not willing and does not want the dividing of his spirit and soul, but rather prefers to enjoy what he himself sees as good, God will respect the character of man and will never force him.
[194]  He should let the word of God deeply pierce him so that his soul-life can have the cleansing of the word of God, for if the believer truly can walk according to the word of God, his soul-life surely will not be active.
[195]  If the believer daily bears the cross, refuses the self, not being directed by the flesh for one moment, and has the Holy Spirit of God constantly reveal the activities of the soul in his daily living, this is a living of the spirit.
[196]  If a believer faithfully submits himself, the Lord will secretly divide the soul and spirit of the believer so that he can have a pure and spiritual living.
[197]  A SOUL UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[198]  We have mentioned that the spirit, soul, and body in a human being are like the holy temple, which is divided into the Holiest of all and the outer court, and that God lives in the Holiest of all.
[199]  This is the other aspect of the dividing of the spirit and the soul.
[200]  Concerning the aspect of the soul affecting and controlling the spirit, the work of the cross is to divide the soul from the spirit.
[201]  But concerning the aspect of being filled with the Holy Spirit and letting the spirit have the authority, the work of the cross is to cause the soul to no longer be independent but be one with the spirit completely.
[202]  If we will thus let the cross and the Holy Spirit work deeply, we will then see that what the soul has lost is not even one ten thousandth of what it has gained.
[203]  Once we were busy planning; now we quietly trust in the Lord.
[204]  Once we were often grieved and anxious; now we are like a weaned child resting in the bosom of the mother.
[205]  Once we were full of our own ideas, having many desires and ambitions; now we only consider the will of God to be good and thus rest in God.
[206]  This kind of person can only say, together with Mary, "My soul magnifies the Lord" Luke 1:46 .
[207]  Such a one is no longer openly or secretly puffed up and self-exalting, but knows himself to be useless and is willing to humble himself and exalt the Lord.
[208]  Now he no longer wants to steal the Lord's glory and give it to the self soul , but he magnifies the Lord in his soul.
[209]  Even after hearing that there is a spirit within man, they either think that their mind, emotion, or will is the spirit, or they are puzzled and do not know where their spirit is.
[210]  At the time of man's regeneration, his spirit receives God's life and becomes enlivened.
[211]  We must understand the relationship between regeneration and the Holy Spirit's abiding within believers.
[212]  Even if a believer is so foolish that his experience never goes one step beyond the first half of God's promise, and he is not aware that the Holy Spirit of God is a person dwelling in him, it is an unchangeable fact that God has given him the Holy Spirit.
[213]  If he is willing to receive God's promise with faith, considering that God has not only given him a new life in regeneration but also the Holy Spirit, as a person, dwelling in his spirit to be his Lord, then his life will make great strides in the path of God.
[214]  Since we have seen that the Holy Spirit indwells the believers at the time of their regeneration, we should see in more detail where the Holy Spirit dwells so that we can understand His work within us.
[215]  We must remember that the real meaning of regeneration is not an outward change or the soul and the body being stimulated, but it is the spirit receiving life.
[216]  If a believer does not know that the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit is in the deepest part of his whole being, which is deeper than his mind, emotion, and will, he will surely seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit in his mind, emotion, and will.
[217]  If we understand this, then we will know that we were deceived before and were wrong in looking outward, outside the spirit in the soul, or inside or outside the body for guidance.
[218]  In the Chinese Union Version of the Bible, it is difficult for us to tell when the word spirit refers to the Holy Spirit and when it refers to the human spirit.
[219]  The capitalized word Spirit indicates the Holy Spirit and spirit indicates that it is not the Holy Spirit but a spirit besides the Holy Spirit, such as the spirit of man, etc. After reading this, do we not understand? In the original text there is no indication that it refers to the Holy Spirit or human spirit whenever just the word Spirit is used.
[220]  A regenerated believer, with his spirit enlivened and the Holy Spirit indwelling him, can still remain a carnal or fleshly believer, with his spirit still oppressed by his soul or body.
[221]  Briefly, there can be at least two great changes in the life of a human being changing from a perishing sinner into a saved believer and changing from a fleshly believer into a spiritual one.
[222]  The resurrected Lord is the life-giving Spirit 15:45 ; therefore, His union with the believers is His union with the believers' spirit.
[223]  The soul is only the personality of a man and is natural; it should only be used as a vessel to express the results of the union between the Lord and the spirit of the believer.
[224]  The Holy Spirit is inside a believer; but the believer either does not know it or he fails to obey Him.
[225]  The believer must know that God's Holy Spirit, being a person, indwells him to teach, guide, and give the "reality," the truth, in Christ to the believer.
[226]  This work of the Holy Spirit can be done only after the believer acknowledges how ignorant and dull his soul is, and he decides that, even though he is foolish, he is willing to be taught.
[227]  When we know that within us there is a spirit, God's Holiest of all, which is deeper than mind and emotion and is able to fellowship with the Holy Spirit and when we wait for God's Holy Spirit, then we know that He truly indwells us.
[228]  When we consider how the Holy Spirit is God, how He is one of the Triune God, how He is the life of the Father and the Son, and then further consider His honor and how He indwells us, who are fleshly, we will surely fear, honor, and praise Him.
[229]  Therefore, in order for the believer to receive this power of the Holy Spirit, some works must be accomplished on his side.
[230]  He must have a specific surrender; he must get rid of all the dubious things and actions in his life; he must be willing to fully obey the will of God; he must believe that God will pour the power of the Holy Spirit into his spirit; and he must pray for this matter.
[231]  If there is no obstacle on the side of the believer, God will immediately accomplish what he hopes for.
[232]  The believer does not need to wait for the Holy Spirit to come and fill him, because the Holy Spirit has descended long ago.
[233]  If the believer is faithful, obedient, and believing, then in a very short time the power of the Holy Spirit will be poured into his spirit, making him strong and providing the strength to live and work.
[234]  We have already seen how a soulish believer becomes a spiritual believer.
[235]  This kind of walking according to the spirit requires dependence and faith.
[236]  We have already seen that all of the good behavior of the flesh is independent of God, rather than dependent on God.
[237]  If he wants God to guide him in his spirit, he must wait for God in his spirit and not arbitrarily take his own feelings and thoughts as his guide.
[238]  Our purpose is to be a spiritual man, not a spirit.
[239]  This distinction will prevent our spiritual life from becoming one-sided.
[240]  It does not, by its lusts, draw the soul to commit sins as it once did.
[241]  As a believer gradually progresses on his spiritual path, he will gradually see more clearly that living for himself is a sin, even the greatest sin.
[242]  If we want to receive power to witness for Christ and fight Satan, we have no alternative but to seek the experiences of the filling of the Holy Spirit.
[243]  When a believer has condemned his flesh and walks according to the spirit, he can truly receive the power of the Holy Spirit.
[244]  Otherwise, he wants his flesh to receive spiritual power.
[245]  If the flesh does not pass through death, the spirit has no possibility of receiving power, because when the power of the flesh remains, the flesh still reigns and the spirit is oppressed.
[246]  A believer's own spirit must be buoyant and without entanglement when he arrives at the meeting place.
[247]  Whether a believer is a leader or a listener, when his spirit has a burden and is not free, it is not able to open toward God and respond to God's words; therefore, a believer's own spirit must be free.
[248]  All the work that God calls us to do is revealed in the intuition of the spirit see Section Five, Chapter One .
[249]  When a believer acts according to the thoughts of the mind, the activities of the emotion, and the ambitions of the will, he goes outside of the will of God.
[250]  All of a believer's work must only come from receiving revelation in the spirit after trusting and waiting upon God; otherwise, the flesh will come in. God will surely give us the spiritual power to do everything that He calls us to do.
[251]  The goal of spiritual work is nothing other than the spirit of man receiving life and building up the spirit which has life.
[252]  If the aim of our work does not pay attention to the spirit in the deepest part of man, then our work will not have any spiritual value and result.
[253]  Since the relationship between man and God begins at regeneration and is all in the spirit, all our works should focus on this point.
[254]  If one only wants superficial success and his goal is just to make people fervent and excited, he will find that there is nothing of God in his work.
[255]  When we no longer want others to understand in their mind, when we no longer want them to be moved in their emotion, and when we no longer want them to decide in their will, and instead only want their spirit to receive life, we will see that we absolutely cannot give life to others unless the Holy Spirit uses us.
[256]  Spiritual work often flows with the current of the Holy Spirit without any constraint and without the need for the strength of the flesh.
[257]  When a believer's work is needed by God, he will feel the flow of the Holy Spirit no matter what kind of difficulty.
[258]  Whenever a believer feels this way, he must search to see whether this kind of "mechanical work" is still needed by the Holy Spirit or if it has accomplished His purpose so that now God is calling His own vessels to go on.
[259]  In the spiritual experience of believers, there are many people who can serve as examples of being entangled in the "organization," both those with form and those without, until they have damaged their own life.
[260]  At the start a servant of God receives the power of the spirit, and God greatly works.
[261]  Therefore, at the present time the servants of God must get rid of all the work which God has not given, the work which he should have left long ago, the monopolizing work, the work which does not come from the Holy Spirit, the work which suppresses the spirit, the work which causes the believer to depart from the spirit, and the work which may be good, but which keeps the believer from being more noble.
[262]  If believers desire to see their prayers becoming effective in the spiritual realm and if they desire that their prayers would not be fleshly, they should confess their weakness, acknowledging that they do not know how to pray Rom 8:26 , and ask the Holy Spirit to teach them to pray.
[263]  They should then pray according to the instruction of the Holy Spirit.
[264]  Generally speaking, before a believer has experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit, he is like the servant of Elisha, who was very unclear about the realities in the spiritual realm 2 Kings 6:15-17 .
[265]  Although he may have received the teachings of the Bible and some instructions, he only understands them according to his mind and has no revelation in his spirit.
[266]  After a believer has experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit and comes in contact with a personal God, after his spirit is released and freed, and he realizes the reality of matters in the spiritual realm, he will engage Satan in warfare if he has the knowledge.
[267]  In addition to the above reasons, another reason for fighting with Satan is to be delivered from his deceptions and to deliver those who are deceived by him see Section Eight, Chapter Three and Section Nine, Chapter Four .
[268]  Although believers become keen in their spirit's intuition when they experience the baptism of the Holy Spirit, this is not sufficient to protect them from the wiles of the enemy.
[269]  The most crucial aspect of spiritual warfare is to be empowered with strength.
[270]  We can see this from the portion of the apostle's teaching concerning spiritual warfare.
[271]  Due to misinterpretation, believers assume that they should not do anything that their mind should be "blank," letting the Holy Spirit think for them; that their emotion should not be allowed to have any affection, letting the Holy Spirit put His own affections in their heart; and that their will should not make any decision, letting the Holy Spirit decide for them.
[272]  God wants to do away with the action of our flesh, but He does not intend to destroy us as a person.
[273]  Once the believer's spirit is passive, his conscience spontaneously becomes passive as well.
[274]  Once his conscience becomes passive, he thinks that he will be led directly by the Holy Spirit, either through a voice or through the Scriptures.
[275]  Since he possesses the highest way of leading, he thinks that he only needs to listen to what the Holy Spirit is personally speaking to him or what He is speaking through the Scriptures.
[276]  Once believers have entered into the spiritual realm, if they do not have a daily attitude of resisting the enemy in the spirit, assaulting Satan with prayers in the spirit, and asking God to destroy all the works of Satan done through the evil spirits, they will soon see their own spirit fall from the heavens and become weak and powerless.
[277]  The body has its senses, and the spirit also has its senses.
[278]  After a believer has embarked on a spiritual life, his spirit's senses and functions grow and fully develop.
[279]  Before a believer's spirit is separated from the soul and joined to the Lord as one spirit, it is hard for him to notice the senses in his spirit.
[280]  But once the power of the Holy Spirit is poured into his spirit and his inner man is strengthened, his spirit will possess the senses and functions of a full-grown man.
[281]  "And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know...The anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him" 1 John 2:20, 27 .
[282]  If we read the context of this portion of the Scriptures, we will see that the apostle spoke about many false teachings and antichrists.
[283]  He was saying that since the believers have received the anointing from the Holy One, who abides in them, this anointing will spontaneously teach them what is the truth, what is a lie, who is for Christ, and who is antichrist.
[284]  Now we can see what spiritual knowledge really is.
[285]  Only that which is apprehended in the spirit is spiritual knowledge.
[286]  Now we should be clearer than before about the difference between the intuition and the mind or emotion.
[287]  Once we understand the intuition, we will be more clear about the spirit which is usually more mysterious to us.
[288]  A spiritual experience is spiritual because it begins from God and is known in our spirit.
[289]  Just as man has fellowship with the physical world through his body, he has fellowship with the spiritual world through his spirit.
[290]  This fellowship with the spiritual realm is not through the mind or emotion but through the spirit.
[291]  Verses 11 and 12 continue, "For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him?
[292]  In the same way, the things of God also no one has known except the Spirit of God.
[293]  But we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is from God, that we may know the things which have been graciously given to us by God."
[294]  Since this is our situation even in the initial step of knowing the will of God, it is no wonder that we do not have any deeper revelation.
[295]  In this condition, we will never be in our spirit which enables us to know God's plan for this last age, the reality of spiritual warfare, or the deep and profound truths in the Bible.
[296]  Furthermore, in the matter of worshipping God, we will follow either what we deem to be right, or we will follow the transient outbursts of our emotions.
[297]  These experiences show us the importance of receiving "utterance" from the Holy Spirit.
[298]  Verse 14 says, "But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually."
[299]  Later the apostle says that a soulish man "does not receive" because the things of God are "discerned spiritually."
[300]  Do we see that the Holy Spirit is repeatedly emphasizing that man's spirit is the organ for fellowship with God?
[301]  The focus of this portion of the Scriptures is to prove, indicate, and clarify that through God's Spirit, man's spirit is the basis for fellowship with God and for knowing the things of God.
[302]  First Corinthians 3:1-2 says, "And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ.
[303]  These two verses are a response to the question, "If the spirit of man knows all the things of man, and if a spiritual man discerns all things, why are there so many Christians who are regenerated in their spirit yet do not feel that they have a spirit and are unable to know the many deep things of God through their spirit?"
[304]  The Scripture likens a newly regenerated believer to a baby because the life he has obtained in the spirit is as feeble as a physical baby.
[305]  There is no problem if the believer grows out of babyhood within a short time, because every grown-up begins by being a baby.
[306]  However, if a believer remains a baby for a long time, and if the stature of his spirit remains the same several years after regeneration, then something is wrong.
[307]  If we misunderstand and do not pursue the growth of the spiritual life and the intuition, which enable us to know God, the matters of God, and have fellowship with Him, but instead we pursue the increase of riches in the soul, we will not have any progress at all in God's view.
[308]  The most pitiful thing today is that Christians appear to have growth in almost everything; but their spirit, which is for fellowshipping with God, has not grown.
[309]  After believing in the Lord for years, one may still say, "I do not feel that I have a spirit."
[310]  Whether this spirit of wisdom and revelation is a hidden potential within the believers' spirit, which is enlightened by God through prayer, or whether it is some fresh wisdom and revelation, which comes from the Holy Spirit being added into the believers' spirit, the fact remains that a spirit of wisdom and revelation is indispensable in a believer's fellowship with God.
[311]  Soulish wisdom comes from man's mind, but spiritual wisdom is given by God to us in our spirit.
[312]  Besides the intuition and fellowship, our spirit has another important function which is to correct our wrong doings and reprove us so that we will not have peace when we come short of the glory of God.
[313]  The following verse shows us the relationship between the conscience and man's fellowship with God in the intuition.
[314]  "How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
[315]  When we come forward to God, we do not use our bodies like those in the Old Testament, because our Holy of Holies v. 19 is in the heavens; neither do we use our thoughts and feelings because these parts of the soul cannot have fellowship with God.
[316]  The precious blood of the Lord Jesus has purified the conscience so that the conscience is clean, possessing the sharpest feeling, and able to work according to the will of the Holy Spirit.
[317]  If the believer wants to be filled by the Holy Spirit, wants to be sanctified, wants his life to fit into God's purpose, and wants to walk fully according to the spirit, he cannot ignore the voice of the conscience.
[318]  The second choice is that a believer will try to do many other things to comfort the conscience.
[319]  On the one hand, he is not willing to obey the voice of the conscience and follow its direction to please God.
[320]  Regardless of how much he does and how men appraise his work, there is not any spiritual usefulness in the eyes of God It is not how much fat there is, nor how many burnt offerings there are, but how much obedience there is to God.
[321]  After the believer has allowed the conscience to work, he should not just remain at this stage.
[322]  A certain sin may have been dealt with already but other sins also need to be dealt with progressively, until all the sins have been thoroughly dealt with.
[323]  If the believer is faithful to deal with all his iniquities and walk according to the conscience, then the heavenly light will shine brighter and brighter within him.
[324]  The apostle Paul said, "I have conducted myself in all good conscience before God until this day" Acts 23:1 .
[325]  The apostle said, "I also exercise myself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and men" Acts 24:16 because "if our heart does not blame us, we have boldness toward God; and whatever we ask we receive from Him because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight" 1 John 3:21-22 .
[326]  The testimony was that "not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world."
[327]  Only when the believer lives by fully depending upon God, not allowing himself to initiate anything, not allowing the mind of man to enter and dominate anything, can the conscience testify that we live in the world according to the singleness and sincerity of God.
[328]  A conscience without offense not only is able to testify for us before man, but it also enables us to receive God's promises.
[329]  Today's believers often complain that their faith is too small and therefore, that they are unable to have a completely spiritual living.
[330]  If a believer does not follow the guidance of his conscience, but rather prefers whatever is not according to the will of God, he will immediately lose his fellowship with God.
[331]  In walking according to the spirit and listening to the voice of the conscience, we should also remember that the conscience is limited by its knowledge.
[332]  If the believer walks according to the standard which he already knows: keeping obeying everything which he knows to be according to God's will and rejecting everything which he knows to be condemned by God, he is able to have a complete fellowship with God.
[333]  Thus, as our biblical knowledge increases and our spiritual experiences grow, the standard of our conduct will also rise accordingly.
[334]  In the gradual increase of light, our conduct must become gradually more holy for our conscience to be preserved without offense.
[335]  Once we have another year of knowledge and experience, our conscience will accuse us if our conduct is the same as the previous year's. In the previous year God did not cut off His fellowship with us, because we were ignorant of our transgressions.
[336]  We have clearly said before that Christ is the standard of holiness for our life.
[337]  At the same time, even though the conscience is not the standard of holiness, it is the standard that testifies whether or not we please God in our daily living.
[338]  The reason for this is none other than differences in the degree of the knowledge of the conscience.
[339]  But if the conscience of another believer does not permit the same thing, he will sin if he does it.
[340]  However, older believers have a big danger in this regard; their conscience may be too strong, and it may become cold and hard.
[341]  Immature believers who seek the Lord wholeheartedly will submit to the Lord in many things because their conscience and intuition are sensitive, and they are easily moved by the Holy Spirit.
[342]  This will always keep the believer spiritual, keep him from the power of the flesh, keep him following the will of God, and keep him from Satan's attack.
[343]  Many believers treat the Holy Spirit's occasional working in their spirit as the most wonderful experiences of their life.
[344]  Practically speaking, the feeling of the soul and the intuition of the spirit are markedly different.
[345]  Yet sometimes, the feeling of the soul is very similar to the intuition of the spirit.
[346]  If a believer does not seek to truly know God in the intuition and walk according to the intuition, but simply postulates in the mind or, even more commonly, seeks after the stirring of the Holy Spirit in his feelings, he still is walking according to the flesh and causing his spiritual life to sink into a lifeless condition.
[347]  The apostle told us that after he received the revelation in spirit, knew the Lord Jesus, and realized that God was sending him to the Gentiles, he followed the leading in the spirit.
[348]  He did not confer with flesh and blood; he no longer needed to listen to men's opinions, thoughts, and arguments.
[349]  Since our spirit, as the organ for fellowship between the Holy Spirit and the believers, is so crucial, it is no wonder that Satan utterly abhors the believers knowing about the functions of the spirit and walking according to the spirit.
[350]  Through these feelings and thoughts, he can confound the spiritual senses of the believers, so that in a state of confusion, the believers cannot distinguish what is really from the spirit and what is from the soul.
[351]  Satan has another way to attack the believer who diligently follows the guidance of the intuition in spirit; he impersonates the believer's conscience to accuse him.
[352]  The enemy uses the desire of the believer to accuse him, causing him to mistake this as the condemnation of his own conscience so that he will be without peace, become weary of dealing with the problems, and lose his boldness to go on.
[353]  In the life of walking according to the spirit, spiritual believers should be aware of other dangers besides the disguise of Satan and his various attacks.
[354]  Many times our own soul, for reasons of its own without the counterfeiting of the evil spirit , initiates a certain feeling to prompt us to act.
[355]  A believer must know that his body has feelings, his soul has feelings, and his spirit also has feelings.
[356]  There is a great danger for us to live excessively by our own spirit or walk excessively according to our own spirit.
[357]  Although the Bible attaches great importance to the individual spirit of the believer, we may fall into the danger of being extreme.
[358]  A believer must learn to know the sense of the spirit because this is the first condition of walking according to the spirit.
[359]  If he does not know what is the sense of the spirit and the feeling of the soul, he will not be able to walk according to the spirit.
[360]  The spirit requires the soul and the body to be the organs for its expression.
[361]  A believer's spirit can become poisoned by evil spirits.
[362]  If the spirit is poisoned, and the poison is not quickly dealt with, it will turn into sins in the spirit.
[363]  Believers become depressed in their spirit mostly when they turn inward to look at themselves.
[364]  There is a difference between the burden of the spirit and the weight of the spirit.
[365]  Many times the burden in the spirit is for us to pray Col 4:12 .
[366]  If God burdens our spirit with a certain burden, we can only relieve the burden in our spirit by fulfilling what God wants us to do, either through prayer or through proclaiming His message.
[367]  This means that God's life and power can ebb away in the believers' spirit like the ebbing away of the tide.
[368]  In summary, a believer must understand all the laws of the spirit before he can walk according to the spirit.
[369]  If he is not watchful, and does not cooperate with God, he will become fallen.
[370]  In spiritual warfare, a believer does not always attack the enemy because he forgets the principle of the cooperation of the spirit and the mind.
[371]  Sometimes we only need to use our mind to consider a little, and the spirit responds; sometimes, however, we have to wait for a while before the spirit agrees with us, because our mind is too narrow, and we may not quickly realize through the spirit what the Holy Spirit delights in. Sometimes God desires to enlarge the scope of our prayers; He desires us to pray for the nation so that all of Satan's work behind the scenes will fail.
[372]  In our spiritual life there are many things that should be done.
[373]  Because the mind can assist the spirit, even though its position is much lower than the spirit, a believer must keep his mind in a normal condition to enable it to search the interpretation of the spirit and assist in any weakness of the spirit.
[374]  If a believer desires to walk according to the spirit, he must continuously keep himself in a proper condition.
[375]  "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit" Psa 51:17 .
[376]  "He that is of a cool spirit is a man of understanding" Prov 17:27, ASV .
[377]  "And my spirit has exulted in God my Savior" Luke 1:47 .
[378]  The spirit of a believer should take the attitude of brokenness towards self Psa 51:17 , while simultaneously rejoicing in God.
[379]  "The hidden man of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of a meek and quiet spirit, which is very costly in the sight of God" 1 Pet 3:4 .
[380]  If God, through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in a believer's spirit, is completely joined with the believer, the believer's spirit will also be one with the other believers.
[381]  Only when the mind and emotion submit to the control of the spirit can the believer disregard or stop the discord in the mind and emotion and be one with the other children of God in spirit.
[382]  Just as Simeon, by the revelation of the Holy Spirit, knew that he would see the Christ of God before his death, a believer should also believe with assurance in his spirit that he will be raptured to the Lord before he dies.
[383]  If a believer receives this raptured spirit, or in other words, if his spirit is in the condition of being raptured, we will see that he is more heavenly.
[384]  His path to the heavens is not like that in the past when he assumed that he must pass through death.
[385]  When a believer has not experienced the sure work of the cross, which is brought about by the Holy Spirit, he may have experienced deliverance from sin yet still be soulish and unable to overcome his own natural life.
[386]  The more we consider the function of our emotional life, the more we know its fluctuation and undependability.
[387]  If believers do not live according to the spirit but according to their emotion, is it any wonder that their living undulates like the waves?
[388]  If a believer can hand over his emotion to the cross through the Holy Spirit and accept the Holy Spirit as the Lord over all things, he surely can avoid this kind of undulating life.
[389]  Many believers do not know how to differentiate inspiration from emotion.
[390]  There are two reasons believers walk according to their emotion.
[391]  First, many believers never understand what walking according to the spirit is, nor have they sought to do so; therefore, they walk according to the influence of their emotion.
[392]  Elsewhere we have emphasized that only the spirit can do spiritual work; all other works are without spiritual value.
[393]  If the workers of the Lord would remember that our aim is to help people receive the life of Christ, they would never use their emotion to make people approve of Christ's teaching and express a good feeling toward Christianity.
[394]  When we clearly acknowledge that man lacks God's life the quickening of the spirit we will realize that all the work which has been done by relying on ourselves is vain.
[395]  If a believer allows the cross to do a deeper work in his emotion, he would soon learn that the emotion would not obstruct the spirit, but would even cooperate with the spirit.
[396]  In the experience of a believer, perhaps the most difficult thing is to submit to the Lord in the matter of love.
[397]  Because believers do not allow the Lord to be Lord over their love, God's work is hindered.
[398]  How many parents love their children so much that they hold back their children and cause God's kingdom to suffer loss!
[399]  Many believers fail simply because they seek in man that which can only be found in God.
[400]  On the one hand, if a believer does not have a deep love for the Lord, He is grieved; on the other hand, even those who love the Lord can grieve Him because they love Him in their souls.
[401]  If we want to walk according to the spirit, we should keep our love calm; otherwise, we cannot hear the voice of the intuition directly.
[402]  Desires comprise the greatest part of our soul-life.
[403]  This natural desire causes a believer to become ambitious.
[404]  Emotion does not know the meaning of waiting for God, waiting for God's revelation, or following the leading of the Holy Spirit.
[405]  God's purpose is that the believer would live in the spirit and also be willing to completely put his soul-life to death.
[406]  Therefore, God has no choice but to banish the natural desire of the believer.
[407]  Yet God does not allow the believer to do or possess these things simply because they are the result of an emotional impulse and the believer desires them.
[408]  Since the purpose of God is such, God allows a believer to pass through many fiery trials under His sovereign arrangement so that all desire, like dross, will be fully burned by the fire of suffering.
[409]  The Lord Jesus said to His disciples, "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls" Matt 11:29 .
[410]  Just as the Father dealt with the Lord, He knows how the heavenly Father will cause the believers to be lonely, misunderstood, and neglected by man v. 27 . He knows that the heavenly Father will allow many unpleasant things to fall upon the believers so that they may be weaned from the world.
[411]  CHAPTER FOUR A LIFE OF FEELING THE BELIEVER'S EXPERIENCE
[412]  Such a believer tends to secretly feel sorry for others because he thinks they do not have his kind of experience.
[413]  He considers his own happiness as an excellent thing and pities his brothers and sisters for not being able to comprehend it!
[414]  When the believer loses the feeling of happiness, he thinks that everything is lost.
[415]  If the Lord's presence cannot be felt, he thinks that the Lord must not be with him.
[416]  The believer who goes through such an experience thinks that his spirituality is at its highest when he has this experience and at its lowest when he loses it.
[417]  He means that his spirituality is at its highest when he feels happy, when he feels that he loves the Lord, and when he feels the Lord's presence; his spirituality is at its lowest when he feels dark, dry, and bitter.
[418]  Why then does God give the believer such a feeling and withdraw it again?
[419]  Another purpose of God for this kind of dealing is to train the will of the believer.
[420]  A genuine spiritual life is not a life of feeling but a life of the will.
[421]  The will of a spiritual man has been renewed by the Holy Spirit; it waits for the spirit's revelation and proposal and then orders his whole being to follow the revelation from the spirit.
[422]  If we understand the significance of this experience which God gives us and walk according to His will, there is no danger at all.
[423]  However, when the believer fails to understand God's goal and lives by this kind of feeling intently pursuing in the presence of feeling while refusing to move in its absence there is inevitably a spiritual danger.
[424]  If we genuinely love God, we will still fervently love Him no matter what circumstance He puts us in. If we only love when the feeling is present but not when it is absent, perhaps we only love our feeling, not God.
[425]  We must have happiness, and the Lord delights in giving us His happiness.
[426]  If we enjoy His happiness according to His will i.e., we do not seek it for ourselves but are thankful when God causes us to feel happy and just as thankful when He causes us to feel dry, not forcing the issue , this enjoyment will be profitable rather than harmful.
[427]  However, if we find so much pleasure in this experience that after enjoying God's happiness, we seek it every day, we have departed from God in pursuit of the happiness which He gives.
[428]  The Bible discloses the proper course of a believer's life in the following verses: "But the righteous shall have life and live by faith" Rom 1:17 ; "the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God" Gal 2:20 ; and "we walk by faith, not by appearance" 2 Cor 5:7 .
[429]  We may think that the cross's most complete work is accomplished when we forsake outward, physical happiness and worldly pleasures.
[430]  Through this the Lord reveals to us whether we are living for Him by faith or whether we are living for ourselves by feeling.
[431]  Since we once believed in God, loved God, and trusted God, no matter where He puts us or how He ill-treats us, and even if He causes us to go through the refining fire so that we would suffer both physically and emotionally, yet we will believe in Him, love Him, and trust Him!
[432]  Many believers do not know that living by the spirit is living by the will that is in union with God.
[433]  A will that is not in union with God is unreliable and does not last.
[434]  When a believer is regulated by a life of feeling, he neglects his duty towards others.
[435]  When a believer has gone through all of the Lord's dealings, he will enter into a life of faith.
[436]  After reading these verses and seeing how the authority of darkness is especially related to man's mind, we can see that the mind is the part of man which is most easily attacked by Satan.
[437]  The authority of darkness cannot directly do anything to man's will, emotion, and body unless it has gained quite considerable ground in him already.
[438]  After a believer repents, his mind is not completely delivered from Satan's workings.
[439]  Man's head does more damage to him than his heart!
[440]  If believers could differentiate between the renewing of the heart and the renewing of the head, they would not be misled to trust in man.
[441]  Believers must know that a man can have the most intimate fellowship with God, and at the same time, the mind can unintentionally receive the suggestions of Satan, bringing his conduct, speech, and judgment into error.
[442]  If we examine all the experiences in the minds of the believers, we will realize that the minds of the believers are not just narrow; they also have many other sicknesses.
[443]  For example, the mind is affected by thoughts and imaginations that cannot be controlled, filthy pictures, wandering and chaotic recollections, sudden loss of memory, prejudices that come from nowhere, lack of concentration, thoughts that are stagnant and obstructed as if the mind is chained, or fanatical thoughts that turn uncontrollably.
[444]  Many times the believer's mind is full of thoughts, and he finds himself unable to stop these thoughts.
[445]  Even though a believer shakes his head incessantly and tries to reject such thoughts, he is not able to do so.
[446]  The flesh is always the place where evil spirits work.
[447]  If the mind is not renewed, even if a person is regenerated in his spirit, evil spirits will still have a chance to work.
[448]  If we misconstrue the efforts of evil spirits in us, in our environment, and in our work by considering them to be natural, obvious, spontaneous, or caused by ourselves, we have given ground to evil spirits and allowed them to continue their works in these matters.
[449]  God created a mind for man; it was not meant to fall into disuse.
[450]  Any ground given by the believers to evil spirits induces the work of evil spirits.
[451]  This kind of teaching is scriptural because the Bible says, "Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is,"..."proving what is well pleasing to the Lord" Eph 5:17, 10 .
[452]  God wants believers to know what they are doing when they obey Him; He does not want to have senseless and blind obedience.
[453]  The so-called modern-day hypnotism, which disguises itself under the name of science, and religious and transcendental meditation, etc., which enable people to possess the power of telepathy and hear things from different directions, as well as healing and transformation, are actually founded upon these two principles.
[454]  Although in name they are for the good of mankind, the methods of "concentration," "mental focus," "yoga," "meditation," etc., all require the mind to first become quiet and the will to become passive.
[455]  One thing is certain if only the believers can remember this one thing : there is a basic difference between the work of evil spirits and the work of the Holy Spirit.
[456]  Even if a man is pursuing the Holy Spirit outwardly, as long as he fulfills the condition for evil spirits to work, the Holy Spirit will not work.
[457]  This is because "the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets" v. 32 . Is this the case with tongue-speakers today? Is it not true that they have completely lost control of themselves and are completely ignorant of what they are doing? Is it not true that the spirits of the prophets are not subject to the prophets, and instead that the prophets are subject to the spirits? Here we can see the basic distinction between what is from God and what is from demons.
[458]  Evil spirits are not only able to inject thoughts into the believer's mind, but they can also form different kinds of pictures in his mind.
[459]  Because of the attack of evil spirits, many believers lose their original power of memory and often have the phenomenon of forgetfulness.
[460]  Many times evil spirits also take away the power of concentration in the believers' minds.
[461]  After the believer's mind is controlled by evil spirits, his thoughts become entirely undependable because he is responsible for very few of his own thoughts.
[462]  After a believer's mind has fallen into passivity and been occupied by evil spirits, he will never listen to the explanation or evidence of others in any matter in which he has already made a decision.
[463]  When the mind of a believer has fallen into the condition mentioned in the preceding chapter, he should seek the way of deliverance.
[464]  Evil spirits will tell the believer, "Your sudden and good thought is of God...these sudden revelations are the result of being spiritual...your bad memory is caused by something in your physical body...your sudden forgetfulness is natural...oversensitivity is a matter of disposition...a weak memory is hereditary...insomnia is an illness...you are tired...your inability to think is the result of overwork...you cannot stop thinking at night because you have used your mind too much during the day...unclean thoughts come from the sins that you have committed...your inability to listen to others is because of differences in the environment...the blame is altogether on others."
[465]  Therefore, the most important thing for the believer to do now is examine where these excuses come from.
[466]  Evil spirits are well able to make man think that their works are caused by something natural.
[467]  When the believer is enlightened and begins to seek freedom, evil spirits will pour out many accusations in his mind.
[468]  They will tell the believer that he can no longer be free, that he has already fallen too deep into passivity, that God is no longer willing to grant mercy, that it is best if he does not resist, allowing the situation to remain as it is, and that there will never be a day when he will be delivered.
[469]  We have previously mentioned that evil spirits are able to work in the mind of the believer because he has given them the ground.
[470]  Today a countless number of believers carry their old way of thinking with them wherever they go.
[471]  Although they are saved and have obtained the new life, they have not changed any in their former reasoning, their way of thinking, and their prejudice.
[472]  When a believer carries out an examination in the light of God, he will see that in the past he accepted countless lies from evil spirits.
[473]  If a believer falls into all kinds of miserable conditions because of being passive and believing in the lies of evil spirits, he needs to know his own "normal condition."
[474]  Aside from the ground of the unrenewed mind, these two kinds of ground that are given to evil spirits will cause the believer to steadily deteriorate in every aspect.
[475]  After the believer realizes his own normal condition, his most important job is to fight to return to his normal condition.
[476]  After the believer has regained the ground step by step in this way, a result will gradually be manifested.
[477]  When a believer's mind has reached the point of being renewed, he will marvel at the capability of his mind.
[478]  If we analyze the process of the walk of a spiritual believer, it may be divided into the following steps: the Holy Spirit reveals and makes known the will of God to the spirit of a believer; the believer realizes the meaning of this revelation through his mind and then exercises the power of his spirit through the will to move his body to execute this matter.
[479]  "The eyes of your heart" are the faculty of our reasoning, the faculty of understanding, which is our mind.
[480]  The more spiritual a believer is, the more he knows about the importance of walking according to the spirit and the danger of walking according to the flesh.
[481]  Besides revealing the truth directly to us, God often in fact most of the time conveys the truth to us through His other children.
[482]  When the mind is working, believers should be careful not to let it work alone.
[483]  This means that it should not work apart from the ruling of the spirit.
[484]  When the mind does not hold its own opinion, it helps the believers know the will of God more clearly.
[485]  God said, "I will impart My laws into their mind" Heb 8:10 .
[486]  In speaking about man and man's will, we should always keep in mind that, as human beings, we have a free will.
[487]  The same is true in the matter of salvation.
[488]  While man is in his flesh, even if he wants to be saved and have eternal life, this will cannot please God.
[489]  "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God...who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God John 1:12-13 .
[490]  God instructs us that, even in such a great and wonderful thing as salvation, if it issues from the self, it will still not please God and will be rejected.
[491]  If we want to advance in our spiritual life, we must understand all the principles God used to deal with us at the time we were saved because these original principles point out to us the principles we should live by in our spiritual life in the future.
[492]  One of the greatest principles is that the intention of our flesh does not have any value before God.
[493]  We should remember at all times that God does not care for the differences between good things, bad things, big things, and small things; God only asks where these things come from and whether or not they are initiated and carried out by Himself.
[494]  Salvation is nothing other than God saving man out of himself and into God.
[495]  As we mentioned before, God wants us to do away with the soul-life, not the function of the soul.
[496]  Hence, after we are united to God in life, God wants to renew our soul mind, emotion, and will to bring our soul into oneness with our new life, as well as into oneness with His will.
[497]  Since our will is the most important part, after regeneration, God daily is seeking the union of our will with His will.
[498]  If our will is not fully one with God, it means that salvation is not fully accomplished, because man himself is still not in harmony with God.
[499]  God moves the believers with His Spirit and stirs them up with His love so that they will submit to His will and not love, pursue, or do anything outside of Himself.
[500]  There is a two-step endeavor in the union of the will with God.
[501]  One step is for God to subdue the activities of our will; the other step is for God to subdue the life of our will.
[502]  Saints those who are entirely consecrated can be possessed by evil spirits in the same way that others can because they often unconsciously fulfill the condition for evil spirits to work; therefore, they give ground for evil spirits to attach themselves to them.
[503]  Today many believers are possessed by demons, though the degree of possession may be different.
[504]  In short, the place that the believers give to the devil is sin.
[505]  The meaning of passivity is that the will no longer actively rules and directs a person's spirit, soul, body, or any part; consequently, he does not use his will to choose and decide everything that is related to himself.
[506]  When a believer has fallen deeply into passivity, he may think that he is submissive to God.
[507]  The believer thinks he must be very passive before he can truly submit to God and before he can be truly in union with God in his will.
[508]  Evil spirits know if a believer is fully submissive to God and willing to pay the price to follow Him to the end.
[509]  Hence, they deceive the believer by counterfeiting God Himself, by counterfeiting God's voice, God's work, and God's presence.
[510]  Among the believers who have contact with the spiritual realm, there are many who assume that certain things are from God because of supernatural experiences they receive in their feeling.
[511]  However, if the believer does not know that passivity affords convenience to the evil spirits and does not know that spiritual life requires an active will to work with God, he may allow his will to become passive.
[512]  Because the believers are so ignorant, they are deceived by the power of darkness and unconsciously taken in by Satan's deceit.
[513]  During this period of time, the believer must take many notes to remind himself of many things.
[514]  When a believer reaches this state, unconsciously he relies upon evil spirits to help him!
[515]  We have already seen how the believer does not have the strength within himself to make decisions and that he has to rely on external forces to support him.
[516]  Many times, because of torment by evil spirits without realizing that the torment is from evil spirits , a believer longs for the external force which has been helping him all along to come to his aid!
[517]  At such times, he can 1 believe in evil spirits, 2 rely on them, 3 obey them, 4 consecrate himself to them, 5 listen to them, 6 pray to them, 7 be led and guided by them, 8 accept their message, 9 accept the Scriptures given by them, 10 work with them, 11 work for them, 12 assist them in accomplishing their heart's desires and work, while still thinking that he is turning to God and that he is for God.
[518]  The believer should know that if he does not communicate with God according to the condition of fellowship, but rather communicates according to the condition of demon-possession, his prayer will be a prayer to evil spirits, his consecration will be a consecration to evil spirits, and his trust will be a trust in evil spirits.
[519]  When man does not move and God does not move, evil spirits will move in. The believer should know that after he clearly understands God's will in the intuition of his spirit, his entire being has to rise up to carry out God's will in an active way; he must not be passive.
[520]  2 The believer has the Holy Spirit dwelling in his spirit, yet at the same time his body is possessed by evil spirits.
[521]  In his spirit he has fellowship with God, but evil spirits manifest their works in his body.
[522]  The believer must not think that whatever he does in his outward body must be something from God just because he has fellowship with God in the spirit.
[523]  We should not have a misconception that believers who are deceived by evil spirits are very defiled, degenerate, and sinful.
[524]  We need to realize that these believers have completely consecrated themselves to God and are actually more advanced than ordinary believers.
[525]  The passivity of many believers is due to a misunderstanding of the truth of "dying with Christ."
[526]  After a believer accepts the misunderstanding concerning dying with Christ and allows himself to fall into passivity 1 he will no longer be active, 2 God will no longer use him either, because this would go against the principle of His working; and 3 evil spirits will seize the opportunity to attach themselves to him because this situation fits the condition for evil spirits to work.
[527]  Therefore, the consequence of this misconception about dying with Christ and trying to practice it is nothing other than demon-possession and a pretense of being filled by God.
[528]  If a believer thinks that he should annihilate the existence of his person, that he should not think, feel, or have an opinion, or that he should not have any movement of the body, but instead that he should live his life in a dream, both day and night, without any knowledge of where he is, he will be possessed.
[529]  "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure" Phil 2:13 .
[530]  A believer may think that only God is the One who wills and works, that God puts the willing and the working into him, and that God wills for him and works for him.
[531]  As a consequence of this action: 1 the believer does not use his own will; 2 God also does not use His will to make any proposal for him, because He wants the believer to actively co-labor with Him; 3 evil spirits take the opportunity to seize his passive will and act on his behalf so that he either becomes paralyzed, without any progress, or burns with the "fire of demons"; and 4 at this time, the believer may think that God is thinking for him.
[532]  There are many believers who have fallen into passivity and possession because of their ignorance of the work of the Holy Spirit.
[533]  The believers, in accordance with the word in Acts 5:32, "the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him," think that they ought to "obey the Holy Spirit."
[534]  The apostle told us in a preceding verse v. 29 that we should "obey God." If the believer takes the Holy Spirit as his object of obedience and forgets God the Father, he will be led to follow a spirit within him or around him and not obey the Father in heaven through the Holy Spirit.
[535]  We have said in another place that God disciplines our spirit through the Holy Spirit and that our spirit governs our body, our entire being, through our soul i.e., will .
[536]  A believer may think this means that God will speak on behalf of him, that he need not speak, and that God will speak words out from his mouth.
[537]  The believer does not realize that the meaning of this word is that the Holy Spirit will enlighten his mind to cause him to remember the Lord's words.
[538]  The consequences are: 1 the believer does not exercise his will to use his memory; 2 God does not use it either, because there is no one to cooperate with Him; and 3 evil spirits come in and display everything that is expedient for themselves in front of him, so that he cannot refuse them.
[539]  God not only wants us to obey Him; He also wants us to withstand Satan.
[540]  Because the believer is totally consecrated, he thinks that he should take the way of the cross and suffer for the sake of Christ.
[541]  Now we should be thoroughly clear about the fundamental difference between the principle of God's work on us and that of Satan's work on us: 1 God wants the believer to exercise every faculty of his entire being through his own will, cooperating with God to the point of being filled with the Holy Spirit.
[542]  A consecrated believer can fall into passivity in a foolish and deceived way for several years and still be ignorant of the danger of his own position.
[543]  Today believers are particularly susceptible to deceptions in supernatural things.
[544]  Because of these deceptions, they are possessed by evil spirits.
[545]  A believer should never forget that if the Holy Spirit gives him a supernatural experience, he can still use his own mind.
[546]  There are different ways for possessed believers to obtain the truth.
[547]  Some believers obtain the truth because they realize that even though ninety-nine percent of their experience seems to come from God, there is still a tiny portion of wrong elements mixed in. This raises their suspicion and causes them to doubt if their experience is really from God.
[548]  While we can say with certainty that a believer can give ground to evil spirits, we need to ask what the ground is.
[549]  In addition to the matter of sins, a believer should realize that he allows his will to become passive whenever he accepts the counterfeit of evil spirits, and he gives ground to evil spirits whenever he believes in their injected thoughts.
[550]  Although one may cast out the demons in himself or others in the name of the Lord, and although the demons may appear to have left, the person is not really free.
[551]  There is one common principle that underlies all the ground given to the evil spirits.
[552]  Resistance requires the combined strength of the spirit, soul, and body.
[553]  Now the believer has to choose whether he will remain passive, allowing evil spirits to continually move him.
[554]  If he is unwilling to let evil spirits use him in this way, even though he is temporarily unable to "determine" anything, he will not allow evil spirits to use his power of determination.
[555]  When the believer battles to regain his ground, he will pass through very painful times.
[556]  In resolutely trying to regain his freedom, he will feel great pain and an intense struggle because of the resistance of the power of darkness.
[557]  When he tries to use his will to 1 oppose the authority of evil spirits and 2 to carry out his duty, he will experience the intensity of the resistance of the evil spirits who have been occupying him.
[558]  If a believer desires to obey God, he must go through the following steps: 1 he must resolve to obey God's will John 7:17 ; 2 he must receive the revelation concerning God's will through his intuition Eph 5:17 ; 3 he must be strengthened by God to resolve to carry it out Phil 2:13 ; and 4 he must be strengthened by God to execute it Phil 2:13 .
[559]  When the believer's spiritual life reaches its climax, he can rule over himself.
[560]  If the believer has this misunderstanding, he will either be possessed by the demons or become discouraged when he does not see the Holy Spirit ruling over his life in this way.
[561]  If a believer realizes that the Holy Spirit is leading him into self-rule, he will not fall into passivity; on the contrary, he will advance greatly in his spiritual life.
[562]  Although the intuition, fellowship, and conscience of our spirit may be very healthy, and although the mind, emotion, and will of our soul may be renewed, we have not become a spiritual man if our outward body is not healthy and renewed in accordance with our spirit and soul.
[563]  Verse 11 says, "And if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you."
[564]  The preceding verse says that God causes our spirit to become life, and this verse tells us that God causes our bodies to receive life.
[565]  In this verse, God tells us that the believers' bodies are privileged to receive life through the Holy Spirit that is dwelling within us.
[566]  This does not mean that "the body of sin" becomes a holy body, that "the body of our humiliation" becomes a glorious body, or that the "mortal body" becomes an immortal body.
[567]  For the Holy Spirit to give life to our body means: 1 if our body has illness, He can cause it to be recovered, and 2 if our body does not have illness, He will preserve us from encountering any illness.
[568]  In short, the Holy Spirit wants to make our body strong, so that it can meet all the requirements of God's work and living, and so that neither our life nor the kingdom of God will suffer any damage because of the body.
[569]  They are like two different people; when they turn within to themselves, they feel that they are very spiritual, very close to God, and very high in their spiritual life, but when they live in the outward flesh, they feel that they are fallen, fleshly, and separated from God.
[570]  Many people think that the flesh has its lawful desires and cravings and that we should fulfill them.
[571]  But the apostle tells us that we do not owe the flesh anything since "we are debtors not to the flesh."
[572]  Beyond keeping the flesh in a proper condition as a vessel to God, we do not owe it any debt.
[573]  In other words, there are many things, humanly speaking, that a believer can do related to his body but may choose not to do because he belongs to the Lord and wants to glorify God.
[574]  "The body is...for the Lord" means that the body belongs to the Lord.
[575]  Nevertheless, it is in the hand of man for him to keep for the Lord.
[576]  It seems unbelievable that the Lord could be for our body.
[577]  Verse 14 says, "And God has both raised up the Lord and will raise us up through His power."
[578]  Verse 17 says, "But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."
[579]  In these three verses we can see the mystery of the union of our body with the Lord.
[580]  Verse 17 means that since those who join their body to a prostitute become one flesh with her and become her members, the believers who are joined to the Lord in one spirit will all the more have their body become His members!
[581]  If a believer thinks that God and His Spirit communicate with him through his body, he may expect God and His Spirit to communicate with him through his body.
[582]  Verse 19 says, "Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God."
[583]  The first "do you not know" v. 15 refers to "the body is...for the Lord." The second "do you not know" refers to "the Lord is also for the body." In 1 Corinthians 3:16 the apostle already told us that "you are the temple of God." But now he specifically says, "Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit." This means that the residence of the Holy Spirit expands from the spirit to the body.
[584]  If we want to know the way to preserve our body in a condition that glorifies God, we must know the attitude that we should have toward sickness, how to utilize our sickness, and how to have our sickness healed.
[585]  We should realize that if the Lord Jesus only forgives our sins without healing our sicknesses, His salvation is still not complete.
[586]  Although He has saved our "soul," He still leaves our body behind to be dominated by sickness.
[587]  Therefore, a sick believer should not hastily seek after healing or methods of healing at first.
[588]  God has no delight in seeing His children become sick.
[589]  However, He knows there is a danger: when believers have favorable days, all their love for Him, all the words of praise for Him, and all the things they do for Him are done only because of the favorable conditions.
[590]  It is very difficult when the believer's heart is far apart from God's heart.
[591]  Because believers love themselves so much and do not deal with God in a basic way, they seek after the healing of earthly medicine when they are sick.
[592]  There is an enormous difference between being healed by medicine and being healed by trusting in God.
[593]  The power of medicine is simply natural, while the power of God is divine.
[594]  Even when a doctor, who is a believer, asks God to grant him wisdom and bless the drugs that he uses, he still cannot give the healed ones a spiritual blessing.
[595]  One thing is certain: if we are healed through trusting in God, the spiritual benefit we derive from such healing can definitely not be obtained by healing that comes from a medicinal cure.
[596]  If a believer is not willing to bow down his head and accept his sickness, and if he cannot acknowledge that God has given him the best, seeking instead for healing outside of God and rebelling against the way He deals with him, He has no choice but to let him become sick again.
[597]  If the believer is not willing to give up his self-love, and if he continues fastidiously to care, nurture, pity, and consider himself, not abandoning himself in God, God will give him more things that will make him pity himself even more.
[598]  "Many are the misfortunes of the righteous man,/But Jehovah delivers him from all of them./He keeps all his bones;/Not one of them is broken" Psa 34:19-20 .
[599]  We know that God's goal today is for "Your will to be done, as in heaven, so also on earth" Matt 6:10 .
[600]  The will of God is done in heaven, but is there sickness in heaven?
[601]  We should not think that we are wiser than God or that we can act beyond what the Bible reveals.
[602]  Even though the sickroom may sometimes feel like a sanctuary, and everyone who enters may be touched by the atmosphere, this is not God's ordained will and not God's best.
[603]  CHAPTER THREE GOD AS THE LIFE OF THE BODY
[604]  We have previously seen how our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.
[605]  Every believer must see the reality of his union with the Lord.
[606]  God never intends for His children to be weak and ill; His will is for them to be healthy and strong.
[607]  By looking at some of David's songs in the Psalms, we can find that he received God's strength in his body: "I love You, O Jehovah, my strength...The God who girds me with strength/And makes my way perfect,/Who makes my feet like hinds' feet/And sets me on my high places,/Who teaches my hands to wage war/So that my arms may bend a bronze bow" 18:1, 32-34 .
[608]  Elihu told Job about the punishment of God and its results: "He is chastened also with pain upon his bed,/and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:/so that his life abhorreth bread,/and his soul dainty meat./His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen;/and his bones that were not seen stick out./Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave,/and his life to the destroyers./If there be a messenger with him,/an interpreter, one among a thousand,/to show unto man his uprightness;/then he is gracious unto him, and saith,/Deliver him from going down to the pit:/I have found a ransom./His flesh shall be fresher than a child's:/he shall return to the days of his youth" Job 33:19-25 .
[609]  If we accept the biblical teaching that our body is a member of Christ, we also have to take the teaching that Christ's life flows inside of our body.
[610]  If we fully consecrate ourselves to God, we can believe that He has indeed prepared a body for us.
[611]  In this way we do not limit our work by our natural strength, nor are we in perpetual anxiety over our body.
[612]  If anything is God's will, we dare to obey even if it is risky according to man's wisdom.
[613]  If we receive the life of the Lord Jesus as the life of our body, our body will be strengthened by the Lord, and our spiritual life will be prosperous because of Him as well.
[614]  According to knowledge, we realized long ago that our body is for the Lord; yet because of our self-will, the Lord has been hindered from saturating us.
[615]  We must see clearly the relationship between sin and death.
[616]  Christ died to deliver us not only from sin but also from death.
[617]  To overcome death a believer must change his attitude from one of submission to one of resistance.
[618]  Unless a believer rids himself of such passivity, he will never overcome death but will instead constantly be harassed by it and end up among the graves of those who die prematurely.
[619]  Unless a believer is clear that his work is finished and that the Lord does not need him to remain on the earth any longer, he should not die; that is, he should always resist death.
[620]  If the symptoms of death have gradually occurred in his body and he knows that his work has not been finished, a believer should completely deny these symptoms and refuse to die.
[621]  Based on what we have said about overcoming death, we do not necessarily mean that our body will never die.
[622]  The Lord Jesus expressed this idea more explicitly at the time of Lazarus's death: "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live; and every one who lives and believes into Me shall by no means die forever" John 11:25-26 .
[623]  We only know that after we die He will resurrect us, but we forget that while we are living He wants to be our life to save us from dying.
[624]  At other times Satan directly attacks believers and causes them to die.
[625]  Actually, many such attacks have happened, but believers do not recognize them as such.
[626]  The Bible tells us that there is a kind of sin called "a sin unto death" 1 John 5:16 which believers may commit.
[627]  In the coming kingdom the Lord Jesus will be the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings Mal 4:2 .
