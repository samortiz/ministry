<h2 class="head1">WAYS TO DISPOSE OF MONEY<br />RECEIVED FROM THE LOCAL CHURCH</h2><p>There are also six ways to take care of money received from the local churches. First, we can remember the poor. Second, we can remember individual brothers and sisters or individual workers. Third, we can spend it on the local needs of the local church. Fourth, we can take care of the needs of other local churches. Fifth, we can take care of the needs of the work in our own region. Sixth, we can take care of the needs of the work of other regions.</p><h2 class="head1">WAYS TO DISPOSE OF MONEY<br />RECEIVED FROM THE REGION</h2><p>There are also six ways to take care of money received from the regions of work. First, we can use it on the poor within the region. Second, we can use it on individual workers within the region. Third, we can take care of the need of the work in the region. Fourth, we can take care of the need of the work in other regions. Fifth, we can take care of the churches within the region. Sixth, we can take care of the churches in other regions.</p><p>In handling the distribution of funds, we have an opportunity to experience God's guidance and the Spirit's discipline in many ways. This exercise requires faith, love, and the leading of the Holy Spirit. Every worker must continue to look to the Lord and must continue to exercise faith. The personal walk of faith, which we spoke of in the past, is still necessary. However, in addition to this individual faith, we also need corporate faith. Individual needs must be met by individuals alone. For the church or the work to take care of such a need would only damage the faith of the individuals.</p><p>As to my personal needs, as well as the needs of the work directly under me, such as the expenses of this training, I will never receive anything from the local churches or the work.</p><p>In handing over one's possessions, we would like to see the matter conducted properly in the church. While we do not want anyone to exhibit his consecration, we do want men to testify of their experience. The church does not dictate how the brothers and sisters should dispose of their wealth; it can be done according to any of the above six ways. (This refers to the brothers and sisters who have handed themselves over to the church.) In order to have a proper testimony in this matter, we need witnesses. A believer acts for the purpose of testimony and fellowship, not for boasting. This is like the Lord's death; it was not a boasting, but a testimony. Worldly men, however, die for their friends for the purpose of boasting. In the Gospels the Lord said that we should not let the left hand know what the right hand is doing, but by the time of Acts things had changed. There must be a proper testimony. Of course, one does not publicize his acts with a loud gong. Our acceptance of the Lord and our faith in Him are mysteries, but baptism is a concrete step we take. When something is concrete, it is certain, like cement mixed with water. Love is abstract, but marriage is concrete. A person may experience a change in a hidden way, but when we ask this person to stand up to testify, his change becomes certain. Personally, I am disinclined to ask others to stand up. If anyone encourages men to stand up, however, I certainly have no objection to this exercise. Any concrete or "mechanical" act is sure and trustworthy. Spiritual things cannot remain spiritual; they have to become concrete and "mechanical." We may say that we are following the example of 2 Corinthians 8 and 9, but who knows how much we have offered up and how much we have held back? No one makes an audit of our account, and no one is there to be our accountant. The best thing for us to do is to make a public confession. Once we make a public confession, we turn our action into something concrete. Many people are visible when they walk in but become invisible when they walk out. Our Lord, however, came visibly and left visibly. It is wrong to walk in visibly and walk out invisibly. We have to pay attention to the "mechanical" side of things, not merely the spiritual side. Once we take care of the "mechanical" things, we make our actions concrete. For the sake of testimony in the conscience, we should make public confessions.</p><p>In summary, we have to see that the love of mammon and our service to it is the root of all sins. If a man tolerates mammon, it will be easy for him to indulge in the flesh. Wherever mammon is, there is pride and greed. We must be delivered absolutely from the influence of mammon.</p>
