In order to perfume something, one must first absorb the element and then spread the aroma. She first has to have the inward experience and then the outward expression. On the one hand, she puts on the fragrance of Christ; on the other hand, she spreads this fragrance.</P><P>"Myrrh" refers to Christ's suffering and death. She has perfumed herself with myrrh, which indicates that she has subjectively experienced the cross. She has now passed through the experience of Philippians 3:10.</P><P>"Frankincense." The emphasis is on the fragrance. Myrrh denotes death, whereas frankincense denotes resurrection. Frankincense refers to the Lord's life, in particular, His prayer life. It also refers to Christ's virtues, which God considers most fragrant. It is interesting to note that the Lord first lived and then died; whereas we first receive His death and then live His earthly life. Hence, there is first myrrh and then frankincense.</P><P>"All powders of the merchant." "Merchant" is singular here. Together with Matthew 13:45, we can see that the merchant refers to the Lord Jesus. The maiden not only has the myrrh and frankincense, but also everything that comes from the Lord Jesus, that is, everything the Lord can sell. As a merchant He cannot give away anything for free. Hence, she has to obtain everything with a price. (In Matthew 13:45, the Lord is buying; in this verse He is selling.) She has paid a great price to buy everything from the Lord. "Powders" seems to supplement the myrrh and frankincense.</P><P>Verses 7 and 8 say, "Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel. They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night." The word "fear" in verse 8 can be translated as "warning." The answer is interesting. The question in verse 6 concerns the maiden, whereas the answer concerns the King.</P><P>What does the "bed" refer to? It refers to Solomon's victory. A bed is something for the night, the time when darkness reigns. There should be no rest when darkness reigns. Yet Solomon was able to have his bed. The night was not void of warnings, yet he could still have his bed. Hence, this refers to Christ's victory and how He has overcome the power of darkness.</P><P>Around the bed are sixty valiant men, every one of them has a sword; the swords are upon their thighs, and they are experts in war. They are all valiant men of Israel. All of these expressions mean that the bed of Solomon is ready to deal with the warnings in the night. It can deal with anything that happens and control any kind of situation. In other words, no enemy can shake Solomon from his repose in victory. The valiant men represent Solomon's power. He has the power to deal with all of his enemies. He still has his bed, which means that he is more than a conqueror. The question concerns the maiden, whereas the answer concerns Solomon. This indicates the oneness between the maiden and Solomon. Whatever is Solomon's is hers; this is union. The union between the maiden and the victory of Christ speaks of our enjoyment of Christ's victory over Satan. Moreover, there are many angels today who are ready to fight for the victory of Christ. The victory has been won already; they are just maintaining this victory. He is King already; they are just upholding His victory.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Song of Songs &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
