   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS REQUIRING US TO LOSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUR SELF-IDENTITY, CONCEPTS, AND TASTES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN ORDER TO BE BUILT UP WITH OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be the genuine testimony of Jesus will cost us everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Can we say that we are the testimony of Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we were the testimony of Jesus, we would not be able to be worldly, and we would not be able to argue much with our husband or wife.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To not quarrel, in itself, does not constitute us to be the testimony of Jesus, but anyone who is a part of the testimony of Jesus cannot remain in a quarrel with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Likewise, a brother in the testimony of Jesus will not be able to have improperly long hair 1 Cor 11:7, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As long as a brother still has improperly long hair, he is not practically a part of the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If he loves all of the saints and behaves himself in a humble, nice, and kind way, we may consider him to be a good brother.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, the fact that his hair is too long is a sign that he is still holding on to his taste, which means that he cannot be built together with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To cut our hair is a small thing in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is crucial is that whoever holds on to his own taste needs to be crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It must be no longer I with my tastes Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must not hold on to anything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The I with our concepts and tastes must be over.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If this is the case, it will be easy to be built with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Someone may seem like a good brother in the church, but in what way is he good?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Is he simply gracious, a good husband, and one who comes to all the meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, a brother must be good in being built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have learned a lesson from observing good brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes the nicest ones are the strongest ones to dissent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The nicer someone is, the more difficult he may be to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is because many good ones are natural and hold on to their concepts and tastes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They love the Lord and the church, but they never lose their individual identity to be built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Different pieces of gold may be round, square, or rectangular, but when they are beaten together into one golden lampstand, they lose their identity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the building up of the church, we all need to lose our identity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Otherwise, we may still be pieces of gold, but we are not the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must all see that what the Lord desires today is not wonderful pieces of gold, even the best pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Someone may be a wonderful piece of gold, but in a sense, this is his problem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Simply because he is so wonderful, he would not be built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to say, Lord, have mercy upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I do not want to be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I do not want to be the best one, and I do not want to be anything special.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I want only to be built up in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Lord, I wish to lose my identity to be a part of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be the lampstands as the testimony of Jesus is the goal of God s eternal purpose, and this is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As long as we are in the golden lampstands, we surely are saved, and it is here also that we become holy, spiritual, heavenly, and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be a part of the testimony of Jesus costs us our everything, but in actuality all that we are and have are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are nothing, and we have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be the testimony of Jesus requires us to be lost and nullified.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What God wants today is the testimony of Jesus, which is the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every local church is a lampstand, bearing Christ as the lamp shining for God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Someone may come to the meetings, but he still may not be built in. I have seen certain good saints who were in the church, but later they stayed away from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Revelation 3:12 says that the pillars in the temple shall by no means go out anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once we are built into the temple as a pillar, we can never get out.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we could pull ourselves out of the church, it means we have never been built into it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The only way to take out a part of a building is to tear down the whole building.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we mean business with the Lord to have the local church, we can never get out of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE EPISTLES TO THE SEVEN CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>IN REVELATION REVEALING</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE CONDITION OF JUDAISM, CATHOLICISM, PROTESTANTISM, AND THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Revelation 2:1-7 speaks concerning the church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This church had good behavior, strong faith, and many works for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, it was rebuked for not enjoying the Lord adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church in Ephesus had lost the enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We know this from verse 7, in which the Lord says, To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To eat of the tree of life is to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The peril and danger today is that we may have good behavior, strong faith, and many good works for the Lord, but we may not enjoy Him very much.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord does not care how much we do for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He cares for how much we eat Him and enjoy Him daily.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is the tree of life for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the past, I heard many messages charging me to have good behavior, strong faith, and do many works for the Lord, but I never heard a message telling me that I need to eat the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We may have done many works for the Lord, but how is our enjoyment of Him?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do we enjoy the Lord Jesus day by day?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Every morning the first thing we should do is eat the Lord Jesus and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We all need to forget about what we do for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Instead, we need to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Nothing pleases Him as much as our eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The more we eat Him, the happier He is.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Verses 8 through 11 speak of the church in Smyrna.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Because the church there suffered persecution, the Lord spoke nothing against them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In this epistle is the first mention of the synagogue of Satan v. 9 . A synagogue is a place where the Jews worship God, but the synagogue has become something of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This indicates that Judaism had become something satanic, the synagogue of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In this same principle, the cathedrals, chapels, and sanctuaries of Christianity today are also not truly something of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The third church is the church in Pergamos vv.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>12-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Here is the place where Satan s throne is v. 13 . The place of Satan s throne is the place where Satan is the king, ruling and reigning over the world.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In other words, in the church in Pergamos there is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Pergamos signifies the worldly church, the church that is married to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is difficult to discern many of today s Christians, since they appear the same as the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In their shopping, housing, and dress they are the same as the people in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Many Christians are worldly, dwelling in the place where Satan s throne is, the place where he dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Judaism is satanic, and worldliness also is satanic.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In the fourth church, the church in Thyatira, there is the woman Jezebel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>18-29 , signifying the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Just as Judaism is satanic, the Catholic Church today is demonic.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Jews do not worship idols in their synagogues, but the Catholic cathedrals are full of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I spent much time to study the situation in Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When I was in Manila, I visited a Catholic cathedral there.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I was surprised to see all the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Under one idol, an image of a certain saint, was a note, saying that if someone prays to her several times a day, the sufferings of a relative in purgatory would be relieved.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>What a superstition this is!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It is demonic.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Frequently in these places there is also the idol of the holy mother.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Can we say that those Catholic cathedrals are something of God?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>They are not only satanic but also demonic.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Verse 20 says that Jezebel teaches and leads the Lord s slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Fornication is an evil sister of idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Where there is idolatry, there is always fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The second through fourth epistles in Revelation 2 speak of Judaism, worldliness, and Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>In chapter 3 we come to Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Verse 1 says that although the church in Sardis has a name that it is living, it is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The characteristic of Protestantism is deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Furthermore, verse 20 says, Behold, I stand at the door and knock.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This is not the door of individual persons; it is the door of the church in lukewarmness, which we also see in today s Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We need to realize that the Lord is not in Protestantism; He is outside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Therefore, Judaism is satanic, Catholicism is demonic, and Protestantism is filled with deadness and is without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It preaches and teaches Christ in name, but it does not have Christ in actuality.</S>
