   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE ECONOMY OF GOD Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26; Isa 9:6; John 1:1, 14, 29; 14:9-10, 17-20; Matt 28:19; 1 Cor 15:45b; Eph 3:14-19; 2 Cor 13:14; Rev 1:4-5; 22:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have covered these two points the mystery and the economy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that this economy is to carry out the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without the economy, God's mystery could never be brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first aspect of God's economy is to dispense Himself into all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Dispensing does not mean primarily a period of time but a kind of doing, a kind of action.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is doing a wonderful work to dispense Himself into His chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the first aspect of God's economy is the aspect of dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE TRIUNE GOD IN GENESIS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is so strange that on the first page of the Bible God is revealed as the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we would study Genesis chapter one in Hebrew, we could see that the title used for God is not a singular noun.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is a triple noun.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" Gen 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God in this sentence is triple in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, in verse 26 of the same chapter, God used the pronoun "our" to denote Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means something very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is one God, yet He is triple.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a mystery!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Genesis 1:26 we see that first He said, "Let us."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was talking to Himself and called Himself "us."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That was a time before the creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He did not talk to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Surely the angels would not be implied here.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He called Himself "us."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then verse 27 says, "So God created man in His own image."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Our image" eventually is "His image."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now, is God plural or singular?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When God came to the point where He was related to man, He revealed Himself in such a triune way, denoting that He is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the initial stage in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE FATHER IN ETERNITY, THE SON IN TIME</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We then come to Isaiah 9:6 which tells us, "Unto us a son is given."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is no more objective; now God becomes quite subjective to us because a Son is given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A Son is given to us, yet this Son is called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This Son given to us is called "the Father of eternity."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the proper translation according to the Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Father, the everlasting Father, is the Father of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This Son given to us in time is the very Father who was there in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There in eternity He was the Father, and here in time, in our age, He is given as the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now, is He the Father or the Son, the Son or the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that end of eternity He was the Father, and at this end of the age He is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is both because there are two ends.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is hardly anything which can exist with just one end. For example, a lampstand has a bottom end and seven lamps on the top.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The bottom end is one, and the top end is seven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why in the Bible there are eventually seven Spirits, and these seven Spirits are just the seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the one hand, the lampstand is one, on the other hand it is seven; so it is both.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the eternal side or end, God is the Father, and at this end of the age as the One given to us, He is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Son is always the expression, and the Father is always the source.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we pray, we do not pray, "Son," but we pray, "Father."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We receive the Son, yet we call Him Father.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A Son is given, and His name is called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We Christians do not say, "We believe in the Father, and we receive the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We say, "We believe in the Son, and we receive the Son."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet 1 John 2:23 says that he who has the Son has the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We believe in the Son, and we receive the Son, yet whosoever receives the Son has the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After you receive the Son and pray to the Father, you should not leave the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Son is given to you, and the Son brings you to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In our Christian experience we don't pray to the Son, we pray to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Son given to us is called the Father of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the way that God dispenses Himself into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He was the very divine source, so He was the Father in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is called the Father of eternity, but for Him to dispense Himself into humanity, He must be a Son given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hence, John 3:16 says, "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God has given His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do not consider that this Son is separate from God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This Son given to us is none less than God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When you receive the Son, you just receive God, and in your prayer you do not call Him Son, but you call Him Father.</S>
