ORIGINATING FROM EXODUS</h2>
<p>Let us consider the title <em>elder</em> and the eldership. These two matters were first spoken of in the Old Testament. In Genesis, the first book of the Old Testament, the record is mainly regarding individuals. Genesis speaks of eight great figures&mdash;Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Their history, however, does not reveal much regarding the corporate aspect of God&rsquo;s people. Although this aspect is briefly touched upon in the record of the age of Noah, it is addressed in a superficial way. Noah was then followed by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Beginning with Jacob, the corporate aspect began to come into view more clearly. After Jacob, the record in Genesis no longer speaks of individuals; rather, it speaks of the twelve sons of Jacob becoming the twelve tribes of Israel and these twelve tribes becoming a nation. At this point, the corporate aspect appears.</p>
<p>In Exodus, the second book of the Old Testament, the age of individuals becomes the age of a corporate body. Exodus speaks of the kingdom. Exodus 19:6 says, &ldquo;You shall be to Me a kingdom of priests.&rdquo; A kingdom surely refers to something corporate. Since a kingdom is a corporate body, it must have an administration. It cannot avoid the issue. Exodus not only says that God decreed the law but also speaks of a corporate body, a kingdom. Without a corporate body, a kingdom, there would be no need for the law. Hence, the law is necessary because a nation, a kingdom, is a corporate body that needs a government. The basis of this government is the law.</p>
<p>Throughout the six thousand years of human history, regardless of man&rsquo;s experiences, changes, and studies, law has always been the foremost matter. Hence, in a kingdom there is a great need for law. In Exodus there is a kingdom involving the matters of law and administration. In human government there is often a legislative and executive branch. According to Exodus, the administration in the Old Testament depended upon a group of elders. The title <em>elder</em> first appears in Exodus 3:16. Chapter 24 later speaks of &ldquo;seventy of the elders of Israel&rdquo; (vv. 1, 9). Hence, a corporate body of elders, or an eldership, was formed in Exodus. Both the title <em>elder</em> and the eldership, a corporate body of elders, are first spoken of in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Although elders are spoken of in the Old Testament, this does not mean that they cease to exist in the New Testament. Some teach that everything in the Old Testament comes to an end in the New Testament. Those who say this must be very careful; God is in the Old Testament, and God is also in the New Testament. Likewise, the heavens and the earth are in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. Knowing the Bible is not an easy matter; one should not simply repeat what others say but must study the Bible carefully. The heavens, the earth, God, the promise of the gospel, and many other items are found in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. In Galatians 3:8 Paul clearly says that, even as far back as at Abraham&rsquo;s time, God announced the gospel to Abraham. God announced the gospel to Abraham in Genesis 12:3, saying that in Abraham all the families of the earth would be blessed. This gospel did not cease to exist in the New Testament simply because it was preached in the Old Testament; on the contrary, this gospel is greatly developed and enriched in the New Testament. The promise God gave Abraham in the Old Testament is the basis of the gospel in the New Testament. Hence, the New Testament gospel did not begin with John the Baptist; rather, it began long ago in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, we must learn to know the principles and the facts and to see that God&rsquo;s intention is consistent. From Genesis to Revelation, from eternity past to eternity future, God&rsquo;s intention has been consistent and has never changed. Nevertheless, there are some particular considerations and needs that are reflected in the various procedures, dispensations, and ages. For this reason, a door was opened for the law that was neither the front door nor the back door but a door added alongside (Rom. 5:20); this means that the law was not the starting point of God&rsquo;s economy. Galatians 3:19 says that the law was added by God because of the transgressions of man. Nevertheless, God&rsquo;s intention, from Adam to the New Jerusalem, has always been the same. I hope that those who read the Bible are able to see this point.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
