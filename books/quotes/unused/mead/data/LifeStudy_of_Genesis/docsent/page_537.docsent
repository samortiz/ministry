   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE NINETY-FIVE BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have pointed out many times, the book of Genesis is a book of seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nearly every item in this book is a seed developed in the following books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is true also with the matter of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message, another parenthesis in our life-study, we shall consider the seed of blessing sown in Genesis and its development in the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. THE PRINCIPLE OF BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hebrews 7:7 says, "But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this verse we see the principle of blessing: that the greater blesses the lesser.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be greater or lesser is not mainly a matter of age.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is a matter of the measure of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are greater or lesser according to our measure of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Matthew 11:11 the Lord Jesus said, "Truly I say to you, Among those born of women, there has not arisen a greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is smallest in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here the Lord Jesus says that John the Baptist was greater than all who had preceded him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The reason John was greater than his predecessors was that he was very close to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although Abraham was great, he did not see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, John the Baptist saw Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But, although John was so close to Christ, he did not have Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those in the kingdom of heaven are not only close to Christ; they have Christ within them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The great ones in the Old Testament could say that Christ was coming, and John the Baptist could say that Christ was in front of him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But all of us in the kingdom of heaven can say that Christ is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can even say, "For to me to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, we are closer to Christ than John the Baptist and all who went before him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whether we are greater or lesser depends upon our measure of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you have more of Christ, you are greater.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you have less of Christ, you are lesser.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If by having more of Christ we are greater than others, then we are qualified to bless them; for the greater always blesses the lesser.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reason for this is that the greater one has a larger measure of Christ to give to others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you are greater than I, it means that you have a greater portion of Christ than I. If so, then you have something more of Christ to minister to me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To bless others means to minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who have just a small measure of Christ need the blessing of those who have a greater measure.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We bless them with the very Christ in whom we participate and whom we enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we enjoy Christ more, then we have more of Christ to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This ministering of Christ is blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE MEANING OF BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is rather difficult to give a proper definition of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Years ago I could only say the blessing was asking or wishing something good for others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But after years of experience I can say that blessing is the overflow of God through someone's maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God cannot flow Himself into others without a human channel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If Christ had never been incarnated, God would not have been able to flow to man, because there would not have been a channel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's flowing needs humanity as a channel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The only humanity God can use as the channel is one saturated and permeated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason Jacob did not bless anyone until he had become mature.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Jacob did not bless Laban or Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even when he saw his brother Esau after the twenty years with Laban, he did not bless him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It was not until he went down into Egypt that he blessed Pharaoh, the highest ruler on earth 47:7, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At that time Jacob was filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Through Jacob's blessing of Pharaoh God's blessing overflowed to Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A child two years of age cannot bless anyone; however, a child of seven or eight may perform some kind of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This illustrates the fact that blessing others depends upon maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Maturity in life is a matter of being filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When you are full of God, you have the overflow of God, and thus you are able to bless everyone you meet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Years ago I could not say such a word about blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This understanding of blessing does not come from reading books; it comes only from experience.</S>
