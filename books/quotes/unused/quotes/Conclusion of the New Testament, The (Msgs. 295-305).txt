In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in the Epistles
Romans first shows us that for our experience and enjoyment the Lord's status is of two natures, human and divine
These two natures of Christ's person are indicated by the two titles of Christ in Romans 1:1-4-seed of David and Son of God
In chapter 1 of Romans we see Christ as a wonderful person with two naturesdivine and humanand in the last chapter we see the local churches
The gospel of God is thus God's entire New Testament economy, and the center of this gospel of God is Jesus Christ the God-man
Romans 1:3-4 gives us Christ, God's Son, as the prototype, and 8:29-30 unveils the many sons as the mass production
Jesus a name given by God is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua which means Jehovah the Savior or the salvation of Jehovah
His commission is to accomplish God's eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second advent
Whenever we turn to our spirit and call upon the name of the Lord, we should enthrone the Lord, giving Him the lordship in us
The two occurrences of according to in 1:3-4 show that the Lord has two essences-the human essence and the divine essence
For this reason, Christ could be of two natures; He could be at the same time divine and human as well as human and divine
Flesh refers not to created man-man as originally created by God-but to fallen man-man who became flesh through the fall
When Christ became flesh as the seed of David, He became a man in the likeness, the form, of fallen man but without the sinful nature
When Christ became flesh, He was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin and did not have the sin of the flesh
Christ was made in 'the likeness of the flesh of sin,' but He did not participate in any way in the sin of the flesh
Regarding the Lord's status as the Son of God, there was a great controversy among the Jews when He was on the earth
They thought that Christ was blaspheming God because they believed that He was not the Son of God but merely a man in the flesh
According to Romans 1:4, when He entered into resurrection, He was designated in power as the Son of God in His humanity
Unlike the resurrection of Lazarus and of others , the resurrection of Christ was not common but very particular
There was no need for Christ to be designated as the Son of Man, because when people saw Him, they immediately recognized that He was a man
There was a need for Him to be designated the Son of God because the Son of God was concealed in Him as the Son of Man
By incarnation He brought God into man; by resurrection He brought man into God, that is, He brought His humanity into the divine sonship
In this way the only begotten Son of God was made the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity
We too will be designated and revealed as the sons of God, as He was in the glory of His resurrection , and with Him we will express God
In His resurrection Christ in His humanity was designated the Son of God, not in mere word but in power according to the Spirit of holiness
The phrase in power in Romans 14 corresponds with 1 Peter 318 which says that Christs flesh was put to death but His Spirit was made alive
We need to walk according to the Spirit, set our mind on the Spirit, and by the Spirit put to death the practices of the body
Designation is by resurrection, which includes sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification
The more we touch the Spirit, the more we enjoy resurrection and the more we are sanctified, transformed, and glorified
The more we contact the Lord by calling upon His name, the more we sense His presence and the more we are conscious of His anointing within
The kind of teachings we need today are those regarding how we are designated by enjoying and experiencing Christ as the life-power
We have pointed out that even the Lord Jesus as a man according to the flesh had to be designated the Son of God
Before His designation, according to the flesh He was only the seed of David; in that part of His being He was not yet the Son of God
The way to be designated sons of God is not to acquire more teachings; it is to have our being according to the mingled spirit
Christ with God our Father is the source of this grace and peace; both Christ and the Father are the source of grace and peace
These verses show that the believers are justified by God and receive the righteousness of God through the redemption of Christ
The requirements of God's holiness, righteousness, and glory were so great upon us that it was impossible for us to fulfill them
God is bound by His righteousness to justify us because of the redemption of Christ, which meets all His requirements
Through the redemption of Christ not only are the believers justified by God, but they also receive Christ as the righteousness of God
The problem that kept us from God, that made it impossible for us to have direct fellowship with Him, was our sins
The propitiating blood sprinkled upon the propitiation cover met the requirements of the righteous law and of God's glory
The problem between man and God was appeased, enabling God to forgive and be merciful to man and thereby to give His grace to man
In the Septuagint this word is translated hilasterion, which means 'the place of propitiation,' implying to forgive and to give mercy
The King James Version adopts the rendering 'mercy seat,' referring to the place where God grants mercy to man
In Romans 325 the same word hilasterion is used to show that the lid of the Ark signifies Christ as the propitiation place set forth by God
Before we knew of this place, we may have been frightened by the thought of approaching God; however, now we are no longer afraid of Him
On the third day God resurrected Him; this resurrection was also a part of the process of God's setting forth of Christ
God set forth Christ through the entire process of His crucifixion resurrection and ascension in which He sat down at the right hand of God
The throne of grace is the cover of the Ark on which Christ sprinkled the blood He shed on the cross for our redemption
Now whenever we meet with God upon Christ as the propitiation place, we have the sense deep within that we are washed by the blood of Christ
Because His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, was put to death by Him on the cross on our behalf, He is legally obligated to forgive us
If anyone believes in Christ, according to His righteousness God must be propitiated toward him, forgive him, and receive him
If God were to receive a sinner without the propitiatory cover with the blood sprinkled on it, He would make Himself unrighteous
Christ came and died to be not only the sin offering and trespass offering for us, but also the sacrifice for our propitiation before God
Now that we are upon Christ as the propitiation place, if God does not receive us, God will make Himself unrighteous
You have accepted His death, have resurrected Him from among the dead, and have set Him forth as the propitiation place
In summary, in this universe the Lord Jesus has been set forth as the propitiation place, and all sinners may come to meet God upon Him
The law has been silenced; it can no longer speak against us, but the glory of God can rejoice over us with satisfaction
In Romans 425 we see that Christ is the factor of our justification Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification
Because we have offenses against God, Christ was delivered on the cross for us in order to satisfy God's righteous requirements
Since the death of Christ has fulfilled and fully satisfied God's righteous requirements, we are justified by God through His death
By believing in Him, we have received Christ as our objective righteousness and are objectively justified before God
The death of Christ gave us a positional justification, and the resurrected Christ in the heavens is a proof of this
As the factor of our justification Christ was delivered on the cross because of our offenses in order to satisfy Gods righteous requirements
We are still on the way toward God and that our journey into God through our being justified out of faith has not yet been completed
The faith that justifies us and cuts off the flesh with its natural energy and effort also gives us access into God's grace
Although we stand in grace and walk in peace, we are not yet in glory, but the day will come when we shall be brought into glory
The hope of the glory of God will be fully realized in the coming millennial kingdom, where Christ will be revealed as our glory
In Romans 5:8-9 Paul says, 'God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us
John 2:2 says, 'He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world'
The Lord Jesus offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins , not only for our redemption but also for God's satisfaction
Through the redeeming death of Christ, God has justified us, the sinners, and has reconciled us, His enemies, to Himself
On the one hand, we have been reconciled to God; on the other hand, we still need to be saved in the life of God's Son
Christ as the Redeemer and the Reconciler died for us once for all, but Christ as the Life-Savior is for our entire life
The life of Christ within us not only saves us throughout our entire lifetime but also causes us to boast, exult, and glory in God
In 511 Paul says Not only so but also boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have now received the reconciliation
The grace of God and the gift in grace of the one man have abounded to the many unto justification out of many offenses
The justification out of many offenses mentioned in verse 16 is the justification of life to all men mentioned in verse 18
Through justification we have come up to the standard of Gods righteousness and correspond with it so that now He can impart His life to us
Justification unto life indicates that justification results in life and that the organic union of life is an issue of justification
We are saved in life to the extent that the life we have received enthrones us as kings to reign over all things
Those who receive the abundance of grace are able to reign in life, for life issues out of the abundance of grace
To reign is to conquer, subdue, and rule over Satan, the world, sin, the flesh, ourselves, and all our environmental circumstances
Nothing can separate us from the love of Christ because we are more than conquerors over all the troubles in our environment
Our Christian life today should not only be a victorious and overcoming life; it should also be a kingly and reigning life
In the universe only God reigns and only He is the King, but we as the children of this King can also reign in His life
The obedience of Christ has constituted us righteous that is through His obedience graceGod personifiedcomes to give us life and enjoyment
God's grace with the gift in grace of Christ-the gift of righteousness-has justified us that we may have life and reign in life
The issue of our present reigning in life will be the New Jerusalem as the universal incorporation of God and man
Grace as God will reign in the New Jerusalem; hence, the New Jerusalem is the consummation of God reigning as grace
Romans 5:12-21 gives us a comparison between sin and grace; there are two lines with two issues and two results
Out of grace issues the gift, and the gift results in justification not only of life but eventually unto eternal life
The result of the line of Satan is death; the result of the line of God is life-it is both of life and unto life
Through baptism we are immersed into Christ, taking Him as our realm, that we may be united with Him as one in His death and resurrection
We were born in one person, Adam, but when we believed and were baptized, we entered into another person, Christ
Baptism is an act in which we put the members of Adam into death, thereby transferring them out of Adam into Christ
Through identification with Christ in His death and resurrection, we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ
On the one hand, we have been baptized into Christ's person; on the other hand, we have been baptized into His death
It is significant that in 6:3 Paul says that we have been baptized not into Christ's resurrection but into His death
Romans 6:4 continues, 'Just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life'
When we are immersed in the water, we enter into death, but when we come out of the water, we enter into resurrection
Verse 5 says For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection
The Greek word translated as 'grown together' is used in Luke 8:7 to speak of the thorns that grew up together with the wheat
When we preach the word we must have faith that we are preaching the word of Jehovah the word of the living God and the word of Jesus Christ
For him to be put into the Triune God in this way is for him to grow with Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God
After a new convert believes in the Lord Jesus, we should baptize him immediately, believing in the effectiveness of baptism
Although the significance of baptism is quite meaningful, very few who are baptized today truly appreciate its significance
When we go to contact people to preach the gospel, we must have the faith that the gospel we are preaching is the living word
When we were baptized we grew together with Christ in the likeness of His death now through His death we are growing into His resurrection
Just as the element of Christ's death is found only in Him, so the element of Christ's resurrection is found only in Christ Himself
Through the organic union of two trees, accomplished by grafting, the one tree partakes of the life and characteristic of the other tree
In this grafting, that is, in the organic union with Christ, whatever Christ passed through has become our history
Now Christ as the life-giving Spirit moves in us, searching our inner being, enlightening us so that we repent
When we believe and are baptized, we are grafted into Him and grow together with Him in the likeness of His death
Once we are thus grafted into Him, His resurrection life comes into us and removes all the negative elements within
He uplifts the original functions given to us at creation, and enriches, strengthens, and even saturates our whole being
As a believer experiences a proper baptism, the divine Spirit within him puts to death the old man with his worldly, sinful elements
After he comes out of the water of baptism a new person he begins to live and walk in the newness of life in the newness of His resurrection
The old man is our very being, which was created by God but became fallen through sin; it is the same as the first 'I' in Galatians 2:20
It is the body indwelt, occupied, corrupted, possessed, utilized, and enslaved by sin so that it does sinful things
The believers old man has been crucified with Him that the body of sin might be of no effect that they should no longer serve sin as slaves
Romans 6:10 says, 'For the death which He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life which He lives, He lives to God'
By faith we come out of the water, and in resurrection we allow the resurrected Christ to live in us that we may live by Him and with Him
A great many believers, although they have been Christians for many years, may never have heard that they have Christ as their Husband
A widow has been stripped and robbed of all her enjoyment; she has lost everything of the enjoyment of human life
Surely all genuine Christians have Christ as their Husband, yet it is pitiful that many of them do not know Him as their Husband
The first husband is not the flesh or the law but the old man mentioned in 6:6, who has been crucified with Christ
Because fallen man left his proper position as God's wife and desired to be the husband, God gave him the law, which he cannot possibly keep
When we were baptized into the death of Christ, we were identified with Him in His death, in which our old man was crucified and died
In Romans 7:4b, Paul says, 'That you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God'
To take God as our Husband means to terminate all that we are, have, and do and to trust in God for everything
When a person believes and is baptized into the Triune God he becomes involved with another person that is he marries another person Christ
Before he believes and is baptized, he is involved with only one person, for he has only himself as his person, that is, his old man
In His death, we as the old man died, and in His resurrection, we as the regenerated new man were raised with Him
Since our old man has been crucified with Christ, we are freed from the law, which was given to the old man, and we are living to God
We have to realize that in 6:4 we have the newness of life for our living; in 7:6 we have the newness of spirit for our service
Newness of life issues from our being identified with Christ's resurrection and is for our walk in our daily life
Newness of spirit issues from our being discharged from the law and being joined to the resurrected Christ and is for our service to God
The spirit in the phrase newness of spirit refers to our regenerated human spirit, in which the Lord as the Spirit dwells
Everything that is related to our regenerated spirit is new, and everything that comes out of our spirit is new
Our regenerated spirit is a source of newness because the Lord, the life of God, and the Holy Spirit are there
Paul had no condemnation because he experienced freedom from the law of sin and of death by the law of the Spirit of life
The law of sin refers to the power to commit sin that arises spontaneously in man, causing man to become a slave of sin
Romans 7:23 shows the warfare that occurs between the law of sin in the members of our body and the law of good in the mind of our soul
Whenever the law of God demands us to do good, the law of good in our soul responds, trying to comply with the law of God
Sin energizes the fallen body to sin whereas death utterly weakens and disables the corrupted body so that it cannot keep Gods commandments
We have God Himself who is life to us in Christ and as the Spirit, and with this life comes the most powerful law
He had a deep conviction of this inward, subjective condemnation, but now 'in Christ Jesus' there is no longer this kind of condemnation
In Christ, not in Adam or in ourselves, we have the Spirit of life-who is Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit-in our spirit
Because we are in Christ, the Spirit of life who is Christ Himself dwells in our spirit and mingles Himself with our spirit as one spirit
Romans 8:2 tells us that the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed us from the law of sin and of death
The law that has freed us from the law of sin, which is of Satan, who dwells in the members of our fallen body , is of this Spirit of life
As a man in the flesh, Christ had only the likeness, the form, of a fallen man; He did not have the sinful nature of a fallen man
When Christ died on the cross, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not have the nature of the flesh of sin
Romans 8:3 reveals that when the flesh of Christ, that is, His body, was crucified, God condemned sin which is in human flesh
In particular, chapter 7 reveals that sin is a person, the embodiment of Satan, and is living and acting within us
When the flesh that Christ put on through incarnation was crucified, God condemned the sin in the flesh of fallen mankind
On the cross He judged Satan, who is related to the flesh, and the world, which hangs on him , thereby destroying Satan
At the same time, through Christ's crucifixion in the flesh, God condemned sin, which was brought by Satan into man's flesh
God condemned sin in the flesh that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk according to the spirit
For once we drift back to our old habitual way of trying to do good we are insulated immediately from the powerful law of the Spirit of life
We should look to the Lord that we may always abide in our spirit so that we may enjoy the freedom of the law of the Spirit of life
In verse 17 the Lord Jesus spoke to the disciples regarding the Spirit of reality: 'He abides with you and shall be in you'
The Christ who was in the flesh went through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ
In Romans 8:9 Paul says, 'You are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you
The Spirit of God implies that this Spirit is of the One who was from eternity past who created the universe and is the origin of all things
He includes not only divinity, which He possessed from eternity, but also humanity, which He obtained through incarnation
In our experience of Him, He is the Spirit; in our worshipping of Him, calling on Him, and speaking of Him, He is Christ
The Spirit of Christ is also the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead, dwelling in us to give life to our mortal body
We have the entire Triune God-the One who raised Jesus from the dead, Christ Jesus, and His Spirit who indwells you
In this way He gives His life to our mortal, dying body, not only to heal it but also that it may be enlivened to carry out His will
If there were no Spirit of Christ, or if Christ were not the Spirit, there would be no way for us to be joined to Him and to belong to Him
That we are of Christ refers to the unchangeable source and position rather than to the changeable condition and experience
We have the Spirit of Christ according to the source, the new birth; hence, we are of Christ and belong to Him
Since He is the Heir of God, even the legal Heir of God, all that God the Father is and has is for His possession
Christ, the firstborn Son of God, is the appointed Heir of God, and we, the many sons of God, have been saved to be joint heirs with Christ
Most Christians have heard of Christ being the only Begotten of God, but very few have heard of Christ being the Firstborn of God
In His divinity and with His humanity that passed through death and resurrection, He was born in resurrection as God's firstborn Son
After He became a man with humanity in His incarnation, He, as the Son of Man, was born to be the firstborn Son of God in His resurrection
These verses indicate that after Christ resurrected from the dead, He came back to His disciples and called them brothers
He also considered them the church, indicating that the church is a corporate composition of the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God
As the only begotten Son of God, Christ had divinity but not humanity; He was self-existing and ever-existing, as God is
The church today is a miniature of this expression , and the New Jerusalem in eternity will be the ultimate manifestation of this expression
According to Romans 8:29, we have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of Christ, the Firstborn of God
Both the inward and the outward changes in us, the product, are the result of the operation of the law of the Spirit of life in our being
Formerly, we as men had only humanity, but when we believed into Christ and received Him, we received His divinity
It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us'
As the Spirit , He is omnipresent, being both at the right hand of God and in our spirit, both in heaven and on earth
No suffering including tribulation, anguish, persecution, famine, nakedness, and peril shall separate us from the love of Christ
The first eight chapters of Romans reveal that Christ has divinity and eternal deity, and that the divine person of Christ is in the Godhead
It is as the Spirit of Christ that He can, and does, enter into His believers to be their life, their life supply, and their everything
Christ as a God-man became the life-giving Spirit, and we as men are one spirit with Him and thus may always enjoy Him
We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that our Lord Jesus Christ is the very God who is over all and blessed forever
Romans 95 says Whose are the fathers and out of whom as regards what is according to flesh is the Christ who is God over all blessed forever
The fathers here refers to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and others; according to His human nature, Christ came out of the children of Israel
It is according to His humanity that Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever, could come from the fathers of Israel
Although in His humanity Christ came out of the fathers of Israel according to flesh, in His Godhead He is God over all, blessed forever
No one can deny the truth that although Christ was incarnated to be a man, Christ is God Himself over all, blessed forever
It is a shame that certain so-called Christians argue about the deity of Christ and debate whether or not Christ is God
Twisting the Holy Scriptures, some believe that although Christ was a perfectly good man, He was not the complete God
Whatever God is, has, has done, has obtained, has attained, is doing, will do, will obtain, and will attain are all embodied in Christ
In Christ we see creation, incarnation, redemption, resurrection, ascension, and the dispensing of the Triune God into us for our enjoyment
In keeping with this thought, the apostle John in 1 John 2:22 says, 'Who is the liar if not he who denies that Jesus is the Christ?
To deny that Jesus is the Christ is the heresy of Cerinthus, a first century Syrian heresiarch of Jewish descent educated at Alexandria
In 1 John 223 John goes on to say Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either he who confesses the Son has the Father also
Since the Son and the Father are one , to deny the Son is to be without the Father, and to confess the Son is to have the Father
Not to deny but to confess that the man Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God , is to let the Word of the eternal life abide in us
In so doing we abide in the Son and in the Father and are not led astray by the heretical teachings concerning Christ's person
In summary, 1 John 2:22-24 reveals that if you deny that the man Jesus is Christ as God, you will have neither the Father nor the Son
Consequently, you will not have eternal life, which is in the Son , and you will not have any experience and enjoyment of Christ
In this message we will cover three more aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in Romans 10
If we desire to experience Christ, we must realize that most of us are under certain laws, including our self-made laws
His visitation will stop all our activities as well as all our desires, intentions, and even schedules made by ourselves
The result of Christ terminating the law is that God's righteousness is given to everyone who believes in Christ
The righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, 'Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven'?
He has become the living Word the Spirit to be in our mouth and in our heart just like the air the breath that can be taken into our being
When Christ died, He descended into the abyss, and in resurrection He was brought up from the dead, that is, out of the abyss
He was God incarnated to be a man, and as a man, He was transfigured through resurrection into the life-giving Spirit
Now in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit, He is so available that we may receive Him and take Him in at any time and in any place
According to Paul, this processed Christ, Christ incarnated and resurrected, is 'the word of the faith which we proclaim'
Verse 12 says, 'For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him'
The five prophets and teachers recorded here were composed of Jewish and Gentile peoples with different backgrounds, education, and status
Christ is rich to all who call upon Him , irrespective of nationality, wealth, behavior, culture, or education
In Psalm 50:15 the Lord asks us to call upon Him in the day of trouble, and in Psalm 86:7 David did it accordingly
Psalm 86:5 says that the Lord is good, ready to forgive, and is abundant in lovingkindness to all that call upon Him
In order to take the cup of salvation, that is, to participate in and enjoy the Lord's salvation, we need to call upon the name of the Lord
Lamentations 35557 makes it clear that when we call upon the Lord He draws near to us and that our calling upon Him is our breathing our cry
Today in resurrection the Lord is ready and available for our participation in Him, and He is rich for our enjoyment of Him
Although it is possible to pray to the Lord silently, calling on the Lord requires that we cry out to Him or address Him audibly
According to the Scriptures, this matter of calling on the name of the Lord began with the third generation of mankind
In Joel 2:32, Zephaniah 3:9, and Zechariah 13:9 it is prophesied that people will call on the name of the Lord
God poured out His Spirit, and the believers opened their mouths to receive the Spirit by calling on the name of the Lord
In addressing his first Epistle to the church at Corinth Paul said All those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place
In his second Epistle to Timothy, Paul charged him to pursue spiritual things 'with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart'
Only when we believe in the great miracle that God performed in Him in raising Him from the dead, can we be both redeemed and saved
When you believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus from the dead, your believing results in receiving righteousness
Although believing in your heart results in righteousness, in order to complete the step in salvation, you must confess with your mouth
When you call on the name of the Lord the entire universe including the angels demons men and all created things realizes that you are saved
When you preach the gospel, you must not only help sinners to believe in the Lord but also teach them to call on the name of the Lord loudly
The resurrected Christ is the living word, which is the Spirit; He is like the air, the breath, that we take into our being
All we need to do is exercise our mouth to breathe Him in, our heart to receive Him, and our spirit to retain Him
Romans 1126 says Thus all Israel will be saved as it is written The Deliverer will come out of Zion He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob
At that time, all the remaining Israelites will be saved; they will receive Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him as their Savior
In the Body of Christ Christ Himself is the element and sphere of all the members because it is in Christ that we are members one of another
The Body is not an organization or a society but is altogether an organism produced by the union in life that we have with Christ
It is rebirth, or regeneration, that has brought us into an organic union with Christ, thus making us a part of Christ
To be organic in the Body means that we must be organically united with Christ and thereby planted into His Body
If we do not realize the organic union in Christ, in practicality we are outside of the Body and apart from the Body
Those whom God and Christ have received we must receive, regardless of how they differ from us in doctrine or practice
Although Christ is the root of Jesse, who was David's father and who signifies the Jewish people, He will also be the Ruler of the Gentiles
Christ embraces both the Jews and the Gentiles and brings them together for one Body, for one new man, the church
Rather, we should consider Christ who is the root of one people and is the Ruler, the overshadowing One, over another people
In receiving the saints, we must likewise be all-embracing, receiving people from every place, race, and nationality
Although the Gentile believers may come from different races and nationalities, they all have the same hope in the same Lord
