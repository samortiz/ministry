   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Weak of the World, the Lowborn</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of the World, and the Despised</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Among the saints in Corinth, there were not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many highborn; but God has chosen the foolish of the world that He might shame the wise, and the weak of the world that He might shame the strong, and the lowborn of the world and the despised, things which are not, that He might bring to naught things which are, so that all flesh should not boast before God 1 Cor 1:26-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Powerful may refer to the physically, mentally, or positionally powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among the Corinthians, there were not many powerful and there were not many wellborn.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who are wellborn are those who are born of a noble or royal family.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nearly all of the Corinthians were the lowborn, born of common people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church of God is composed not mainly of the upper class, but of the lowborn of the world and the despised.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has chosen the foolish of the world to shame the wise and the weak of the world to shame the strong so that no one may have any boast, any glory, before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's choosing is not according to whom we prefer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many parents pray for their children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to pray for our children, but we must be careful not to give our children a higher evaluation than others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I still remember a story I read when I was young concerning some parents who prayed and prayed for their children, but none of them was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The parents were somewhat unhappy with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They told the Lord, "Lord, You said that You would give us whatever we ask for when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have been praying for our children for many years, but still not one of them is saved."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord answered them in this way: "If you pray for others' children as you have done for your children, your children will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You need to start praying for others' children."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do we believe that our prayer is stronger than God's choosing?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Was Jacob chosen by God because Rebecca prayed for him?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is our prayer first, or is God's choosing first?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's selection and predestination are first Rom 9:10-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Abraham had a number of sons Gen 25:1-5, 9 , but Isaac was the one chosen to fulfill God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to learn to be according to God's choice with God's taste.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes the more a brother prays for his wife, the less spiritual she will be.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If he would pray for other brothers' wives, the Lord might be merciful to him with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have also seen a number of sisters who are very spiritual, but their husbands do not love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This shows us that we should not have our choice in our evaluation of people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The person we are praying for and caring for might be another Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may feel that Saul was great, but in Ephesians 3:8 he said that he was less than the least of all saints.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They said, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas" 1 Cor 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To evaluate others in this way is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul told the Corinthians that God has chosen the foolish of the world that He might shame the wise, the weak of the world that He might shame the strong, and the lowborn of the world and the despised, the things which are not, that He might bring to naught things which are.</S>
