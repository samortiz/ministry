   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REMEMBERING CHRISTMAS Issue No. 28</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>December is right in front of us, and many people will again celebrate Christmas.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the opinions of many believers, it is a good thing to have a day each year to remember the Savior's birth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I dare not treat the opinions of God's children lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, apart from man's opinion, God's Word, the Bible, is still the only standard and the highest standard.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our concern lies not with what man speaks, but with what God has spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is what we care about.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Thus saith the Lord" is the supreme judge over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Does the Bible have a command to remember the birth of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If God's children are willing to ask this question, they will receive the shining of God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What a pity that so many have forgotten the necessity of asking this question.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the Bible, during the last supper, the Lord only asked us to remember His death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did not command us to celebrate Christmas, nor did He command us to celebrate Easter!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These things are poison from Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only one who believes in the Bible will know that the things God did not command and the things God did command have the same significance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many say, "God never put a stop to the celebration of Christmas."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But did God ever command us to observe Christmas?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is sad when Christians search the Scriptures to give a basis for their sin and an occasion to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They say, "The Bible does not prohibit this, so why can we not do it?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Oh, how I wish that God's children would not speak in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May God give us more strength to enable us to say, "How do we dare do what God has not commanded?"</S>
