The first aspect is the meaning of the church; the second, the course of the church; and the third, the organization of the church
Although a physical body looks like an organization, the most important characteristic of a body is not its organization but the life within
To speak bluntly, when the life within a body is gone, what remains is merely a corpse, and a corpse is merely an organization
If we speak of the Body of Christ without referring to our physical body, it will be difficult for us to understand the church
We cannot say that a body does not have organization; however, it is inaccurate to say that a body is merely an organization
Every stone in a physical building is dead because stones lack life, but every stone in the church is living because these stones have life
We are joined together not merely through outward coordination and arrangement but by inward union and growth in life
Not only are a person's arms and shoulders connected together, but they also share the same life and the same circulation of blood
After being organized, a piece of wood is located on top of another piece of wood, and a stone is located on top of another stone
Even though the Bible does not speak of organization in relation to the church, it does speak of blending, or coordination
In such a locality the saints may not argue or quarrel with one another but neither are they related to each other
Corinthians 12:28 says that what God has placed in the church is not merely one type of person but many types of people
On one hand, he replaces what is God-made with what is man-made, producing a well-ordered and hierarchical organization
The Roman Catholic Church today is the greatest hierarchical organization with the pope having nearly unlimited authority
Saints who claim to be delivered from the organization of Christianity may think that all believers are the same and are equal
In conducting our gospel meetings, we never arranged beforehand who would pray, who would speak, and who would be ushers
Sometimes after we sat and waited for a while, we announced, 'Today none of us has the leading of the Holy Spirit, so the meeting ends here
According to the truth we are children of God and are equal; nevertheless, based on the order arranged by God, there is still a distinction
As children of God, we are all equal before God, but according to the order in the Body of Christ, we are not the same
While it is necessary to get rid of manmade hierarchal organizations there is a need for a proper Godmade and wellordered placement to exist
On one hand, the church is not an organization; on the other hand, the church is not completely without organization
As an illustration, the New Testament always places apostles and prophets together, but it never says, 'Prophets and apostles'
A placing is an arrangement, and since it is an arrangement, it cannot be separated from the term organization
We should not deny the fact that the church has organization yet we should recognize that the church is truly an organism an organic entity
The reason that we use the term organization is for the purpose of expressing and explaining an aspect of the church
His being an elder is definitely something related to organization; otherwise, it would be unlawful and illegal
Based simply on outward appearance, it is inaccurate to say that having elders is organizational and that such organization is wrong
In the past, among the churches in different places in mainland China, some elders were elders purely in an organizational sense
An elder who is an elder among the saints according to the arrangement of the Holy Spirit will produce in people a sense of life
They will sense life in his person and in his carrying out of his office, that is, in the carrying out of his duty and position as an elder
They should not think that they can appoint elders, deacons, and other serving ones merely according to the Bible
In principle, one who is sent by the Lord for His work is an apostle, and as such, he may appoint elders in the churches
All those who work for the Lord must seek the Lord cautiously and seriously in regard to their appointing of elders and choosing of deacons
He must ask, 'Today, am I, as an elder serving and administrating in the church, able to touch the life supply?
The brother who was saved a year earlier should not expect to be in the same position simply because he has been saved longer
Being an elder, a deacon, or a responsible one for a home meeting or a small group is a matter that should be tested before God
If the children of God do not serve and coordinate in life, they will compare, and even more seriously, they will compete
Those of us who work for the Lord should be careful; we must not stretch out our hands to appoint people in a careless manner
Strictly speaking, those who cannot and do not know how to touch the sense of life are not qualified nor worthy to appoint elders
We should never think that we are the one to take care of a messy situation simply because no one else is taking care of it
We must know that unless it is of life, our taking care of such a situation will be similar to Uzzah and the Ark of God in 2 Samuel 6:1-7
When a brother is appointed to be an elder, those appointing him should ask, 'Is the authority of the Holy Spirit in this brother?
We who work for the Lord and serve in various places must check with ourselves concerning where the authority for our coordination lies
If a brother is elderly and is a deputy authority, he needs to ask himself whether it is he or the Holy Spirit who has the authority
As those who submit to authority, the saints also need to check whether they are submitting to man's authority or God's authority
There is organization in the church, but every item and aspect of this organization issues from God's authority
Those who serve as authorities are under God's authority, and those who submit to authority are also under God's authority
The arrangements and coordination must be the result of Gods authority of the authority of the Holy Spirit not the issue of mans authority
Although there is such a thing as place or position in the organization of the church, our emphasis should be function, not position
It is not easy for a person without a gift to function, but often, gifted people do not have much function in the church
Although a meeting may start at a certain time in the evening, she may arrive ten minutes late, when the singing has stopped
The New Testament makes mention of people speaking in tongues and being able to heal the sick, both of which are gifts
In order to function, he must have God's life wrought into him to the extent that a proper character is produced within him
Suppose there are two brothers who both have a gift for preaching the gospel, the first one being more gifted than the second one
After the first one lives in a certain place for a year, he may not be able to continue in the work of the gospel
Although he has a greater gift, due to his lack of endurance, he is not able to continue to labor for more than a year
Although he may be gifted, his laziness, sloppiness, carelessness, and lack of perseverance and endurance will cause him to have no function
We have seen many gifted brothers and sisters in the church whose functions are not manifested because of their poor character
If they want their character to match their gift, they must pass through the cross and experience the life of Christ
To speak inaccurately or do things in a sloppy manner proves that one has not learned the lessons taught by the Lord's life
The amount of function and the kind of function a brother has determine what portion he should have in the service
Without a certain function, he cannot serve in a certain capacity, nor can he have a corresponding portion in the service
Ninety percent of our function in the church depends upon our character, and only ten percent depends upon our gift
Our character is valuable only when it has been dealt with by the cross and been worked on by the resurrection life
The general coordination in the church is according to function; the specific coordination in the church is according to ministry
When we speak of the coordination in the church, we must set aside the matter of gifts because gifts are dangerous
The requirements for having a function are general, whereas the requirements for having a ministry are specific
The help she has rendered to the church and the supply she has rendered to the saints come out from her ministry
To have a ministry requires us to pass through a considerably long process in God's hand in regard to certain matters and certain aspects
In the coordination, or organization, of the church, we need to pay attention to life and to the authority of God
An apostle is a person with a ministry; that is, he is a person who has been dealt with by God and constituted with God
As a result, others will be able to see that he has the measure of an apostle and realize that he has a portion that the church needs
It is difficult to separate ministry from function, although experientially there is a distinction between them
If we serve the Lord full time, we should not think that we have acquired a special position because we are a worker of the Lord
In regard to the organization of the church, we should pay attention to four items-life, authority, function, and ministry
We do not want to correct these mistakes with our human hand, but we look to the Spirit of God to work in each of our hearts
Christianity has been in error for two thousand years because it has many different organizations that are contrary to biblical principles
On our part, although the word organization has negative connotations, we do not categorically refuse to use it
A brother may preach the gospel and speak of how the Lord Jesus died on the cross to bear man's sins; nevertheless, no one may be touched
If we experience repentance and confession, we will speak from experience when we give a message concerning the Lord Jesus bearing our sins
If this is the case, we need to seriously repent before the Lord in order to see where we have gone wrong in regard to life
On the surface, it is a group of responsible brothers who make the arrangement, but actually, it is the Lord who holds the authority
When the coworkers appoint elders they must be able to say from a pure conscience and a calm spirit We sense that this is the Lords feeling
In the church of God no brother or sister or group of saints should be so presumptuous as to usurp the Lord's authority
Whenever we assign someone to serve inwardly we need to bow down and worship saying Lord You are the Head of the church and You are our Lord
Although You have entrusted us with the responsibility of making this assignment, the authority is in Your hand
We should all realize that in the church God has the authority, Christ is the Head, and the elders are but God's deputy authority
We are not submitting to the authority of man but to Christ, the Head of the church, recognizing His authority in the church
They will sense the authority of the Head not in those to whom the young people submit but in the young people themselves
We should never consider this matter as the submission of subordinates to superiors such as occurs in human society
In order for a church with one hundred brothers and sisters to function properly, there is a need for a clear order among the saints
To be three-dimensional is to have an order, as spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12:28: 'First apostles, second prophets, third teachers'
When a church is facing a problem we should not speak too much but should simply say O Lord let the elders be clear concerning this matter
We have to keep the order and recognize that the problem is the responsibility of the elders, not our responsibility
If someone sees that all the brothers and sisters are in order in the church he will bow his head and worship saying Indeed God is among you
When we see a church in which everyone is in order, we also will surely bow our head and worship the Lord for His presence among the saints
Among us there were several sister co-workers who had learned much and who kept their proper place in the order
The coordination and organization within the church must be according to life, the authority of God, function, ministry, and order
We do not deny that the church has organization but we must determine that the organization of the church is according to these five matters
All the arrangement and coordination in the church must be according to life, authority, function, ministry, and order
Of taking these words as doctrines, each of us should use them to realistically examine our personal situation
Having seen these five basic points clearly, we now come to the practice related to the organization of the church
Although it may seem that we are studying merely external matters, these matters are very much related to our service and life
In the same way, every healthy Christian, not only those serving the Lord, needs to know the organization of the church
The human body as an organization has its basic constituents, and the church as an organization also has its basic constituents
The basic constituents of the church are people who have the life of God, that is, who are God mingled with man and man mingled with God
These are not nominal Christians, because nominal Christians are the constituents of Christendom, not the church
After having passed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, God has two elements: divinity and humanity
Before incarnation, God was simply God, but after the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Christ, God is in man, and man is in God
In brief, we need to realize that as a basic constituent of the church, God is not simply God but God mingled with man
If we desire to know the organization of the church, we must realize that God and man are its basic constituents
If humanity was removed and only the Spirit remained, this Spirit would not be the Spirit of the God who became flesh
In order to know God, a person must know the church, and in order to know man, a proper man, he must also know the church
We do not desire to study the mere outward appearance of the church but to discover the basic principles concerning the church
The Bible reveals that even the appointment of elders in the church is a matter of the mingling of God with man and of man with God
Throughout the generations many activities in the church have been carried out either in one extreme or in the other
If we touch the feeling of the Holy Spirit, we will see that every matter in the church is accomplished by God mingling Himself with man
In regard to the organization of the church, we must see that the church has a universal aspect as well as a local aspect
The local expression of the church is the representation of the church in a particular locality at a particular time
If we do not have a clear understanding of the universal and local aspects of the church, we will encounter many problems
Its mistake, however, is that it extends the application of the universal nature of the church to the church's local expressions
Today tens of thousands of Catholic groups and organizations exist in different localities throughout the world
Should the church in Tainan then control the church in Taipei, or should the church in Taipei control the church in Tainan?
The unification of the churches produced an organization that included many churches of different ranks and levels
When we come to the matter of the organization of the church, we must know the basic constituents of the church
On one hand, the church is uniquely one, but on the other hand, in regard to its expression, there are tens of thousands of churches
The church in Jerusalem was not the headquarters, nor did the church in Antioch become the headquarters of the churches among the Gentiles
According to their understanding, the lampstand is the headquarters, and the seven lamps are seven sub-churches
The church in Ephesus was not accountable to the church in Smyrna, and the church in Smyrna did not control the church in Pergamos
In regard to the church itself, it is one; but in regard to its local expression, there are tens of thousands of churches
The church has both a universal and a local aspect, and its organization also has a universal and a local aspect
If an elder in the church in Kaohsiung moves to Taipei, he will not necessarily be appointed an elder of the church in Taipei
The gifts that God gives to the church are for the church, and the gifts that He gives to an individual are related to the individual
These include speaking in tongues, interpreting tongues, healing, and carrying out operations of works of power
Based on his regular learning, when he is inspired, he will rise up to speak for the edification of the saints
At another time a person may have the instant inspiration of the Holy Spirit and rise up to speak a word of prediction
The third portion is 1 Corinthians 12, which speaks of miraculous gifts, such as speaking in tongues, interpretation of tongues, and healing
In terms of the ability to teach, a teacher has a gift, but in terms of being hired to teach, a teacher has an office
An office may be compared to a husband, and a gift, to a wife; we should never emphasize one and neglect the other
Gifts tend to be less problematic, but it is very easy for problems and mistakes to arise in relation to offices
The appointment of offices must pass through human hands, as in the laying on of hands by the apostles in Acts 14:23 and Titus 1:5
The primary requirement for someone to speak as a prophet is that he must be spiritual that is he must have the Holy Spirit operating in him
On the other hand, in organized Christianity the emphasis is altogether related to office, to man's authority, and gifts are neglected
If we try to correct such mistakes by caring only for gifts and neglecting offices, this will also be a mistake
If in the church there are only gifts, there will be no authority, and if there are no gifts, there will be no offices
If there are spiritual gifts in the church, there should also be authority; otherwise, the church will be weak
As we touch the deeper meanings of this matter, we will see that it is ultimately related to authority and spirituality
In a proper church life no one becomes an elder of his own accord; rather, elders are designated and appointed by the apostles
Only when an apostle designates certain ones to be elders do they have the position and authority of elders in the church
The source of the elders' authority is Christ, the Head of the church, because it is He, not man, who has appointed the apostles
When an apostle appoints certain ones to be elders, everyone is able to see it, and thus there should be no doubt about it
When we speak concerning the organization of the church, we touch the matter of office and thus the matter of authority
In contrast, since apostles appoint elders and deacons, the offices of elders or deacons need not be held in question
If there were no apostles in the church, there would be no authority and order, and everything would be dependent on gifts
If the church had only gifts and there were no offices, the church would undoubtedly become flat and no longer be three-dimensional
It does not say that God placed one apostle above another apostle; neither does it say that one apostle was under another apostle
Otherwise, there would be a chief apostle, such as the pope in the Roman Catholic Church, and all authority would be vested in him
The authority over the churches of the Jews was Christ, and also the authority over the churches of the Gentiles was Christ
Paul said, 'I count myself to be inferior to the super-apostles in nothing' , and he also said, 'I am the least of the apostles'
The result of having such levels would be a top apostle, who is under Christ the Head but over the other apostles
Since the authority of the apostles comes from the Head, the source of authority in the organization of the church is surely the Head
We need to firmly understand a basic matter; that is, the fruit of a person's labor in the Lord is a proof of his apostleship
If a person does a certain work by himself and obtains positive results, these results alone are not proof of his apostleship
Every believer is able to sense if a person has been sent by the Lord to do the work and whether or not he is doing the work by himself
A person who works for the Lord must submit to the authority of the Head; he must be governed and controlled entirely by the Head
A worker is sent by the Head to do the work of the Head; thus, he does not know what it means to be political in order to please people
When we work for the Lord, are we concerned about behaving ourselves properly, or are we concerned about laboring as those sent by the Lord?
If someone thinks that in the service his purpose is to help a certain brother, then it is better for him not to have a part in the service
The workers need to be saved by reminding themselves constantly that the work which they do is the Lord's work, not their own work
Only when a person is under the Head, commissioned by the Head, and sent by the Head to do His work can he be an apostle
Even if others do not acknowledge him as an apostle, the Lord who sent him will still regard him as an apostle
In order to have an office and represent authority in the church, we need to submit to the authority of the Head
There must be some who submit to the authority of the Head, who are sent by the Head, who fast and pray, and who wait for the Lord's command
Although some may not be able to give messages, when you contact them, you sense an authority that cannot be violated
Once the church submits to the authority of the Head, immediately offices, authority, and order will be manifested
There is no need to try, or prove, the office of the elders and deacons; however, there is a need to try the apostles
It is not difficult to prove the office of the elders and deacons, but it is difficult to prove the office of apostles
Since the appointment of apostles is entirely of God and does not pass through human hands it is invisible and difficult for man to perceive
Of course, a person cannot send another to do something for him unless he gives the person he is sending a certain amount of authority
Even if the sender sends him to do a very small thing, the sender must at least give him a small amount of authority
If a person goes out to work for the Lord and his going is truly of the Lord, he will have the Lord's authority
If he is sent out by men, not by the Lord, and if his going out is of himself, he will not have the Lord's authority
If the Lord did not send him to work among a particular group, he would not have had the Lord's authority among them
He may not have had authority in the churches in Judea, because the Lord had not sent him to work among the Jews
If there is a work that enables us to know the Lord, we have to humble ourselves and say, 'The Lord's authority is here'
To submit to and accept the authority of a work is equivalent to recognizing the one entrusted with the work as an apostle
If we think that an apostle has to be someone extraordinary, it will be very difficult to recognize anyone as an apostle
We must be delivered from this wrong concept and simply see that an apostle is one who is sent by the Lord to work for Him
We cannot receive our parents and reject their authority, nor can we receive our teachers and reject their authority
In one sense, it was the Holy Spirit who wrote through Paul, yet in another sense, it was Paul who wrote through the Holy Spirit
Paul inscribed Christ in the hearts of the Corinthians; hence, they became Paul's living letter of commendation
Although someone is not an apostle who has been commanded by God to do a work or been sent by God, he may claim and pretend to be an apostle
God did not send him there or entrust him with the work in that city, yet he may claim to be an apostle to that city
Once the saints are clear regarding who is an apostle and what are work and authority, they will be clear regarding the offices
The church in Antioch did not control the church in Jerusalem, nor did the church in Jerusalem control the church in Antioch
The church in Ephesus was mentioned first among the seven churches in Asia , but it did not have authority to control other churches
If we are sent by the Lord to a certain place to participate in the work, we should not be proud or overly humble
Rather, we should have a deep consciousness that the Head has sent us and that the presence, the authority, of the Head is with us
They were both directly appointed by the Lord to work in two different regions-the Jewish region and the Gentile region
If they had possessed rank in relation to one another, the result would have been a system of hierarchy as seen in the Roman Catholic Church
In the way arranged by God, He will not let His authority suffer loss, and He will not allow human hands to act freely in His work
In other words, God desires that His authority be acknowledged in the church, and He prohibits men from acting freely
In God's work, if a person does not have a commission directly from the Head, he will lose the authority that comes directly from the Lord
On the side of the church, a church cannot receive the work of an apostle but not his authority, both of which are from the Lord
If we submit to authority, it will be easy for us to discern in our spirit whether or not a worker has the Lord's authority
Those who acknowledge an apostle do not become an authority to the apostle; rather, they submit to the apostle's authority
An apostle is one who absolutely submits himself to God and who receives his work and commission from the Lord
We must remember that those who are not sent by the Lord but go out to work by themselves have only a work but no authority
He said to Moses, 'Go, get down; for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves'
When we serve the Lord and encounter difficulties, can we be like Moses and boldly tell God, 'God, this is Your work
Some people speak of authority in the church so that they can control other people and make them submit to their personal authority
If we desire to receive the work that God is carrying out through His servant, we should not deny His servant's authority
Those who always say that the church is wrong and that the Lord's servants are wrong will never be able to rise up
Rather, apostleship can be acknowledged by the apostles themselves and by those who receive the apostles' work
Whether or not a person is an apostle is something that must be proven by the person himself and by those who receive his work
Most of the problems that have arisen throughout the ages in regard to the organization of the church are related to offices, not gifts
Because man is involved in the appointing of some offices, it is not difficult to falsely claim to have an office
On the surface, those who say this seem to be correct, but in their practice they still must make arrangements
If there are no arrangements, the chairs in the meeting hall will not be clean, and the bread and the cup will not be spread upon the table
When Samuel anointed David, Samuel's position was similar to that of an apostle, and David's position was similar to that of an elder
We should have the assurance that the Lord has sent us to do the work and that we have the authority to carry it out
If he does not work for the Lord, the Lord will not acknowledge that his work is of the Lord or that he has been sent by the Lord
Those who receive an apostle's work will lose their sense of peace if they have problems with the apostle and doubt his authority
If those who receive supply from an apostle do not recognize his apostleship, he is no longer an apostle to them
If we do not adequately fear the Lord or have much learning before the Lord, we may receive help from an apostle but not keep our position
Being an apostle depends on the apostle himself, whereas recognizing an apostle depends upon the recognizing one
In many organizations in today's society, members have the right both to elect and to recall those responsible for the organization
If a local church could elect or recall elders it would not be a normal church rather there would be confusion and degradation in the church
The government of the church is neither an autocracy, rule by a single person, nor a democracy, rule by the people
Whenever an apostle, who has been appointed by the Head, fails to live in the Holy Spirit or before the Head, he loses the safeguard
The safeguard of authority in the government of the church lies in the apostles' living in the Holy Spirit and before the Head
In other words, if the apostles do not live in the Holy Spirit and before the Head, they should not appoint elders and deacons in the church
If they do not live under the rule of the Holy Spirit and submit to the authority of the Head, they should not touch the eldership
In order to avoid confusion, God has arranged a way to raise up some; that is, He has given apostles authority to appoint elders
If the saints are not spiritual, they will not fear God or submit to the authority of the Head, nor will they receive the elders and deacons
Only when an apostle lives in the Holy Spirit and submits to the authority of the Head can he receive authority from the Head
Position, reputation, ability, and wealth should never be considered; rather, all these matters must be put aside
In order for one to be an overseer or an elder, the prerequisite is that he submit to the authority of the Head
If he does not submit to the authority of God, no one should put the responsibility for a local church into his hands
Biblical knowledge, ability to serve, and capability in handling matters are not the qualifications of an elder
In the appointment of an elder, the first matter to be settled is whether or not a person submits to the authority of God
In Matthew 8 the centurion knew that he was a man under authority, that he was under some and that others were under him
He could manage God's house because he was a man according to God's heart; he allowed God to reign through him and by him
Similarly, an elder should not think that his position is proper simply because the saints regard him as an elder
The saints may regard him as an elder in the church because they have personally learned from God to submit to authority
No one who disobeys the authority of God can exercise God's authority in the church as an apostle and appoint elders
As the apostle considers this person, the Holy Spirit will also ask him if the matter of authority is settled within him
If the matter of authority is not settled within an apostle, he certainly is not qualified to consider whether it is settled in others
If no one in the church submits to the authority of the Holy Spirit, it will be impossible to have elders and unnecessary to appoint some
A strict requirement in regard to the appointing of elders is that the one being appointed must submit to the authority of God
Once these two matters are clear, there can be an additional consideration, that is, how much function a brother has
The degree to which an elder submits to God's authority will be the degree to which people submit to him as an authority
If a person submits to the authority of the Holy Spirit, he does not need to boast and say, 'I submit to the authority of God'
In regard to the appointment of elders, the saints also face a serious requirement; that is, they must be spiritual
If they submit to God, and are proper in their inward condition toward God, they will choose David and reject Saul
When an elder who is in the flesh meets with a believer who is in the flesh, they will either talk nicely or argue fiercely
If you have been deceived, this shows not only that he is living in the flesh but also that you are living in the flesh
He would do so because there are many fleshly ones to support him, and it would be the best opportunity for him to be enthroned
In contrast, when the saints learn to live in the spirit and submit to God's authority, there will be absolutely no place for Saul
The apostles who appoint elders must be spiritual, and those who are appointed to be elders must also be spiritual
Biblical principles can be living only if they are applied in the Holy Spirit; otherwise, they are merely dead letters
If a brother is about to be appointed as an elder, he needs to ask himself whether or not he is in the Holy Spirit
When a saint receives someone as an elder, an authority, the saint should ask himself whether or not he is in the Holy Spirit
If we are living in the Holy Spirit no one can deceive or control us and we will certainly know the condition of the ones who appoint elders
To live in submission to the authority of the Holy Spirit is to obey the Spirit, not to walk merely according to the Bible
In contrast, all those who desire to rule over others do not submit to God's authority and do not have God's authority
If we live under the authority of the Holy Spirit, we will know whether a person is living in submission to God's authority
If you say that someone has deceived you or exercised control over you, this indicates that both are living in the same place-the flesh
The administration of the church is altogether a matter of God's government, of the authority of the Head, and of life
A person does not become a deacon simply because he desires to be one or because a group of brothers has nominated him
It refers to such abilities as speaking as a prophet, healing sicknesses, casting out demons, or speaking in tongues
All gifts whether they are for the church or for individuals whether they are ordinary or miraculous are given freely by God in grace to men
He was able to labor more abundantly than the other apostles because he gained and experienced God who was in him
Simply put, grace in the New Testament is God Himself-that is, the Spirit of God, the life of God-being received by us
The grace spoken of in the New Testament is God; that is, God giving Himself, His Spirit, and His life to us for us to receive as grace
After resurrecting, the Lord came into the midst of the disciples and breathed into them, saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
The first verse is Ephesians 4:7, which says, 'To each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ'
If a glass is large, it can receive a great amount of water, but if a glass is small, it can receive only a small amount
Ephesians says that grace is given according to the gift, but Romans says that gifts differ according to grace
Whether it is grace given according to gift or gift given according to grace, in either case the two cannot be separated
Although we spoke first of Ephesians 4 and then Romans 12, according to sequence Romans 12 comes before Ephesians 4
There are some who having received God's grace are not only willing to give hospitality but also consider it the sweetest matter
When blood flows to the eyes, it helps them to see, and when blood flows to the mouth, it enables the mouth to speak
If the blood circulation stops, almost immediately the ears cannot hear, the eyes cannot see, and the mouth cannot speak
There is only one circulation of blood, but when it flows to different places, it enables different functions to be manifested
The Lord gives a person grace, produces a gift within him, and then supplies grace according to the gift in him
If the blood supplied to our shoulders was only equal to the supply to our ears, it would not be possible for the shoulders to function
It is wonderful when a person who has been appointed as God's mouthpiece opens his mouth and the supply within him begins to flow
Romans tells us that gifts come from grace, and Ephesians tells us that we need the supply of grace in order to exercise our gifts
Once he is enlivened, the gift within him will immediately be manifested without his having received any teaching
The reason he does these things is not that certain ones have asked him to; rather, he does these things because of the gift within him
Grace enables us to manifest our gifts thus we should never forget that we need a continual supply of grace in order to exercise these gifts
According to Ephesians 4, the amount of grace we receive depends entirely on the measure of gift we have received
All that is left is a social group, a societal organization, not the genuine church with a proper organization
If we do not submit to God's authority and are not enjoying God's grace, we should not speak of the organization of the church
If we do not submit to God or live in fellowship with God, whatever we do will be worthless, even if it is scriptural
In the past many saints held firmly to biblical principles without realizing the significance of authority and grace
To speak about the organization of the church according to the letter in the Bible will produce merely another human organization
No matter how scriptural our practice may be, if it is only according to letter, it will still be human organization
Our being according to biblical principle is not a matter of letter or doctrine but a matter of spirit and life
Corinthians 12:4-5 says, 'There are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distinctions of ministries, yet the same Lord'
In this way, may we be His living Body, coordinating together, standing in our proper place, and supplying others according to our measure
In other words, Peter did not unify the churches in Judea, and Paul did not unify the churches among the Gentiles
Ignoring our oneness because there is no unification causes us to become unruly and to fall into a fleshly situation
The most proper way to meet the need is for some of us to receive a burden from the Lord instead of having a unified move
During the past few years, while traveling overseas, brothers have told me, 'Brother Lee, you should send some saints to us from Taiwan'
The Lord has truly been merciful to us regarding the matter of finances, and by His mercy our finances are not organizationally unified
The general practice in Christianity is to unify and centralize the finances and then distribute them to others
The brothers in Taipei should be able to write a letter to the brothers in Hong Kong, saying, 'We need some of you to come here'
It is also very clear in regard to the work in a region being one, but there is no ground for a universal unification
If there is a group of co-workers serving the Lord together in a certain region, it is proper for the work in that region to be one
We should never suppose that all the churches should practice the same things that the church in Taipei practices
If a brother who is an elder in the church in Taipei goes to Hualien, he should not assume that he will be an elder there
In order to maintain a universal unification, the Roman Catholic Church uses human hands to restrain man's unruliness
There is a need that each of us would be on the alert to guard against and be watchful of the danger of unruliness
We should not take the matter of not having an organizational unification as an excuse to say that we can act independently and recklessly
Awhile ago some young brothers came to me, asking, 'Brother Lee, is it all right if we do something a certain way'?
Once some brothers from a certain local church came to ask me, 'Brother Lee, what do you think we should do about a certain matter'?
Although the administration of a church is local, every saint in a local church should live directly before God
The Bible never says that the saints cannot touch the matter of the young people's marriage and that only the elders can decide this matter
They may not have intended to be this way, but in their way of doing things, people can sense the flavor of organization
There should be many older saints who love and fear the Lord and are concerned about the marriage of the young people
Whoever has a desire to touch this matter should fear the Lord, learn to wait and pray in the Lord's presence, and seek others' fellowship
We should not say that if the elders have not decided that the church will preach the gospel, we should not have any gospel activity
If we have the feeling to preach the gospel, we should pray earnestly and look to the Lord to receive the burden
After we have received a burden from the Holy Spirit we should fellowship with those who are experienced and who are in coordination with us
The responsible brothers should never keep the church in their hands and turn the church into something unified
Not only so, we must learn to place ourselves in the Lord's hand and fellowship with those in the church and with those with whom we serve
In the past few years, from 1952 until today, we have indeed had God's presence in the matter of serving full time
Not only apostles prophets evangelists and shepherds and teachers should serve God but even a member who has a small gift should serve God
Other people who serve the Lord may have a commission that requires only part of their time, not all of their time
After observing the situation of the brothers and sisters who have been serving full time, we feel that some of them should take a job
Initially, some began to serve full time because the Lord had arranged the environment, and they themselves sensed the Lord's commission
Whether we serve full time is based not on how we feel but on the amount of work and the extent of the commission that the Lord has given us
They have a strong desire to come together with others every day to pray, to read the Bible, and to live before the Lord
If they were to work as teachers, they would have to learn how to deal with the principal, the dean of academics, and other colleagues
Of struggling and striving every day, they would rather contact the saints, preach the gospel, read the Bible, and pray
By living such a life they do not need to worry about their living to struggle for worldly possessions and to strive with those in the world
From the standpoint of religion, this is quite good, and from the viewpoint of human philosophy, it is also not bad
If the sisters like to stay at home and take care of the housework and serve their family, this is surely a proper human endeavor
Some sisters feel that it is too troublesome to stay at home and do housework, serving their husband and children
If this is the case, their serving is absolutely not according to the Lord's leading but an excuse for them to avoid human responsibility
A sister should not serve full time in order to avoid the troubles of housework and of serving her husband and children at home
Consequently, some who are serving full time should not continue to serve full time because they have not been given much commission
If such a person can hold a part-time job and serve part time, the benefits to both him and the church will be great
Methods of teaching are continuously improving, and ways to handle the students are also constantly being adjusted
Everyone is competing, and this competition forces people to learn how to conduct themselves and to do their work properly
As a result, it seems that it is easier to become proud when things are done correctly and to make excuses when mistakes are made
If those serving full time among us are loose in handling matters, in the future this will be a great loss to the church
If one is able to resist being influenced or subdued by the environment and instead subdues the environment, he is a most remarkable person
At the same time, the service in the church does not have an element of competition or of reward and punishment
Due to such an environment, the young full-time serving ones gradually enter into a state of ease and begin to slack off
Their heart is good and proper toward the Lord, but the environment they live in has caused their character to become loose
Our attitude should be to do things so thoroughly that if the angels came behind us, they would have nothing to do
The way we work depends on how we handle matters, and the way we handle matters depends on the way we conduct ourselves
Almost every person who knows how to handle matters is a strict person, and he does not do things as he pleases
They know that if they do a good job, they may not be commended and that if they do a poor job, they will surely be rebuked
If they are rebuked, they realize that they must learn the lesson of humility, saying that this is the discipline of the Holy Spirit
Consequently, the leading brothers have not dared to pressure them, and they have not learned the proper lessons nor had a proper walk
The working saints are pressured by the matters related to obtaining a livelihood such as salary benefits position reputation and future
It does not matter whether they preach the word, visit the saints in a way that is profitable, or do things properly
Although they do not intend or have the slightest intention to be like this the matter of serving full time has fallen into such a condition
The brothers who are older and who have spiritual weight in the church do not want to and dare not pressure these full-time serving ones
Even without the pressure from the environment, you should learn to force yourself and create for yourself some demands and pressure
If some of them were to go into business, they would not make any money, and if they were to serve in the military, they would not win a war
If you continue to be loose, you will definitely become useless to Him, not to mention in other matters as well
If you work in secular society, no matter what profession you are in, the environment will never allow you to be loose
Unless we deal with this looseness and gird ourselves up, those serving full time will not be of much use in their future service
Since there are many persons living in the workers' home, you should be strict even in the matter of your voice
Recently, the weather has become warmer, yet those serving full time still gave heavy blankets to the guests in the workers' home
Neither did he do this because he was not happy to receive guests, because we are all zealous to provide hospitality
In every matter someone should take responsibility, and he should be given clear instructions in regard to all the principles and details
Whenever something wears out, it should be fixed at once, and whatever is broken should be replaced immediately
Those serving full time must bear in mind that if their looseness remains unchanged, the work will have no future
Some saints have told the leading ones, 'Since there are full-time serving ones, why do you want us to serve'?
It shows that although they desired to serve, they no longer have such a desire because they see that the full-timers are serving
Such a thought makes serving the Lord the business of the full-time serving ones and allows the saints who are not serving full time to rest
It is an erroneous concept to think that only those who drop their jobs can minister the word in a ministry meeting
It is true that someaccording to the Lords leading commission and arrangementdrop their jobs to serve full time in the ministry of the word
In regard to serving in the church, no distinction should be made between those who serve full time and those who serve while holding a job
The difference is not in regard to how they function, or serve, but in regard to how they maintain their livelihood
In regard to serving the Lord we should not make a distinction between those who serve full time and those who hold a job
The full-time serving ones should not have the attitude that they need to do everything because they serve full time
The working saints should not have the attitude that they do not need to do anything because others are serving full time
Being a doctor, working as a clerk, and engaging in business are all for the purpose of providing a livelihood
Although there is a difference in the way saints earn a living, there is no difference between the saints in serving the Lord
Some of the churches in various localities have been doing well in this matter, and we thank God for this from the bottom of our heart
Five years ago, on the whole island of Taiwan only four or five brothers had dropped their jobs to serve full time
Now that seven years have passed without this matter being presented clearly, it has become a weakness in the churches
In the very beginning we did not want to give the brothers the feeling that the workers were asking people for money
According to my personal observation, the support for the full-time serving ones in the churches was very little
Because no clear fellowship was given concerning the need of those serving full time, no one paid attention to or received a burden to give
If we do not make a turn now and begin to take care of the full time serving ones, God will find help from some other place
If we do this, it will be as if their feet are constantly treading out the grain, yet their mouths are muzzled
When we reap the benefit of their service, we cannot merely appreciate it without taking care of their living in a practical way
Since the brothers and sisters have not received leading in this matter, they have not paid much attention to it
Due to a lack of knowledge regarding this kind of service in the past many brothers and sisters were not able to get married for a long time
We must learn to pick up this matter as a burden and lead the saints in the church to take care of this matter
In the beginning, when we were in mainland China, the matter of supporting the full-time serving ones was extremely difficult
For the past twenty years none of our children have been willing to take this way, because they know the kind of life that we live
Even if we were able to change the heart of the entire earth, we would not be able to change our children's heart
From the day our children began to remember things, they have experienced how we live, and this has caused their heart to be hardened
Otherwise, if the current situation continues, the next generation will not follow in the steps of the preceding generations
Throughout the years, there has been no organization of the work among us; there has been only the commission received through the ministry
It is difficult for the full-time servings ones to speak concerning this matter, but it is possible for the saints who have jobs to do so
In principle, a person's character determines whether he will be successful and effective in his work or activities
As we learn to serve the Lord, we need to have much fellowship with the Lord and look to Him for His mercy and grace
Some people by nature like to contact people, but this is useless because it is natural and not of resurrection
The young brothers from Taiwan do not know the names of those from Hong Kong or how many have come from Indonesia
These young brothers should realize that the brothers from overseas have come not only to hear some messages but to seek fellowship
If we would receive more breaking and learn to have a proper spiritual disposition, we will receive more grace
If every one of us were to contact one person before and after each meeting, each of us would be able to contact two persons every meeting
In this way, if we attend three meetings per week, each one of us would be able to contact six people every week
If we have an amiable disposition, a disposition that likes to contact people, we would feel that this is both convenient and spontaneous
We all should have such a disposition-one that desires to contact people and know their spiritual condition before the Lord
Most businessmen realize that business deals are not made in the office but on a tennis court or in a coffee shop
Sometimes, according to God's leading, He withdrew from a certain place to be alone and purposely did not contact people
He was joined to God at all times and in all places, and He also contacted people at every time and in every place
If everyone among us, regardless of age, learns and exercises to contact people, the church will be greatly blessed
On the surface, contacting people seems to be a small thing, but we do not know how many will be brought in as a result
We are serving the Lord with our time, effort, and energy, yet we do not speak or do things related to our line of work
When we see the elderly saints, we need to learn from them, and when we see the younger ones, we need to supply them
If we have seen the types and the plan concerning the church, we will have a clear understanding of the church
We need to see that the intrinsic significance of what took place at Bethlehem is that God was brought into man and mingled Himself with man
In general, Christians consider that what took place at Bethlehem was simply a birth, but we should see that it was a mingling
The mingling that took place at Bethlehem and the mingling that took place in resurrection produced the church, a divine-human entity
Anything that is of resurrection has passed through death, and anything that has not passed through death is not of resurrection
Of course, not everything that dies is resurrected, but everything that is of resurrection has passed through death
When we speak of the experience of resurrection, we need to ask ourselves whether our working and doing are of the first or of the second?
When we examine ourselves in this way, we will begin to see how many things in us are natural and how many things in us are of resurrection
In some local churches there are good brothers who serve together, but they often have arguments and different opinions
Not only should we deny our natural capabilities, but we should also deny our so-called spiritual views and spiritual gifts
We should not think that if we deny our spiritual gifts and spiritual views, they will all be terminated and finished
Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
A person who is in resurrection does not fight, because he knows that his gain comes from his loss, that is, he gains by losing
Only one who is serious and diligent before the Lord can be brought by God's hand to the point where he expresses resurrection
For a person to feel that he loves people and is meek indicates that his feelings are not related to the church
The church is in resurrection; hence, whoever is in resurrection does not hold to his own feelings or argue with others
As a result of remaining in their natural being, they have opinions about others and are not able to be one with others
Anything that was there originally is in the natural man; it is not the mingling of God with man or the mingling of man with God
Although the church may have benefited from their diligence yesterday, this benefit may eventually become a great problem to the church
If we become slothful once our diligence has been put aside, this shows that we certainly have no element of resurrection within us
If resurrection is in us, the more we put to death our diligence, the stronger and more multiplied it will become
In other words, once our natural diligence is put to death, a diligence in resurrection will be produced and multiplied
In our practical experience we seldom condemn, reject, or put aside what is of us, that is, what we originally are and have by birth
Whether a person accepts or rejects criticism does not determine whether or not that person is in resurrection
If a person has the light of resurrection when others praise him, he will sense a hand within him pointing him to the cross
How much there is of the element of the church among us today depends upon how much we judge the natural things in us
Not only do the natural things need to be judged, but even the so-called spiritual gifts and spiritual views need to be judged
There should always be a finger within pointing at us and saying, 'Is this spiritual insight the first or the second?
When others praise him and he senses a happy response, immediately something will convict him and say, 'This feeling needs to be rejected'
When he is about to argue for the Lord's work, something will point at him and say, 'This argument needs to be condemned'
According to our experience, this condemnation is experienced by everyone who is in resurrection; hence, it is not related only to the cross
It is in resurrection that the church the coordination the one accord the expression of the Body and every function of the Body are realized
The crucial matter is whether we have passed through judgment and whether something within has inwardly convicted us
When there is nothing more to be said or done, when there is absolutely nothing more, then there is resurrection
To this, the Lord will say that it is not a matter of having an opportunity but a matter of whether it is of the first or the second
Of paying attention to opportunity, God keeps asking whether it is of the first or the second, whether it is of man or of man in God
Everything that is merely of man is natural, but everything that is of the mingling of God and man is in resurrection
Although he cannot utter or explain it, this story is in him, and it causes him to desire and incline toward the Lord all the time
In the same way, if he has been shown mercy, today there is another story in him, that is, a story of conviction, a story of being rebuked
If man cannot enter into God and God cannot be expressed from within man, not much of the church will be expressed
The story of resurrection is that man enters into God and allows God to be continually expressed from within him
Everyone who has experienced resurrection and the Holy Spirit knows that resurrection and the Holy Spirit cannot be separated
Doctrinally, resurrection is resurrection, and the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit; however, experientially, the two are one
Jesus entered into His glory when He resurrected ; hence, the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet resurrected
In incarnation God became a man, the Lord Jesus, and in resurrection the Lord Jesus became a life-giving Spirit
To be in resurrection is to be in the Holy Spirit; to say it in reverse, to be in the Holy Spirit is to be in resurrection
If he allows his feelings to be condemned, rejected, and judged, and they rise up again, they will be in resurrection and in the Holy Spirit
When a brother is having problems, it is common to suggest that he be visited by a brother who has a friendly relationship with him
The problem is that man pays more attention to such matters as good or evil and truthfulness or falsehood than to the Holy Spirit
According to the position of the church and the blessings that the church has received, the church is truly in a heavenly realm
If we carefully analyze Ephesians 1 and 2, we will see that these chapters speak of the position, nature, function, and sphere of the church
In Ephesians 1 and 2 heavenlies indicates not only the heavenly place but also the heavenly nature of the church
In other words, the Lord Jesus' resurrection brought humanity, which He put on and was joined to, into the heavenly nature
According to 1 Corinthians 15, the natural man is earthy, but the regenerated man of the new creation in Christ is heavenly
Through Christ's incarnation, death, and resurrection, our earthy nature has been transformed and brought into the heavenly nature
The New Testament frequently mentions the heavens, and the Gospel of Matthew repeatedly makes mention of the kingdom of the heavens
In contrast, whenever we speak of something spiritual, we emphasize God's nature and life more than His authority
In the Bible the Holy Spirit is chiefly spoken of in regard to God's life, and in Romans 8:2 He is even called the Spirit of life
The most obvious examples are 'the heavens do rule' in Daniel 4:26 and 'the kingdom of the heavens' in Matthew
Every matter that is earthly is not in submission to God's authority, but every heavenly matter is in submission to God's authority
The garments that the children of Israel wore had fringes on their borders, and on each fringe was a cord of blue
The difference in nature between a piece of chalk and a handkerchief is that one can be folded easily and the other cannot
People think that they will to go to heaven, but the Bible tells us that the New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven
The source of the concept of the blessing and happiness of heaven is entirely something of the Roman Catholic Church
Gods enemy encroaches in the sphere of Gods authority in the air thus spiritual warfare is a matter of being heavenly and having authority
Certainly, all these items are heavenly, but we should not forget that heaven takes God's authority as its center
The church is heavenly not because it does not have a board of directors, does not elect elders by voting, and does not collect donations
If the difference is a matter only of method, then the election of elders is just as earthly as the apostles' appointment of elders
If the apostles do not allow God to freely exercise His authority in the appointment of elders, we should reject such a method
To preach the word, a person must be willing to submit to God's authority and allow God's authority to have a free way
The most important matter for maintaining the heavenly nature of the church is that the church stays under God's authority
Those ministering the word among us do not take turns in preaching the word, because there is no such practice in the Bible
He has caused those who would not and could not submit to God's authority to be willing and able to submit to God's authority
The church being heavenly is not a matter of method or outward appearance but a matter of having authority inwardly
To be heavenly means that although God's enemy rebelled against God's authority, the saved ones submit to God's authority
To be heavenly is not a matter of being blessed or of being in a certain situation or condition; rather, it is a matter of nature
Since the church is heavenly, whenever we depart from God's authority and do not submit to God's authority, we lose the nature of the church
The reason the church is able to represent God to rule over everything on the earth is that the church is heavenly
We now come to the question concerning our receiving of people in the churches, that is, how to determine whether to baptize someone
For the past few years our principle for receiving people, that is, for determining whether or not to baptize people, was right
We may not have been clear at the time, but looking back, the facts indicate that our practice had certain defects
We were clear concerning the principle that only a saved person should be baptized, that is, a person who has believed, who has been saved
We should not baptize those who receive the Lord Jesus nominally but do not receive God's life and have no inward relationship with the Lord
We cannot deny that some perhaps a small number were never clear concerning salvation yet due to our inaccurate judgment we baptized them
We can point to several people whose salvation we initially doubted and who, we are now quite certain, were never saved
It seems that we have made the decision regarding receiving and baptizing people an easy and convenient matter
The matter of whom to receive and baptize has been a great controversy in the church from the time the first apostles passed away
We may all agree to the principle of baptizing only those who are saved, but the difficulty lies in verifying the details
We do not have any problems in regard to principle, but we face difficulties in regard to carrying out the principle
The Bible does not say that he who believes and is saved shall be baptized but that he who believes and is baptized shall be saved
Strictly speaking, some portions of God's salvation can be received and obtained immediately through believing
When a person believes, he truly receives a portion of salvation, and based upon this portion of salvation, he can be baptized
John 3:36 says, 'He who believes into the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life'
It does not say that he who is baptized has eternal life; rather, it says that he who believes has eternal life
To baptize someone based upon his believing is to baptize him based upon his receiving justification and eternal life
The faith that qualifies a person to be baptized is a faith that brings him forgiveness of sins, justification, and eternal life
If he has not received forgiveness of sins, justification, and the life of God, his 'faith' cannot qualify him to be baptized
The faith that qualifies him to be baptized must result in his receiving forgiveness, justification, and God's life
Only such a faith makes it possible for a person to be saved; hence, only this faith can be the basis of baptism
It is not like the two eyes and the nose on a person's face, which everyone can see and about which there is no doubt of their existence
Whether a person's faith is only mental or based on revelation, it is something that cannot be shown to people
One of the manifestations of faith is the forgiveness of sins, another is justification, and yet another is the receiving of God's life
When we discuss the matter of baptism with people, we may have paid more attention to what they have spoken than to their inward feeling
In order to determine whether a person has received forgiveness of sins we must first sense whether he has an inward feeling concerning sins
If we want to know where a person is from, that is, whether he is from the South or North, we need him to speak only a few words
In the end, we may judge that because this person is unclear regarding sin, he is not qualified to be baptized
We should not determine a person's readiness to be baptized based on his answering all of our questions correctly
If he begins to give off 'light,' 'sound,' and 'aroma,' this is proof that inwardly he has been connected to the electricity
We may not even have finished half a question, yet we become clear that the person to whom we are speaking has contacted God inwardly
Of course, at other times we may talk with a person for two hours but still not be able to figure out if God has contacted him
We should question him further, asking, 'You have sins, and you have also confessed your sins, but how do you deal with your sins'?
She did not know if her sins were forgiven, but the feeling and taste made it clear that she had a relationship with the crucified Savior
Perhaps he would say that he does not know and is not that clear; nevertheless, we need to touch his inner feeling
He should feel grateful to the Lord, be full of thanksgiving, and have a peace within that is incomprehensible to him
Water is water, but some water carries the flavor of sulfur, some the flavor of a ditch, and some the flavor of a clear spring
Such questions will help us verify that he is not experiencing mere psychological excitement without touching the spiritual reality
As we listen to him describing these things, we need to touch what is behind his words, that is, his change in life and disposition
In the past, when he heard of God, he felt disgusted inwardly, but now whenever God is mentioned, he is joyful
In the past he was happy when he danced, but now without any apparent reason he feels miserable when he goes dancing
Some brothers might suggest that we need to be strict in the matter of receiving people, lest some unsaved ones 'sneak' in
If we consider the past, we will realize that most of our mistakes were made due to a lack of spiritual sense and objectiveness
We must exercise much consideration when assigning a person to be responsible for the matter of receiving people
If the person who makes the judgment is not accurate, the result will be unthinkable, and we will displease the Lord and delay His work
May the Lord have mercy on us so that all the churches may take the matter of receiving people seriously and solemnly
Otherwise, in the future more problems will arise in the church because there will be many who are not clearly saved among us
We must stress that it is not a matter of being loose or strict but a matter of whether our discernment is accurate or inaccurate
During the training we have been busy with many things, running here and there, yet the Lord has cared for us and sustained us in many ways
We need to pray solemnly to the Lord to offer this training to Him, to give ourselves into His hand, and to ask for His blessing
Whether we pray out loud one by one, pray silently, or pray out loud simultaneously depends on our sense from the Lord
None of us should be unruly or loose before the Lord, and none should have his own activity or an intention to make a display of himself
As a result, if they have an opinion, they dare not express it, and if they have something to say, they dare not voice it
Although they know that certain matters within them should be condemned, they are not determined to condemn these matters
It seems that our mind knows that the matter should be judged and condemned, but our spirit cannot rise up, and our entire being cannot move
It is true that we have been enlightened, but within us there is no response to the shining and no ability to move
During this time, it is difficult for us to discover our problems, because we are immature and stay in the excitement of our emotion
Today in many churches a number of brothers and sisters are inwardly dull and dead, without the freshness and livingness of life
We are often slothful and stingy in the matter of submission; thus, we truly need more of the Lord's grace and mercy
We must ask the Lord to have mercy on us and to add grace to us so that by Him we can deal with and solve this problem
We may pray for him, speak to him, or fellowship with him, but time after time we will realize that his problem remains
Many of us realize that in our service, coordination, and spiritual life, we have come to a point where we cannot go further
On that day Jacob made a determination to wrestle with God, but our problem is that we lack the resolve to wrestle
The more one gains the Lord and touches the Lord's word inwardly, the more a killing element operates in him to put him to death
The more a person's problem is exposed, the weaker he becomes until eventually he is not able to rise up inwardly
We need to look to the Lord for His mercy that we, like Jacob, will become so desperate before the Lord that we will wrestle with Him
