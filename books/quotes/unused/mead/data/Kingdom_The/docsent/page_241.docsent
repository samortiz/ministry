   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SMYRNA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Smyrna is the church which suffered persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we all return to our first love for the Lord, surely the persecution will come.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During the first, second, and third centuries the church suffered much persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Satan used the Roman Empire to persecute the church and to kill many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Foxe's Book of Martyrs tells how that many of these early Christians were persecuted and martyred for the sake of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus promised those persecuted ones that if they would overcome, they would receive the crown of life and not suffer the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be hurt of the second death does not mean to be lost, but it means to suffer something.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Any kind of suffering will not be pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not be concerned about the details concerning the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Simply take the warning from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus does not give us the details because He does not expect us to be there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He expects that we all would receive the crown of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, the crown of life is not given today, but is given during the time of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Regardless of how much you may suffer for the Lord Jesus today, you will not receive a crown in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even the Apostle Paul does not yet have his crown.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is still waiting for the time of the millennium to receive his crown.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At that time all the overcomers will be the co-kings with Christ and receive a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>PERGAMOS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Satan's persecution of the church was not successful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more he persecuted the church, the stronger the Christians became.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>So he used a more subtle attack.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the beginning of the fourth century, during the time of Constantine, Satan changed his tactics.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He turned from persecuting to welcoming the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is signified by the church at Pergamos.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Pergamos literally means marriage and symbolically means a high tower.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This signifies the church having a kind of evil marriage with the world and becoming something great.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Constantine brought the world into the church and took the church back into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This became an evil and illegal marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church was married to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because the church was married to the world, it became something great as a high tower.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was the beginning of the great tree mentioned in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Within Pergamos, there were the teachings of Balaam and the Nicolaitans 2:14, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These teachings were a kind of evil leaven within the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus came in to call out the overcomers and to promise them two things: the hidden manna and a white stone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The stone is for building, and the white color indicates that it is approved and pleasant to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Upon the white stone there is a new name which none besides yourself can know.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many times we should have some special experiences with the Lord that others cannot understand.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes even our family cannot understand our experiences of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We experience something new and fresh that others cannot understand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The new name indicates fresh and new experiences of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we enjoy the Lord in a hidden way, He will become the hidden manna to us, and we will become a justified, approved stone which is so pleasant to the Lord for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We will enjoy the experiences that others cannot understand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the overcoming life for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It may be that many dear ones in the local churches have become a white stone with a new name and are enjoying the real and rich experiences of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If so, they will enjoy the right and privilege to experience the Lord Jesus, not as the open manna in the wilderness, but as the hidden manna in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Within the Holy of Holies there was the ark, and within the ark there was the golden pot with the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The manna here is something very hidden and very close to God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because the overcomers are one with the Lord and so near to Him, they enjoy Him as the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This enjoyment is for the kingdom.</S>
