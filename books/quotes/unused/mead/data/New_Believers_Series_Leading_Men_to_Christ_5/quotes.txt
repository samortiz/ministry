[1]  LEADING MEN TO CHRIST Scripture Reading: Rom 1:16; 10:14; 1 Tim 2:1, 4; Mark 16:15
[2]  In the previous chapter we said that once a person believes in the Lord, he has to witness for the Lord.
[3]  If we do not know how to lead people to Christ, I am afraid that much of our witnessing will be in vain.
[4]  The first thing that we must do is ask God for people, asking Him to give men to the Lord Jesus and to add them to the church.
[5]  Prayer is a test; it exposes your spiritual condition before the Lord.
[6]  If your spiritual condition is proper and normal, others will be saved one by one.
[7]  As you intercede continuously before the Lord, you may find one or two persons saved after a few days or half a month.
[8]  If your prayers are not answered for a long time, it must mean that you are sick before the Lord.
[9]  Isaiah 59:1-2 says, "Behold, Jehovah's hand is not so short that it cannot save;/Nor is His ear so heavy that it cannot hear./But your iniquities have become a separation/Between you and your God,/And your sins have hidden His face/From you so that He does not hear."
[10]  If one deals with sin properly before the Lord, he will be able to offer proper prayers, and others will be brought to the Lord through him.
[11]  If the conscience is blameless, it is easy for faith to be strong, and if faith is strong, spontaneously our prayers will be answered.
[12]  When the Lord places a person in your heart, He intends to save this person through you.
[13]  You have only to tell others that you felt happy and peaceful after you believed in the Lord Jesus, that you sleep well now, and that even meals are becoming tastier.
[14]  When you pray, God will give you the opportunity.
[15]  You may think that it is difficult to talk to someone, but if you pray for him, the Lord will give you the opportunity to speak to him, and he will change.
[16]  After you have prayed for a person for some time, the Lord will impress you to speak to him.
[17]  Each time you lead someone to the Lord, you have to do a detailed analysis, just like a doctor who studies each patient's case in detail.
[18]  Some brothers and sisters are good at bringing people to the Lord because they have studied the ones whom they brought to the Lord.
[19]  If you meet a certain type of person, you will need only to speak certain words to him, and he will receive the Lord.
