   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FORTY-TWO ALL BUILDING MEMBERS WITHOUT RANK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Throughout the centuries Christians have held the natural concept that the church is merely a social organization.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Actually the church is not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As Paul says in his Epistles, the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our physical body, which is a picture of the mystical Body of Christ, is not an organization, but an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As an organism, it is altogether dependent upon life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the life is gone, the body becomes a corpse, which could possibly be regarded as an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>AN ORDER OF FUNCTION, NOT OF RANK</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The concept that the church is a social organization has caused a great deal of damage.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In social organizations there is the need for certain members to be on the top, to be of the highest rank.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In religion this may take the form of hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But there is no hierarchy in our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No doubt, certain members are above others, but this is a matter of functional order, not of rank.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, for the purpose of function, the nose is higher than the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It would be absurd to say that the nose has a higher rank than the mouth has.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In like manner, our fingers are below both our arms and shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this does not mean that the fingers have a lower rank.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is entirely a matter of order according to function.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How could the fingers function if they were attached to the shoulders?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, in the physical body, a picture of the living organism of the Body of Christ, there is no rank nor hierarchal order, but only order according to function.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the past I have met some women who did not agree with Paul s word in Ephesians 5 about wives submitting to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Likewise, they could not accept Paul s word in 1 Corinthians 11 about the man being the head of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Under the influence of the modern concept of female emancipation, they questioned why the woman had to be under the man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I answered them by pointing to the arrangement of the members in our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I tried to show them that this arrangement is not a matter of rank, but a matter of function.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, the nose is in the right place for its particular function.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The same is true of all the members of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, the fact that the nose is higher than the mouth in functional order does not mean that it is of a higher rank than the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To consider the matter of rank with respect to the Body of Christ is to be under the influence of the fallen human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many troubles and problems have been caused by this very concept.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we consider the apostles, prophets, and elders spoken of in the New Testament, we need to drop the natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we hold to our natural concept, we shall automatically think that the apostles, prophets, and elders have a higher rank.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The concept of rank is altogether a natural concept, a concept foreign to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The apostles, prophets, and elders carry out certain functions, but fulfilling these functions does not place them on a level above the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Body there are many members, and these members have different functions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although there is a difference of function, there is no difference of rank.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In an organism there is no consciousness of rank.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If our shoulders could speak, they would say that they have never thought of having any rank in our body; they would say that they have never regarded themselves as higher than the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some of the elders have been rather proud of their position and have expected the saints to give place to them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Other brothers have been ambitious to become elders.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no room for such ambition in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we know the Bible, we shall realize that an elder is a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The thought of rank must be purged away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The apostles and elders are not high officials.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the contrary, they are those who serve Christ to the churches and to the saints.</S>
