In our Life-study of the Bible we have covered all the books of the New Testament except the books of James, Mark, Luke, and Acts
We may also regard 1 and 2 Corinthians among the strategic New Testament books, bringing the number of these books to twelve
The more you are saturated with these riches, the more you will be equipped to preach the gospel in different ways to different people
The number of the saints in the Lord's recovery in the United States is still small, only about eight thousand
If all the saints in the recovery would be saturated with the riches of the Word, they would become living witnesses
The Lord's recovery would have thousands of reporters, thousands of saints preaching the gospel, presenting the truth, and ministering life
Martin Luther, the great reformer used by the Lord to begin the recovery, said that the Epistle of James was an 'epistle of straw'
These Christians especially appreciate the book of James in the New Testament and the book of Proverbs in the Old Testament
In the West, when the New Testament is printed separately from the Old Testament, it is often printed with the book of Psalms
In 4:14 James uses vapor as an illustration of human life, and in 5:7 he uses the illustration of a farmer waiting for his crop to ripen
When James was with the Lord Jesus in the flesh, he probably did not listen to Him, and at least to some extent he may have despised Him
In His New Testament economy God no longer considers the Jewish believers as Jews for Judaism but as Christians for the church
James, as a pillar of the church, in his Epistle to the Christian brothers, still called them the twelve tribes
It is nonetheless a fact that James uses a term given by God to His chosen people in the Old Testament economy
On the day of Pentecost Peter, speaking through the Holy Spirit, considered them a perverse generation and charged them to be saved
In 1 Corinthians 1032 we see three categories of people Give no occasion of stumbling both to Jews and to Greeks and to the church of God
We see that the first virtue related to practical Christian perfection covered by James is that of enduring trials by faith
If there were no final examinations in school, the students would probably be careless concerning their studies
Perhaps after you believed in the Lord Jesus, you thought that in the Christian life there would be no sufferings or trials
The various trials through which we must pass as believers serve the purpose of trying, testing, and proving us
On the other hand we should count it all joy when we experience such things because God uses them to perfect us
You will learn that patience alone is not adequate, because in the suffering of trials you also need endurance
In verse 4 James continues, 'And let endurance have its complete work, that you may be complete and entire, lacking in nothing'
Following that, we shall have the entire Christian perfection; that is, we shall have practical Christian perfection as a whole
When James' writing touches the matter of practical Christian perfection, it is very descriptive and also detailed
On the one hand, this perfection must be complete, with every item present; on the other hand, it must be a whole, an entirety
His desire was that those who received his Epistle would be complete and entire in their practical Christian perfection, lacking in nothing
When a believer doubts in prayer, he makes himself double-souled, like a boat with two rudders, unstable in direction
Whether in exaltation or in being brought low, to rejoice and praise is a virtue of practical Christian perfection
He used even the turning of the planets in verse 17 to illustrate a variation which is in contrast to God the Father's invariableness
The word 'life' in verse 12 indicates that the underlying thought of verses 12 through 27 is the crucial need of the divine life
At the end of this section on enduring trials by faith, he says in verse 12, 'Blessed is the man who endures trials'
James says that the man who endures trials is blessed because, having become approved, he will receive the crown of life
They think it is adequate to know God, to love God, to be a man of prayer and faith, and to be able to endure trials with joy
Not only did he have experience in human life, but through prayer he also obtained wisdom from the divine source
The fact that James was sympathetic to Judaism and compromised with it can be seen in chapter twenty-one of Acts
James and the other elders told Paul that there were thousands of Jewish believers who were zealous for the law
If this had not happened, the mixture of Judaism with God's New Testament economy might have continued for centuries
There is the possibility that we may be careless in our behavior or that we may neglect the matter of practical Christian perfection
Many of us can testify that we have seen the vision concerning God's economy and that we are absolutely for this vision
A brother may easily become angry with his wife, or a sister may not have the proper attitude toward her husband
His Epistle is notable and remarkable concerning Christian conduct and emphasizes practical Christian perfection
For this reason, in 1:4 James indicates that the believers should be 'complete and entire, lacking in nothing'
On the one hand, we need to see that this Epistle indicates that James may have lacked a clear view of God's economy
Although we may be soldiers, fighters, for God's economy, we still need to be complete and entire in our daily Christian life
Although you are a good soldier fighting for God's economy, in your daily life you may not be complete and entire
Because you are good in the major things but lacking in certain practical things, you need balance in your Christian life
James was outstanding in the matter of practical Christian perfection; he was a godly man who knew God, who loved God, and who prayed to God
James was hindered by his godliness and veiled by his religion from seeing a thorough vision concerning God's New Testament economy
We may be absolutely for God's economy, and yet we may be wrong in the way we speak to others or deal with them
We see that we need to be balanced: we need a clear vision concerning God's economy, and we need practical Christian perfection
We should be warned from the Epistle of James that we may be very godly, yet still lack a clear view concerning God's economy
In paying attention to the major things of God's economy, we should not neglect the practical details of our personal daily life
These Christians may be religious and godly, they may pray a great deal, they may have faith and endurance, and they may love God
Because it is possible for us to be this kind of Christian, we need the warning that we may be godly and yet not see God's economy
We may be complete and entire concerning Christian conduct, but we may not know how to fight the battle to carry out God's economy
We need to see God's economy, and we need to be perfected in our daily personal life so that we may be complete and entire
Regarding this book we need to be fair recognizing that the entrance of Pauls Epistles still needs the help of the door of the book of James
In 1:2-12 we considered the first item of the practical virtues of Christian perfection covered in this book-enduring trials by faith
In verses 13 through 18 the first matter is resisting temptation, and the second is God's bringing us forth through regeneration
In these verses there is the implication that we resist temptation by the divine life we received in our divine birth
The divine life has been deposited into us, and thus we have the ability, energy, strength, and power to resist temptation
As for temptation, we should resist it by receiving the implanted word to obtain salvation, the salvation of our soul
To be tested by outward environmental suffering is a trial, but to be tested by the enticing of inward lust is a temptation
As we shall see verse 18 says that our Father has brought us forth regenerated us by the word of truth which is the word of divine reality
Now we can understand that James refers to the orbs in the solar system to show us that the Father, the One who has begotten us, is stable
Based upon the realization of God's stability, James emphasizes the fact that our begetting Father never tempts us
The Father of lights brought us forth to be the firstfruit of His creatures, full of the vigorous life that matures first
James says that God has brought us forth by the word of truth so that we should be a certain firstfruit of His creatures
In verse 19 James says, 'You know this, my beloved brothers; but let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath'
James' word here, for the strengthening of his view of practical Christian perfection, resembles the tone of the Old Testament proverbs
The word of God is likened to a plant of life planted into our being and growing in us to bring forth fruit for the salvation of our souls
We should appreciate James for saying that we need to receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save our souls
After the word of God has been planted into the soil of our heart, it will grow and have the power to save our soul
If we receive the implanted word with meekness, with submissiveness, this means we are absolutely open to God's word
As God plants His word into us every morning, this word becomes nourishment to our inward man, and it strengthens our spirit
As we have pointed out, in order for our soul to be saved, it needs to be sustained through our daily feeding on the implanted word
James may have considered this law to be the basic rule of the Christian life for practical Christian perfection
Concerning the perfect law, the law of freedom, one interpretation is that the perfect law refers to the entire New Testament
The two interpretations of the perfect law-that it refers to the New Testament and that it refers to the law of life-are one
On the one hand, the perfect law is the entire New Testament; on the other hand, it is the law of life inscribed into our being
The fact that the perfect law is readable indicates that it denotes not only the law of life but also the entire New Testament
The principle of the New Testament law has been written into our inner being and has become the law of life within us
As we have pointed out, this new law has become the law of life within us, and this law corresponds to the entire New Testament
Although the law of the New Testament is shorter than the law of the Old Testament the new law is perfect whereas the old law is not perfect
The noun is used here and in verse 27 in a positive sense, in Colossians 2:18 in a negative sense, and in Acts 26:5 in a general sense
In 1:26 James says of the one who does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, that his religion is vain
We have seen that the law of freedom refers to the law of life, which has been planted into our being as a principle
In 1:27 he uses the word 'religion' in a positive sense when he speaks concerning 'pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father'
James goes on to say that this pure religion is to visit orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unspotted from the world
No doubt, this is a very good religion, even the best religion, a religion according to the heart and nature of God
Although James could write such a word about pure religion, he did not have a clear vision concerning God's New Testament economy
In our Christian life we need to have a balance between practical Christian perfection and God's New Testament economy
The fact that the human body has two shoulders two arms two hands two legs and two feet indicates that there is balance in Gods creation
After Paul had greeted them, 'he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry'
By that time Paul had already written the books of Romans and Galatians, books in which he says that the law had been annulled
Paul gave a testimony of how God had used him to work among the Gentiles, and they all glorified the Lord for this
Whatever the case may have been, Paul took the advice of James and joined himself to those who had the vow upon them
Although Paul was such a strong apostle, he was still human, and he took the advice of those Judaic elders in Jerusalem
We have a strong basis in the Bible for saying that James was not strong in the revelation of God's New Testament economy in Christ
We may say that James' view was obscure concerning the distinction between God's new economy and His old dispensation
In Acts 21 even Paul became somewhat involved in this mixture because of the atmosphere, the cloudy sky, in Jerusalem
We see once again that although James was a very godly man, he did not have a clear vision concerning God's New Testament economy
The mixture in Jerusalem between the old and new dispensations was a cause for God's allowing the Roman army to destroy the city
The kingdom of God here is also the kingdom of Christ, which will be inherited by the overcoming believers in the coming age
The reality of this kingdom should not be practiced in the Jewish synagogue, but in the Christian church, which is the Body of Christ
We believe in the Lord for our salvation ; we love God for our overcoming so that we may receive the promised kingdom as a reward
Verse 8 says, 'If indeed you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well'
In verse 9 James says, 'But if you respect persons, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors'
The point in verse 9 is that those who respect persons commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors
In verse 10 James goes on to say, 'For whoever keeps the whole law, yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all'
The word in verses 8 through 11 indicates that the Jewish believers at James time were still practicing the keeping of the Old Testament law
James, the elders in Jerusalem, and many thousands of Jewish believers still remained in a mixture of the Christian faith and the Mosaic law
James' Epistle was written under the cloud of a semi-Judaic mixture, under a background that made matters obscure
The believers will be judged by the law of life, the law of freedom, which is the law of Christ, at His judgment seat
We receive salvation in this age, the church age, and we receive the reward in the next age, in the age of the millennial kingdom
The goats will go to the lake of fire, and the sheep will be transferred into the millennial kingdom to become the nations
According to Matthew 25, He will judge the living at the throne of His glory at the beginning of the thousand years
In 2:12 James refers to the judgment of the believers according to the law of freedom at the judgment seat of Christ
It indicates that he did not have a clear vision about the distinction between the Old Testament and New Testament
He mixed the two dispensations together; that is, he mixed the law of the Old Testament with the law of the New Testament
In 2:13 James says, 'For the judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment'
Anyone who despises a poor brother in this way will not receive mercy when he appears before the judgment seat of Christ
When we come before the Lord to be judged, He will not show mercy to us, because we have not shown mercy to our brother
James is not talking about being saved from perdition, but is speaking about being saved from judgment at the judgment seat of Christ
If someone says he has faith but does not have any works of love, this means that he does not love the brothers and sisters
If we do not show mercy toward fellow believers, we shall not receive mercy from the Lord at His judgment seat
In verse 14 James is concerned for us; in verses 15 and 16 his concern is for those who are not properly cared for by us
Because of our merciful and loving work toward the saints, we shall be saved from merciless judgment at the Lord's judgment seat
In verse 21 James asks, 'Was not Abraham our father justified by works in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar'?
Immediately James continues in verse 22, 'You see that faith worked together with his works, and by works faith was completed'
To be justified by faith is for receiving the divine life ; to be justified by works is through living the divine life
Abraham's offering of Isaac and Rahab's receiving the messengers and thrusting them out are both works which issued from their living faith
The latter is the cause, bringing forth the first, and the first is the effect, the outcome and proof of the latter
To cut straight the word of the truth means to unfold the Word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion
In the eighteenth century Zinzendorf was raised up by the Lord, and to some extent he improved the dividing of the holy Word
If we would be saved from such unmerciful judgment, we need to have works of mercy and love toward the brothers
Whereas Luther said that this book is an Epistle of straw, a number of pious and godly people have sided with James
A number of years ago we interpreted the Epistle of James in such a way as to reconcile justification by faith with justification by works
In the past we interpreted this to mean that justification by faith is something inward and that justification by works is outward
In 2:9 and 10 James says, 'But if you respect persons, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors
In verse 12 James goes on to say, 'So speak and so do as those who are about to be judged by a law of freedom'
In verse 13 James says that judgment will be without mercy to him who has shown no mercy, and that mercy triumphs over judgment
If we do not have mercy on a brother today, when we stand before the judgment seat of Christ, Christ will not have mercy toward us
If we have mercy toward the poor ones today, then at the time of the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ, Christ will have mercy on us
Let us consider verse 14 again: 'What is the profit, my brothers, if anyone says he has faith, but does not have works?
Our attitude toward the saints will be a deciding factor regarding whether or not we are rewarded at the judgment seat of Christ
In these verses faith and works are not a matter of eternal salvation but are related to being saved from judgment at Christs judgment seat
Economy' is an anglicized form of the Greek oikonomia, a word that means household arrangement and refers to God's management
If you read Marys praise recorded in chapter two of the Gospel of Luke you will see that it contains many quotations from the Old Testament
No doubt Marys godliness was in the Old Testament dispensation and certainly she taught her children to be godly in this Old Testament way
The fact that James was the most influential believer in Jerusalem is proved by what is recorded in Galatians 2:11 and 12
Acts 21 does not say that Paul went to the elders, but that he went to James, where all the elders were assembled
James pointed out to Paul that in Jerusalem tens of thousands believed in the Lord Jesus and were zealous for the law
Along with these positive matters concerning God's New Testament economy, James brings in things of the Old Testament
James does not speak of living Christ, of walking in the Spirit, or of having a life for the building up of the Body of Christ
What we have in the Epistle of James is a mixture of the things of the Old Testament with God's New Testament economy
Teachers tend to bring in different teachings, and this produces different opinions and causes trouble and division
Although we need to learn to bridle our tongue in our daily living, we all should be encouraged to speak in the church meetings
If this becomes our practice, the meetings will be greatly uplifted, blessing will come, and problems will be solved
Because some have an unruly tongue, this tongue creates serious problems, and these problems may even result in divorce
In 3:5 and 6 James likens the tongue to a fire: 'So also the tongue is a little member and boasts great things
The 'fire' in verse 5 is a wildfire with spreading power, and the fire in verse 6 is an evil fire from Gehenna that contaminates us
Like the wildfire the tongue spreads its destruction, and like the evil fire it contaminates our whole body with evils from Gehenna
In verse 6 the Greek word for 'course' is trochos, referring generally to anything round or circular which runs or rolls, like a wheel
Such meekness equals forbearing and yielding in verse 17, in contrast to bitter jealousy and rivalry in boasting and lying in verse 14
When we exercise our spirit, stay in the spirit in every situation, and do things according to the spirit, we shall have wisdom
When some hear that wisdom is in the spirit, they may say, 'James was a man who emphasized wisdom in practical Christian perfection
Just as we need to use the proper organs for seeing hearing and eating so we need to use the right organour spiritin order to have wisdom
In verses 14 and 15 James goes on to say, 'But if you have bitter jealousy and rivalry in your heart, do not boast and lie against the truth
By 'this wisdom' in verse 15 James means the wisdom of having bitter jealousy and rivalry to boast and lie against the truth
In verse 15 'earthly' refers to the world, 'soulish' to the natural man, and 'demonic' to the Devil and his demons
Verse 17 says But the wisdom from above is first pure then peaceable forbearing compliant full of mercy and good fruits impartial unfeigned
His view may have been somewhat under the influence of Old Testament precepts concerning man's behavior, morality, and ethics
In verse 17 James also tells us that the wisdom from above is full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, and unfeigned
The fact that this wisdom is unfeigned means that it is honest, true, faithful, trustworthy, altogether without hypocrisy
James was saturated with the Old Testament atmosphere, and his way of speaking about wisdom bears an Old Testament color and flavor
When he tells us that true wisdom comes from above, from God, his word does not have a New Testament color or flavor
If electricity were given some other way, there would be no need for 'communication' between our homes and the power plant
On the other hand, we need to see from Paul's writings that the proper way to receive wisdom is to pray by 'switching on' our spirit
We simply need to switch on our spirit and allow the Spirit of God to transmit the riches of the divine Trinity into our being
The Epistle of James, therefore, serves not only as a balance and warning, but also serves as a reminder to pay attention to God's economy
As long as we exercise our spirit to contact the Lord by praying, we actually do not need to pray specifically for wisdom
If we do this, the divine transmission will go on continually, and the riches of the Triune God will be transmitted into our spirit
They were wondering if this Epistle was inspired by God, since it seems to contain so much of James' own wisdom
In Matthew 16 certain words spoken by Peter were not the words of God either, but Satan's words spoken through Peter's mouth
If we are clear concerning this, we shall see that in the Epistle of James certain words were not spoken by God
Words such as 'twelve tribes' and 'synagogue' were spoken by James, but recorded by God's inspiration for a particular purpose
In this message we shall consider what James says in 4:1-10 concerning dealing with pleasures, the world, and the Devil
Once electricity has been installed, there should be a continuous transmission of electricity from the power plant to the building
God's economy is to dispense Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God into us for the building up of the church as the fullness of Christ
For God's economy, we need to be those with the practical Christian perfection portrayed by James in his Epistle
In 4:2 James continues, 'You desire and do not have; you murder and are jealous, and are not able to obtain; you fight and war
In verse 3 James goes on to say, 'You ask and do not receive, because you ask evilly, that you may spend it on your pleasures'
In Matthew 25:34; John 17:15; Acts 17:24; Ephesians 1:4; and Revelation 13:8, it denotes the material universe as a system created by God
In John 1:29; 3:16; and Romans 5:12, it denotes the fallen human race corrupted and usurped by Satan as components for his evil world system
In 4:5 James goes on to say, 'Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: The Spirit who dwells in us longs to envy'?
The indwelling Spirit makes His home in us so that He may occupy our entire being for God and cause us to be wholly for our Husband
Whenever we would not be solely for Him but would love the world, this indwelling Spirit will not only be offended, but will also be envious
In 46 James leaps to the matter of grace But He gives greater grace wherefore it says God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble
If the problems of pleasures, the world, and the Devil are not dealt with, we may eventually become adulteresses, enemies, and sinners
A strong friendship has been built up with the world, the satanic system organized by God's enemy, His adversary
If a child of God loves the world, and forms a friendship with the world, the world will cause him to become an enemy of God
Such a believer becomes an enemy of God because he takes sides with God's enemy by loving the world, the satanic system
By this we see that, according to one's actual condition, a child of God may be an adulteress, an enemy of God, and a sinner
In order not to become adulteresses, enemies, and sinners, we need to deal with pleasures, the world, and the Devil
Often, the conversation at school or work on a Monday morning is related to sinful, worldly things done over the weekend
If we have a bird's-eye view of 4:1-10, we shall see that in these verses three major things are covered-pleasures, the world, and the Devil
In verse 6 James says, 'But He gives greater grace; wherefore it says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble'
To be humble toward God, that is, to be subject to God, is to withstand the Devil, that is, stand against the Devil
The flesh implied in verse 1, the world in verse 4, and the Devil in verse 7 are the three major enemies of the believers
They are related one to another: the flesh is against the Spirit , the world is against God , and the Devil is against Christ
When a believer doubts in prayer, he makes himself two-souled, like a boat with two rudders, unstable in direction
In verses 11 and 12 James gives us a word about not speaking against the brothers: 'Do not speak against one another, brothers
According to the divine revelation in the entire New Testament, there is a definite, clear distinction between the two
In the next section we have another virtue of practical Christian perfection: confiding not in self-will but in the Lord
On the divine level we know Christ, experience Christ, and possess Christ for the building up of the church, His body, as His expression
What James says in these verses is different in tone from what is found elsewhere in the New Testament, especially in the writings of Paul
We see that when Paul was traveling for the preaching of the gospel, he was restrained and directed by the Spirit
If we did not have the fourteen Epistles of Paul, we might be influenced by the book of James to go back to Judaism
In 5:1 James says to the rich, 'Come now, you rich, weep, howling over your miseries which are coming upon you'!
As in Romans 929 Lord of hosts is the equivalent of the divine title in Hebrew JehovahSabaoth which means Jehovah of hosts Jehovah of armies
After the parenthetical section in 5:1-6, we have a word concerning awaiting the Lord's coming with longsuffering
He talks to the rich among the Jews, and then he speaks to Christians about waiting for the Lord's coming back
Behold, the farmer awaits the precious fruit of the earth, being longsuffering over it until it receives the early and late rain'
In verse 8 James continues, 'You also be longsuffering; establish your hearts, because the coming of the Lord has drawn near'
Verse 9 says, 'Do not complain, brothers, against one another, that you be not judged; behold, the Judge stands before the doors'!
You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very compassionate and full of pity'
It is a great help for us to realize that if we are serious about awaiting the Lord's coming back, we need to grow in life
Their expectation is that one day the Lord will suddenly come, and that His coming will have nothing to do with their maturity
It may be that the concepts many Christians hold regarding the Lord's coming back are actually causing Him to delay His coming
The illustration of the farmer in 5:7 implies that the farmer is waiting for the crop growing in the field to ripen
While we are awaiting the Lord's coming back, we need both longsuffering and endurance because we face suffering from two sources
If he loses his job, suffering as a result of that environmental affliction, he will once again need endurance
As we are exercising longsuffering toward those who persecute us and endurance toward afflictions, we need to grow in life
Earlier in this message we pointed out that the Greek word for 'coming' in 5:7 and 8 is parousia, which means presence
The Lord's parousia will last for a period of time, at least three and a half years, the length of the great tribulation
The parousia is likely to begin a little earlier than the tribulation, and it may conclude a little before the end of the great tribulation
It is very difficult for us to know when this will be, because the Lord Jesus has said that only the Father knows the time of His coming
Most Christians do not understand the Lord's coming as being a matter of the parousia, His presence over a period of time
According to James' word, we need to await the coming of the Lord, His parousia, with longsuffering and endurance
Our genuine faithfulness and sincerity in our words according to the divine nature we partake of will keep us from God's judgment
An idle word is a non-working word, an inoperative word, having no positive function, useless, unprofitable, unfruitful, and barren
After telling us not to swear, James says that our yes should be yes and our no should be no, so that we may not fall under judgment
Apparently, they do not realize that whatever they say will one day be judged according to the Lord's word in Matthew 12:36-37
They may have the concept that once they have been saved from eternal perdition, there will be no more problems
We know according to the New Testament that all believers will have to give an account to the Lord at His judgment seat
Because of his concern for Christian perfection, he says in 5:12, 'Above all things, my brothers, do not swear'
In 5:13 James goes on to the matter of healthy practices in the church life: 'Does anyone among you suffer evil?
Praying brings us the strength of the Lord to endure suffering, and singing praise keeps us in the joy of the Lord
In any environment and under any circumstance, humble or exalted, grievous or joyful, we need to contact the Lord
Let him call to him the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil in the name of the Lord'
The anointing in 5:14 is not by elders alone, but by their being one with the Lord, representing both the Body and the Head
The matter of turning back a brother who has been led astray from the truth is also a matter related to the church life
What James says concerning the church involves negative matters, praying for the sick and restoring backsliders
The prayer that Elijah prayed was great, for he prayed that it would not rain on earth for three years and six months
In other words, Elijah had the burden to pray in a particular way, and that burden was a prayer given to him by God
We must have a burden from God to pray for a certain thing, just as Elijah was burdened with the prayer given to him by God
As to the saving, or gaining, of our soul, it depends upon how we deal with it in following the Lord after we are saved and regenerated
If we would lose it now for the Lord's sake, we shall save it , and it will be saved, or gained, at the Lord's coming back
In verse 20 James uses the word 'sinner,' because in the sight of God a misled believer is temporarily a sinner
In 5:20 James also says that the one who turns such a sinner, such a backslidden brother, will save his soul from death
Saving the soul is not a matter of initial salvation; it is a matter of the progressing stage of salvation, the stage of transformation
If this believer does not repent, God may discipline him further to the extent that He cuts short his physical life
In the Gospel of Mark we see a life-the life of the Lord Jesus-that is fully according to and for God's New Testament economy
We cannot find a strong indication with James that he passed through the Old Testament dispensation fully into the New Testament economy
According to Paul's writings, the Jewish believers in Christ have been called by God out of the old dispensation
How then could such a godly person as James address his Epistle which was written to Christian Jews to the twelve tribes in the dispersion
Having purposed, He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a certain firstfruit of His creatures'
The fact that we have been brought forth by the word of truth means that the word is the seed of life, by which we have been regenerated
How could James speak to the twelve tribes and then say that God has brought them forth to be a certain firstfruit of His creatures?
When we compare 1:1 with 1:17 and 18, we see how cloudy was the situation with James, as indicated by this Epistle
In Acts 21 Paul took James' suggestion to go to the temple with certain ones who had a vow and to pay the charge for them
If we read Acts 21 carefully, we shall see that the Lord did not agree with what was happening in Jerusalem, and He came in to deal with it
Although the keeping of the perfect law of freedom is a very positive thing, James speaks of keeping this law in the Old Testament practice
In 1:25 he says that the one who looks into the perfect law and continues in it, being a doer of the work, will be blessed in his doing
The entire New Testament is not for us to keep by ourselves; it is for us to live by the Spirit so that we may keep it
Merely keeping is a matter of doing by ourselves, whereas living is by the indwelling Spirit who is in our regenerated spirit
There is a great difference between one who keeps the law by himself and one who lives according to the Spirit
James speaks of the law of freedom, but he speaks of it in the Old Testament way of keeping the law of letters
James may have thought that the Mosaic law was not complete, not perfect, but that the New Testament teaching is perfect
Some readers of the Epistle of James may think that there is nothing wrong with being a doer of the perfect law
If we read the Bible this way, we read it according to the natural understanding, not according to the enlightenment of the Spirit
All the New Testament teachings are definitions of the living and the indwelling of the all-inclusive Spirit within us
To try to keep these teachings or to do them by ourselves is not our need; our need is to walk according to and by the indwelling Spirit
When we walk according to and by the Spirit, we live the perfect law, the law of freedom; we live the entire New Testament
It came to denote the place of gathering and was used in the New Testament to denote the congregation and congregating place of the Jews
When the Jews returned from captivity, they brought back to their own country this practice of meeting in synagogues
In Jerusalem there were synagogues for Jews who had returned from different areas and had their own languages and customs
In 2:1 and 2a James says, 'My brothers, do not have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect of persons
According to James' understanding, the wisdom that is from above may have been much like the wisdom given by God to Solomon
In 4:4 and 5 James says, 'Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship with the world is enmity with God?
James does speak of the indwelling Spirit, but he speaks of the Spirit only in relation to dealing with the world
The Spirit of the Son is not merely for us to overcome the flesh and deal with the world, but is for Christ to be formed within us
In this message we shall consider some other characteristics of a life that is not fully according to and for God's New Testament economy
He addresses this Epistle to the twelve tribes and even uses the term 'synagogue' to indicate an assembling place for Jewish Christians
You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very compassionate and full of pity'
James' teaching concerning awaiting the Lord's coming is much different from that of the Lord Jesus and the Apostle Paul
Concerning the Lord's coming, Paul also charges us to watch: 'So then, let us not sleep as the rest, but let us watch and be sober'
In his Epistle James speaks concerning the practice of the church life; however, this practice is in the way of mixture
Let him call to him the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil in the name of the Lord'
Although James says a good word concerning prayer in 5:14-16, his way of praying is that of the Old Testament prophets
In the case of Elijah, the Lord gave him a particular prayer as a burden, and Elijah prayed that it would not rain
If we are enlightened by the Lord, we shall see that the way of prayer described by James is the Old Testament way
By this we see that James' writing brings us away from the New Testament practice and back to the Old Testament practice
Since we have pointed out so many shortcomings of the book of James some may wonder if this Epistle is inspired of God if it is Godbreathed
We need to explain carefully what is our attitude toward the inspiration of the Scriptures in relation to the book of James
Throughout the Old Testament many other words were spoken by evildoers and by those who are enemies of God and of His people
Eventually, God Himself came in to speak and He repudiated many of the things that had been spoken by Job and his friends
Certainly, although the Gospels were breathed by God, inspired by God, the words of the high priest and of the people are not God's words
Receiving a revelation from the Father, in Matthew 16:16 Peter declared, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God'
You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men'
Other examples of words spoken by Peter that are not words of God can be found in Matthew 26:33, 70, 72, and 74
What was spoken by James and the other elders in Acts 21 was not the word of God; instead, it was the word of godly men
Just as chapters one and two of Genesis were breathed by God, so chapter three of Genesis was also breathed by God
If we did not have the record of the serpent's speaking as found in Genesis 3, we could not know the serpent's subtlety
Part of this purpose is that we may realize that it is possible even for a godly man to be veiled concerning God's New Testament economy
Praise the Lord that everything in the Bible is God's breath, and everything has been recorded to serve a particular purpose!
