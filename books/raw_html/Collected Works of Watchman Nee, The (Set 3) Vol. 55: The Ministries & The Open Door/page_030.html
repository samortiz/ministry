<h2 class="head1">THE LORD'S GRADUAL ARRANGEMENT</h2><p>I have not written for a long time, but I often remember you in the fellowship of prayer. Thank the Lord that He has done some work in Shanba. It is a work that is not from man. The meeting hall has already been purchased for a total of more than two hundred million yen. There are two courts with a total of fourteen rooms. We use six of the large rooms for meetings. The Lord has done a wonderful work. In the beginning we borrowed, then rented, and now we are able to buy the meeting hall. We never expected the owner to sell us the hall, because he is very rich. After we rented it, the brothers and sisters prayed continually for this hall and asked the Lord to give it to us. Thank the Lord, He heard the prayers of His children. The owner suddenly announced he was going to sell the house. The Lord did this. We saw the Lord's clear presence in everything. Among the brothers and sisters, more than two hundred have been saved for less than two years, and there are not many wealthy ones among us. But within two weeks, we collected enough offerings for everything except a small balance. Glory be to Him.</p><p>Brother, is the Lord leading you to have a conference in Shanghai? Please remember us when you pray. May the Lord preserve you and be with you.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chao Xu-dong<br />May 15, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: 28 Chung Cheng Road, Hsiapa City, West Suiyuan</p><h2 class="head1">THE REMOTE VILLAGE OF JIXINCHUN</h2><p>Peace to the brothers and sisters meeting in the Lord's name in Shanghai:</p><p>In the past, we were very lonely in this remote mountainous region because communication was cut off during the war. Thank the Lord that we heard of the revival and new light in your locality. Our hearts are filled with unspeakable joy. This is the Lord's marvelous doing!</p><p>We received the Lord's leading to come here in the winter of 1941 to open up the barren lands (farming). We began meeting at that time and have continued until now. Although we have passed through the attack of storms and winds, thank the Lord, the number of saved ones has increased.</p><p>There is now one woman who truly believes in the Lord. (She was possessed by demons but turned to the faith.) We were unable to preach the gospel when we first came here because we could not speak the local dialect. Thank the Lord, a small number of brothers are now able to speak it. Because the brothers' harvests are not large, all are forced by the cares of this life to work very hard, and the Lord's work has been put aside. We feel shameful in our hearts and can only ask the Lord to open a door for the gospel. We also ask you brothers to pray for us!</p><p>We feel very weak because we are all infants in the Lord and very immature in the Lord's work. We only learn through petition. We deeply hope that some brothers from your locality could come here to lead and strengthen us. We would be happy to give them hospitality.</p><p>We are sending a table of our condition for your perusal. In the future, we ask you to instruct us much. Please send us a response. May the Lord bless you.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Hsu Xiu-gen, Chou Yuan-lung, He Chai-gen<br />August 11, 1948<br />Mailing Address: c/o Jixin Cooperative Farm, Yangshuchiao,<br />Yiyang, Kiangsi</p><p>(See map on page 78.)</p>
