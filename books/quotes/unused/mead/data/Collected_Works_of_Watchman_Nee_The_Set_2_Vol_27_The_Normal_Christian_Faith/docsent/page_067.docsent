   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE CHURCH, ONE CITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But the Bible gives a clear and simple word concerning the matter of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It has no confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you read the Acts of the Apostles or the beginning of all the Epistles or the first chapter of Revelation, you can see what the Bible calls the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are called "the church in Rome," "the church in Jerusalem," "the church in Corinth," "the church in Colossae," etc. In Revelation 1 there are seven churches in seven localities.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can see that the Bible designates the churches according to only one way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rome is the name of a city.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So is Corinth, Ephesus, Colossae, or Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are all names of cities.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The churches are identified according to the names of cities.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Other than the difference in localities, there is no other way for the churches to be differentiated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church has its locality as its unit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Other than a division according to this unit, the Bible gives no further ramifications.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>NEITHER BIGGER NOR SMALLER</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, whether a church is big or small, its unit is the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Anything smaller than the locality cannot be the unit of the church, nor can anything bigger.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What does it mean to have something smaller than the locality?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first chapter of 1 Corinthians shows us clearly that there was only one church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If some among them should say, "I am of Paul," while some other said, "I am of Apollos," with a third party saying, "I am of Cephas," and a fourth proclaiming, "I am of Christ," the church would be divided into four parts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every one of these parts would be smaller than the boundary of the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible calls this division and walking according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of division produces sects which God hates.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the church cannot be bigger than a locality either.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible shows us that Galatia, which was a province containing many cities, had many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It calls them "the churches of Galatia" Gal 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Again, Asia is a region.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It consists of different areas.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible says that there were seven churches in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Note that it does not mention a unified organization.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, it mentions seven individual local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Foochow, God ordained that there should only be one church, which is the church in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot have a number of churches in one city.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fukien, however, is a province with many cities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this province God has not sanctioned a church of Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Anything that is bigger or smaller than the locality cannot form the basis for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>NO OTHER NAME</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A church can only be named after its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It cannot have any other name.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is also quite clear from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church should not be prefixed by the name of any person, system, country, origin, or doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It must only contain the name of the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, you cannot have a church of Rome in Shanghai or the Church of England in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even the Church of Christ in China is something not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Wherever you are, you are the church in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you want to change churches, you have to move to another locality.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>BORN INTO THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After a man has believed in Jesus Christ through the mercy of God, he must realize that God has put him into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is born into it in the same way that a member is born a part of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no need to join the church, for he is already a part of it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, for the sake of knowing and fellowshipping with other brothers and sisters, he should find a church that stands on the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He should go to them and say, "I am a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Let us have fellowship together."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this way he will be able to function with other members in the Body of Christ and will be able to run a straight course and experience fast progress in his Christian life.</S>
