TO RECOVER THE DORMANT SAINTS</h2>
<p>During the past thirty years, no less than five to six thousand people were baptized in the church in Kaohsiung. We took the time and made the effort to preach the gospel to them, bring them to salvation, and baptize them. But today more than three thousand of them are lost. We have an obligation to find them and recover them. I am speaking these words in every place, not only here. I am speaking the same thing in every locality. The churches have not fulfilled this obligation. Recently I visited a church in Taichung County that has the names and addresses of more than two hundred saints on their list, but only forty saints are in the meetings. This locality has a beautiful meeting hall with a nice office building in the front, but who is in the meetings? I exhorted the saints to promote the small groups and have love feasts in order to focus on recovering the two hundred dormant saints. If they are willing to practice this, within a year one hundred dormant saints will be recovered.</p>
<p>The saints who meet regularly should set aside at least one day a week to look for the saints who have not been meeting for a long time. If a dormant brother is only available during the table meeting, we should sacrifice the table meeting to go and be with him. If we are willing to sacrifice even the meetings to be with the dormant saints, in two or three months they will be recovered. Some brothers or sisters may say, &ldquo;We have suffered a great deal because of the dormant saints. We have begged them and visited them. Week after week the more we begged, the harder their hearts became. You told us that the Lord&rsquo;s work is like a farmer working the soil and that if the soil cannot take a seed, we should move to a location that is more receptive to the seed.&rdquo; Even though this word is true, I would still ask you to go back to visit these ones. Then you will see barren ground turning into fertile land.</p>
<p>We have not yet spread the gospel throughout the entire island. Although we put much effort into bringing people in, we did not uphold them or keep them, nor did we take the time to search for those who were lost. We will not be able to give any excuses for this to the Lord. This is not according to the Lord&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. The Lord treasures the one lost sheep more than the ninety-nine (Luke 15:7). Moreover, the Lord said that when a lost sheep is found, the angels in heaven rejoice. This is not a small thing. It is good that there are saints who are faithful to come to the meetings, but it is also our responsibility to consider the thousands of souls who are perishing and the thousands of brothers and sisters who are still wandering.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONLY SOULS BEING BROUGHT<br />
INTO THE LORD&rsquo;S KINGDOM</h2>
<p>We will now consider the support for the full-timers. In the Old Testament one tribe among the twelve tribes of Israel served full time. This means that eleven tribes supported the livelihood of the tribe of Levi. In Acts 1 one hundred twenty saints were gathered together. Among the one hundred twenty, twelve apostles served full time. One-tenth of the saints served full time; therefore, nine persons supported the livelihood of one. Church history shows that when various mission groups sent missionaries from Europe and America to Africa and Asia to preach the gospel, one out of every twenty believers was sent out as a missionary. I paid a special visit to one of those groups. Their chapel was old, and the furniture and chairs were clean but well-worn. Those believers told me that every penny they had was saved to send missionaries overseas to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>Does the Lord want a beautiful meeting hall, or does He want ten full-timers to go out and serve Him? A beautiful meeting hall cannot be brought into the kingdom. Only people&rsquo;s souls can be brought into the kingdom. If there are fifteen hundred saints meeting regularly in the church in Kaohsiung and twenty saints support one full-timer, the church in Kaohsiung would have seventy-five full-timers. However, there are only a dozen full-timers there. We owe the Lord sixty full-timers. I would like to ask the saints where we can find these sixty persons? I hope the young brothers and sisters would reply, &ldquo;Find them among us.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">SENDING OUT FULL-TIMERS<br />
TO EVANGELIZE TAIWAN IN FIVE YEARS</h2>
<p>There are more than four thousand saints meeting regularly in the church in Taipei. If one out of every twenty saints would serve full time, the church in Taipei owes the Lord another one hundred full-timers, not including the one hundred who already serve full time. In order to evangelize Taiwan in five years, we must produce five hundred full-timers every year, beginning from this year. The Lord sent me to remind you to pay your debt. Our burden in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to spread the gospel so that the gospel would multiply and increase in this age. For this we must produce full-timers. It should not be a difficult thing for one out of every twenty saints to come forth and serve full time or for nineteen saints to support one full-timer. If we do not practice this, the Lord cannot have an outlet in Taiwan. Who will evangelize Taiwan? Will angels do it? Even if the angels are happy to do it, it is not their privilege. The Lord has entrusted us with the position and the privilege to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>If one out of every twenty saints would serve full time, what would the other nineteen do? The full-timers cannot live on air; therefore, the other nineteen saints should bear the burden first to pray for them, that is, to match them in prayer. Furthermore, these nineteen saints should try their best to give financially. Suppose there are seventy-five full-timers, and every full-timer needs ten thousand New Taiwan dollars a month. We would need seven hundred fifty thousand New Taiwan dollars every month, or a total of nine million a year. [Note: ten thousand New Taiwan dollars is equivalent to three hundred thirty U.S. dollars; for seventy-five full-timers, there is a need for roughly twenty-five thousand U.S. dollars a month, or three hundred thousand a year.] For this reason, whenever we spend money, we need to consider how to meet this need. Paul loved the Corinthians and was willing to spend his money and his energy for their souls. He says, &ldquo;I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:15). According to the original Greek text, <em>to be utterly spent</em> refers to his person. For the sake of others&rsquo; souls, Paul not only spent his money but also spent his entire person.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 5: Concerning Various Aspects of Church Service &nbsp; pg 69</div><br></body></html>
