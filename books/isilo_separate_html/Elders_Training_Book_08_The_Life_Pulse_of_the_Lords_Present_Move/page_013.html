AND SPEAKING FORTH GOD</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 14:32 indicates that we need to exercise our spirit to prophesy. To prophesy is not mainly to predict or to foretell the future. This is something miraculous. The word prophesy mainly means to speak for God and to speak forth God. When God called Moses to go to Pharaoh, Moses told Him that he was not eloquent (Exo. 4:10). The Lord gave Moses his brother Aaron to be his prophet, his spokesman (Exo. 4:16; 7:1). As Moses&rsquo; prophet, Aaron spoke for Moses and even spoke forth Moses. To prophesy is to speak for another and to speak forth another.</p>
<p>When most Christians hear the word prophesy they always think of it in the sense of predicting or foretelling the future. The main meaning, however, of the word prophesy is to speak for God and to speak forth God. We need the spirit to speak for God and to speak forth God. Otherwise, whatever we say will just be an ordinary speaking, not prophesying. I may be a bona fide Christian and an ethical, nice gentleman. If I speak in a church meeting in a meek, mild, and normal way this is not prophesying. Apparently I am speaking for God and speaking forth God, telling something of God to others. But actually I am a gentleman, a mild man, a meek man, speaking with no spirit. We have to exercise our spirit when we speak. In our regenerated spirit dwells the Spirit (Rom. 8:16), so whenever we exercise our spirit the indwelling Spirit moves. If we do not use our spirit, and merely speak or converse in an ordinary way, that is not to prophesy. To prophesy is to speak for God, to speak forth God, from your spirit in which, through which, and with which the Holy Spirit speaks in you. This is the difference between prophesying and the human, ordinary speaking.</p>
<p>Many times in our church meetings, too many of the sharings are just ordinary, human speech. Regardless of how nice this kind of speaking is, it does not edify, it does not build up. Sometimes even the one who gives the message speaks in the way that a typical gentleman converses, with no exercise of the spirit. This kind of speaking kills the audience; it does not give life. Regardless of whether you have a big meeting or a small group meeting, the principle is the same&mdash;to speak without the exercise of the spirit kills the ones to whom you are speaking (2 Cor. 3:6). Many of today&rsquo;s Christian meetings will slaughter or kill your spirit. To some extent we are the same. The elders need to have meetings in their localities continuously for two weeks to train the saints in these things before starting any practice. Otherwise, you will be trying to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present and new move with &ldquo;dead bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can illustrate what the elders are doing by relating something that happened in my home town of Chefoo in 1943. There was a strong sister in the church there who spoke in tongues, and the entire church was captured by her. One sister died whom we all loved. Then the sister who spoke in tongues prophesied and told the husband of the dead sister not to prepare any funeral. She said that the next day at twelve noon, our sister would be resurrected. That stirred up the whole church. The next day before noon, the house was crowded with the saints to see this resurrection. A short time before noon, the tongue-speaking sister came in with two helpers. They all kneeled down and spoke in tongues. After approximately one hour, nothing happened, so she lay down on the dead sister&rsquo;s body, mouth to mouth and arm to arm, and she attempted to breathe life into the dead sister. Nothing happened. Then she and her two helpers picked this dead body up and tried to get the body to walk on the floor. Eventually, one of the leading ones charged the husband to prepare a funeral for our sister. Sometimes the elders try to do the same thing with the saints in their locality. All the attendants are dead bodies. You try to breathe life into them and nothing happens. Then you try to pick them up and even hold them up, hoping that they will be brought to life. Eventually, everyone gets disappointed with the meeting.</p>
<p>Most of the saints like to have a big gathering with a good speaker speaking to them. They feel inspired and edified in this kind of meeting. But mostly they do not appreciate coming together in the way of mutuality with everyone speaking, whether it be in a home gathering or with the whole church coming together. This is the situation because all the attendants are like dead bodies, somewhat like the scattered bones in Ezekiel 37. Ezekiel 37 is a picture of today&rsquo;s Christianity, a picture of scattered bones. In the church meetings what we can see is mostly dead bodies, which is a little bit better than scattered bones.</p>
<p>The elders need to call a conference for two weeks and declare a fast. The whole church needs to fast and pray for our poor, present situation. Let all the saints know and realize the poor situation among us. We have no ground to criticize other Christian bodies. What about ourselves? We are dead, cold, and lukewarm. We need to fast and pray. Then some proper messages need to be given to the saints to edify them, to enliven them, and to tell them that they need to &ldquo;shake the chairs.&rdquo; I am not promoting tongue-speaking, but we need to fellowship with the saints to stir up their spirit in the right way. Chair shaking or tongue-speaking is not the right way. That would get the saints addicted. We need to stir up the saints in seeking such a spirit that is exercised to the uttermost.</p>
<p>Quite often in our meetings the one who is speaking will have to be told by some other saints to speak louder. The reason why this person is speaking in such a way is because his spirit is not exercised. When we exercise our spirit there is a big difference in the way that we speak. The person giving a testimony must be told to speak louder because he is &ldquo;a carcass.&rdquo; A carcass is something dead with no spirit.</p>
<p>For the meeting of the entire church and for the home gatherings we all have to exercise our spirit, so we need to exercise our spirit in our daily life. Especially a half hour before meeting time we should exercise our spirit to get ourselves prepared for the meeting. The members of an athletic team get themselves prepared for the game by warming up. It would be a joke to think that they would come to play a game with a tie and a suit on. But most of the saints come to the church meeting in this way. One brother might ask another who is going to speak in the meeting. When he hears that there will be no speaker but that everybody will speak, he feels that this is too bad. When he hears that Brother Lee is coming to speak, he gets excited and stirred up. This shows how terrible the situation is among us. We say that we are in the recovery, but meeting-wise we still remain in Christianity, we still practice Christianity, and we still repeat Christianity.</p>
<p>The first thing needed is for the leading ones to call a conference and declare a fast. Tell the saints for what purpose we have to fast&mdash;for the deadness, the coldness, the lukewarmness, the indifference, and the spiritless situation. We need to fast and we need to stir ourselves up. We hate to repeat the history of Christianity. We do not promote chair shaking or tongue-speaking, but we like to see what is taught and revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. We like to have the proper prophesying.</p>
<p>Again I want to say that prophesying is speaking for God with our spirit and speaking forth God with our spirit. First Corinthians 14:1 tells us that we need to have an earnest desire to prophesy. Then verse 3 says that prophesying builds up, encourages, and consoles people. Since to prophesy, to speak forth the Lord, ministers Christ to people, it builds up people and gives them encouragement and consolation. Only prophesying can fulfill this three-fold duty to build up, to encourage, and to console the saints. This is what we need, so we have to prophesy.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:31 says, &ldquo;you can all prophesy...&rdquo; God desires that each of the believers prophesy, that is, speak for and speak forth Him. In Numbers 11:29 Moses exclaimed to his helper Joshua, &ldquo;Would God that all the Lord&rsquo;s people were prophets.&rdquo; Even in Old Testament times, God wanted every one of His people to speak for Him and to speak forth Him. How much more should this matter of prophesying be with all the believers in the New Testament age! I am concerned that even though I have given a message concerning this (see <em>The Divine Speaking</em>&mdash;pp. 14-18), and you may have heard this, you have not promoted it. Everywhere the elders have to promote the prophesying of all the saints, including the sisters.</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 11:5 women can prophesy, and the book of Acts gives us illustrations of sisters being prophets (2:17-18; 21:9). The Bible, however, does not allow sisters to teach with authority. Sisters should be silent in the meetings in the sense of teaching with authority (1 Cor. 14:34; 1 Tim. 2:12). Both the sisters and the brothers are all privileged to speak for God and to speak forth God (see note 34<sup>2</sup> in 1 Cor. 14&mdash;Recovery Version). For years I could not understand why in 1 Corinthians 11 a woman was allowed to pray and prophesy with her head covered, but in 1 Corinthians 14 Paul said that in the church meeting the women should be silent. Eventually I realized from the Scriptures that sisters are privileged to prophesy even in big public meetings, but in any meeting sisters are not permitted to speak as a teacher to define certain doctrines with authority as the brothers. The Lord never gave this portion to the sisters. All the sisters, however, are privileged to speak for God, to speak forth God. When they speak, they need some covering. This covering is not merely a piece of cloth, but it means that the sisters have to speak under the covering of the brothers. We all must see that whenever we come together either in a big gathering or in a small group the principle is the same&mdash;we have to exercise our spirit that we may speak for God and that we may speak forth God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
