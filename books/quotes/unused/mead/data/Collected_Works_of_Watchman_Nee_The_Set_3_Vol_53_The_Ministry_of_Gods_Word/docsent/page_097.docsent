   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We should be in fear and trembling all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Even though the Lord may use us, we must not forget that we are still unqualified.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to remember the gravity of our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If something is wrong with us, the flaws that are in our spirit will be mixed in with the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One day the Lord will shine His light in us, and we will prostrate ourselves before Him and say, "Nothing that I have said in the past was up to Your mark."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Anyone who receives any light will be deeply conscious of his past failures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Indeed, God's Spirit may have accomplished some amount of work through us, but our person is still wrong; we remain an impure vessel before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not a perfect vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the hand of God we are a contaminated vessel, and we need deeper dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When a man receives the light, he discovers his shortcomings; he realizes that his very person is unusable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the word is released, the spirit must also be released.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we need to ask for mercy and grace so that everything would be under the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every day we must learn to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without this, our spirit will not be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord may want to make us a minister of the word; He may be working in us every day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the dealings, trials, and occurrences in our environment are for the purpose of increasing our usefulness in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All things work together to make our spirit purer and more perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They work together to bring about a purer flow when our spirit is released and to increase the usefulness of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today God may grant us mercy and allow His Spirit to be released through us, and we may think that we are now a great servant of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may be puffed up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may think that all is well, without any realization that His selection was merely provisional in its measure.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must realize that the training of a minister of the word is a daily matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is also a lifelong work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The words we speak may not improve, but our spirit can improve.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps the words we speak are the same as the words we spoke ten years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But when we speak the same words today, our spirit is different from the spirit we had ten years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A young man must never think that he can give the same message as an older man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He can speak the same words, but he does not have the same spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some brothers repeat the same things they spoke twenty or thirty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The words are the same, but the spirit is different.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should never be concerned with whether we have the same words but whether we have the same spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While we can speak the words of some older brothers, it is not easy to have their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not enough for a minister of the word to have the word alone; he must also have the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord said, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When a minister of the word stands up to speak for the Lord, not only must his words be pure, but the release of his spirit must be pure as well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not a matter of whether or not we can say the words, but of whether our release of the spirit is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The issue is not our eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is at stake is the kind of spirit we convey when we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One realm justifies a man as long as he is clever, eloquent, and wise.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But another realm demands nothing less than the Lord's chastising hand and the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The two belong to two entirely different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The second kind of word can only be "beaten out" through the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Words are beaten into existence; they are wrought into one's being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every day the Holy Spirit "beats" the word into a person's being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are going to preach a message today, it is not enough to simply deliver the word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may think afterwards that our message was wonderful, and we may feel very good about ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may think that we can continue to preach the same message.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may think that our words are not much different from those who have the genuine ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet none of our speaking will result in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In fact, we are living in a different realm.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Others might have told us about a truth, and we might have received it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since that time, we may be speaking about the same truth, but our speaking does not lead us anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The words can be the same, but if we do not have the proper spirit, there will be flaws in the release of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord's words are spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why our spirit must be dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our person must be carved and molded before our spirit can be released in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the word is released and the spirit is released, praise the Lord, the Holy Spirit is released as well.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the way of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Without such a release, we will be like scribes teaching the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The trouble with this kind of teaching is that everything is doctrinal, didactic, and expositional.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If the spirit is not involved, everything is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God has to work on us until our spirit is released whenever the word is released.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes there is the need of extraordinary release.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But not every instance requires such extraordinary effort; only a few times do we need such special outbursts.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>During these times the Holy Spirit bursts out and operates in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Unless we have such an experience, the message we preach will not match the preaching of the apostles.</S>
