   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE DESIRES CONCERNING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first section covers three desires concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The First Desire: "Your Name Be Sanctified"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Your name be sanctified!"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has an expectation that we all pray for His name to be sanctified by men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His name is exalted among the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But on earth, His name is being used in vain; even the idols use His name.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When a man takes the name of God in vain, God does not show His wrath by striking him with thunder.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He hides Himself, as if He did not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When a man takes His name in vain, He does not do anything to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet He wants His children to pray, "Your name be sanctified."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brothers and sisters, if you love God and know Him, you will want His name to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If anyone takes God's name in vain, you will feel hurt, your desire will be even stronger, and you will pray even more earnestly: "Your name be sanctified."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One day man will sanctify this name and no longer take this name in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Your name be sanctified!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's name is not only a title we address with our mouth; it is a great revelation we receive from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's name is used in the Bible to designate His revelation to man concerning Himself; it denotes everything we know about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's name speaks of God's nature, and it reveals His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not something that man can understand with his soul but something that the Lord reveals to us John 17:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord said, "And I have made Your name known to them and will yet make it known, that the love with which You have loved Me may be in them, and I in them" 17:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This shows us that in order to know God's name, we need the Lord to make it known to us again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Your name be sanctified!"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not only our desire but also our worship to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should give glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should begin our prayer with praises.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before we can hope to receive mercy and grace from Him, we should give glory to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should allow Him to gain the fullest praise concerning Himself, and then we should receive grace from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brothers and sisters, we have to remember that the main thing and the ultimate goal in our prayer is for God to gain glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Your name be sanctified!"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's name is linked to God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ezekiel 36 says, "But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went" v. 21 . This means that the house of Israel had not sanctified God's name, so God's name was profaned wherever they went among the heathens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet God had pity for His holy name.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our Lord wants us to have this desire.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In other words, He wants to glorify His own name through us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's name must first be sanctified in our hearts before our desire can be turned to something more profound.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There must be a deep work of the cross before we can glorify God's name.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Otherwise, our desire is not even a desire but only an empty idea.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brothers and sisters, this being the case, how much we need to be dealt with and trimmed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Second Desire: "Your Kingdom Come"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What kind of kingdom is this kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we read the context in Matthew, we will see that this kingdom refers to the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord teaches us to pray, "Your kingdom come."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that the kingdom of God is in heaven, but the kingdom of God is not on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Consequently, we have to pray for God to expand the heavenly sphere to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Bible God's kingdom is historical as well as geographical.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>History has to do with time, while geography has to do with place.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to the Bible, the kingdom of God is more a geographical matter than a historical matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord said, "If I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you" Matt 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Is this related to history?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No, it is something related to geography.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The kingdom of God is wherever the Son of God casts out demons.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, within this period of time, the kingdom of God is more a matter of geography than a matter of history.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Brothers and sisters, if you are filled with a historical concept of the kingdom, you have seen only one side of the truth and not all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the Old Testament, one only finds prophecy concerning the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the Lord Jesus came, we had the declaration of John the Baptist, who proclaimed that the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near Matt 3:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then the Lord Jesus Himself said that the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They said this because by then there were people who were already of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By Matthew 13, we have the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today the kingdom of God is wherever God's children cast the demons and their works out by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In asking us to pray for His kingdom to come, the Lord is looking forward to the time when God's kingdom will fill the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"Your kingdom come!"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is not only a desire of the church, but also a responsibility of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The church should bring in God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In order to bring in God's kingdom, the church has to pay the price to be restricted by heaven and come under heaven's rule.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It has to be the outlet for heaven, and it has to allow heaven's authority to be expressed on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In order to bring in God's kingdom, the church has to know all the schemes of Satan 2 Cor 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It has to put on the whole armor of God and stand against the stratagems of the devil Eph 6:11 , for wherever the kingdom of God is, the devil is cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the kingdom of God rules on earth fully, Satan will be cast into the abyss Rev 20:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Since the church has such a tremendous responsibility, Satan will do all he can to attack the church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May the church pray like the saints of old, "O Jehovah, bow Your heavens down and descend" Psa 144:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>"Oh that You would rend the heavens, that You would come down" Isa 64:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At the same time, we should say to Satan, "Depart from the earth immediately, and go to the eternal fire which God has prepared for you" cf.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Matt 25:41 .</S>
