<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Church Being the New Man<br>Created in Christ, through His Cross,<br>with the Jewish and Gentile Believers</H2><P>The church is the new man created in Christ, through His cross, with the Jewish and Gentile believers (Eph. 2:14-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Church Being the Mingling<br>of the Processed Triune God with the Believers,<br>Being Built Up as the Organic Body of Christ<br>by the Gifted Members and by Each<br>Functioning Part through the Growth in Life</H2><P>The church is the mingling of the processed Triune God with the believers (Eph. 4:3-6), being built up as the organic Body of Christ by the gifted members (every joint of the rich supply) and by each functioning part through the growth in life (Eph. 4:11-13, 15-16). The church as the organic Body of Christ is built up by two categories of persons: first, the gifted persons, who are the joints of the rich supply, and second, each functioning part. We should have and we do have these two kinds of persons among us. In the building up of the Body of Christ, the gifted persons perfect the saints that the saints may do the work of the New Testament ministry, that is, that they may build up the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Church Being the House of God,<br>the Habitation of God in Our Spirit</H2><P>The church is the house of God (Eph. 2:19b; 1 Tim. 3:15), the habitation of God in our spirit (Eph. 2:22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. The Church Being the Kingdom of God Today,<br>the Reality of the Kingdom of the Heavens</H2><P>The church is the kingdom of God today, the reality of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 16:18-19). In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, "On this rock I will build My church." Then, in verse 19 He said, "I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens." This shows us that today the proper church life is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. The Church Existing Universally<br>as the Unique Universal Church, but Being<br>Expressed Locally as Many Local Churches</H2><P>The church exists universally as the unique universal church (Eph. 1:22-23), but it is expressed locally as many local churches (Rev. 1:4a, 11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. This All Being according to<br>the Arrangement of God's Eternal Economy</H2><P>This is all according to the arrangement of God's eternal economy (Eph. 3:9-11; 1:9-11).</P>
