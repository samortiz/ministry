   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWING UP INTO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE DETAILS OF OUR DAILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the brothers buy a necktie, it seems that this is a small thing, but the principle in buying it is not small.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have to grow up into Christ in the matter of buying a tie.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am happy to see the young people seeking and loving the Lord so much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But as you are seeking the Lord so much, you need to grow up into Christ when you go to the department store to buy a tie.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When you buy a tie, you must have the assurance that you are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you are not sure, that means your shopping is not in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With us it is not a matter of right or wrong; it is a matter of being in Christ or apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have to be able to tell Satan, "Satan, look, my shopping is in Christ!"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Could you say this?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You can cheat me, but you cannot cheat the devil, because he knows.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We also need to consider how we cut and style our hair.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brothers, how about your haircut?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you go to get a haircut, this is not a small matter, because you practice a principle of growing into Christ in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This includes your haircut.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Have you grown into Christ in the way that you cut your hair?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not argue with me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Simply go to Christ and check with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may want to know what kind of haircut is right.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would say, "I don't know.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He knows."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I believe that if you go along with Him and go to Him and say, "O Lord, my haircut," you will know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He knows and you know too.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Others do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But after you cut it, those who are spiritual know whether or not the cutting of your hair is of the flesh or of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They know whether you have grown up into Christ in the matter of cutting your hair.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to bring all the items of our daily walk to the Lord, and say, "O Lord," over every item.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not just say, "O Lord," in a general way, but in a specific way, in an itemized way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Item by item you have to say, "O Lord," and seek His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then you will have the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kind of practice will revolutionize you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The older brothers and sisters may feel that the young people are too much and need to be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But we should not think that our oldness is something of Christ either.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to grow up into Christ in our oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to give up our oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need a change.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My point is that we have to grow up into Christ in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The sisters should not just call on the Lord in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have to call on the Lord in everything in your daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You need to go to the Lord with every item of your daily walk and have a thorough dealing with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then you will see the change, not by teaching, correction, or outward adjustment, but by the growth in life into Christ in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You need to call on the Lord when you buy your eyeglasses.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then the Lord will adjust you inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do not do this, we are not faithful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we use the name of the Lord, we must mean it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Second Timothy 2:22 says that we need to pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 19 says, "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All those who name the name of the Lord must depart from any kind of iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we say, "O Lord," we have to mean business with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not call on the Lord in a light or loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We mean it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we call on the Lord and yet do not deal with the items of our daily walk, I am afraid that we are being loose with the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to mean business with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we mean business with the Lord by saying, "O Lord," I believe the Lord will point out specific things to us in our daily walk which need to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to bring every item of our daily walk into the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In every item we need to pray, "Lord, how about this?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No one can tell us specifically except the Lord Himself.</S>
