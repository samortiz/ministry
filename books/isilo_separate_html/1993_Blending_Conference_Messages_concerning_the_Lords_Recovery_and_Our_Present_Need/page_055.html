AS THE GOD-REDEEMED-REGENERATED-<br>TRANSFORMED-GLORIFIED PEOPLE,<br>SIGNIFIED BY THE FOLLOWING SIGNS</H2><P>As the God-redeemed-regenerated-transformed-glorified people, we testify for Jesus. This testimony of Jesus is signified by a number of signs in the book of Revelation. The seven lampstands, the man-child, the firstfruits, the bride, and the New Jerusalem are clear signs with spiritual significance. We may also say that the overcomers within the churches and the late overcomers are signs. This is because the book of Revelation is a whole book of signs. </P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Golden Lampstands</H2><P>The golden lampstands, as a sign of the churches, signify that the churches as the counterpart of Christ are a testimony to Jesus for the Triune God (Rev. 1:12-13, 20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. By the Gold</H2><P>The testimony of the lampstands is by the gold, signifying the Father's nature as the divine substance of the churches. All the seven lampstands are of pure gold. Gold in typology signifies God in His nature. This shows that all the churches are of God's nature. They are divine.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. By the Shape</H2><P>The shape of the lampstands signifies the embodied form of Christ the Son as the manifestation of the churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. By the Shining</H2><P>The shining of the seven lamps of the lampstands signifies the Spirit's expression as the bright testimony of the church to Christ for God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Overcomers within the Churches</H2><P>The overcomers within the churches signify the overcoming part of the churches (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). In order to be a proper Christian today, you have to overcome all the distractions and also the degradation of today's Christianity. Furthermore, you have to overcome the satanic world system, spiritual deadness, and spiritual lukewarmness.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> </body></html>
