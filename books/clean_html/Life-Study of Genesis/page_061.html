<H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(2) The Sabbath Was Made for Man</H2><P>The Pharisees forced every man to be for the sabbath. The Lord condemned them, telling them that they were absolutely wrong. He said that the sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath (Mark 2:27). Hallelujah! Man's destiny is not work&#151;it is the sabbath.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(3) Man Rests Because God Rests</H2><P>Whenever God is satisfied, you are satisfied. Whenever you are satisfied, that is a proof that God is at rest. He is satisfied.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(4) Man Rests When God's Work on Man<br>Reaches His Goal</H2><P>Don't work. Just take care of one thing: to let God reach His goal. What is God's goal? God's goal is to have His image expressed and to have His dominion exercised. As long as you have God's image expressed and God's dominion exercised to deal with His enemy, God has reached His goal. God will say, "I am satisfied." Then you will say, "God, I am satisfied too." Thus, you rest with God.</P><P>All the aforementioned rests are due to the fact that God has reached His goal and man enjoys the rest with God. Praise the Lord! This is wonderful.</P><P>I am so happy that the Lord has afforded us the opportunity to release these nine messages on Genesis. From these messages we can see that everything written in the divine record is fully focused on life. Genesis 1 and 2 are simply an outline. The biographies of the eight men&#151;Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph&#151;will present the full picture. Eventually we will see that Jacob and Joseph are coupled together. These two are actually one man: Jacob becomes Israel, the prince of God, bearing the image of God; Joseph becomes the one to rule over everything, exercising God's dominion. At the end of Genesis, we will see a dual man: one aspect&#151;Jacob&#151;expressing God's image and the other aspect&#151;Joseph&#151;exercising God's dominion. God's image is expressed, God's authority is exercised, and there is rest. Hallelujah!</P><P>The whole Bible, with all its stories, histories, biographies, and teachings, is focused on life. This life will produce the expression of God and the representation of God. God will be manifested and His enemy will be dealt with. Hallelujah! Then there will be ultimate rest in this universe. We thank God for the Old Testament and the New Testament. Without the New Testament, it would be difficult for us to understand the allegories, types, figures, and shadows of the Old Testament. However, without the Old Testament, we would have only the direct words of the New Testament. We would lack the pictures. Praise the Lord that we have both testaments. We have the pictures and we have the clear words that we may know where we are&#151;in God's image and God's dominion. We shall be in God's rest. We need to remember the five crucial words that we have covered thus far&#151;image, dominion, blessing, satisfaction, and rest. When we bear the image of God expressing Him, we will have the dominion of God representing Him. Then His full blessing will be upon us and we will be satisfied. Eventually, God and we will all rest in full satisfaction under His blessing with His image and dominion.</P>
