These prophecies speak of a child born and a son given. The word child in these verses implies God, implies man, implies God becoming a man, and implies God and man mingled together as one. Such a child was a God-man. This child of both the divine and human natures born of a human virgin was also a son given in the divine nature by the Eternal Father.</P><P>The first poetic pair of items revealed concerning Christ in the book of Isaiah is that He is the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth (4:2). The second pair of items concerning Christ is an issue of the first pair. This pair is Christ as the covering canopy of glory and the overshadowing tabernacle of grace (4:5-6). We are covered under the glory and we are overshadowed by grace. Christ as grace is a tabernacle overshadowing us, and Christ as glory is a canopy covering us. Many of the riches of Christ seen in Isaiah are not pointed out in the New Testament. Paul's writings, for example, do not speak of Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth. The Christ whom Paul ministered to us and helped us to pursue is God's Shoot to branch out God and the Fruit of the earth for His multiplication and reproduction. God's branching out was for Him to spread Himself from and with divinity into humanity. In eternity past and before the incarnation, He was merely in the territory of divinity. Then through His incarnation, He branched out into another territory, the territory of humanity.</P><P>The second revelation Isaiah saw concerning Christ was that of Christ in His divine glory with His human virtues held in His holiness (6:1-10). His divine glory is signified by the smoke, His human virtues are signified by the train of His robe, and His holiness is held by the seraphim. Isaiah was sent by the Christ who is full of the divine glory and the human virtues in His holiness.</P><P>In this message we come to the third major revelation of Christ in Isaiah, seen in 7:14 and 9:6. This pair of items of Christ is a child born of a human virgin and a son given by the Eternal Father. Isaiah 7:14 says, "Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel." Isaiah 9:6 says, "For a child is born to us, a son is given to us; and the government is upon His shoulders; and His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace." The child born in 9:6 is the One born of a virgin and called Immanuel in 7:14.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_168.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_170.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 169</div><br></body></html>
