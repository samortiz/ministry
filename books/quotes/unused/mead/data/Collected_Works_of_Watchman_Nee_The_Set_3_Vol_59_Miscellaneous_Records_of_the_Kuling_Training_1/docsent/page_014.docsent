   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ready to Receive Others' Spirit Ready to Receive Help from Others</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth benefit from the breaking of the outer man is that it becomes easy for others' spirit to come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In other words it becomes easy for one to receive help from others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The breaking of the outer man is very much related to the way we live.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the outer man is dealt with, we can respond to the slightest movement in others' spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It becomes easy for us to receive supply from others, and it becomes easy for others' spirit to get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even the slightest move of the spirit of a very simple Christian will render supply to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The spirit of others' will become a supply to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the Spirit of God is moving, yet we do not touch Him even though we are in the midst of this moving, it proves that we are living in the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, we may walk into a denomination, and we may find many things which we can criticize.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, there should always be something of the Spirit from which we can receive supply.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we find it hard to receive help from anyone, it proves that our outer man is not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our spirit cannot go out to others, and others' spirit cannot come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A person whose outer man is dealt with can receive help very easily from others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A sister once said that she does not take in others' words easily.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A brother once said that he was never easily moved by anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Another brother said that he never shed any tears.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We surely can say that these ones have a very hard outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They have to be put to death, and their hard shells have to be cracked.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The shell of the grain in John 12 is very hard; it has to fall into the ground and be softened and cracked by moisture and pressure before the germ within will spring forth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When a man's outer shell is broken, he will find it easy to listen to others and to be touched by others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He will not only find it easy to release his spirit and touch others, but he will notice his own mistakes, repent, and confess his mistakes easily.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He will be able to afford a free and generous course for others' spirits to come into him and his own spirit to flow out to others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There was a brother who had a certain weakness all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was a typical weakness found among brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The responsible brothers spoke to him more than once and reminded him of his weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, it was a tough spot in him, and exhortation did not help him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What should we do with such a brother?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to muster up enough indignation within before we can deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before we can deal with our brother's problem, the burden and pressure within us must build up, and the indignation must grow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When this burden finally reaches a certain critical point, we will pour out our indignation on the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even though he may have built up a hard shell around himself, our word will break him like a hammer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It will not brush him superficially like a little broom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way he will get some help from our word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When a person's outer man is broken, others' spirits find it easy to touch him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is hard to give some people a word of advice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can say all we want, but their nodding does not mean anything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A broken man, however, is ready to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is easy for him to confess his wrong and to yield to others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a man is not broken, even his outward meekness will not do him any good.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sooner or later he will be stirred up, and he will create greater havoc.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people are hard, intransigent, and stubborn because they have never given up their self, their face, and their pride.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They want to preserve their own pride and face.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A broken man, however, is different.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is easy for him to give in and to confess his mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is hard to touch the hearts of some people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seems that they have to be hit with a hammer before their hearts can be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is hard to deal with such ones, and it is hard for them to receive help from others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is hard to get through in those whose outer man is not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those whose spirit is so unapproachable are always a problem to the other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Ready to Receive Frank Words</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I will use Brother Sun Feng-lu as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was a magistrate, a job which requires the shrewdness of a politician.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before he was saved, his spirit was closed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Other people would never speak an honest word to him out of fear of being incriminated.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Everyone acted diplomatically around him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After he believed in the Lord, the church would have suffered great confusion if he had continued in his politics and maneuvering.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He would, of course, have been wrong, but we would have been wrong as well.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In such a case, the church would no longer have been the church, but a worldly society.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the church we are all open to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We accept the breaking and do not want to save our face.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This makes it easier for us to speak to one another, and it brings in more genuineness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Others are able to speak an honest word to us when we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By nature Brother Sun does not take others' words easily.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But if his outer man and inner man are separated, many problems will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we are afraid of offending this brother or that sister, we will not dare say anything, and the church will become a social organization, a community of politicians and diplomats.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our outer man must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is how we can speak the truth to one another and how we can mutually edify and perfect one another.</S>
