   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TAKING HEED TO LABOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I feel that the great lack we have today in the matter of bringing Christ to the meetings is that our harvest is not rich.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is why sometimes when you come to testify, you try to use some gimmicks.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am not saying that you should refrain from all kinds of methods, but I am afraid that you have these without content.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The gimmicks are for embellishment; they are not the content.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I would prefer not to have any gimmicks or methods but rather to have more content.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot gain substance in our testimonies in only a few days; we need to labor for an extended period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brothers and sisters, we have to turn back to the Lord to have a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to labor that we may grow something.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes the Lord is like the grain sown into us; at other times He is in us as a small tree.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This tree may be an olive tree, a vine, a fig tree, or a pomegranate tree.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You need to cultivate it that it may grow and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then when you come to the meetings, you will have the firstfruit to offer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The problem today is that when we come to the meetings, we only know how to release our spirit and call on the name of the Lord; we cannot present anything with substance to enjoy with others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This may be likened to coming to the feast empty-handed or with only a small pigeon, which is enough for only one meal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since many are devoid of things to present, they have to resort to some amusing activities to make people laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Regrettably, everyone then remains empty within.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we have an abundant harvest and are rich in grain, new wine, bulls, sheep, and pigeons, we can bring in our produce, basket upon basket and pile upon pile.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can present our bulls, sheep, pigeons, and fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That will be very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everyone will be very supplied and will want to come back the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I hope you will not spend your energy on gimmicks; rather, you will use your effort to produce a content.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You need to sow the field, cultivate the fruit trees, tend the cattle, and take care of the pigeons.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Subsequently, the crops in the field, the trees on the mountains, the bulls, sheep, and pigeons on the farm will all grow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You will be rich because everything in you will be continually growing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By this way the sower has seed, the eater has bread, and the offerer has something to offer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When everyone brings his riches to the meetings, the meetings will be delivered from all the old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have this much to say at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we all have learned to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have learned that there are two kinds of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One is the eating in sowing, and the other is the eating in harvesting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The eating in sowing cannot constitute our worship; we need the eating in harvesting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When you bring the eating in harvesting, that will constitute the true worship and the genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church needs this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to look to the Lord and open up to Him that we all may learn to be exercised in the matter of eating.</S>
