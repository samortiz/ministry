<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF MUCH STUDY</h2>
<p>You young brothers are in a golden time because you have many years to study these precious things if the Lord delays His coming. I believe that all this wonderful knowledge will be very useful in the millennium and in eternity. If you do not pick this knowledge up today it will be too late. You will be the &ldquo;later graduates.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ultimate Consummation of the Stones</h2>
<p>Again let me emphasize that we must study the consummation of all the stones in the Bible from Genesis 2. Onyx is the very first stone mentioned in the Bible and one of the last stones mentioned in the Bible is jasper. This is very interesting and needs your study. You also must study the twelve stones on the breastplate of Urim and Thummim and the stones on the shoulders of the high priest. By such study you will receive something.</p>
<p>When you present these things to the saints, even the new ones among us will enjoy hearing them. You will attract people, and the church will be built up through the saints being edified by you. Then your preaching or teaching will enrich the ministry in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. You do not need to go to the traditional teachings in the books on your shelves. Many marvelous mines in the twenty-seven books of the New Testament have been opened up in these last ten years. The only problem is that we did not take the time to dig in them. Do not go away from these mines to other sources, hoping to get something there. You must see the ultimate consummation of all the stones.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ultimate Consummation of the River</h2>
<p>Then you must go on to study and see the ultimate consummation of the river with the water of life in the Bible. In Genesis 2 we see a river flowing out of Eden to water the garden that parts into four heads (v. 10). In Exodus there is the flowing water out of the cleft rock. Psalm 46 tells us that there is a river whose streams make glad the city of God (v. 4), and Psalm 36:8 tells us that the Lord will make us to drink of the river of His pleasures. Also, in Ezekiel 47 we see a river that brings life wherever it goes (v. 9). Finally, in Revelation 22:1 we see a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the book of Revelation there are some minor things which should not be considered as consummations of the things in the other books of the Bible. But all the major things are the consummation of items already existing in the Bible. This is because Revelation is a book of the harvest of all the truths in the Bible. It is the harvest of all the seeds of the divine truth which have been sown and grown up throughout the Scriptures. This is why in Ezekiel 47 the water is issuing out of God&rsquo;s house (vv. 1-2), which nearly matches Revelation 22 with the water proceeding out of the throne of God. From God&rsquo;s temple there is water flowing and from God&rsquo;s throne there is water flowing. Then in the New Testament the Lord Jesus says that if we drink of Him we will have rivers of living water flowing out of our innermost being (John 7:37-38). Paul also tells us that the Israelites in the wilderness drank the same spiritual drink and that they drank of Christ who was the spiritual rock which followed them (1 Cor. 10:4). In Revelation chapter seven we see that the Lamb shepherds the saints and guides them to springs of waters of life (v. 17). In 21:6 it says that God will give to the thirsty one from the spring of the water of life freely. Also, in chapter twenty-two is the ultimate calling in the entire Bible. The Spirit and the Bride say that whosoever is thirsty must come to drink the water of life (v. 17). This needs much study. This is the consummation of the river and of the water of life in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ultimate Consummation of Light and Life</h2>
<p>We also need to study light throughout the Bible with its consummation. We have to go to all the references of light in the Old Testament and in the New Testament. In Genesis 1 are the fourth day lights. Psalm 36 says, &ldquo;In Your light we see light&rdquo; (v. 9). Isaiah 2:5 says, &ldquo;House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.&rdquo; Peter tells us that we have been called out of darkness into His marvelous light (1 Pet. 2:9). Even Paul was charged by the Lord to preach the gospel to open peoples&rsquo; eyes and to turn them from darkness to light (Acts 26:18). There are many references to light in the Old and New Testaments which we must study. Once you have studied light throughout the Bible, then you can see that the light in Revelation 21 is a consummation of all the light in the Bible. We have also seen that the tree of life, the river of life, and the light of life are the consummation of the divine life throughout the Bible. This also needs our study.</p>
