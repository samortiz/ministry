   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We should come before God to rebuke our self and offer up everything to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the Spirit of the Lord, we should put to death everything that is included in our self-life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should tell God, "Hereafter, it is no longer I, no longer my own likeness, opinions, tastes, or preconceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I will put all these on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Starting from today, I will live only according to Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is You...not I."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should submit to the Lord in such a way as to put all we have to death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But this does not mean that from now on we will have the self exterminated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The self cannot and will not be exterminated; it always exists.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why then do we say to nail the self on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here we must know one important thing: the question before us is one that has to do with the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this kind of question, we must emphasize spiritual experience more than mere literary fluency.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are many things which seem to contradict one another in semantics and which seem utterly incompatible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet they fit very harmoniously together and have no awkwardness of any kind in the realm of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is what happens here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the literal meaning, if the self is dead already, how can it not be exterminated?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to know that the word "dead" here refers to a kind of process in the spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The self being dead does not mean that the self is from now on non-existent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It means that the self will hereafter submit to God, that it will not allow its likes and dislikes to take over, but that it will allow the cross to crucify and terminate all its selfish thoughts and activities.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To stop the self-life from driving the self means that the living which is derived from the self-life is dead, that there is no more self-life and self-living, and that only the shell of the self remains.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The self includes the will, the emotions, the intelligence, etc. This does not mean that when we believe in our self being crucified with Christ, our will, emotions, intellect, etc., will be annulled! No one can annihilate the few faculties which make up his being just by believing in his having been crucified with the Lord! To die with the Lord simply means to no longer allow the self to be the master, to no longer act according to one's own will, emotions, and thoughts, and to no longer allow the self-life to have its way; it means to allow the Lord's Spirit to rule over everything that the self encompasses so that the person can obey God's life within.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As long as the self is not dead, it will not yield to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once the self walks away from the cross, it will right away resume its old posture.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Believers have neither the power nor the way to subdue themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Galatians 2:20 sheds a lot of light on this point.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"I the self am crucified with Christ;...and the life which I now live in the flesh...."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Does not the Scripture speak very clearly here?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the first part of the sentence Paul made it very clear that his self was crucified on the cross, yet in the second part of the sentence, did he not say that his self still existed?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, the crucifixion of the self does not mean the extermination of the self; rather, it means to cease from the activities of the self and allow the Lord to be the Master.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This should be very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What has been said above was achieved once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But is it enough for us only to believe once that we are crucified with Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Will this solve the problem once for all?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This leads to the second passage of Scripture: "Let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me" Luke 9:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This verse points out that the three things we ought to do are actually not three but one thing divided into three steps.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first step is to deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Denying means rejecting, discarding, ignoring, and not acknowledging one's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The meaning of denying the self is simply to not allow the self to be the lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This step is a definite act; it is to believe specifically that "I am already crucified with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to maintain the work of this step, we must carry out the second step, which is to "daily" take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that even though we have willingly given the self over to the cross once and have disallowed it from being the lord, we should continue to deny the self daily.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Denying the self should be daily and uninterrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This matter of denying the self cannot be accomplished once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord must give us a daily cross to bear.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The self is very alert, and Satan who takes advantage of the self is also untiring.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every moment, the self is looking for an opportunity to restore itself and will never let even the slightest chance pass by.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, it is extremely important to bear the cross daily.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is where the believers must be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should "daily" and moment by moment bear the cross the Lord has given us; we should continuously acknowledge that the Lord's cross is our cross and should not give any room to the self or allow it to assume any position.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The third step is to follow the Lord; this is to positively honor the Lord as Lord and to completely obey the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way, the self will have no chance or possibility to develop itself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These three steps are all based and centered upon the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The first step of denying the self is on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The second step of taking up the cross is negatively positive.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The third step of following the Lord is on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The teaching in these two passages should not be separated from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we consider them together and practice them together, we will have the overcoming experience all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, we should allow the Holy Spirit to do His own work and should allow the accomplished work of the cross to be wrought into us.</S>
