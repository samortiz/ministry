   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KINGDOM REVEALED TO BABES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 11:25-27 reveals another basic principle: the kingdom is absolutely a matter of divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After speaking about John the Baptist, the Lord turned to talk to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 25 begins, "At that time Jesus answered and said,..."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is quite interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Has your prayer ever been an answer to God?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Have you ever begun your prayer by answering God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 25 Christ started His prayer by answering God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"I praise You, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord's prayer in these verses began as an answer to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It seems that as the Lord Jesus was talking to the people, the heavenly Father asked Him a question: "Do you mean that God the Father hides the kingdom from the wise and intelligent?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord responded, "Yes, Father, that is what I mean."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The principle here is that we should never exercise our wisdom or cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the kingdom life we must forget our wisdom and cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The kingdom of the heavens is not a matter of our being wise or intelligent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we think that we are wise or intelligent, we are finished as far as the kingdom is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must be like little babes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we become like little babes, we will receive the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God hides the kingdom from the wise and intelligent, but He reveals it to babes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, do not exercise your wisdom, mentality, or cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as you place confidence in your knowledge, you are through with the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all should be little babes in the local churches today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we become wise and intelligent, we can no longer participate in the kingdom life or share the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The kingdom life will become a hidden matter as far as we are concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must be like little babes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we will receive the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is this revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The revelation is that the kingdom is nothing other than the Son of God 11:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This verse tells us that the revelation of the kingdom is simply the revelation of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are religiously wise and intelligent, you will never receive the revelation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The kingdom is a heavenly revelation concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you receive this revelation, you will know Him in such a rich way, in a way of tasting and in a way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the church life we should continually have a vision of the Lord Jesus, not merely a doctrine about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The content of the kingdom is the wonderful Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 27 gives us the revelation of the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we read this verse in its context beginning at verse 20, we will see that it is the revelation of the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The revelation of the kingdom life is the revelation of the Son with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many years ago I studied the Bible under the influence of some good teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the more I was taught, the less I knew the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One day the Lord brought me to the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a very short time I came to know the Lord Jesus, not in a doctrinal way, but in a living way, in the way of life, taste, and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although I have been in this way for more than forty years, I cannot exhaust the enjoyment of the Christ revealed to me in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, I am still concerned that some of the dear ones may remain wise and intelligent in a religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If so, they will have no real knowledge of Christ and no genuine enjoyment of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to follow the principle that the revelation of the kingdom is given to babes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let us review the principles we have covered thus far in Matthew 11.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First, due to the opposition of human culture, the kingdom must be taken by violence.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Second, the kingdom is not a matter of outward regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since the kingdom life is the life of Christ, we should not make any outward regulations into a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Third, if we remain in the kingdom for the kingdom life, we must forget our wisdom and cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is awful to be religiously wise and intelligent.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to become like babes, so simple and so single.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then we will know the Lord Jesus whom others cannot know.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We will also know the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Son with the Father will become our enjoyment.</S>
