   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD, CHRIST, THE SPIRIT, AND THE WORD BEING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the entire New Testament, the term the life of God is only mentioned once, in Ephesians 4:18.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The term the life of God indicates that God is life just as the phrases the love of God 1 John 4:9; 2 Cor 13:14 and the light of the Lord Isa 2:5 indicate that God is love 1 John 4:8, 16 and God is light 1 John 1:5 , respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These phrases are synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All are in the form of appositions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the phrase the life of God, life and God are also in apposition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is life, God is love, and God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The eternal life, the divine life, is the very God of whom is life, and who is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Life is God Himself, God is Spirit John 4:24 , and the Spirit is life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The eternal life, the divine life, is also the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God the Spirit, has embodied Himself in Christ John 4:24; 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The life of God, God Himself, is also the life of Christ, Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually in the New Testament, there is no such term as the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It simply states that Christ is life John 14:6; 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Life is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Life is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is God, and Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The eternal, divine life which is God, the Spirit, and Christ is embodied in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The New Testament says that the word is life John 6:63; 1 John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This life is embodied not only in the words spoken by God but also in His word spoken by us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Acts 5:20 reveals that the word spoken out of Peter's mouth was the word of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter's speaking was not only the word of God, but the word of his testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter's life and work made the divine life so real and present in his situation; hence, it was the word of his testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The entire content of the Bible, especially the New Testament, is life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Life is its center.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Life is the substance, element, and factor of the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The New Testament is a book of "this life" Acts 5:20 , the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>MAN WITH GOD'S IMAGE, LIKENESS, AND BREATH</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Life being the content of the Bible is fully signified by the tree of life Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to know the significance of the tree of life, we must consider the background of chapters one and two of the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The book of Genesis portrays the tree of life with a certain kind of background.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to Genesis 1 and 2, God created man as the center of His creatures, the center of His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man was created in God's image, according to God's likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Outwardly, in appearance, man bears God's image and has God's likeness Gen 1:26-27 , and inwardly, God's breath has entered into man Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Hebrew word for breath in Genesis 2:7 is neshamah.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This word neshamah is also used in Proverbs 20:27 and is translated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a crucial verse, and I encourage you to learn it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Proverbs 20:27 says, "The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By looking at the usage of the word neshamah in these two verses, we can see that when the breath was with God it was a breath Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when this breath entered into man it became man's spirit Prov 20:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By this we can see that the spirit of man is very much linked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Genesis 1 and 2 show us that man is outwardly made in God's image, according to God's likeness, and that inwardly he is filled with God's breath.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The breath of God became man's spirit for man to contact God, to receive God, and to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These two portions of Genesis, 1:26-27 and 2:7, show us that man is a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His outward appearance is like God, and his inward parts are linked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although at the time of his creation man had all of these things, he still did not have God within him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Man did not have the life of God within him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Man only had the breath of God, but that breath was neither God Himself nor was it God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This breath linked man with God by forming man's spirit.</S>
