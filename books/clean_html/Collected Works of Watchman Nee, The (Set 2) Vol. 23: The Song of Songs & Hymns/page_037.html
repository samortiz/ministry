<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Lord's Inserted Words (7:6-9a)</H2><P>Verse 6 says, "How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!" Now the Lord inserts His remarks. Since the Holy Spirit's word fully matches the Lord's will, the Lord is able to continue with the conversation, as if the previous words were actually spoken by Him. When He hears the Holy Spirit speaking in verse 5, He cannot help but insert His word and speak directly to the maiden, who is the subject of the discussion. This is an inserted exclamation of praise.</P><P>Verse 7 says, "This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes." In the past, there was no growth, there was no perfection, and there was no maturity; hence, there was no stature. Now she has become mature, and there is the stature. A palm tree is tall and straight, and it represents the Lord in the Bible. Saying that she is likened to a palm tree is saying that she has the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13). The roots of the palm tree are in touch with the spring of living water, and although the leaves and branches are scorched by the sun, it still grows without any hindrance. Even though believers may suffer great trials in the wilderness, they are not affected, because of their union with Christ, and they can still grow.</P><P>"Thy breasts [are like] to clusters of grapes." This indicates once again that her measure is increased for the sake of others. Breasts are originally for feeding and not just an expression of love. When you are young, there is more of a sense of love than a sense of feeding. But when you become mature, the aspect of feeding is inevitably manifested. Here the emphasis is on the feeding; the breasts are like clusters of grapes, good for food and good for satisfying others.</P><P>Verses 8 to 9a say, "I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples; and the roof of thy mouth like the best wine." [Translator's note: The Lord's speaking stops here; see note in Darby's New Translation.] "I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof." It seems as if the Lord is trying to embrace Himself by taking hold of the stature of the believers. He wants to fellowship with the believers. It seems that this is not the time for believers to pursue after the Lord, but the time for the Lord to pursue after them. When such a Body life between the members exists (i.e., a life between the branches), the Lord is drawn to desire the believers and to communicate with them. How different this is from the initial condition of the believers sitting under His shadow (2:3)! The Lord speaks of three things in particular that satisfy His heart. First, He speaks of the maiden's capacity for feeding others. His word is a blessing in the hope that this capacity would increase. Second, He speaks of her intuition. But the emphasis is not on the function of the intuition, but on the fragrance that the intuition left in her through previous contacts. In order for the smell of the nose to be like the bergamot orange ("apples" can be translated "bergamot orange"), one must first eat the bergamot orange. Those who have eaten Christ cannot fail to give the flavor of Christ. Third, He says, "The roof of thy mouth like the best wine." This means that she has a foretaste of the power of the age to come (Heb. 6:5). The best wine should refer to the wine of the millennium (John 2:10; Matt. 26:29). She is able to provide the Lord with such a pleasant taste.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE LORD (7:9b-13)</H2><P>Verse 9b says, "...that goeth down smoothly for my beloved, and causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak." [Translator's note: See Darby's New Translation. This part is spoken by the maiden.] The Lord's speaking continues to the second part of verse 9. At this point, the maiden is able to continue where the Lord left off because she is so one with the Lord. The wine flows smoothly into her Beloved. This means that she and her Beloved have tasted a foretaste of this blessing. However, tasting this wine is not limited to the two of them. There are many others who are asleep who have tasted of this wine. Neither the word "asleep" nor the word "sleep" in 5:2 means something bad. The tone does not convey the sense that sleep is a bad thing. Moreover, the ones who are asleep are in the same position as the Beloved. Hence, the sleeping ones refer to those who are asleep to themselves. They have lost consciousness of themselves and are only living to God.</P><P>Verse 10 of chapter seven says, "I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me." Her attention is drawn toward who her beloved is. She has given up her obsession with herself. It seems as if she is willing even to lose her beloved if it would please him. She is only concerned with whether or not her beloved has gained her. She knows that she belongs to her beloved, and this is enough to satisfy her heart. The former grasping of the flesh is gone. In the beginning, the fact that she belonged to her beloved was a secondary thought. Later, it became her primary thought. She was unable to forget that her beloved was hers. Now, because of the depth of her experience, we no longer hear that her beloved belongs to her. Indeed, in our spiritual pursuit, the self is working constantly. Little do we realize that even in the matter of loving the Lord, there is the possibility of reserving a place for the self!</P><P>The matter now is not our pleasure, but His desire. We know that our existence is for the purpose of satisfying His desire. Our purpose for living is to be the object of His desire. We are to be the desired ones of the desiring One. The question now is not what we feel, what we gain, what we lose, or what our work is. What is of importance to us is that we are His, and His desire is toward us. This is all that matters.</P><P>When a believer reaches this stage, and when the self is dealt with in such a thorough way, he can begin to work with the Lord. Because he is so filled with the Lord, he can now initiate some work. Outwardly, it may look as if he is the one who initiates the work. Actually, it is the Lord within who is initiating the work. Since the union between the maiden and the Lord is so absolute, her movement becomes very dependable, and she can now speak the words in the following verse.</P>
