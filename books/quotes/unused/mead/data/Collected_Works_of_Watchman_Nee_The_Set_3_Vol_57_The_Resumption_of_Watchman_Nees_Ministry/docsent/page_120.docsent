   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is one thing we would like the saints from out of town to pay attention to: You have been receiving and acknowledging co-workers on our behalf for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This practice has given us much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If someone comes to your place to work, please ask him to show you the letter of recommendation from us.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the New Testament Paul also spoke of the matter of a recommendation letter 2 Cor 3:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today, not only is there the need for recommendations in matters related to the church; there is the need for recommendations in matters related to the work as well.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a letter only recommends a certain person as a brother, you have to treat him as a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If he is also a co-worker, there should be a separate recommendation letter to recommend him as a co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May the Lord cause all of us to do our best to stand firm in our own position.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whether a person is making money or is engaged in spiritual services, he should offer up everything he has.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We hope that we will do a proper job before the Lord in all these matters, and we hope that we will see God's blessings.</S>
