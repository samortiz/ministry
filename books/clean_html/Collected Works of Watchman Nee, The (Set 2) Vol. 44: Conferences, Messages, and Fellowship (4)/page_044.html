<h2 class="head1">NOT ACCORDING TO NATURAL DISPOSITION,<br />BUT ACCORDING TO GOD'S WILL</h2><p>The principle of Christian living is based not on natural disposition but on God's own nature. Our natural disposition should not be the guideline for our daily living. We should not live according to our looseness or caution. It is not a matter of how we feel. It is a matter of prayer and of acting according to God's will. If we do not put God's will first and do not seek after it, we will do something based on our natural disposition or character, and it will be nothing but acts of self-will.</p><p>The Lord's life on earth was a life of acting according to the will of the One who sent Him (John 6:38), not according to His self-will. He went up to Jerusalem, cleansed the temple, and cast out those who were making merchandise in the temple. Although this offended many and although others interrogated Him, He was not discouraged from carrying out God's will. The Lord did not care for man; He did not save men's faces. He only cared for God's will. It is often the clever and capable saints who get themselves into trouble. While we may face many obstacles in doing God's will, including criticism, mockery, and opposition from others, we should remain single to the Lord, obeying His will and pleasing Him alone.</p><p>A clever man often has to resort to lies, tricks, maneuverings, or politics. Luke 20:1-8 records the story of priests, scribes, and elders finding Jesus teaching the people in the temple. They asked the Lord by what authority He was doing all these things and who had given Him such authority. The Lord asked them, "The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men?" (v. 4). They reasoned together among themselves and told the Lord that they did not know. They avoided the Lord's question, even though they knew the answer. They knew that the baptism of John came from heaven. All the people believed this, but they themselves did not believe this. They could not say that it was from heaven, because they were afraid the Lord would ask, "Why did you not believe him?" (v. 5). Neither could they say that it was from men, because the people would stone them; therefore, they said that they did not know. They did not answer because their words would have condemned them. The Lord then said, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things" (v. 8). The Lord did not say that He did not know; He said that He would not tell them by what authority He did these things. The word "neither" is very interesting. This word exposed the lies of the priests, scribes, and elders. They lied when they said they did not know; therefore, the Lord said, "Neither do I tell you." The priests, scribes, and elders were men of politics. They resorted to human politics and plots to avoid hurting themselves. A person who resorts to such things is absolutely useless in the hand of the Lord.</p><p>May the Lord be merciful to us. May we learn to live by God's singleness and sincerity and not by human wisdom, maneuverings, or politics, and may we not seek our own advantage or be driven by motives of self-advancement. May the Lord cause us to live according to His singleness and sincerity, and may we carry out His will with singleness of heart.</p>
