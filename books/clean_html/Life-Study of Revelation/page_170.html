<h2 class="head2">H. Coming to His End and None Helping Him</h2><p>Eventually, &ldquo;He shall come to his end, and none shall help him&rdquo; (Dan. 11:45). This means that Christ will terminate him at the war of Armageddon and that no one will help him to escape.</p><p>As we consider all these points regarding Antichrist, we see what kind of person he will be and even where he will come from. I am quite certain that, according to the Bible, he will come either from Greece or from the territory of ancient Macedonia. Possibly, he will both be a descendant of the Greek nationality and come from that geographical region. The eastern Roman Empire included the four divisions of the empire of Alexander the Great. According to the prophecies, Antichrist will not come out of the western Roman Empire, but from one of the four kingdoms in the territory of the empire of Greece and Macedonia. These kingdoms all lie in the territory of the eastern Roman Empire. I say strongly that Antichrist will probably come from both the nationality and the territory of Greece. We need to be watchful and observe the events in Greece. The great part of the prophecies in Daniel chapters two, seven, eight, and eleven have been fulfilled. Since those that have been fulfilled have been fulfilled literally, so will the remainder. Antichrist will proceed from Macedonia or Greece to the south (Egypt), to the east (Syria), and to the Holy Land (the land of Israel). Today&rsquo;s world situation is centered in the Middle East. We must believe that the time is near and that soon both Christ and Antichrist will come. However, we are not waiting for Antichrist&mdash;we are waiting for Christ. Daily, I am watching the situation in the Middle East and exercising my spirit concerning events in that region. We praise the Lord that we have the light of God&rsquo;s word in His prophecy.</p><p>Through the study of the prophecies concerning Antichrist, we may conclude that he is the ultimate issue of the worldly powers. In God&rsquo;s eyes, the worldly powers began with Babylon, which was followed by the empire of Medo-Persia, the Macedonian Empire, and the Roman Empire. The Medo-Persian Empire continued the Babylonian Empire, the Macedonian Empire continued the Medo-Persian Empire, and the Roman Empire continued the Macedonian Empire. By this we see that world power continued from one empire to another. Ultimately, out of the Roman Empire will emerge Antichrist as the consummate issue of these worldly powers. When Antichrist is defeated and cast into the lake of fire, worldly power will be completely terminated.</p><p>According to Daniel 2, a stone &ldquo;cut without hands&rdquo; will fall from heaven upon the ten toes of the image (v. 34). That stone will not only smite the ten toes, but also the entire image from the head to the toes. As we all know, the stone is Christ. Today, He is the building stone (Matt. 21:42; Acts 4:10-12), but in that day He will be the smiting stone (Matt. 21:44). To the church Christ is the building stone, but to the worldly powers He is the smiting stone which will smash the whole image to pieces.</p><p>We have seen that Antichrist will come out of one of the four kingdoms of the ancient Macedonian Empire, probably out of Greece. Greece, which was part of the Roman Empire, will also be one of the ten kingdoms, or the ten toes, of the image. According to the prophecy of the Bible, we can now definitely and clearly say that Antichrist will come out of the Roman Empire in the region of either Greece or Macedonia.</p><p>We also have seen what Antichrist will do. He will oppose God and persecute God&rsquo;s people. He will annul everything pertaining to Judaism, persecute the Jews and the Christians who are left on earth, and destroy Catholicism. He will be intellectually brilliant, capable, and have the power to touch the host of the heavens. He will probably employ modern scientific inventions to probe into space. He will have an appearance that is stout, strong, fierce, and attractive. If you are left on earth at the time Antichrist appears, you will be able to recognize him by knowing all his characteristics as covered in these two messages. You will know who he is, and you will not be attracted to him.</p><p>The entire world today is looking for a strong leader. Although this is the age of democracy, many are tired of the shortcomings of democracy and are looking for strong leadership. When a powerful leader emerges, nearly everyone will look to him. Because this is the tendency of today&rsquo;s world situation, it will be easy for Antichrist to attract many. But praise the Lord that we have the light of prophecy, and that we are not in darkness! We know what kind of person Antichrist will be. The Antichrist is the fourth beast, the little horn, the prince, and the king. When he appears, it will be easy to recognize him.</p>
