   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 6 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 8:14-17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>14 And Jesus, coming into Peter's house, saw 1 his mother-in-law lying down and in a fever.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>15 And He touched her hand, and the fever left her.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And she arose and served Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>16 And when evening fell, they brought to Him 1 many who were demon possessed, and He cast out the spirits with a word, and 1 all those who were ill He healed,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>17 So that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, " 1 He Himself took away our infirmities and bore our diseases."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>14 1 Peter's mother-in-law in vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>14-15 represents the Jews living at the end of this age, who will be saved by receiving the kingly Savior Rom 11:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time, during the great tribulation, the Jews in the eyes of God will be "in a fever" v. 14 , "hot" in things other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, the kingly Savior will come back to this remnant of the Jews that they may be saved Rom 11:25-26; Zech 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Peter's mother-in-law was healed in Peter's house.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the end of this age all the remnant of the Jews will be saved in the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, they will be saved by the kingly Savior's direct touch v. 15 , as was the Jewish leper v. 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>16 1 Many who were demon possessed and all those who were ill represent all the people on earth in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The millennium is the last dispensation of the old heaven and old earth; thus, it is considered the "evening" of the old heaven and old earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the millennium the power to cast out demons and heal illnesses will be manifested to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, all the demon possessed and all the sick will be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such extensive power is the power of the coming age Heb 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The casting out of demons and the healing of the sick in this age are only a foretaste of the extensive power of the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The signs recorded in vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>2-17 bear a dispensational significance and show the coming kingdom in miniature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The order of the four incidents recorded in vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2-16 differs from that in Mark 1:29 2:1 and Luke 4:38-41; 5:12-14; and 7:1-10.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Mark's record, which shows that Jesus is the Servant of God, the order is according to history.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Matthew's record, which proves that Christ is the King of the kingdom of the heavens, the order is according to doctrine; i.e., Matthew puts certain incidents together to present a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Luke's record, which reveals that Jesus is the proper man to be man's Savior, the order is according to morality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In John's record, which testifies that Christ is the Son of God and even God Himself, the order is somewhat according to history.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>17 1 All healings accomplished on fallen people are a result of the Lord's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the cross He took away our infirmities, bore our diseases, and accomplished full healing for us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, in this age the application of this divine healing power can be only a foretaste to us; in the coming age we will experience the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The temperature of the Jews today is very high in their fervency for science, finance, education, politics, industry, agriculture, and warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But in their heat and fervency they neither trust in God nor care for morality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless , at the Lord's second coming, the Jews will be directly touched by His arrival and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Immediately after Peter's mother-in-law was healed, she arose and served the Lord v. 15 . This signifies that at the Lord's coming back, the remnant of the Jews, after being saved, will arise and serve Him in the millennium.</S>
