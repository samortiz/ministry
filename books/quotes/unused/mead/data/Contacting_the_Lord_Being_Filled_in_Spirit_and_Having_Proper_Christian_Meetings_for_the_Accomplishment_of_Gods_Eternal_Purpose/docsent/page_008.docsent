   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE WAY TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND TO BECOME</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GENUINE SPIRITUAL MEN Scripture Reading: Eph 5:18 A GENUINE CHRISTIAN Not Merely a Good Man or a Religious Man</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All human beings have the tendency to try to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even sinful people often have the thought that they should try to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In addition to trying to be good, some people feel the need to be religious.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Being religious is going a step further than simply trying to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is possible to try to live a good life without having any consideration concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Throughout history there have been many people like this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although these people had nothing to do with God, they appeared to be good people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether or not they were truly good is another question, but to those around them they appeared to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the other hand, people who are religious consider God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They fear God, worship God, and endeavor to live and walk according to the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many of these religious people become Christians, thinking that to be a Christian is to be one who fears God, worships God, and attempts to live and walk according to God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Is this concept correct?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Is this what it means to be a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Surely, as Christians we must be good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moreover, no one can dispute the fact that true Christians fear God, worship God, and seek to live and walk according to God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, we must see that being a Christian is much more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Being a Christian is more than merely being a good or religious person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A Christ-man One Who Is Filled with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be a Christian is to be a spiritual person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What does it mean to be spiritual, and what is the difference between being spiritual and being good or religious?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be spiritual is to be mingled and filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, a true Christian is a person who is mingled and filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word Christian means an adherent of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A genuine adherent or follower of Christ is a man of Christ, a Christ-man, one who is filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A cup of tea is a good illustration of what it means to be a Christ-man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A cup of tea is not composed solely of tea; it is tea that has been mingled with water.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is neither merely water nor merely tea; it is tea plus water, water plus tea.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, we can call it tea-water.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Human beings are like a cup of water, and Christ is like tea.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Christ as the tea enters into us as the water, He is mingled together with us, making us Christ-men.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A true Christian is a Christ-man one who has been mingled with Christ and has Christ as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A Spiritual Man</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One Who Is Filled with the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be spiritual is also to be one who is filled with the Spirit, for the Spirit is the reality of Christ, and Christ today is the Spirit 1 John 5:6; John 16:12-15; 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we do not have the Spirit, we do not have Christ, because Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second Corinthians 3:17 clearly states, And the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, Romans 8:9 says, But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This verse reveals that we are of Christ because we have the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, if we do not have the Spirit of Christ, we do not belong to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can never divide the Spirit from Christ, because Christ and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit are not three separate Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are one God who is three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Just as the Triune God is one, Christ and the Spirit are also one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, if you have the Spirit, you have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This makes you a Christ-man a man who is mingled and filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, a Christ-man is a Spirit-man a man who is mingled and filled with the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is what it means to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A Christian is not a good man or a religious man; a Christian is a spiritual man, a man mingled and filled with Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE DIFFERENCES AMONG BEING A GOOD MAN,</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A RELIGIOUS MAN, AND A SPIRITUAL MAN</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Suppose there is a man who does not believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He does not love God, fear God, worship God, or have any consideration for God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, because he is a human being, this man feels that he should be a good person.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He feels that he should try to love his neighbors and that he should be good toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the kind of person that we would call a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, suppose that one day this good man begins to realize that in this universe there is an almighty Being, a God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>With this realization, he begins to fear, love, and worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Eventually, this man hears that he is a sinner before God and that God sent His Son, the Lord Jesus, to die on the cross to redeem man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As a result, this man believes that Jesus is the Savior, repents to God, and is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He then begins to attend Christian meetings and to endeavor to live according to God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In addition, he begins to study the Bible and to read many Christian devotionals and religious writings.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He even begins to collect sermons and to practice delivering sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He also learns how to compose prayers, and when he comes to the meetings, he offers to God the prayers that he has composed and delivers to the congregation the sermons that he has prepared, reading from his notes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The question now is what kind of man he has become.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Previously, he was a good man a man who attempted to do good apart from God but now what kind of man is he?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Surely he has become something more than a good man, but can we say that he is a spiritual man?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This man has become a religious man, but it is doubtful that he has become a spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>From this we can see that it is very possible to become a religious person without becoming a truly spiritual person.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Suppose that one day the Lord comes to this brother and brings him into His light.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As a result, the way this brother prays begins to change.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Rather than praying from his memory, from his mind, or according to his circumstances, he begins to pray according to what he senses in his innermost being, and his prayer often comes out in broken sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He prays, O Lord, O Lord, I am sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Lord, how sinful!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Oh, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I am sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then this brother fully gives himself up to the Lord, and the Spirit has the way to possess, occupy, and fill him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As a result, when this brother comes to the church meetings, he is filled with the Spirit, and there is something energizing, burning, and bubbling within him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He cannot control it; neither can he quench it.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When the opportunity arises in the meeting, he offers prayers in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Although his prayers are not grammatically correct like the prayers that he used to compose, he prays from his spirit, and a living stream flows out from within him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>All the brothers and sisters in the meeting sense the presence and anointing of the Lord in his prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When the opportunity arises for this brother to give a short word in the meeting, he stands up and speaks from his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Previously, he shared from his prepared notes; now he shares from the burning, energizing, strengthening, and bubbling within him, testifying to the congregation of the living One who lives within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What kind of person is this man?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Clearly he has become a spiritual person a person filled with Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He is not merely a good man or a religious man; he is much more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He has become a spiritual man, a man who is according to God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God s desire is that we would be spiritual, that is, that we would be filled, occupied, and saturated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Only when we are spiritual can we be living and functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If we are not spiritual, we may be good and religious, but we will be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is possible to be a good Christian and a religious Christian and at the same time be a dead Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>A dead Christian has no living impact, no genuine spiritual gift, and no power or authority.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>All he has is religious knowledge and Christian teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is why we need to be filled and saturated with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>When we are filled and saturated with the Spirit, we become genuine spiritual men.</S>
