<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(7)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:7-15</h1><p>In this message we shall continue to consider the fourth sign in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John—the sign of the divine Trinity.<h2 class=head1>THE FATHER</h2><h2 class=head2>The Source, the Originator, the Initiator, the Planner, and the Designer</h2><p>The Father is the source; He is the Originator, the Initiator, the Planner, and the Designer. According to John 7:29, the Lord Jesus said, “I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me.” This brief word indicates that the Father is the source. As the source, the Father sent the Son. John 13:3 also indicates that the Father is the source: “Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands, and that He had come forth from God, and was going to God.” The Father is the Planner, and He sent the Son to carry out His plan. Because the Father is the Originator and the Initiator, the Son came forth from Him and received all from Him.<h2 class=head2>Having the Will</h2><p>In the Godhead the Father is the One who has the will. In John 6:38 the Lord Jesus says, “I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.” In John 6:39-40 the Lord goes on to speak of the will of Him who sent Him and the will of His Father. As the Son of God, the Lord Jesus never did His own will. Instead, He always did the Father’s will. He was sent by the Father not to carry out His own will, but to carry out the will of the Father. The Son is one with the Father, and the Son’s will is the Father’s will. This means that the Father and the Son have just one will. We should not think that the Father has a will and the Son has another will. No, there is only one will, and this is the will of the Father. The Son came to accomplish the Father’s will.<h2 class=head2>Dwelling in Unapproachable Light</h2><p>The Father dwells in unapproachable light. Concerning this point, 1 Timothy 6:16 says, “Who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen nor can see.” No one can approach the Father. Actually, this unapproachable light is a burning fire. It is impossible for anyone to approach such a light.<h2 class=head2>Sending the Son</h2><p>Many verses in the Gospel of John speak of the Father’s sending the Son. In 4:34 the Lord Jesus says, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work.” John 5:24 says, “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life.” According to 5:30, the Lord did not seek His own will, but the will of Him who sent Him. Then in 5:36 the Lord says, “The works themselves which I do testify concerning Me that the Father has sent Me.” Then in the next verse the Lord goes on to say, “The Father who sent Me, He has testified concerning Me.” In 6:38 the Lord says that He came down from heaven to do the will of Him who sent Him, and in verse 57 He says that the living Father sent Him. In 7:16 the Lord says, “My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.” In the same chapter the Lord says that the One who sent Him is true (vv. 28-29). John 13:20 says, “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I shall send receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.” In 14:24 the Lord says, “The word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father’s who sent Me.” According to 15:21, the disciples will be persecuted because their persecutors do not know Him who sent the Son. In 16:5 the Lord says, “Now I go to Him who sent Me.” In His prayer to the Father in chapter seventeen, the Lord also refers to the Father’s sending Him into the world: “As You have sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world” (v. 18). Elsewhere in this prayer the Lord indicates that the disciples believe that the Father sent the Son (v. 8). If we study these verses, plus others in the Gospel of John, we shall learn why, how, and when the Father sent the Son.
