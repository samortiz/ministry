After the marriage dinner, Christ will come as a fighting General with His bride as His army to fight against and defeat Antichrist and the kings under him with their armies at Armageddon (Rev. 19:11-21). Satan will then be bound and cast into the abyss for a thousand years (20:1-3). The defeat of Antichrist will end human government on earth, and Christ with His overcomers as co-kings will reign in His kingdom to rule over all the nations on earth for one thousand years (vv. 4-6). After these thousand years are completed, the old heaven and old earth will pass away and be renewed to become the new heaven and new earth. The New Jerusalem, composed of all of God's chosen and redeemed people throughout all generations, will then come down out of heaven to the new earth (21:2).</P><P>The book of Revelation shows us that without the overcomers Christ has no way to come back. We know that Christ is our way (John 14:6a). But from deep within His heart, Christ would tell us that the overcomers are His way. Without Christ, we do not have a way, but today without the overcomers, Christ has no way. The overcomers are the very way for Christ to come back.</P><P>Christ's coming is actually a long process. This coming was initiated with His first coming and will be consummated at His second coming. In between these two comings is the process of His coming. He is still on the way of His coming, and this way is the church, His Body, as represented by the overcomers. His second coming will be consummated through the overcomers. His Body in this age is partly overcoming and partly defeated. The defeated part is always under the satanic chaos. That part cannot be the process of Christ's coming. The overcoming part is the process of His coming. Revelation is a book on the overcomers who consummate God's economy. Without the overcomers, there is no way for God to accomplish His economy.</P><P>The title of this book is The Satanic Chaos in the Old Creation and the Divine Economy for the New Creation. The new creation came into being through the divine economy, and the divine economy will be consummated by the overcomers. The overcoming martyrs who are under the altar began with Abel, the first martyr. Eventually, it will take God, beginning from the time of Adam, at least six thousand years to gain His bride, who is the aggregate of all the overcomers. The bride is the New Jerusalem, the Paradise of God, in the thousand-year kingdom. In those thousand years, God will discipline all those who have believed in the Lord Jesus but have been defeated and are not matured. Through this discipline for one thousand years, all of them will become mature, and they will be ready to become the constituents of the New Jerusalem in eternity.</P><P>In the thousand-year kingdom, the New Jerusalem is in the heavens, but after all of God's redeemed people become matured to be a part of the New Jerusalem, the New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven from God to the earth (Rev. 21:2). This indicates that our dwelling place for eternity will not be heaven but the New Jerusalem on the new earth. That will be the consummated and enlarged New Jerusalem as the wife of the Lamb for eternity. We all need to see that we need to be matured to become the New Jerusalem. If we are not matured in this age, God has a way to make us mature in the next age, but that way to be matured is the hard way.</P><P>It is correct to say that Revelation is a book on prophecy, but that is not the central purpose of this book. The central purpose of the book of Revelation is concerning the overcomers. God did not accomplish His economy with the race of Adam, with the race of Abraham according to the flesh, or with the race of Abraham according to the Spirit. But out of these three races, God gained some overcomers. Hebrews 11 lists a number of these overcomers from the Adamic race and from the Abrahamic race according to the flesh. From among the race of Adam and from the earthly descendants of Abraham, God did gain some overcomers such as Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, etc. I hope that we also will be counted among the overcomers.</P><P>The churches in the Lord's recovery, however, should not be reckoned as churches of overcomers. We should not think that everyone who is in the churches in the recovery is an overcomer. But our being in the churches in the recovery will strengthen us and help us to be matured to be an overcomer. The recovery is the Lord's way to help us to be the overcomers.</P><P>We have to run the race and finish the course so that we can be counted among the overcomers. Paul did not have the assurance that he had finished the course until right before his martyrdom. In 2 Timothy 4:6-8 Paul said, "For I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness..." At that time Paul anticipated his reward in the coming kingdom. In order to be the overcomers, we must conquer all the destructive chaos and triumph in the unique constructive economy.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Satanic Chaos in the Old Creation and the Divine Economy for the New Creation &nbsp; pg 38</div><br></body></html>
