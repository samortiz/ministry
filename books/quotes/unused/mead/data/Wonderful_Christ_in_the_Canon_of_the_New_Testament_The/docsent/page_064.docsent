   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A BIG PROBLEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, there is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Perhaps you and I would like to come together for the proper building up of the church, but so many brothers and sisters do not like to come together.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They still like to stay in the Catholic church, in the denominations, or in the free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Shall we go to their different places and join them?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do, there will be no possibility for the proper building on the ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must still come together to be the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some say that a local church must include all the saints in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We absolutely agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But they go on to say that since we only have a small number, not including all the saints in that city, how can we call ourselves the local church?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If this were the case, there would be no possibility of having the local church because so many real Christians in every city will never agree to meet in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let me illustrate in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose there is a large family by the name of Smith with thirty-six members, and they all become scattered individually into so many places and into so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day, two of the thirty-six become saved, begin to consider the poor situation of their family, and realize that they must come together to be the Smith family.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Following this they come to the third brother and tell him about the Lord Jesus, and ask him to come home to be the family with them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually five come back home, but thirty-one remain scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now, is it too much for these five to say that they are the Smith family?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would say that it is not too much.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yes, the Smith family should be composed of thirty-six people, but all of them would not come back.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only five, by the mercy of the Lord, would come back.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If they do not call themselves the Smith family, what should they call themselves?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Should they call themselves the Smith fellowship, the Smith Center, or the Smith Bible study?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is absolutely right for them to call themselves the Smith family because they are the Smith family.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They do miss so many of their folks, but they are still the Smith family.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today is a day of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I would like to be kind to everyone, but I do have a burden from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If I were afraid that I would offend someone, I could not be faithful to the Lord s burden.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I must speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The sky must be cleared.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are the Smith family then you must simply call yourselves the Smith family.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you do not like the Smith family, just say that you do not like it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Be honest and frank and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since 1962, a strong testimony of the local churches has been raised up by the Lord, starting from Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the first few years people did not agree with it and did not pay much attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After so many years, not only were many more churches raised up, but many books were published.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, the term local church has become popular.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Twelve years ago it was opposed, but in the last five years so many so-called free groups have begun to call themselves the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Recently the churches had some migrations to several cities, and from two of these cities we received letters warning us not to come because there was a local church there already.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They said that they were the local church, and that they would not have fellowship with all the other local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>And they did not!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But they claimed to be the local church in those cities.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>ONE IN FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In a situation of this nature, there is the need of clear discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the Bible, the Body of Christ is universally one, comprising all the saints and all the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the local churches, regardless of whether they are in this city, in this country, or in other countries, are the one Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is absolutely right to say that all the local churches are independent of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But this independence should be in administration, not in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In administration, all the local churches have their own jurisdiction, but in fellowship they must still be one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the local churches throughout the whole world should be one in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose there is a so-called local church in Atlanta.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand they claim to be the local church there, but on the other hand they would not open to the other local churches in order to have fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What sort of local church is this?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Immediately that church becomes a local sect.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A local church is one that is open to all the saints in that locality and open to all the other local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If there is a so-called local church that would not have fellowship with the other local churches, that is not a local church, but a repetition of the history of fallen Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In refusing fellowship, this so-called local church becomes a local sect.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The first local church in the U. S. was raised up in Los Angeles in 1962.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If anyone truly means business with the Lord for the proper unity, they will have no problem in having fellowship with the church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If they will not fellowship with the church in Los Angeles, but hold a certain kind of concept that keeps them separated, they have lost the proper ground and have become sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are the same as the other free groups, because they will not recognize the other local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Ever since 1962, wherever a local church was raised up, if those saints did mean business with the Lord, they were happy to fellowship with the church in Los Angeles and the other local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is in order to keep the proper unity among the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If any group refuses to fellowship with the other local churches, they have lost the ground of unity and have become sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They are not a local church but a local sect.</S>
