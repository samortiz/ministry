   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Keeping the Lord outside Her Door</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Revelation 3:20a the Lord says, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The door here is not the door of individuals but the door of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church in Laodicea has knowledge, but she does not have the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord, the Head of the church, is actually standing outside the degraded church, knocking at her door.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that, in a very practical way, the degraded recovered church is Christless.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This church has Christ in name but not in presence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In actuality, the Lord is outside her door.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord's Promise to the Overcomers of This Stage</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 3:20b and 21 we have the Lord's promise to the overcomers of this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To overcome here means to overcome the lukewarmness and pride of the degraded recovered church, to buy the needed items, and to open the door for the Lord to come in. a. To Have the Lord Come in to Them and Dine with Them and They with the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 20b the Lord says, "If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the Greek, the word "dine" signifies the principal meal of the day at evening.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To dine is not merely to eat one item of food but to partake of the riches of a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This may imply the fulfillment of the type of the children of Israel eating the rich produce of the good land of Canaan Josh 5:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The dining promised in Revelation 3:20b is not only for the future but also for today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are overcomers, when the Lord comes in the kingdom we shall have the special privilege of eating with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before that day, however, we may enjoy His dining with us. b.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To Be Given to Sit with the Lord on His Throne</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 21 the Lord says, "He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To sit with the Lord on His throne will be a prize to the overcomer that he may participate in the Lord's authority in the coming millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that the overcomers will be co-kings with Christ ruling over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I. All the Last Four Kinds of Churches Will Remain until the Lord's Coming Back</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 not only signify prophetically the progress of the church in seven stages but also symbolize the seven kinds of churches in church history: the initial church, the suffering church, the worldly church, the apostate church, the reformed church, the recovered church, and the degraded recovered church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The initial church had its continuation in the suffering church; the suffering church turned into the worldly church; and the worldly church became the apostate church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the first four churches eventually issued in one kind of church, that is, the apostate church, the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then, as a reaction to the apostate church, the reformed church came into existence as another kind of church, a church not fully recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Following this, the recovered church was raised up as a full recovery of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By the degradation of the recovered church, the degraded recovered church came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These four kinds of churches the Roman Catholic Church, the reformed church, the recovered church, and the degraded recovered church will remain until the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Undoubtedly, only the recovered church can fulfill God's eternal purpose, and only she is what the Lord is after.</S>
