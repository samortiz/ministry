   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REVEALED BY THE FATHER IN THE HEAVENS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord said to Peter, You are blessed, Simon Bar-jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father Who is in the heavens v. 17 . The Lord seemed to be saying, You are Simon, the son of Jonah, the son of a man of flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But flesh and blood did not reveal this matter to you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It was the Father in heaven who revealed it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to look to the Father in heaven to grant us to see that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need the Father to show us that Christ has the water, the life, and also the oil, the function.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not assume that you know that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This may be merely terminology to you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may not yet have the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we were in Sunday school, we were taught that Jesus was the Christ and the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, these terms did not mean anything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need the revelation that the very Jesus in whom we believe for salvation is the Christ, the oil upon us for functioning, and the Son of the living God, the water within us for life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>RECEIVING THE SON AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First John 5:12 says that he who has the Son has life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Son is the very life because He is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because God s element, essence, life, and nature are embodied in the Son, the Son is the substance, the expression, of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, if we have the Son, we have the divine life, the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we have the Son, we have God in us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>FIRMLY ATTACHED TO THE ANOINTED ONE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Second Corinthians 1:21 says, Now he who firmly attaches us with you unto the anointed One, and has anointed us, is God Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>. By being attached to the anointed One, we have the ointment for function.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not say that you are not able to pray in the meetings or give a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you have this concept, heaven will be closed to you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Oh, we all must look to the Lord for an open heaven!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Forget about what you are or what you can do, and remember that you have received the Son of the living God into you as your life and that you have been attached to the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because you have been attached to Him, the ointment upon Him is flowing down to you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Forget your weakness, dullness, or sense of nothingness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although we are nothing, we have been attached to the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have the Son of the living God within us, and we have been attached to the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, we have life within and ointment without.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anyone who believes this is truly blessed by the Father in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>TWO SOURCES</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By nature we all are Bar-jonas, natural men born of natural fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we also have another source, the Father in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We, the followers of Christ, have two sources: a natural source and a heavenly source.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, we are Bar-jonas; on the other hand, we are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Father in heaven always cooperates with His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Son brought the disciples to Caesarea Philippi, the Father was ready to inspire Simon Bar-jona to see that Jesus, the Nazarene, is the Christ and the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through this revelation, Peter was transformed from Simon to Peter, from a son of Jonah to a son of the Father in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, Peter received blessing from another source, from the Father in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THIS ROCK</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 18 may be translated as follows: And I also say to you that you are a stone, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord told Simon that he was a stone and that He would build the church upon this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This rock firstly refers to the wonderful Person of Christ, the Son of the living God, the One who is our life and who has the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Secondly, it refers to the revelation of this Person seen by Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we see this revelation, the revelation becomes the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, the church is built not only on the Person, but also on the revelation of this Person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thirdly, this rock refers to Peter s declaration that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, the rock refers to three things: the Person, the revelation, and the declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE WAY TO BE BUILT</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many Christians in Catholicism or in the denominations are familiar with the verse about Christ building His church upon this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, they do not know how to be built upon this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to be built we need the Person, the revelation, and the declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not only know this as a doctrine, but also practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Person is always available, for He is both universal and local.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But it is possible to talk about Christ without having the revelation of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As soon as we see that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, and declare it, we are built.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, nominal Christians who attend a so-called service on Sunday morning only to spend the rest of the day at sporting events or the movies are not built upon this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But when some begin to see that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God, they are built up; for they are attached to Christ, the anointed One, and the Son of God comes into them as life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Immediately, they and He become one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It was at the juncture of confessing that Jesus was the Christ and the Son of God, that Simon was changed to Peter.</S>
