As we have already pointed out, the entire New Testament reveals a universal man, which is composed of Christ as the Head and the church as the Body. The New Testament can be divided into three sections. The first section is composed of the first five books, from Matthew through Acts, showing us the history of this universal man. The second section comprises the twenty-one Epistles from Romans through Jude, giving us a full definition and explanation of this universal man. The last section is the book of Revelation, which shows us the ultimate consummation of this universal man. Thus, the entire New Testament deals with the universal man and the history, definition, and consummation of this man.<h2 class=head1>THE EIGHT SUPPLEMENTARY EPISTLES</h2><p>The first part of the second section includes the books from Romans through Philemon. These thirteen Epistles give us a full definition, a full picture, of the Body of this universal man. Then, the other eight Epistles, from Hebrews through Jude, serve as a supplement to this definition. These last eight Epistles comprise five items of supplement. The first item of the supplement is the book of Hebrews, which is an explanation of the difference between Christ and Judaism. The thirteen Epistles from Romans through Philemon do not address the problem of Judaism and the difference between Christ and Judaism. Therefore, a supplementary book is needed to clarify this matter. The second book, James, is a supplement dealing with the relationship between works and faith. The first thirteen Epistles stress the matter of faith. They do not give us a clear understanding about the relationship of works and faith, so again there is the need of a supplement. First and 2 Peter, as the third item of the supplement, deal with the government of God. Again, the first thirteen Epistles do not touch the matter of the divine government of God. Today in this universe there is the divine government of God. We must keep all the rules of this divine government. If we violate any one of them, we will suffer something. The fourth item of the supplement, the Epistles of John, deals with the fellowship in God&#8217;s divine family. The last item, Jude, deals with apostasy, the drifting away of the church from the right track of God&#8217;s economy.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING SUPERIOR TO ALL THE ITEMS OF JUDAISM</h2><p>Hebrews, as the first item of the supplement, is a rich and high book dealing with the matter of Judaism. I have conducted a study of this book on at least three main occasions. I have spent many years in it, and I have found that it is a rich yet difficult book. It is not easy for its readers to understand.<h2 class=head2>Judaism Being Composed of Five Wonderful Items</h2><p>Before Christ was incarnated as a man, God gave the people of Israel a number of items, all comprising Judaism. In Judaism, the Jewish religion, there is first of all God Himself. Second there are the angels. Following these there are the leaders such as Moses and Joshua. Fourth, there is the priesthood with the priests, such as Aaron and his sons. The last item is the old covenant, including all the sacrifices, the offerings, the tabernacle, and the temple. Judaism is composed with these five items-God, the angels, the leaders, the priests, and the old covenant. If you take away these five items, Judaism will collapse. God is so good, and the angels are wonderful. We highly esteem Moses, Joshua, Aaron, and his sons the priests. We also consider the old covenant as something marvelous. Altogether, Judaism is very good, even wonderful, because in it we have God, the angels, the leaders, the priests, and the old covenant.<h2 class=head2>Christ Being Superior to All These Items</h2><p>The Gentiles never had such leaders as Moses and Joshua and such a person as Aaron. Neither did the heathen religions have such a covenant from God. Therefore, Judaism is altogether good. How then could the Hebrew believers as people of God forsake this religion? This bothered the Hebrews, because they had inherited all the things of Judaism, but then they believed in Christ and became Christians. On the one hand, they had received Judaism, while on the other hand they had received Christ. They realized that they needed Christ, but they could not give up Judaism. This became a bothering to them. It was under such a situation that Paul wrote this book to clarify the situation. He told them that Christ is altogether better than all of those five items.<p>In Judaism there is God, but Paul told the Hebrews that Christ is the very God. If we do not have Christ, we have God in terminology and name only, not in reality. The reality of this God is Christ, so in order to have God, we need Christ. Christ is better than Judaism because Judaism gives us God in name but not in reality, while Christ is the very embodiment and reality of God. If we have Christ as our reality, there is no need to hold on to Judaism. Since we have the reality, there is no need to keep the mere terms.<h2 class=head2>The Sections of Hebrews</h2><p>In the first two chapters of Hebrews, Paul tells us that Christ is better than the angels (1:4-2:18). Then chapters three and four tell us that Christ is better than the Jewish leaders (3:1-4:13). Christ is better than Moses and better than Joshua. From Hebrews 4:14 through 7:28, Paul tells us that Christ is also superior to Aaron and all the priests of the order of Aaron. Then from 8:1 through 10:18, Paul tells us that Christ&#8217;s new covenant is superior to the old. Chapters eleven through thirteen are a final section of this book, speaking of faith as the unique pathway to follow Christ, among other matters. We should keep these sections of Hebrews in mind. On the one hand, this book is hard to understand, but on the other hand, no other book is so clearly divided as Hebrews. The first four sections tell us that Christ is superior to everything else, and the last section shows us the way to go on and follow Christ.<p>In addition, each of the five sections contains a particular exhortation or warning. In order to understand this book, we must take care of these five warnings. The warnings appear either at the end of a section or midway through it. Hebrews 2:1-4, for example, is the first exhortation and warning, found in the middle of the first section of this book.<h2 class=head1>GOD SPEAKING IN THE SON</h2><p>The first three verses of Hebrews are the introduction of this book. This book begins by telling us that God is speaking in the Son. In the Old Testament time God spoke through many prophets, but now in the New Testament age God speaks in the Son. The Son is the Word of God, the explanation and expression of God.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST SUPERIOR TO THE ANGELS</h2><p>The first section of Hebrews, from 1:4 to the end of chapter two, reveals to us that Christ is superior to the angels because of two things. First, since Christ is God Himself and God is certainly superior to the angels, Christ is superior to the angels. Second, because Christ is also a man, as a man He is superior to the angels. We should give up wanting to be like an angel. Many times I have thanked the Lord that I was created as a man, not as an angel, because man is superior to the angels. Not only is God superior to the angels, but man is also superior to them. Therefore, in the first two chapters Christ is superior to the angels because according to chapter one He is God, and according to chapter two He is man.<h2 class=head2>As the Son of God-As God</h2><p>Chapter one quotes the prophecies in the Old Testament to tell us that the Son, through whom God speaks, is God Himself (v. 8). The angels, however, are merely the servants of God and even of those who inherit God&#8217;s salvation (vv. 6-7, 14). Those who inherit God&#8217;s salvation are men. Therefore, we are the masters, and the angels are our servants.<h2 class=head2>As the Son of Man-As Man</h2><p>Chapter two tells us that this very Christ, who is the Son of God and who is God Himself, one day became a man. This very God came into man to mingle Himself with man. By the incarnation of Christ the position and standard of man was very much uplifted. The incarnation of Christ uplifted man&#8217;s standard and position because God Himself became a man. Formerly, the angels could boast of their position in heaven, but now we can return the boast to them. We can say, &#8220;Angels, you do not have God within you, but we do. God is not one with you, but God today is one with us!&#8221; By the incarnation, God took the same position as man, and man shared the same position with God. If the president of the United States came into our meeting and sat among us, everyone would feel uplifted in position, sharing the same rank with the president. Today, however, man and God share the same position, because God became a man.<p>Hebrews 2 tells us that one day this man, Jesus, who for a time was made a little inferior to the angels, resurrected and ascended to the third heaven and was crowned with glory and honor (v. 7). A man is now in heaven crowned with glory and honor. Once again we can boast to the angels and say, &#8220;Angels, you are in heaven, but you are not crowned. There is now a man crowned in heaven.&#8221; Therefore, who is higher, man or the angels? Would you rather be a man or an angel? We no longer should prefer to be angels. We should be fully satisfied to be a man, having Christ within us and being in Christ. In Him we also are crowned with glory and honor. Moreover, He and we, we and He, have the same life and nature. He has the divine life, and we do also. He is the Son of God, and we are the sons of God. We are His brothers, and He is our elder Brother. The angels, however, are merely our servants, but we are sons of God and brothers of Christ.<p>By Christ&#8217;s incarnation He put on the human nature, and through His resurrection and ascension we have His divine nature. Now if God says to us, &#8220;You are humans,&#8221; we can reverently say, &#8220;Yes, but You too have the human nature.&#8221; If He says, &#8220;I have the divine nature,&#8221; we can say, &#8220;Lord, we have the divine nature also.&#8221; This is the reason that man today is superior to the angels. Moreover, one day Christ will bring all His dear ones, the sons of God, His many brothers, into glory (v. 10).<p>In this way, the first two chapters of Hebrews tell us that Christ as the Son of God, the very God Himself, through His incarnation, ascension, and glorification made Himself the same as we are and made us the same as He is. We are human, and He made Himself human. He is divine, and He made us to have the divine life and nature. Since He is such a man, and at the same time God Himself, He is superior to the angels. This is the message of Hebrews 1 and 2. In chapter one Christ is God, and in chapter two He is man. He is the God-man, the mingling of God and man.<h2 class=head2>Not Neglecting So Great a Salvation</h2><p>Within this section there is the first warning. The first four verses of chapter two exhort us to be careful. We have so great a salvation that brings us into the nature of God and the glory of God. If we neglect such a salvation, we will suffer loss. The Hebrew believers should not go back into Judaism. In Judaism at most there is God in name only, along with the angels, but there is no reality of God and nothing of the human nature uplifted into the divine nature and brought into the divine glory. The great salvation mentioned in 2:3 is much higher than Judaism. If we neglect such a great salvation, we will lose much.<p>Our Christ is wonderful. He is the reality and glory of God, and He is superior to the angels. Hence, if we are one with Him, we also are superior to the angels. We have to tell the angels that we are superior and that they are merely our servants. All the angels, regardless how wonderful they are, are only our servants, ministering to us. Acts 12 tells us that Peter had an angel. When Peter knocked at the door of the house of Mary, those within said, &#8220;It is his angel&#8221; (v. 15). We all have an angel as our servant, and sometimes the Lord may give us a number of angels to protect us. We are superior to the angels because we are in Christ and Christ is superior to them.<p>Therefore, there is no need to return to Judaism. Let us forget Judaism and cling to Christ. Christ is God not only in name but also in reality, and He is a man in the glory. We are now one with Him, so both we and He are superior to the angels. In the first section of this book, the writer helped the Hebrew believers to drop Judaism by taking Christ as the superior One.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST AS THE APOSTLE FOR GOD&#8217;S BUILDING SUPERIOR TO MOSES </h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 1:1-3; 2:3, 5; 3:1-4, 6; 4:8-9, 11-13</h1><p>As the book of Hebrews speaks about the difference between Christ and Judaism, it tells us who Christ is and what Christ has done; that is, it reveals the person and work of Christ. If we intend to know Christ, we must know His person and His work. The opening verses of this book are a short introduction, giving an all-inclusive description and definition of the person and work of Christ. Hebrews 1:1-3 says, &#8220;God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son, whom He appointed Heir of all things, through whom also He made the universe; who, being the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance and upholding and bearing all things by the word of His power, having made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE PERSON OF CHRIST IN HEBREWS 1 AND 2</h2><h2 class=head2>The Son</h2><p>According to these verses, the person of Christ is first the Son. The Son is a very special and specific term. As we know, God is triune-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. These are not three different Gods but the three of the one Triune God. Verse 8 of chapter one says, &#8220;But of the Son, &#8216;Your throne, O God. &#8217;&#8221; Here, the Son is called God. Not only is the Father God, but the Son is also God, just as the Spirit is God. All three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-are God. Therefore, the very opening verses tell us that the person of Christ is the Son in the Trinity. In the ancient times God spoke in the prophets, but at the last of these times God speaks in the Son, the person of Christ, who is God Himself.<h2 class=head2>The Appointed Heir of All Things and the Creator</h2><p>Before the foundation of the universe, Christ was appointed Heir of all things, and then at the time of creation Christ was the One through whom all the universe was created (v. 2). The Amplified New Testament renders universe as &#8220;the worlds and the reaches of space and the ages of time.&#8221; The universe includes space and time, all the physical, material things, and all the systems, orders, laws, and principles. All these things added together comprise the universe, which was created by God through Christ.<h2 class=head2>The Effulgence, the Impress, and the Bearer</h2><p>Christ is one thing to God, and He is another thing to God&#8217;s creation. To God, Christ is the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory and the impress of His substance (v. 3a), while to creation, Christ is the One who bears all things by the word of His power (v. 3b). By this we can see that God and all His creatures are related to Christ. The effulgence of God&#8217;s glory is outward to glorify God, while the impress of God&#8217;s substance is inward. Christ is the very glory of God outwardly and the impress, the image, of God&#8217;s substance, God&#8217;s being, what God is.<h2 class=head1>THE WORK OF CHRIST IN HEBREWS 1 AND 2</h2><p>After making purification of sins, the work of redemption, He went to the heavens and sat down (v. 3c). To sit down indicates that everything is finished. If we still have something to do, we cannot sit down. Christ has finished everything of His redemptive work on the earth. After accomplishing this, He went to the third heaven to sit down on the right hand of the Majesty on high, and that is where He now is. This refers to His work.<p>This is the very Christ in whom we believe. He is wonderful, yet this is only the introduction to this book. Who can exhaust telling what Christ is, who Christ is, and what Christ has accomplished? He is the inexhaustible One.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST SUPERIOR TO THE ANGELS</h2><p>After such an introduction, the writer of this book gives us a comparison between Christ and Judaism. The first item in Judaism is God. Here the writer tells the Hebrew believers that this Christ is nothing less than God Himself. If you will not misunderstand me, I would say that Christ is something more than the God of the Old Testament. Christ is not only God; He is the appointed One, the appointed Heir of all things. He is also the means through whom the whole universe was created. Furthermore, He is the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory, the impress of God&#8217;s substance, and the One who accomplished redemption. Because our Christ is the very essence of God, He is superior to and more excellent than the angels. This is revealed in chapter one.<p>Chapter two reveals that Christ as man is superior to the angels. The writer of Hebrews argues in this way: &#8220;For it was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth, concerning which we speak&#8221; (v. 5). However, God did say in Psalm 8 that the time would come when He would subject all creation to man. This man is the very Jesus (Heb. 2:6-9), the One who brought God into man to uplift man&#8217;s standard and position. By His incarnation He brought the divine nature into man, and by His resurrection, ascension, and glorification, He brought the human nature into God. Therefore, this man is much more excellent than the angels. What then are the angels? The angels are nothing more than servants who minister to all the members of this man, to all those who inherit salvation through this man, that is, who inherit this wonderful man as their salvation.<p>Such a salvation is the great salvation mentioned in 2:3, which asks, &#8220;How shall we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation?&#8221; This salvation is not merely the forgiveness of sins, joy, peace, blessing, and a good family, and neither is it to bring us to heaven after we die. It is much greater than this. This salvation is the very Christ in Hebrews 1 and 2. It is the living mingling of God with man. God&#8217;s divine nature is in man, and man&#8217;s uplifted human nature is in God. By Christ&#8217;s incarnation God was brought into man, and through His resurrection, ascension, and glorification man was brought into God. This is the great salvation, a salvation that is nothing less than a living mingling of God with man.<p>In Hebrews 1 and 2 we see the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is God in such a wonderful way and man in such an expansive way. This is our Christ. How can Judaism compare with such a Christ!<h2 class=head1>CHRIST SUPERIOR TO MOSES</h2><p>After the first two chapters describe and define the person of Christ, chapter three begins to tell us what Christ is doing for us now. He is not only the one who accomplished redemption for us in the past; He is also the One who was sent to us by God to work for us. Hebrews 3:1 says, &#8220;Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus.&#8221; The Greek word for apostle means a &#8220;sent one.&#8221; The Apostle here is Christ Himself who was sent by God.<h2 class=head2>The Apostle and High Priest of Our Confession</h2><p>Verse 1 speaks of the Apostle and High Priest of our confession. This Apostle and High Priest is Christ Himself. In Judaism of the ancient times, Moses was the apostle, the one sent by God to help the people. Today, however, Christ is the Apostle, the sent One.<p>In Judaism there was also a high priest, who was Aaron. What is the difference between the Apostle and the High Priest? The Apostle is the One sent to us from God, representing God to take care of us, as Moses did in the ancient times, while the High Priest is the One who goes to God from us as our Representative to take care of our case in the presence of God, in the heavenly court of law. Christ is all-inclusive. He is the sent One and the going One. He is the One who comes from God and the One who goes from us. He is wonderful!<p>Therefore, there is the need of two more sections of Hebrews. The second section, from 3:1-4:13, tells us that Christ is the sent One, the Apostle, sent from God to us to represent God in taking care of all our needs. Following this, the third section, from 4:14-7:28, tells us how Christ as the High Priest goes from us to God, representing us in the heavenly court to take care of our case.<h2 class=head2>Superior to Moses as the Builder of God&#8217;s House</h2><p>Verses 2 through 4 of chapter three say, &#8220;Who was faithful to Him who constituted Him, as also Moses was in all His house. For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by as much as He who built the house has more honor than the house. For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God.&#8221; How can Moses compare with Christ? Christ is the Builder, while Moses is only part of the house. Verse 4 says that every house has a builder, but He who built all things is God. This proves that the very Christ who is the Builder is God Himself. This Apostle, the One sent by God, is God Himself. He is the universal Builder, the unique Builder in the entire universe. However, the central building of His ministry is His house. Verse 6 says, &#8220;But Christ was faithful as a Son over His house, whose house we are.&#8221; We are the house which Christ is building.<p>As we know, this house is the church. Christ is the Builder of the church. In what way does Christ build the church? It is by caring for all the needs of His people, as Moses did, and to bring us to pass through the wilderness into the rest of the good land. The good land typifies Christ Himself, and the wilderness is a type of the soulish life. Christ builds up the church by bringing us through the soulish life into our spirit where He abides as the rest, the good land. Our concept may be that God sent Christ to us as an Apostle greater than Moses in order only to take care of our needs. If we need manna, He gives us manna. If we need living water, He gives it to us. If we need peace and joy, He gives us peace and joy. However, if we think only in this way, we are too shortsighted. In the picture in the Old Testament, Moses did not care for the people&#8217;s needs merely for their own enjoyment. It was for something much more. He took care of them so that the tabernacle would be built up among them as God&#8217;s dwelling place.<p>Today Christ is our greater Moses sent from God to take care of our needs. This is not merely for our enjoyment, but for the purpose that a house may be built up for God. Christ builds up the house of God by bringing us through the soulish life into our spirit, the very Holy of Holies where He resides today as the good land for us to enjoy rest and all the riches of Christ.<h2 class=head2>The Need to Discern Our Spirit from Our Soul</h2><p>This is the reason that at the end of this section of Hebrews, the writer tells us that the word of God has to divide our soul from our spirit. Verses 8 and 9 of chapter four say, &#8220;For if Joshua had brought them into rest, He would not have spoken concerning another day after these things. So then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.&#8221; Verses 11 through 13 continue, &#8220;Let us therefore be diligent to enter into that rest lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience. For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And there is no creature that is not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are to give our account.&#8221; This is the end of the second section of Hebrews, which begins at 3:1.<p>If we do not learn how to discern our soul from our spirit, then we will remain in the soul; we will continue to wander in the wilderness of the soul. Then there will be no possibility for the house of God to be built up. The house of God is built up in the good land of peace and rest. It was only after the people of Israel entered into the land of rest that the house of God was built up among them. This is a full picture showing us that the building of God&#8217;s house can be realized only when we enter into our spirit to live and work no longer in the soulish life. The church can be built up only when we pass through the soulish life and enter into the spirit to enjoy Christ as the good land and rest in Him. It is here that God has a dwelling place and we have a resting place.<p>If we do not enter into the spirit, we will remain in the wilderness, always wandering in the soulish life. Hence, there is a great need for us to be brought by the Lord through our soulish life into our spirit to enjoy Christ as the good land. It is here that God has a dwelling place, and it is here that we have a resting place. This very place is the all-inclusive Christ who is residing in our spirit. It is in this Christ that the house of God is built that God may have a dwelling and we may have rest.<p>Again I say, there is the need for us to discern the soul from the spirit. By discerning the soul from the spirit we are transferred from the soul to the spirit to build up God&#8217;s house. We must learn not only how to discern our soul from our spirit but also to labor to enter into our spirit. This is to enter into the Holy of Holies today to enjoy Christ as the peace and rest of the good land. As a result, we will be built up in spirit as God&#8217;s dwelling place and our resting place. This dwelling is the house built up by the Apostle, the sent One from God. He is the One who builds up the church by helping us to discern the soul from the spirit, pass through the soulish life, and enter into our spirit to enjoy Him. In this way the church is built up in spirit as a dwelling place for God and as a resting place for man.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST AS THE GREAT HIGH PRIEST SUPERIOR TO AARON</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 4:14-16; 7:16, 25</h1><p>The third section of the book of Hebrews, from 4:14 to 7:28, is a comparison between Christ and the high priest in Judaism. As we pointed out before, in Judaism there are God, the angels, Moses who was sent as an apostle by God and from God, the high priests such as Aaron with his sons, and the old covenant. These five items together comprise Judaism. The book of Hebrews is a comparison of Christ with Judaism. It tells us that Christ Himself is the very God, the Son of God; He is the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory and the impress of His substance. He is even called God Himself (1:8). In Him there is the reality of God. As such, He is much superior to the angels. He is also a glorified man with God&#8217;s divine nature, crowned with glory and honor. As such a man, He is superior to the angels. The angels are merely servants of those who inherit Christ as their salvation. Then this book proceeds to tell us that Christ is better than Moses because Christ is the real Apostle sent to us by God and from God to take care of our need in order that God&#8217;s house may be built up.<p>Following this, Hebrews tells us that Christ is the real High Priest. Hebrews 4:14-15 says, &#8220;Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession. For we do not have a High Priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all respects like us, yet without sin.&#8221; Christ is all-inclusive. As the Apostle typified by Moses He comes from God and with God to take care of our need. As the High Priest typified by Aaron He goes to God from us and with us to take care of our case in the presence of God. As the Apostle, Christ is the One sent by God to us to be with us, to care for us, to meet our need, and to settle all our problems that we may enjoy Him as our rest and our everything to be built up as the dwelling place of God. As our High Priest, Christ goes from us to God and stands before God, representing us to care for our case.<h2 class=head1>EXPERIENCING CHRIST&#8217;S HEAVENLY PRIESTHOOD IN OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>As our High Priest, Christ has passed through the heavens (4:14). However, if Christ were only in the heavens, how could His priesthood be related to us? We must realize Christ&#8217;s priesthood in the spirit. Christ is in the heavens, but today He is the Spirit, and as the Spirit He is in our spirit. Because He is in our spirit, our spirit is related to the heavens. We may illustrate this with electricity. On the one hand, electricity is in the power plant, but on the other hand, it is transmitted into our lamp. Thus, the lamp is related to the power plant by the transmission of the electricity. If there is no current of electricity within the lamp, the lamp is not related to the power plant. But because of the transmission of electricity, although the lamp is in our home, it is still connected to the power plant far away. The transmission of the spiritual &#8220;electricity&#8221; within us is the all-inclusive Spirit. In Christ&#8217;s resurrection He was transfigured to be the Spirit, and in His ascension He is in the heavens. Now the Spirit transmits Christ as the &#8220;electricity&#8221; into us. Therefore, not only Christ but also the heavens are in us. How can we as persons on the earth be in the heavens? This is possible only by the heavenly Spirit within us. The heavenly Spirit of Christ transmits the heavenly Christ into us. It is by this Spirit that we are connected to the heavens while we are still on the earth. In order to realize the priesthood of Christ, we must experience this transmission in our spirit.<h2 class=head1>COMING FORWARD TO THE THRONE OF GRACE IN OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>Hebrews 4:16 says, &#8220;Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.&#8221; If the throne of grace is in the heavens, how can we come forward to it while we still live on the earth? Here again we need our spirit (v. 12). The throne of grace is in the heavens, but this heavenly throne is continually transmitted into us in our spirit. In spirit we can touch the throne of grace in the heavens.<p>In one sense, we may even say that the throne of grace is within us because the heavenly Spirit is within us. Within the temple there was the Holy of Holies, and within the Holy of Holies there was the ark. The covering of the ark, the mercy seat, signifies the throne of grace (Exo. 25:17, 21). The ark is a type of Christ, and the ark is in the Holy of Holies. Therefore, since Christ is in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), our spirit today is the Holy of Holies. On the one hand, the Holy of Holies is in the heavens, but on the other hand, Hebrews 10:19 tells us that we must enter the Holy of Holies. If the Holy of Holies today were only in the heavens, how could we enter into it? All the heavenly things are transmitted to us in our spirit even while we are on the earth. In this way, our spirit is connected to the heavens. The all-inclusive Spirit is the current, transmitting the things in the heavens into us.<p>Christ as our High Priest in the heavens before God is constantly being transmitted into our spirit. We may also illustrate this with television. Although the scenes, the persons, and the places may be far away, television brings them into people&#8217;s homes. The scenery is far away, but it is transmitted to people by electricity. In a similar way, Christ is in the heavens acting and doing things as our High Priest, but this &#8220;scenery&#8221; is transmitted into our spirit. Day by day in our spirit there is a heavenly &#8220;television.&#8221; I do not care to watch television because within me is a better &#8220;television.&#8221; Many times when I close my eyes, I see something heavenly of Christ being transmitted into me. Day by day in my spirit I have a wonderful scenery. Christ is living, acting, and doing His job as the High Priest, and this scenery is being transmitted into our spirit. We simply enjoy Him in our spirit. Undoubtedly, the throne of grace is in heaven, but it is transmitted into our spirit. We simply come with boldness to this throne of grace in our spirit to receive mercy and find grace for timely help. We need to experience the Spirit in our spirit. This is altogether a matter in the spirit.<h2 class=head1>MINISTERING ACCORDING TO THE POWER OF AN INDESTRUCTIBLE LIFE</h2><p>Hebrews 7:16 says that Christ &#8220;has been appointed not according to the law of a fleshy commandment but according to the power of an indestructible life.&#8221; Aaron and all the priests according to the order of Aaron served according to the outward rules and regulations. Today, however, Christ as our High Priest ministers according to the power of an indestructible life. He works not according to the regulations of letter but according to the power of an indestructible life, a life which cannot be destroyed.<p>According to the type in the Old Testament, God&#8217;s people were weak and sinful, under the conviction that they could do nothing to please God. When they came to the priests, the priests did something according to the regulations written in the books of Moses to help the weak and sinful ones, to care for them so that they could be reconciled to God. Today Christ is our High Priest. If we are under the conviction that we are sinful, weak, wrong, and doing things against God, Christ as our High Priest sympathizes with us and cares for us, not according to rules and regulations in letter, but by the power of an indestructible life within. This is a not an objective matter; it is subjective. The power of an indestructible life is the eternal Spirit, and the eternal Spirit is the reality of resurrection. The eternal Spirit is the very power of the indestructible life. In acting as our High Priest, Christ cares for our case by this very power.<p>I can testify that many times I was disappointed by my weakness, circumstances, and failures. However, I sensed and experienced that there was a living power within me, sustaining me, taking care of me, and reconciling me to God to bridge the gap between me and God. This was not by outward regulations or rules in black and white but by something living and powerful within. After only five minutes I could jump up and shout &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221; because there was something living and powerful within me taking care of my case. This is our High Priest taking care of us by the power of an indestructible life, which is in the heavens but transmitted into our spirit.<p>We should have this kind of experience as Christians. If we offend a brother, we may not be able to sleep for the whole night. We may regret and condemn ourselves for being wrong with our brother and wrong before God. However, while we regret, there is something within us transmitting into us what Christ is doing to bridge the gap between us and God and between us and the offended brother. Something is transmitted into us from the third heaven, just as a television picture is transmitted from far away. Eventually we may say, &#8220;Praise You, Lord, You are my High Priest! You take care of my case.&#8221; Then we will have peace in our heart with God and the assurance that the problem between us and the brother is gone. This is the work of our High Priest, Christ the Son of God, who is actively taking care of our case in the heavens and transmitting into our spirit. There is no need for us to worry about anything. We must come simply and boldly to the throne of grace to contact Him, to look to Him, to receive mercy, and to find grace for timely help. We must learn to contact Him in our spirit and see the heavenly &#8220;television.&#8221; Then we will receive mercy and find grace.<h2 class=head1>SAVING US TO THE UTTERMOST</h2><p>Verse 25 says, &#8220;Hence also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them.&#8221; Christ can save us to the uttermost because He is living not only in the heavens but also within us. While He is living in the heavens, He is transmitting Himself into us. He is living in the heavens to intercede for us and take care of our case, but the reality of this is transmitted into our spirit by His Spirit. We must learn to see the heavenly, spiritual &#8220;television&#8221; and enjoy our High Priest. Then we will receive mercy and find grace at the throne of grace for timely help. We will be delivered and saved to the uttermost. This is the work of our High Priest as revealed in the third section of Hebrews.<h2 class=head1>AN OVERVIEW OF THE WARNINGS IN HEBREWS</h2><p>With every section of this book there is an exhortation and warning, either at the end or in the middle of each section. The first three verses of chapter one comprise an introduction. Following this, 1:4-2:18 is the first section, showing that Christ is superior to the angels. Within this section, 2:1-4 is an exhortation and warning. The second section is 3:1-4:13, which reveals that Christ as the Apostle sent from God is superior to Moses. At the end of this section there is a long exhortation from 3:7-4:13. Only six verses are used to tell us how Christ is the Apostle superior to Moses. The remaining verses are an exhortation. Then 4:14-7:28 forms the third section to show that Christ our High Priest is superior to Aaron. The exhortation and warning in this section extends from 5:11-6:20. In the coming chapters we will see the warnings in the following sections.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST&#8217;S NEW COVENANT SUPERIOR TO THE OLD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 8:1-3, 6, 10-12; 9:14-17; 10:19-25</h1><p>As we have seen, Hebrews is not easy to read and understand. In these messages we will present the most important points. This will help us to understand and realize the proper meaning of this book.<h2 class=head1>A COMPARISON BETWEEN CHRIST AND JUDAISM</h2><p>Hebrews deals with the difference between Judaism and Christ. Judaism is a religion which was established and ordained by God in order to present a set of types, pictures, and shadows to illustrate the real, heavenly, spiritual, and eternal things. These spiritual matters are difficult for the human mind to comprehend, so we need pictures to help us. When children are taught in kindergarten, a teacher often displays pictures and drawings to help them see what they are being taught. Judaism is a set of pictures, shadows, and types set up by God to illustrate the heavenly, eternal, spiritual, and mysterious things.<p>God&#8217;s purpose in these spiritual, heavenly, eternal, and mysterious things is twofold. On the negative side, God ordained Christ to be the very One to take away all our sins and redeem us back to God. On the positive side, this very Redeemer by His death, resurrection, and ascension has been wrought into us as our life. By Him, in Him, and with Him we sinners are not only forgiven and redeemed but also related to God by being joined to God and mingled with Him. By this relatedness, this union and mingling, heaven is related to earth and has even been brought into man. Now we are one not only with God but also with the heavens. The is the main thing that God has purposed to do. All the things of Judaism are the shadows, pictures, and types of this, while Christ Himself is the very reality of all these things. The difference between Judaism and Christ is that Judaism is only the shadows and pictures, not the real item. Christ Himself is the real item.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE REALITY OF GOD AND A GENUINE MAN</h2><p>Hebrews 1 tells us that Christ is the very God. He is the expression of God, the mouthpiece of God, the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory, and the impress of His substance. Christ is the reality of God. Then, chapter two tells us that this very God was incarnated as a man. By being a man, He uplifted the standard and position of man. He brought God into man by incarnation and brought man into God by resurrection and ascension; that is, by His incarnation, resurrection, and ascension He brought divinity into humanity and humanity into divinity, uplifting humanity into divinity. He is God, the reality of God, and a genuine man.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE APOSTLE SENT BY GOD TO US</h2><p>In chapter three, Christ is the One who was sent by God to us to care for us and bring us out of our fallen condition, just as Moses was sent by God to deliver the children of Israel from their fallen situation in Egypt. Christ also builds us together as God&#8217;s house by transferring us from the soul into the spirit. By enjoying Him as our rest and good land in spirit, we are built up together as God&#8217;s dwelling place.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE HIGH PRIEST ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHISEDEC</h2><p>Hebrews goes on to tell us that Christ is the High Priest going from us to God. With the high priest there are two aspects because there are two different orders of priests, the order of Aaron and the order of Melchisedec (5:4, 6, 10). Aaron as the high priest typifies Christ as the High Priest for us on the earth. Before His resurrection and ascension, Christ is typified by Aaron the high priest, taking care of our case on the earth. Aaron was the type of Christ as our High Priest to offer sacrifices for us, redeem us from sins, and reconcile us to God. This was the work Christ accomplished while He was on the earth. After His resurrection and ascension to the heavens, however, Christ is still our High Priest but no longer according to the order of Aaron but according to the order of Melchisedec. As such, He has no beginning and no end; He is the eternal One and the One in the heavens (7:3). This is something not on the negative side but very much on the positive side.<h2 class=head2>Ministering the Eternal, Heavenly, Spiritual, Living, and Refreshing Things</h2><p>On the negative side, Christ is typified by Aaron, while on the positive side, He is typified by Melchisedec. Aaron as the high priest of the people of Israel helped the people to offer their sin offerings and trespass offerings for their redemption and reconciliation to God. Melchisedec, on the other hand, brought bread and wine to Abraham. He did not offer sacrifices for redemption and reconciliation on the negative side, but he ministered something into Abraham on the positive side. After Abraham gained the victory, Melchisedec did not come to meet him, saying, &#8220;Abraham, you are sinful. Now I have to offer sacrifices on your behalf to reconcile you to God and redeem you from your fallen situation.&#8221; Rather, he came in a positive way with bread and wine to minister something eternal, heavenly, spiritual, living, and refreshing.<p>Hebrews 8:1 says, &#8220;Now in the things which are being said the chief point is this: We have such a High Priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.&#8221; While Christ was on the earth, He was a High Priest according to the order of Aaron to offer a sacrifice for our sins and reconcile us to God by the shedding of blood in His death. After His resurrection and ascension, however, Christ is in the heavens as our High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec, coming to meet us to minister the heavenly bread and the spiritual wine to us. While we are fighting the battle for God&#8217;s kingdom on this earth, Christ comes from the heavens to meet us as the eternal One, the One without beginning of days nor end of life, to minister and strengthen us with the eternal bread and the heavenly wine. This is wonderful and glorious! Although many times we gain the victory in our fighting, we are tired afterwards, and we need the bread and wine as a refreshment and strengthening to us.<h2 class=head2>Leaving the Word of the Beginning of Christ</h2><p>After speaking about the order of Aaron in the last part of chapter four and in chapter five, the writer of this book goes on to speak concerning the order of Melchisedec. He tells his readers that they are childish, that they need to leave the elementary teachings and go on to understand the higher and deeper matters (5:11-6:20). Even today nearly all of Christianity remains in chapters four and five. Most Christians know Christ only according to the order of Aaron. They often speak of how Christ loved us, shed His blood and died for us, and redeemed us and reconciled us to God so that we may be justified by faith and forgiven of our sins. In the same way, the Hebrew believers were in &#8220;elementary school,&#8221; so in chapter six the writer urges them to go on and leave the elementary teachings.<p>The elementary teachings are good, but we must advance. We should not remain in the ABCs for so many years. We should not talk only about how the Lord loves us, how He died for us on the cross, how He bore our sins and shed His blood. If we do, this means that we do not know Christ in the heavens, how He resurrected and ascended to the heavens, and what He is doing in the heavens today. This is something higher and deeper. We must know Christ according to the order of Melchisedec, the One who comes out to meet us to minister the heavenly bread and wine.<p>Hebrews 6 is a turning point. After this chapter, Hebrews 7 begins to speak of the heavenly things. It speaks not of a Christ on the earth, offering a sacrifice for sins, but of a Christ in the heavens, ministering the eternal, heavenly, spiritual, and mysterious things into us. Such a Christ brings us into the heavens and brings the heavens into us. To bring us into the heavens is to bring us into our spirit, and to bring the heavenly things into us is to bring the all-inclusive Spirit into us. We must know this heavenly Christ according to the order of Melchisedec. He is such a High Priest according to the heavenly order to minister the life supply to us, not according to the law of a fleshy commandment but according to the power of an indestructible life (v. 16), not merely to redeem us, reconcile us, and deal with our sins, but to minister into us the heavenly life supply, the heavenly power, the heavenly strength, and the heavenly riches, as Melchisedec did to Abraham.<h2 class=head1>THE NEW COVENANT SUPERIOR TO THE OLD</h2><p>The fourth main section of Hebrews, from 8:1 to 10:39, tells us that the new covenant enacted by Christ is much better than the old. The new covenant is superior to the old covenant because the old covenant was only a shadow, a type, while the new covenant is the reality, the fulfillment of the type. Christ offered Himself as the real sacrifice for sin and shed His blood to wash away our sins, and by the shedding of His blood He enacted this covenant for us.<p>With any covenant or agreement there are certain contents. The new covenant, the new testament, contains all that Christ has done. Hebrews 8:10-12 shows us the content of the new covenant. These verses say, &#8220;For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them. For I will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I shall by no means remember anymore.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>The Forgiveness of Sins</h2><p>There are four main items of the contents of the new covenant. One primary item is the forgiveness of sins (v. 12). Because of this covenant we have the right to claim the forgiveness of sins from God. With this covenant in hand we can boldly go to God and say, &#8220;You have to grant me the forgiveness of sins, because this is an item of the covenant made by my Redeemer with His shed blood.&#8221; If we know the content of the covenant, there is no need to beg God to forgive us. We can say to God, &#8220;Whether or not You are willing to forgive me, You must grant me forgiveness.&#8221; This can be illustrated by the title deed to a house. If someone buys a house and holds the deed, he can tell the former owner to give it to him, whether or not that person is willing, because the possession of the house is one of the items of the contents of their agreement. A primary item of the new covenant enacted by the shedding of Christ&#8217;s blood is the forgiveness of sins.<h2 class=head2>Imparting His Laws into Our Mind and Inscribing Them on Our Heart</h2><p>Another item of the covenant is that something of life is imparted into us (v. 10a). For the Lord to impart His laws into our mind is altogether a matter of life, the divine life, with all of its riches, including the law of life, the fellowship of life, and the sense of life. We must know the riches of the contents of the covenant, the &#8220;title deed.&#8221; We have this wonderful title deed, but we may not know what its contents are. How poor this is! The new covenant includes the forgiveness of sins and the imparting of the divine life into us with the divine law of life, the divine fellowship of life, and the divine sense of life. This is the imparting of God Himself into us.<h2 class=head2>Having God as Our God and Being His People</h2><p>Another item of the covenant is that He is our God and we are His people (v. 10b). We have the right to claim God to be our God because this is an item of the deed, the covenant. If we buy some property and hold the title deed to it, we own everything on the property. Then we may come and claim all the items according to the deed. The covenant is a title deed signed and sealed by the blood of Christ.<h2 class=head2>Knowing God</h2><p>The next item of this covenant is that we know God (v. 11). We should not cry to God for the ability to know Him. Rather, we should go to God to claim the ability to know Him, because to know God is not merely a promise of God but an item of the agreement, the signed title deed.<h2 class=head1>THE MAKER, MEDIATOR, EXECUTOR, AND MINISTER OF THE NEW COVENANT</h2><p>The items of the covenant are things Christ has already accomplished, and there are no conditions or terms for their completion. By shedding His blood, Christ enacted this deed, the covenant, and through His death He left this title deed to us as a will, a testament. Hebrews 9:16-17 says, &#8220;For where there is a testament, the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established. For a testament is confirmed in the case of the dead, since it never has force when he who made the testament is living.&#8221; A covenant is an agreement made by the giver, which is in effect while he is alive, while a testament is a will. When the maker of the covenant dies, the covenant comes into effect as a will. By shedding His blood and dying, Christ signed the title deed and left it to us as a will. Because the maker of the will died, we have the legal and judicial right to claim what is in the will.<p>With a will there is the need of an executor or arbiter. A will comes into effect when the one who makes it dies, but because some of the parties named in the will may not be proper, there is the need of an executor to execute the will faithfully. After resurrecting and ascending to the heavens, Christ became the Executor of the will in the heavenly court. Christ is not only the Maker of the covenant and the Giver of the will, He is also the Executor of the will. By shedding His blood He enacted the covenant, by dying He gave the will, and in resurrection and ascension He is today the Executor of this will in the heavenly law court.<p>Hebrews 8:6 says, &#8220;But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry inasmuch as He is also the Mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted upon better promises,&#8221; and 9:15 says, &#8220;And because of this He is the Mediator of a new covenant.&#8221; Christ as the Mediator of a better covenant is the Arbiter, the Executor, of the will. After signing the title deed by His death and leaving it to us as a will, He resurrected and ascended to the heavens as the Executor to execute what is mentioned in the will.<p>Hebrews 8:2 says, &#8220;A Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.&#8221; Christ is also the Minister, ministering to us all the divine, heavenly, spiritual, and eternal things mentioned in the will. How can Christ minister the heavenly, spiritual, and eternal things from the heavens to us on the earth? It is by the heavenly &#8220;television&#8221; within us. Christ is &#8220;televising&#8221; the &#8220;scenery&#8221; in the heavens into our spirit. Christ is now far away in the heavens acting as our Executor to minister all the heavenly, eternal, and spiritual things to us by the transmission of the eternal Spirit. Whatever is now in the heavens is immediately transmitted into our spirit.<h2 class=head1>COMING FORWARD TO THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2><p>At the end of the fourth section of Hebrews there is an exhortation and warning to urge us to learn how to enter the Holy of Holies with boldness (10:19-39). Verses 19-22 say, &#8220;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh, and having a great Priest over the house of God, let us come forward to the Holy of Holies with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.&#8221; Today our spirit is the Holy of Holies. Now we may come to the Holy of Holies to contact this heavenly Christ and touch the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace for timely help. This is the secret of receiving Christ&#8217;s ministry in the heavens.<p>There is no need to go back to Judaism with its shadows, pictures, and types. We have the reality of all of these things in the heavenly Christ. This heavenly Christ is in the heavens, and the heavens are &#8220;televised&#8221; into our spirit. By simply entering into our spirit, we can be in the Holy of Holies to touch the throne of grace. It is here that we contact Christ who is ministering everything heavenly, spiritual, and eternal into us. How wonderful this is!<p>All the things we have seen from the first ten chapters of Hebrews are transmitted into our heavenly &#8220;television,&#8221; which is our spirit. Therefore, the secret is to discern the soul from the spirit and learn how to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord who is in the heavens in our spirit. Christ is here as the heavenly High Priest to minister all the heavenly, eternal, and spiritual things into us, just as Melchisedec ministered the riches to the fighting Abraham. He is this kind of High Priest to us while we are walking on this earth and fighting the battle for God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>ENTERING THE VEIL AND GOING OUTSIDE THE CAMP</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 12:1-3; 13:10-13; Exo. 33:7</h1><p>The book of Hebrews may be divided into two main sections. Chapters one through ten may be considered the first major section, dealing with certain truths. Chapters eleven through thirteen are the second main section, dealing with the way of faith. In the first section there are four subsections. The first tells us that Christ is superior to the angels, the second that Christ is superior to Moses, the third that Christ is superior to Aaron, and the fourth that Christ&#8217;s new covenant is superior to the old. Christ is superior to everything in Judaism.<p>The second section of Hebrews deals with the way to follow the Lord. Chapter eleven speaks concerning the witnesses of faith. Then, as we have seen, each section of Hebrews contains an exhortation and a warning, which in the last section of this book is the whole of chapter twelve.<h2 class=head1>FOLLOWING JESUS ON THE PATHWAY OF FAITH</h2><p>After dealing with the matters of the truth in a full way, the writer goes on to tell us that we have to follow Jesus on the pathway of faith. The pathway of faith is a narrow way, the way of the cross. It is the narrow way of suffering and the way of loss. Therefore, we must walk this way by faith. All the patriarchs and prophets in the ancient time are witnesses of this way. They are a cloud of witnesses surrounding us and testifying to us of the pathway of faith.<p>Hebrews 12:1-3 says, &#8220;Therefore let us also, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, put away every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and run with endurance the race which is set before us, looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God. For compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary, fainting in your souls.&#8221; Christ is the unique Author and Perfecter of our faith. Therefore, for this faith by which we walk the narrow way, we need to look away unto Jesus. This living faith is not something originating from us, but it is from Him. We must look away from ourselves, from all our circumstances, surroundings, environment, and all things, unto Him and take Him as the Author and Perfecter of our faith. In ourselves we do not have the faith by which we can walk the narrow way of the cross, but we can look away from all things other than Christ unto Him. Then He will be the Author and Perfecter of this faith. If we look away unto Him, we will have His living faith for us to walk the narrow way of the cross. This is the main content of chapters eleven and twelve.<h2 class=head1>ENJOYING CHRIST WITHIN THE VEIL</h2><p>Hebrews 13:10 says, &#8220;We have an altar from which they who are serving the tabernacle have no right to eat.&#8221; This verse tells us that there is a unique altar in the universe. On this altar we have an offering to eat and enjoy. The priests of Judaism have no right to eat from this altar, but we the believers do. This altar is the very cross of Christ, and on this altar the offering we enjoy is Christ Himself.<p>Verse 11 says, &#8220;For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the Holy of Holies for sin by the high priest are burned up outside the camp.&#8221; The blood of the offering was brought into the sanctuary, but the bodies of the offerings were burned outside the camp. This signifies that we enjoy Christ as our offering in two aspects, an aspect in the heavens and an aspect on the earth. First, the blood of Christ was brought into the heavenly sanctuary to be effective for us there. This is a matter of the priesthood according to the order of Melchisedec. By and through Christ&#8217;s redeeming blood, which was shed on the cross and brought into the heavenly sanctuary, the heavens were opened to us and we were brought into the heavenlies, that is, into our spirit, to contact and enjoy the heavenly things. This is the enjoyment of the heavenly Christ in the heavenly Holy of Holies.<h2 class=head1>GOING FORTH UNTO JESUS OUTSIDE THE CAMP</h2><p>Verses 12 and 13 speak concerning our portion of Christ as our offering on the earth. These verses say, &#8220;Therefore also Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate. Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.&#8221; Christ suffered in His body on the earth outside the gate, which is the gate of the old Jerusalem, the center of Judaism, the organized Jewish religion. On the one hand, Christ opened the heavens for us to enjoy Him in the heavens, and on the other hand, He is our portion to enjoy that we may follow Him to suffer on this earth by walking the way of faith. Today, we Christians have to learn how to enter the veil by a new and living way which was opened for us by the blood of Christ to enjoy the heavenly Christ within the veil, in our spirit, and in the heavens. However, we also must go outside the camp to follow His footsteps to suffer as Jesus suffered on the earth.<h2 class=head2>The Camp Being First the People of Israel and Then Judaism</h2><p>Verse 13 says, &#8220;Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.&#8221; Although we may know what the Holy of Holies within the veil is, we may not know what the significance of the camp is. Before the record of Exodus 33:7, the people of Israel had encamped near the Tent of Meeting, because the tabernacle as the dwelling place of God was not raised up until Exodus 40. At the time of Exodus 33, the tent of Moses represented the place of the Lord&#8217;s presence. The people of Israel had committed the serious sin of worshipping the golden calf (32:1-6), so the camp was polluted and corrupted by idol worship. This provoked the Lord greatly. When Moses came down from the mountain, he called for the overcomers to stand with him to slay the idol worshippers. This indicates that by that time the entire camp of the children of Israel was polluted, corrupted, and given up by the Lord. From that time on, Moses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp. Before that time, Moses had always pitched his tent within the camp, but after the worship of the golden calf, Moses gave up the camp and went outside the camp.<p>The camp, therefore, represents the Jewish religion as an organization. In name this organization is something of the Lord&#8217;s people, but in fact within this religious organization there is corruption and idol worship, and the Lord&#8217;s presence is not there. At the time the Lord Jesus was on earth, Judaism had become a fully-established religious organization, a real camp. In its outward appearance it was an organization of God&#8217;s people, but within this camp there was corruption and idol worship. This camp even cast the Lord Jesus outside the gate of Jerusalem, which was the center of the Jewish religion. He was cast out, and He suffered outside the gate.<p>In the heavenly Holy of Holies we enjoy the heavenly, resurrected, and ascended Christ, while outside the camp we follow the suffering Jesus and bear His reproach. This book was written to the Hebrew believers. To them, Judaism was a religious organization, the very camp that cast out Christ. On the one hand, those Hebrew believers were enjoying the heavenly Christ, but on the other hand, they tried to remain in the camp. This became a problem to them. They enjoyed the resurrected and ascended Christ in their spirit, in the heavens, but they would not give up Judaism. They tried to reconcile these two, so the writer of this book told them that this was impossible. Those who intended to enjoy the ascended Christ in the spirit in the heavens needed to follow His steps to go outside the camp of Judaism, the Jewish religion, and bear His reproach.<h2 class=head2>The Camp Being the Organized Religion of the Day</h2><p>We who enjoy the heavenly Christ in the Holy of Holies within the veil need to follow Him in our walk on this earth. Where is Jesus today? He is not in the camp; He has been rejected by the camp and cast out of it. Remember well that the camp is the religious organization of the present day. At the time of Moses, the camp was the people of Israel. Then at the time of the Lord Jesus, the camp was the organized Jewish religion. At the time of Martin Luther, the Roman Catholic Church had become the camp. From Luther&#8217;s biography we can realize that he entered within the veil to enjoy the heavenly Christ to be empowered so that he would have the strength and power to suffer the persecution of that camp, and he went out of that camp to follow Jesus, bearing the reproach and suffering the persecution. Years later John Bunyan, the author of The Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress, went outside the camp of the state church of England. Today this camp is the organization of Christianity. In the eyes of God organized Christianity is simply a camp. In name it is the Lord&#8217;s people, but in actuality it is full of corruption and even idol worship. There is almost no place, no ground, for the Lord, and the presence of the Lord has been cast out. If we mean business to enjoy the presence of the Lord in the heavens within the veil, we must go outside the camp of organized Christianity to follow Jesus.<p>Today many Christians are like the Hebrew believers. On the one hand, they try to enjoy the heavenly Christ in their spirit, but on the other hand, they compromise with organized Christianity and try to remain there. They do not want to go outside the camp to bear His reproach. According to this clear picture, we can see where we should be. Our spirit must be in the heavens with Christ, and our steps must be with Jesus outside the camp of organized Christianity. However, many dear Christians cannot say boldly that their steps are outside the camp of organized religion to follow Jesus.<h2 class=head2>Within the Veil and Outside the Camp</h2><p>I truly appreciate these two phrases in the book of Hebrews: within the veil and outside the camp (6:19; 13:13). Christ is our offering, our portion offered to God for us on the altar of the cross. The way to enjoy Him as our portion is twofold. On the one hand, we enjoy the ascended Christ in the heavens in our spirit, while on the other hand, we need to follow His steps outside the camp and bear His reproach. In these two ways we fully enjoy Him as our portion. The way to enjoy Him is by entering the veil and going outside the camp. To enter the veil is to enjoy the heavenly Christ in our spirit, and to go outside the camp is to give up the organized religion to follow Jesus. There is no other way to fully enjoy Him. The more we enjoy Him as the heavenly Melchisedec in our spirit, the more we will step outside the camp and give up organized Christianity.<p>By enjoying and experiencing Christ in our spirit, we spontaneously step out of organized Christianity. We may say that we do not have the strength to bear His reproach and suffer. However, the strength is not of us; the strength is of Him. The more we go to Him to enjoy Him in the heavens by contacting Him in our spirit, the more we have the strength to step out of organized Christianity, following Jesus on this earth and bearing His reproach. It is not by our strength but by Christ as our strength.<p>It is not sufficient merely to encourage you to step out of organized Christianity, but if you contact the heavenly Christ in your spirit and enjoy Him, you will spontaneously walk out of that great &#8220;tree&#8221; (Matt. 13:32). Spontaneously and unconsciously you will be outside the gate. Even if you do not want to walk out, the people there may cast you out. I left organized religion in 1927. Some people were ready to cast me out, saying, &#8220;Mr. Lee, you better go somewhere else. You are too much trouble to us!&#8221;<p>The more we contact the heavenly Christ, the more we may be considered a &#8220;pest&#8221; by the people in organized religion (Acts 24:5). When we are cast out, we suffer and bear the reproach. Today I can say that I am one of many who are within the veil enjoying the heavenly Christ and outside the camp bearing the reproach of Jesus. This is the only way for us to follow Him and enjoy Him as our portion. This is the way of faith, the way of the cross, which is the narrow pathway for us to enjoy Christ in a practical way. May the Lord be gracious to us that we may practice this.<h2 class=head2>Being Careful Not to Form a Camp</h2><p>The camp is organized religion, which claims to be the people of God yet gives no room to Christ. Instead, it has only rituals, rules, orders, and other such matters. Originally Judaism was established by God, but later the ground given to God was lost, and no ground was given to Christ. Rather, the people turned it into a religion with rituals and regulations, producing a camp.<p>On the day of Pentecost the church was established. Originally it was something living, but gradually even within the church the ground for God and Christ was lost. In The Waning Authority of Christ in the Churches, A. W. Tozer wrote that according to his realization, Jesus Christ is &#8220;little more than a beloved symbol&#8221; among the churches of today and that no real ground is given to Christ. As a pastor in a large denomination in America, he observed that there is no room for Jesus Christ in the denominational churches. That was his full recognition that Christianity today is a camp, a religious organization.<p>The church originally was a living Body to contain Christ, and Christ had the full ground within the church, but gradually this ground was lost, and the church drifted first into Catholicism. During the time of Martin Luther, the Roman Catholic Church was one hundred percent a camp. When the Reformation began, many pure, seeking Christians left Catholicism; they went out of that camp. However, after not too long, even the reformed churches themselves gradually became many camps. On the one hand, we have to give up the camp, but on the other hand, we must be careful not to become another camp. If a group of people claim to belong to God but do not give any ground to Christ, they will form rituals, charters, creeds, rules, and regulations and give no ground to the Holy Spirit. Then they will become a camp. We must reject and forsake such a camp, and we must come out of it. We must not only reject organized Christianity; we have to reject any camp we ourselves may form. We should not try to form anything. Whatever we form, no matter how much it seems to be according to the pattern of the New Testament, is still a camp. If we are truly following the Lord, we must drop all these things. Then what we should do is minister Christ and give birth to Christ in so many persons.<h2 class=head1>THE SUBJECTIVE WORK OF THE GOD OF PEACE</h2><p>Chapter thirteen of Hebrews contains some final charges, after which verses 20 to 25 are a conclusion. Verses 20 and 21 say, &#8220;Now the God of peace, He who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of an eternal covenant, perfect you in every good work for the doing of His will, doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.&#8221; In verse 21, Jesus Christ is the subjective Christ. Even this book, which deals with the truth, tells us that God must work within us subjectively through Jesus Christ. This conclusion impresses us that all the teachings within it are for the subjective work of God within us.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>FAITH AND ITS ISSUES IN JAMES</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: James 1:17-18, 12, 21; 2:5; 4:5-8; 5:14, 7-8; Acts 21:18-21</h1><p>We may now consider some verses from the short book of James, not according to their order in the chapters but according to a spiritual order.<h2 class=head1>IMPORTANT MATTERS IN THE BOOK OF JAMES</h2><h2 class=head2>The Birth of Life, the Gift of Life, and the Crown of Life</h2><p>James 1:17-18 says, &#8220;All good giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation or shadow cast by turning. He brought us forth by the word of truth, purposing that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.&#8221; These two verses speak of the spiritual birth and the spiritual gift. Even James stressed the matter of regeneration in his writing. Truth in verse 18 is Christ Himself. God has regenerated us with this living word, His word of truth, that we may be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures. Our spiritual rebirth is the start of the Christian life.<p>Verse 12 says, &#8220;Blessed is the man who endures trial, because when he has become approved by testing, he will receive the crown of life, which He promised to those who love Him.&#8221; Verse 2 speaks of &#8220;various trials.&#8221; Verses 2 through 12 deal with trials, not temptations, while verses 13 to 18 deal with temptations. Trials come from God, but temptations come from the devil. We should not endure temptations; we have to overcome temptation. What we must endure are the trials. If we endure the trials, we will receive not only the birth of life and the gift of life but the crown of life. We obtain the new birth by faith in Christ, but we receive the crown of life through our love toward the Lord. By believing in the Lord we have the divine birth, but we must go on to love the Lord so that we will receive the crown of life. The crown of life is a reward to those who love Him.<h2 class=head2>Inheriting the Kingdom</h2><p>James 2:5 continues, &#8220;Listen, my beloved brothers: Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him?&#8221; The crown of life has much to do with the kingdom. Both of these are the reward promised by God to those who love Him. If we love the Lord, one day we will receive the crown of life and share in the kingdom of God.<h2 class=head2>The Indwelling Spirit and Greater Grace</h2><p>James 4:5-6 says, &#8220;Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: &#8216;The Spirit, whom He has caused to dwell in us, longs to envy&#8217;? But He gives greater grace; therefore it says, &#8216;God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.&#8217;&#8221; The Spirit in verse 5 is not the human spirit but the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. Even in this book the indwelling Spirit is mentioned. The grace spoken of in verse 6 is nothing less than Christ as life to us.<p>Verses 7 and 8 continue, &#8220;Be subject therefore to God; but withstand the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-souled!&#8221; This book also speaks of the devil and the soul. A man should have only one soul and not be double-souled.<h2 class=head2>The Church</h2><p>James 5:14 says, &#8220;Is anyone among you ill? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.&#8221; Here James speaks of the church, the elders, and divine healing.<h2 class=head2>The Implanted Word and the Saving of the Soul</h2><p>James 1:21 says, &#8220;Therefore putting away all filthiness and the abundance of malice, receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.&#8221; Our spirit needs to be regenerated, and our soul needs to be saved. The way for our soul to be saved is by the implanted, grafted word.<h2 class=head2>The Coming of the Lord</h2><p>James 5:7-8 says, &#8220;Therefore be long-suffering, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer eagerly awaits the precious fruit of the earth, exercising long-suffering over it until it receives the early and late rain. You also be long-suffering; establish your hearts because the coming of the Lord has drawn near.&#8221; The Greek word for coming here is not the common word for coming. It is parousia, meaning the presence of the Lord.<p>All of the foregoing matters-regeneration, every perfect gift, the crown of life, the kingdom, the indwelling Spirit, grace, the devil, the church, the implanted word, the saving of the soul, and the coming of the Lord-are the major items of this Epistle.<h2 class=head2>Under the Influence of Judaism but Still Touching the Line of Life</h2><p>However, James was still under the influence of Judaism. Acts 21:18-21 helps us to realize this. These verses say, &#8220;And on the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. And having greeted them, he related one by one the things which God did among the Gentiles through his ministry. And when they heard it, they glorified God and said to him, You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed; and all are zealous for the law. And they have been informed concerning you that you are teaching all the Jews throughout the nations apostasy from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs.&#8221; At this time James advised the apostle Paul to keep the formalities of Judaism. Paul agreed to do that, and due to this he was subsequently arrested. From this portion of Acts we can see that even James and perhaps the elders with him were still zealous for Judaism.<p>James is the earliest of all the Epistles, written around A.D. 50, before the time of Acts 21. Although this book has the background of Judaism, the writer still stresses things such as the new birth, every perfect gift, the crown of life, the kingdom of God, the indwelling Spirit, the devil, the church, the saving of the soul, and the coming of the Lord. In principle, the teaching in this book is the same as the New Testament teaching; it is still in the line of life. When reading this book, however, many Christians are distracted by the background and do not see that this is also a book concerning life.<h2 class=head1>TWELVE ISSUES OF LIVING FAITH</h2><p>From the point of view of the whole New Testament, the book of James is a supplement to the teaching of faith. Many believe that as long as they have faith, that is sufficient. However, living faith must be confirmed by its issue, its result. Living faith must have fruit. If someone claims that he has living faith, he must bring forth fruit from this faith as a confirmation. This is the main purpose of the book of James. James gives us twelve particular items as the issue of living faith.<h2 class=head2>Having a Faith That Is Living</h2><p>First of all, our faith must be a living faith. This is particularly dealt with in chapters one and two (1:3, 6; 2:1, 5, 14-26).<h2 class=head2>Having a Prayer Life</h2><p>Second, if we have living faith, we will have a prayer life; we will pray much (5:13-18). History tells us that James was a man of prayer. The more faith we have, the more we pray. Prayer is an issue, the fruit, of living faith.<h2 class=head2>Enduring Various Trials</h2><p>Living faith also endures various trials (1:2, 12). If we suffer trials for a short time and fall away, this proves that we do not have living faith. If we have living faith, we will endure the trials.<h2 class=head2>Overcoming All Temptations</h2><p>In addition, if we have living faith, we will overcome all temptations. As we have seen, verses 2 through 12 deal with trials, whereas verses 13 to 18 deal with temptations. Trials come from God, but temptations come from the devil. As far as trials are concerned, we must endure, while concerning temptations, we have to overcome. Both the enduring of trials and the overcoming of temptations are the fruit of living faith.<h2 class=head2>Being Doers of the Word</h2><p>Fifth, if we have living faith, we will be not only hearers of the word, but also doers (vv. 22-25). Living faith causes us to act and work according to what we hear of the word, making us doers of the word.<h2 class=head2>Being Separated from the World</h2><p>Sixth, living faith causes us to be separated from the world, to be unspotted from the world and to not have any friendship with the world (1:27b; 4:4).<h2 class=head2>Caring for Orphans, Widows, and Poor Ones</h2><p>The seventh issue of living faith is that we are kind to orphans, widows, and poor ones (1:27a; 2:1-6, 14-16). If we have living faith, we will be generous to spontaneously take care of these needy ones.<h2 class=head2>The Work of Faith</h2><p>If we have living faith, we will have the conduct, the work, of faith. James 2:14-16 illustrates this. To tell a needy, poor brother to trust in the Lord and go in peace is to have a faith which is not living. Living faith gives something to the needy one. We cannot speak to a needy one with vain words about faith. We must have the true work of faith. If we believe that God is living and can care for this needy one, we should share what we have with him and let God care for us. Why would we believe in God for him, yet not believe in God for ourselves? We may believe that God will care for the needy one, but we may believe that only the money in our pocket and in our bank account, not God, will take care of us. This faith is full of doubt. If we have living faith, we should take out all we have in our pocket in order to care for the needy one, and then we can let God care for us. This is a true work to confirm and prove that we have a living faith.<h2 class=head2>Bridling Our Tongue</h2><p>Another issue of our living faith is that we bridle our tongue (3:2-12). We should not talk too much. We should bridle our tongue like we would bridle a horse. The more faith we have, the more we will pray and not gossip, but to have gossip and vain talk means that we lack living faith. In fact, the more we talk vainly and gossip, the more we lose our faith.<h2 class=head2>Trusting in the Lord</h2><p>Living faith always causes us to trust in the Lord (4:13-17). In whatever we do and wherever we go we should not trust in ourselves. We should say, &#8220;Lord, if You will, I will go, and if You will, I will do. I do not know whether or not tomorrow I will live. My breath is like a vapor, and perhaps tomorrow this vapor will disappear. Therefore, I do not trust in myself. I trust in You, Lord.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>Using Our Riches in the Proper Way</h2><p>Furthermore, if we have living faith, we will use all our wealth and riches in the proper way. James 5:1-6 is a warning to the rich. In the entire New Testament, there is no other book which warns the rich as much as this one does. Rich people may love their money and trust in their wealth simply because they do not have living faith. If we have living faith, we will use all our riches and wealth in the right way.<h2 class=head2>Being Right with the Brothers</h2><p>The twelfth and final issue of our living faith is that it causes us to be right with the brothers (5:19-20). This means that we do not speak anything critical against a brother. Rather, we rescue the fallen ones who are led astray from the truth, and we take care of them to bring them back to the Lord.<p>The foregoing twelve items are different aspects of the living work that issues out of living faith. If we have living faith, we will manifest these living works. They are the reality of our conduct as persons who have living faith. If we consider these points, the entire book of James will be open to us.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY</h1><h1 class=msg>THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD IN 1 AND 2 PETER</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 1:17; 4:17; 2:12; 2 Pet. 2:9; 3:7; 1 Pet. 1:2-4, 18-19, 22-23; 2:2-5, 9; 5:1-5; 2 Pet. 1:1-7</h1><p>As we have seen, the books of the New Testament are arranged according to the sovereignty of the Lord. The eight books from Hebrews to Jude are supplementary to the other Epistles. Hebrews is the first supplement, James is the second, the two Epistles of Peter are the third, the three Epistles of John are the fourth, and Jude is the fifth. As a supplement to the teaching of the previous Epistles, Hebrews tells us the difference between Christ and Judaism. James, although written before the other Epistles such as Romans and Galatians, is a supplement to the teaching of faith, containing much wisdom.<h2 class=head1>THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD</h2><p>The third supplement, the two Epistles of Peter, deals with the government of God. First Peter 1:17 says, &#8220;And if you call as Father the One who without respect of persons judges according to each one&#8217;s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear.&#8221; It is not easy to understand this passage because we may consider that the judgment mentioned here is in the future. However, the judgment spoken of here is not the judgment in the future, at the coming back of the Lord Jesus Christ and at the end of the millennium. Strictly speaking, those judgments will not be in the hands of the Father. John 5:22 tells us, &#8220;For neither does the Father judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son.&#8221; The judgments in the future will be in the hands of the Son. First Peter 1:17 says that it is the Father who judges. The judgment here, therefore, is not in the future. It is the dealing of God&#8217;s government in the present time. While we pass the time of our sojourning here on earth, God as the Father has apportioned a certain amount of dealing for His people. This is a judgment in the present time, in the present course of this age. While we are passing our earthly journey, God is exercising His judgment, His government.<p>First Peter 4:17 says, &#8220;For it is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God; and if first from us, what will be the end of those who disobey the gospel of God?&#8221; Again, the judgment mentioned here is not the ultimate judgment in the future, but a temporary judgment during the course of this age.<p>First Peter 2:12 says, &#8220;Having your manner of life excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the matter concerning which they speak against you as evildoers they may, by your good works, as they see them with their own eyes, glorify God in the day of His visitation.&#8221; The Greek word for visitation here implies God&#8217;s intervening, God&#8217;s coming in to deal with man.<p>Second Peter 2:9 says, &#8220;The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of trial and how to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment.&#8221; Verse 7 of chapter three says, &#8220;But the heavens and the earth now, by the same word, have been stored up for fire, being kept unto the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.&#8221; These verses also speak concerning the government of God in this present time, showing us the subject of these two books.<p>In the two Epistles of Peter, the Holy Spirit clearly reveals to us God&#8217;s present government. The other Epistles contain something related to God&#8217;s government, but not so clearly as in these two Epistles. All humans on the earth are under the government of God. With any kind of government there are always rules and regulations. If we keep these regulations, we will be at peace, but if we trespass them, we will be in trouble. We may illustrate this by the government of a city carried out through the city hall. When we drive a car, we must obey all the traffic signs; otherwise, we will be issued a traffic citation or even have our driver&#8217;s license suspended. We must abide by the rules because a government is here. We should not think that today in the universe and on the earth among men there is no government of God. There is a government of God over humans on this earth.<p>It is due to the judgment and dealing of God in the present time, as revealed in the two books of Peter, that many of God&#8217;s people suffer. They suffer because they do something against God&#8217;s rule. Again, we may illustrate this principle with a policeman. Even if we break a law unconsciously, we cannot excuse ourselves in this way to a policeman. A policeman does not regard whether we violate the law consciously or unconsciously; he still will issue us a ticket. This illustrates that although God may seem to be loose with the unbelievers, He is not loose with His own children. First Peter 4:17 says that the judgment begins from the house of God. We should not think that because we are the children of God, He will favor us. Rather, He is very strict with us. Even before God&#8217;s final and ultimate judgment comes upon man, He still exercises His government over His children. Therefore, we as the children of God must be careful to keep all the rules in His government.<p>Peter&#8217;s first Epistle tells us that God&#8217;s government is for the profit of the believers, whereas his second Epistle tells us that God&#8217;s government is His punishment on the unbelievers. God&#8217;s dealing with His own children is for their profit, but God&#8217;s dealing with the unbelievers, the unrighteous, is for their punishment. God has a present, divine government in this universe and on this earth among men. We must learn to be governed by the many divine rules of this government. This is the subject of the two Epistles of Peter as books of supplementary teaching.<h2 class=head1>CHOSEN, SANCTIFIED, REDEEMED, REGENERATED, AND FEEDING</h2><p>Although the subject of the Epistles of Peter is the government of God, their content is still in the principle of the inner life and the church life. A second set of verses shows us this content. First Peter 1:2-4 says, &#8220;Chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you.&#8221; Verses 18 and 19 read, &#8220;Knowing that it was not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, that you were redeemed from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers, but with precious blood, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ.&#8221; Verses 22 and 23 continue, &#8220;Since you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned brotherly love, love one another from a pure heart fervently, having been regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God.&#8221; In addition, 2:2-3 says, &#8220;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation, if you have tasted that the Lord is good.&#8221;<p>The Father chose us in eternity past, the Holy Spirit sanctified and separated us, and Christ redeemed us by shedding His blood. Moreover, God also has regenerated us. To be regenerated means that God has put Christ into us as our life that we may have another life, the divine life, in addition to our human life. All of these basic matters-God&#8217;s selection, Christ&#8217;s redemption, the Holy Spirit&#8217;s sanctification, the divine regeneration-are found in the writings of Peter. Now after being regenerated, we need to seek the spiritual food and spiritual milk for us to drink that we may grow and that our soul may be purified. The apostle Paul did not use the word purified as Peter did, but he used the word transformed (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2). To be transformed is to be purified in our soul.<h2 class=head1>GROWING TO BE BUILT UP AS A SPIRITUAL HOUSE</h2><p>First Peter 2:4-5 says, &#8220;Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&#8221; The purpose of our growing is to be built up as a spiritual house, which is the church. God&#8217;s purpose is that we be built up together as a spiritual house, and this spiritual house is a priesthood, a body of priests built together to offer up spiritual sacrifices to God. This is the service in the church and the church life. This building, this spiritual house, is the Body of Christ. The Body with many priests coordinated together offers up spiritual sacrifices to God.<h2 class=head1>THE HOLY PRIESTHOOD AND THE ROYAL PRIESTHOOD</h2><p>Verse 9 says, &#8220;But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.&#8221; The believers are not only holy priests but also royal priests. Whereas the holy priests are according to the order of Aaron, the royal, kingly priests are according to the order of Melchisedec. Melchisedec was a king and a kingly priest (Heb. 7:1). The holy priests are those who are separated to go to God to represent God&#8217;s people, while the kingly priests come from God to care for us, just as Melchisedec came from God to meet Abraham to minister bread and wine to him (Gen. 14:17-18). On the one hand, we are the holy priests, always going to God to represent the people, while on the other hand, we come from God to the people to represent God. We may apply this in a practical way. Before we go out to preach the gospel, we should go to God in prayer, praying day and night, representing the sinners before God. At this time we are the holy priests. Then, when we go to the sinners to proclaim the gospel to them, representing God to minister grace and life, we are royal priests.<p>The holy priesthood in 1 Peter 2:5 offers spiritual sacrifices to God, while the kingly priesthood in verse 9 tells out the virtues of God. The holy priests offer something to God for the sake of the people, while the royal priests declare the things of God to people. We are the holy priests and the kingly priests, going and coming in two directions.<p>In the past we may not have had the thought that we are not only holy priests but also kingly priests coming from God, representing Him, to minister Christ to others. Many times I have had the realization that we are the kingly priests, those coming from God to others. We are here representing God, declaring something of God to people, declaring His excellency, His grace, His life, and His divine nature to others. The church is this kind of priesthood. The church is composed of those who are regenerated, purified in their soul, nourished and growing up, and built together as a living house to contain God, to be indwelt by God, to serve Him as the holy priests, and to minister Him to people as the royal, kingly priests. Even in such a book as 1 Peter, which speaks about the government of God, there is the content of the divine life for the church life.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH AS THE FLOCK OF GOD</h2><p>In the last chapter of 1 Peter there are the elders and the flock of God, which is the church. Verses 1 to 5 of chapter five say, &#8220;Therefore the elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory to be revealed: Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God; not by seeking gain through base means but eagerly; nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders; and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.&#8221; In the church we must all submit one to another that we may have a good order, so that the Lord may be glorified among us.<h2 class=head1>EQUALLY PRECIOUS FAITH</h2><p>Peter&#8217;s second Epistle is even more wonderful than the first. Some wrongly believe that there is not much content in 2 Peter. On the contrary, it is full of riches. Second Peter 1:1-4 says, &#8220;Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have been allotted faith equally precious as ours in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord; seeing that His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness, through the full knowledge of Him who has called us by His own glory and virtue, through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust.&#8221; Verse 1 speaks of the equally precious faith allotted to us, which is the same faith that Peter had. Then verse 3 speaks of the divine power within us, which has granted to us all things which relate to life within and godliness without, and verse 4 speaks of precious and exceedingly great promises. Finally, verse 4 says that we are partakers of the divine nature. If we have these six items-precious faith, divine power, life, godliness, precious promises, and the divine nature-what else could we desire?<p>We can never be rid of this precious faith within us. When we are under trials and temptations, we may say that it is no good to try to be a Christian. We simply cannot make it, so we try to drop being a Christian. However, we cannot drop it. We may try to drop the Lord, but He will not drop us; the precious faith grabs hold of us. Because there is something living within us, which is precious faith, the more we try to drop the Lord, the more He lays hold of us. This is truly mysterious. This precious faith within us is the strongest confirmation that we have been chosen by God.<p>It is from this living faith within us that we have the divine power. Today many people are seeking the outward power of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. However, real power is not outward but inward. We may illustrate this with atomic power. Atomic power is not merely outward; it is contained within even the poorest natural materials. Within us there is a divine &#8220;atomic&#8221; power. This divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness. Life is the content within, and godliness is our living without.<p>We have everything we need. God takes care of us in such a full and complete way. He knows our true condition, so He gives us many precious promises that through them we might become partakers of His divine nature to be the same as He is in nature. How wonderful this is!<h2 class=head1>THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF EQUALLY PRECIOUS FAITH</h2><p>Verses 5 to 7 of chapter one say, &#8220;And for this very reason also, adding all diligence, supply bountifully in your faith virtue; and in virtue, knowledge; and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control, endurance; and in endurance, godliness; and in godliness, brotherly love; and in brotherly love, love.&#8221; Equally precious faith may be compared to a root and the divine power to a sprout. Then out of this comes a tree with fruit, which are the virtues which grow out of faith. Verse 5 speaks of adding, bringing in beside. This means that beside the six items in verses 1 to 4-precious faith, divine power, life, godliness, precious promises, and the divine nature-we must add all the virtues in verses 5 to 7.<p>By the divine power and divine nature, virtue grows out as the issue of faith. Then out from this virtue knowledge grows, and out from knowledge self-control grows. The more we grow in Christ and in the spiritual life, the more we will exercise self-control. Then the more we exercise self-control, the more endurance will grow and the more we will endure with others. Out of this endurance godliness will grow. Toward ourselves we exercise self-control, toward others we have endurance, and toward God we have a life of godliness. Then out of godliness brotherly love will grow, and out of brotherly love the divine love will grow. This growth begins from faith and issues in love, like the growth of the tree of life. In this way, the divine life and the church life are the content even of the two Epistles of Peter, which deal with the government of God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP IN THE EPISTLES OF JOHN AND CONTENDING FOR THE FAITH IN JUDE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:1-3, 5-7; 2:27; 3:24; 4:13; 2 John 7-11; 3 John 5-10</h1><p>The three Epistles of the apostle John are the fourth supplement in the New Testament Epistles, concerning the fellowship of God&#8217;s household, God&#8217;s divine family. Although the Epistles of Paul cover many matters, they do not adequately deal with the fellowship of God&#8217;s family.<h2 class=head1>THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE DIVINE LIFE</h2><p>First John 1:1-3 says, &#8220;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life (and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us); that which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.&#8221; The Word of life is the Son of God, Christ Himself, as in John 1:1, and the fellowship in 1 John 1:3 comes out of this eternal life.<p>The fellowship of God&#8217;s children is not only a fellowship between themselves but also one between the children and the Father. This fellowship issues from the divine life, which is Christ Himself. Fellowship is the divine life flowing and living within us. The current of electricity is electricity itself flowing, and the circulation of blood in our body is the blood itself circulating and flowing. In the same way, when Christ constantly lives, works, and flows within us, we have the fellowship of the divine life.<p>This divine fellowship is between us and the Father and also between us and all the members of the Body. In our physical body there is only one circulation of the blood. Although there are hundreds of members, the circulation of the blood is one. The circulation of the blood illustrates the fellowship of Christ as our life. We are the many members of Christ&#8217;s Body, yet we have one fellowship in Christ as our life. The more we remain in Christ, the more we have this fellowship.<h2 class=head2>Maintained by the Cleansing of the Blood of Jesus</h2><p>This fellowship can be maintained by two things. On the negative side it is maintained by the cleansing of the blood of Jesus, while on the positive side it is maintained by the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Verses 5 to 7 say, &#8220;And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth; but if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.&#8221; Although sin interrupts, frustrates, and damages the fellowship, the blood of Christ deals with sin to maintain and sustain our fellowship.<p>In the typology of the Old Testament, when anyone contacted God or anything was brought to God, there was always the need of the sprinkling of the blood and the anointing. Anything that was brought into the presence of God needed to be sprinkled with the blood. Then based upon the sprinkling, it was anointed. The sprinkling typifies the cleansing of the blood of Christ, and the anointing typifies the moving and working of the Holy Spirit. Hence, the fellowship of the divine life between us and God is always maintained by the cleansing blood and by the moving, anointing Holy Spirit.<p>While we are in the divine fellowship, we are in the light. Then as we are in the light, we see how sinful and dirty we are. Spontaneously we need the cleansing of the blood. If we neglect the cleansing of the blood, our conscience will be full of accusations and offenses. However, by the cleansing of the blood our conscience is void of offense; we have a pure conscience without any accusations. Our conscience is always kept pure and without any offense not by our own self-perfection but by the cleansing of the blood of Christ. As a result, our conscience is at peace to fellowship with the Lord.<h2 class=head2>Maintained by the Anointing of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Then on the positive side, the Holy Spirit is always moving, working, and anointing within us based upon the sprinkling of the blood. Where there is the sprinkling of the blood, there is the anointing of the Holy Spirit. First John 2:27 says, &#8220;And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.&#8221; To abide in Christ is to have fellowship with Him. We are kept in this fellowship, this abiding, by the anointing, which is the moving of the Holy Spirit as the ointment within. Verse 24 of chapter three says, &#8220;And he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.&#8221; First John 4:13 continues, &#8220;In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit.&#8221;<p>The Holy Spirit anoints God Himself into us more and more. We may illustrate the anointing by painting. The Holy Spirit is the Painter, and the paint is God Himself. The Holy Spirit anoints us with God Himself as the paint. The more a painter paints something, the more paint there is on that article. In the same principle, the more the Holy Spirit anoints us, the more God Himself as our very essence is anointed into us. The more we are in the fellowship, the more we have the very essence of God anointed into us. The portion, the essence, the very element of God within us increases continuously by the anointing of the Holy Spirit.<p>The divine fellowship is maintained by the anointing of the Holy Spirit with God Himself as the very essence anointed into us. This is one of the most important matters in the entire Scriptures. We must experience this in a full way so that day by day we will be in the divine fellowship, and day by day in this fellowship God&#8217;s essence within us will constantly increase. It is by this anointing that we are saturated with God Himself in Christ. Therefore, it is by the sprinkling of the blood and by the anointing of the Holy Spirit that the fellowship in Christ as the divine life is maintained.<h2 class=head2>Remaining in the Divine Fellowship to Overcome Sin, the World, and Satan</h2><p>First John deals very much with victory over three main items: sin, the world, and Satan (5:4-5, 18). The way to overcome besetting sins, the seducing world, and the deceiving Satan is by the divine fellowship. When we are in the fellowship, it is easy to overcome all the besetting sins, put the seducing world under our feet, and overcome the subtle Satan himself. There is no other way for us to overcome these three enemies except by remaining in the divine fellowship, and the way to keep ourselves in this fellowship is by the blood of Christ and by the Holy Spirit. We should always apply the blood to counter all the accusations, and we should take care of the inner anointing. There is no need to exercise our human effort to defeat the enemies. Simply by our remaining in this fellowship, all the enemies become our footstool. We transcend them all, and we are in victory. This is on the negative side. On the positive side, if we remain in the fellowship, we spontaneously carry out the Lord&#8217;s will, fulfill His purpose, and love the brothers.<p>All the foregoing matters are the main points with the main line in 1 John. We must learn to abide in God and allow God to abide in us by the Holy Spirit. We must also learn how to have a heart that does not condemn us, by the cleansing of the blood of Jesus. Then we will be kept in the divine fellowship. On the negative side we will be victorious over all things, and on the positive side we will be able to do everything that God intends us to do.<h2 class=head1>HAVING NO FELLOWSHIP WITH THOSE WHO DENY CHRIST</h2><p>First John tells us that we have to love the brothers, but 2 John tells us that we have to be very strict with certain ones who claim to be Christians. Second John 7 says, &#8220;For many deceivers went out into the world, those who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.&#8221; This kind of person is similar to today&#8217;s modernists who proclaim that they are Christians yet do not believe that Christ is the very Son of God. Verses 8 through 11 continue, &#8220;Look to yourselves that you do not lose the things which we wrought, but that you may receive a full reward. Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice! For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works.&#8221;<p>We must love all the dear brothers in the divine fellowship, but we must be strict with certain persons. We should not even greet them because they are not in the fellowship and even oppose the fellowship. On the one hand, they claim to be Christians, but on the other hand, they do not believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who was incarnated as a man. Not only are there modernists teaching these things today, but from the very beginning of the church in the first century, before the early apostles had passed away, there was already this kind of persons. In the words of the apostle John, they do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh (v. 7). Although they claim that they are Christians, John called them deceivers and antichrists. These persons went beyond the teaching concerning Christ, as today&#8217;s modernists do, inventing something beyond the truth.<p>We need to do our best to love the unbelievers and help them to be saved, but we must be very strict with the modernists, those who claim that they are Christians yet do not believe that Christ is the very Son of God incarnated as a man, opposing this teaching and going beyond it. These are antichrists and deceivers, and they have no share in our fellowship. We should not have any fellowship with them; they are in &#8220;another world.&#8221; We should not receive such persons into our house or even greet them. To greet them is to partake of their evil deeds. This is not our attitude alone; this is the plain word of the Scriptures.<p>Recently I was invited to meet with a certain Christian group. Some there may have been real brothers and sisters, but among them, even among the leading ones, there were modernists. After I spoke with them, I realized that they were promoting a modernistic teaching, saying that whether or not people believe that Christ resurrected does not matter. I told them that this was a shame to the Lord, and I could not tolerate it for even a minute. I challenged them in this way, but they would not give up their teaching, so I could have nothing to do with them. We cannot go along with anyone who claims to be a Christian but denies that Christ is the Son of God, that He was born of a virgin, that He died on the cross for our sins, and that He was literally resurrected. The modernists do not believe these teachings. This is a shame to the Lord, which we cannot tolerate. John tells us to have nothing to do with these antichrists and deceivers.<h2 class=head1>EXTENDING HOSPITALITY AND NOT DESIRING TO BE FIRST</h2><h2 class=head2>Sending the Workers Forward in a Manner Worthy of God</h2><p>Third John tells us that we should receive the saints into our home, extending hospitality to them, because we are all in the one fellowship. Verses 5 through 8 say, &#8220;Beloved, you do faithfully in whatever you have wrought for the brothers, and this for strangers, who testified to your love before the church; whom you will do well to send forward in a manner worthy of God; for on behalf of the Name they went out, taking nothing from the Gentiles. We therefore ought to support such ones that we may become fellow workers in the truth.&#8221; We should especially take care of the Lord&#8217;s servants who live by faith, taking nothing from the Gentiles. We should never treat them as beggars, giving them a few dollars out of pity. This is not a manner worthy of God; it is a manner that is shameful to God. I have been a small servant of the Lord for many years. In many places I have seen how the Lord&#8217;s children treat His servants in a manner worthy of God. However, I have found that a servant of the Lord must learn the lesson of humility, because sometimes gifts are given in a shameful way.<h2 class=head2>Not Desiring to Be First</h2><p>This Epistle also shows us that among the believers, there are often some who want to be the head. Verses 9 and 10 say, &#8220;I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us. For this reason, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, babbling against us with evil words.&#8221; In the fellowship of the saints, we should not have the expectation to be the leader, the &#8220;ruling class.&#8221; This is wrong. The more we desire to serve the Lord, the more we must be willing to be small. Among the believers, to be big is not a glory; it is a shame. To be small is a real glory. We should never try to be great; we must always learn to be small. The economy among Christians is different from that of the worldly people. Among the worldly people, to be rich is glorious, but among the saints, to be poor is more glorious. Likewise, among the worldly people, to gain things is glorious, but among Christians, to lose things and suffer is more glorious. For this reason we must be renewed in our mind (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23).<p>We must not seek after a high rank. The highest rank is the most shameful thing, while the lowest rank is the most glorious thing. We must learn to be small and poor, and we must love suffering. We should not try to be the head or rule over others. To do this is to damage the fellowship.<p>If we put the three Epistles of John together, we will see a clear picture of the proper fellowship among the members of God&#8217;s divine family. First John gives us the principles of the divine fellowship. Second John tells us to have no fellowship with certain ones who claim to be Christians, while 3 John tells us to extend hospitality in fellowship to all the dear saints, the more the better. However, we should not try to be a leader and rule over others. If we do, we will damage the fellowship of God&#8217;s family.<h2 class=head1>CONTENDING FOR THE FAITH IN JUDE</h2><p>The short book of Jude is the last of the supplementary Epistles, dealing with the problem of apostasy in the church, the drifting away of the church from the track of God&#8217;s economy. Toward the beginning of his Epistle, Jude charges us to contend for the faith (v. 3). The faith denotes the contents of the New Testament as our faith (Acts 6:7; 1 Tim. 1:19; 3:9; 4:1; 5:8; 6:10, 21; 2 Tim. 3:8; 4:7; Titus 1:13), in which we believe for our common salvation. The faith is the New Testament inheritance substantiated to us and realized by us. This inheritance is the Triune God processed to be our portion.<p>Jude goes on to speak of the heresies of the apostates (v. 4), historical examples of the Lord&#8217;s judgment upon apostasy (vv. 5-7), and the evils of the apostates and their punishment under the Lord&#8217;s judgment (vv. 8-19).<p>Toward the end of his Epistle, Jude says, &#8220;But you, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life&#8221; (vv. 20-21). On the foundation of this holy faith and in the sphere of it, through praying in the Holy Spirit, we build ourselves up. Jude&#8217;s word concerning building up ourselves in our most holy faith is equal to Peter&#8217;s word about being built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5). To pray in the Holy Spirit, to keep ourselves in the love of God, and to await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ is to live in the Triune God. In this way the entire Blessed Trinity is employed and enjoyed by the believers.<p>Finally, Jude speaks of caring for others with mercy in fear (Jude 22-23), and he praises Him who is able to guard and set the believers before His glory (vv. 24-25).</body></html>
