   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REVEALED IN JOHN 14 Scripture Reading: John 14</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 14 seems easy to read, and there have been many expositions of this chapter in the Bible, but this chapter is difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most people are short of proper light concerning this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By the Lord s leading and our experience, we are beginning to understand the true meaning of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This chapter speaks of God s building in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The teaching of the Brethren has resulted in the mistaken consideration that John 14 is a chapter on prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Brethren consider the Lord s word in verse 3, a word spoken to His disciples before His departure from the world, to be a word of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They understand this verse to mean that the Lord Jesus was going to heaven in order to prepare a place for us and that once this place was prepared, He would come and take us to heaven so that we would be with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the Brethren determine this to be a chapter of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, the thought in this chapter is richer, deeper, and higher than the thought of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They do not see the true meaning of verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE CENTRAL THOUGHT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>BELIEVING INTO GOD,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>BELIEVING ALSO INTO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verse 1 the Lord said, Do not let your heart be troubled; believe into God, believe also into Me. This verse is the subject of the chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Chinese Union Version translates this verse as, Believe in God, believe also in Me ; however, the word in is actually into in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the correct translation should be, Believe into God, believe also into Me. The Greek word for into is the preposition eis.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This same word is used in the phrase baptized into Christ Jesus in Romans 6:3.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This preposition means to enter into.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, if we have a box, and we squeeze our hand through a hole on one side of the box, our hand enters into the box.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, into best conveys the meaning in English.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The central thought of John 14 is, Believe into God, believe also into Me. As those who believe in the Lord Jesus, we need to believe into God and believe into the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In reading the Bible it is very important that we grasp the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, Genesis 1 begins by saying, In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth ; thus, the subject of Genesis 1 is God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, John 14:1 says, Believe into God, believe also into Me. Our need to fully enter into God is the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE LORD S GOING BEING HIS COMING</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 2 the Lord said, In My Father s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 1 says, Believe into God, that is, enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 2 continues with, In My Father s house ; this is a marvelous turn.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the natural understanding, the Father s house refers to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the Bible says that the church of the living God is the house of God 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It does not say that the Father s house is heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is this Father s house, and what does the Lord s going refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The erroneous understanding of the Brethren is that the Lord s going was His leaving the world to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In John 14:3 the Lord said, If I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Chinese Union Bible translates to Myself as to the place where I am.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, people understand this verse to mean that the Lord will receive us to a place the place where He is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, He is not referring to a physical location.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord s word here means that He will receive us into Himself, not into a physical place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If I go..., I am coming is according to the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord s going is His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His going to prepare a place for the disciples was His coming to them.</S>
