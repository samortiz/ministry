   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Since the Lord's recovery has come to this country over thirty years ago, thousands of messages have been released through our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many of the saints in the recovery have received all the truths, yet they are short of the Spirit and of walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Recently we have been paying our attention to the vital groups, but according to our actual daily practice, we are not picking up God that much.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is why we need to have set times of prayer every day.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to pray in the morning and we should try to have another time of prayer during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should make a decision that upon rising up early in the morning, we would not care for anything first except going to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should also make a decision to go to the Lord in prayer at another time later in the day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a very difficult thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During our time with the Lord, we should not allow ourselves to be disturbed by the telephone or by someone coming to our door.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we were having a time with the Lord in prayer, and there was a knock on our door, would we go to answer it?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should have the attitude that when we are having such a time with the Lord, we are absent because we are fully occupied by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since we are absent and occupied by God, we do not need to answer the door or the phone at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to realize that during our time of prayer, we are busy with our God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this sense, we are not at home during this time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not be directed or controlled by the telephone or by people knocking on our door.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During our time with the Lord, we are absent from everything and busy with Him, occupied by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our lack of vitality in the Spirit is because of our lack of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Most of us have read Romans 8:4, but how many of us really practice walking according to the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We surely love Jesus and desire to exalt Jesus, but do we have our daily life according to the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to experience and enjoy Jesus, Jehovah our Savior, we must practice doing everything according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first issue of the incarnation is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jesus is our Savior, our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is not merely in heaven; He is within us as the processed, consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But do we have our daily life walking according to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In our walk, does He take the lead or do we?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Does He direct our steps or do we?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to admit that most of the time in our Christian life we are the boss.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are the ones taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Quite often in our experience, we even fired Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The virgin Mary brought forth a child and was told by God to give Him the name Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As Christians we have received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We possess Him and He is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He lives in us and He is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may even say that He is our person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But we have to admit that most of the time we do not take Him as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead we take our self as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Most of the time He is the guest within us, and we are the host.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since the day we were saved, we put Him in a position as the guest within us instead of allowing Him to make His home within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If this brief fellowship could be used by the Lord to touch us, it will revolutionize us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The realization that we should walk according to the spirit will restrict us and revolutionize our Christian life and church life.</S>
