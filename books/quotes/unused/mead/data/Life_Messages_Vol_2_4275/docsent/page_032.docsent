   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Drinking, Eating, and Breathing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have not exhausted this gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every line and every word of the book of John is part of the rich gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Just consider two short clauses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1:11 it says "He came" and in 1:16 "we all received."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The matter of His coming is an important part of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He came by way of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His coming has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What about our receiving?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is a continual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We receive by eating, drinking, and breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the way we receive Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is an organic, metabolic matter, different from the way we would receive a book that was handed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such an organic receiving strengthens, transforms, and changes us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Drinking, eating, and breathing, as the way to receive Christ into us, are all covered in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Drinking is mentioned in 4:14.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 7:37 it says further, "If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eating is covered in chapter six; for example, verse 57 says, "He who eats Me shall also live because of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then breathing comes up in 20:22, where "He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we take Christ into us by these means, we shall be receiving of the fullness of this all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to be filled with this gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we equip and arm ourselves with it, we shall all be able to teach and preach and even live out this gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the church life will be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>STRENGTHENING THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the matter of taking care of the church life, it is easy to be concerned with the kind of meeting we should have.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I would like to remind you that a particular kind of meeting in itself will not strengthen the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we feel the church meetings are weak, it is not that the way of meeting is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The lack is with the drinking, eating, and breathing of the Lord Jesus, as revealed in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let us come back to this book and learn to drink adequately, to eat richly, and to breathe prevailingly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then the church will be strong and shining.</S>
