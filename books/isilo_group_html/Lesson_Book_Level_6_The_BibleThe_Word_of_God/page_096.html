<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: This book was written by the apostle Paul to &ldquo;the saints who are in Ephesus&rdquo; (1:1) about A.D. 64, while imprisoned in Rome (3:1).</p>
<p>B. The subject: the church&mdash;the mystery of Christ, the Body of Christ, to be the fullness of Christ and become the fullness of God.</p>
<p>C. The background: [Ephesians has a specific position in the order of the books of the New Testament.] [It has been placed in the right position, immediately after the revelation concerning Christ versus religion (Galatians), followed by the practical experience of Christ (Philippians), and leading to the Head (Colossians).]</p>
<p>[In Galatians we see the matter of Christ versus religion. We should not replace Christ with anything. This means that it should not be our emotion versus religion or our practice versus religion. It must be Christ versus religion. Ephesians comes after this revelation of Christ versus religion. The matter of Christ versus religion leads us to the church. Christ is not versus religion merely for our experience. That is the improper emphasis of the so-called inner life people who seek Christ, not for the church, but for their experience. Christ is versus religion for the church. The very Christ who is versus religion is not primarily for our experience, but for the church. Galatians 2:20 says that we have been crucified with Christ and that Christ lives in us. This experience must be for the church life.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [God&rsquo;s intention in His economy is to obtain a glorious church. Strictly speaking, God is not seeking a spiritual church, a heavenly church, nor even a victorious church. He wants a church of glory. Glory is the expression of God and it is altogether different from human morality and behavior.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: Ephesians covers seven aspects of the church: the church as [the Body, the new man, the kingdom, the family, the dwelling place, the wife, and the warrior. What we do does not mean very much, but what we are means a great deal. In such a church as described in Ephesians Christ is expressed. Through such a church Christ, the Person, is lived out. In such a church there is the kingdom of God with rights and responsibilities and the family of God with life and enjoyment. This church is also God&rsquo;s dwelling place, Christ&rsquo;s satisfaction, and God&rsquo;s warrior fighting the battle for His eternal purpose.]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction (1:1-2), 2) blessings and position received by the church in Christ (1:3&mdash;3:21), 3) living and responsibility needed for the church in the Holy Spirit (4:1&mdash;6:20), and 4) conclusion (6:21-24).</p>
