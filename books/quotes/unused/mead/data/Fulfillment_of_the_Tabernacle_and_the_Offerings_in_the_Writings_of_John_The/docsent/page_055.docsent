   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRADITION NOT ABLE TO SATISFY MAN'S THIRST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What does the well of Jacob in John 4 signify?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It signifies that tradition cannot satisfy man's thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all know that water is necessary for human life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Water is even more important than food, for thirst is more serious than hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You may go without food for several days and still live, but you cannot go nearly as long without water.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Old Testament there are a number of stories that point out how crucial water is for human life Gen 21:15, 19; Exo 15:23-24, 27; 17:6; Num 20:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible the record of man's need of water to quench his thirst is found again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The well in the land of Jacob is a sign that traditional things cannot quench the thirst in human life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No matter how genuine or typical a tradition may be, as long as it is a tradition, it cannot satisfy man's thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the significance of the sign of Jacob's well in John 4.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>OUR NEED FOR A LIVING PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The sign of Jacob's well should lead us to realize our need of something other than tradition, and this is our need for a living Person, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In John 4:10 the Lord Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This gift is the Son of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Isaiah 9:6 says that a Son has been given to us, and John 3:16 says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son so that every one who believes into Him may have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this God-given gift is eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot separate eternal life from the gift of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's gift to us includes both His Son and His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These two are one gift, for the divine life is in the Son, and the Son actually is the divine life John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, 1 John 5:11 and 12 say, "God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The thirst in human life cannot be satisfied by tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our thirst can be quenched only by a living Person, the One who has been given to us to be our eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Samaritans had fallen into the error of trusting in traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Samaritan woman in John 4 was trying to get water for her living from that traditional well, and she spoke to the Lord Jesus about worship on that traditional mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Her trust was altogether in these two traditions, in the well for human living and in the mountain for the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many Christians also put their trust in traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Much of their theology, doctrines, and teachings is traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Their rituals, regulations, formalities, and holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, also are traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is an interest among some Christians in returning to the so-called historic church, that is, in returning to traditional things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christians, however, should not care for traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, we need to be renewed and refreshed by a living Person with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is never traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is always new, renewing, and refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we experience Him daily throughout our Christian life, we shall find that He is always new.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our well is not Jacob's well, a traditional well; our well is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have received Him, and He has become a spring of water welling up within us into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As He wells up within us, we are brought into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This welling up of the Lord within us quenches our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I can testify that He wells up within me again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever He wells up in me, I am brought into eternal life, and my thirst is satisfied.</S>
