   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUBBLING AND BEING BESIDE OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Group meetings in which the saints bubble are the proper church meetings and the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A group meeting is a meeting full of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In such a meeting everyone speaks and everyone bubbles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such meetings are full of activity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is doubtful that the meetings of the thousands of new believers on the day of Pentecost kept a certain sequence, with a particular brother praying, another brother calling a hymn, and a designated brother reading the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They simply bubbled, sang, and testified in their group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many times if no one instructs the saints to begin to read the Bible, to pray, or to sing, no one will do it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not need to be instructed as to what to do in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should come singing and praising.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, in many of today s meetings, if no one says, Let us read the Bible, no one opens the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That kind of meeting is still very much in the traditional way of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times our reading of the Bible in the meetings is done in a set way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is of the flesh to do something with the purpose of being different from religion, but we do not need to be the same every time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a certain verse is wonderful to us, we can read it in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If in a long list of verses we find Hebrews 10:24-25, we can say, Hallelujah for Hebrews 10:24-25! and read it before we read the other verses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then when we come to the phrase inciting to love and good works, we can say, Oh, inciting!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to incite one another!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our old way of meeting can be seen in the big meetings as well as in the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a recent conference meeting there were seventeen hundred attendants, but the meeting still kept a fixed sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the saints began coming together, no one declared the banners, read the Scripture references, or called a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes most of the attendants in a meeting are quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This quietness is like the dumbness of idols 1 Cor 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some may say that to shout Hallelujah! in the meetings is not the proper worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, God would rather that we be beside ourselves in the meetings than worship in a dead way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The quiet way of meeting is the tradition of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Traditional Christianity has influenced us to meet in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before we were saved, we already knew how to worship God in the traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even a Moslem knows how to meet in a Christian way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a Moslem becomes a Christian, he will feel that he already knows the way he should worship as a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, the many new believers on the day of Pentecost had no idea how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They knew how to meet in the Jewish way, but on that day they saw something that caused them to be beside themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They no longer cared for the Jewish things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, they met in their meetings in a bubbling way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our meetings should be full of shouting, praising, singing, and speaking in a bubbling way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the way for Christians to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we bring new believers to this kind of meeting, they will receive a proper impression of the way to meet, and they will never forget that impression.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>PRAYING, CONFESSING,</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>AND NOT QUENCHING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Young children do not need to be introduced and formally organized in order to play together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If they are simply put together for a few minutes, they will mingle together and become a lively group.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Living children play well together.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even if you charge them not to play too actively, they will still do it because they are so living.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we go to the group meetings, we also should be living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not go in oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are dead and stale, we lose our capacity to have a proper group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We were regenerated years ago, but now we need to be transformed and renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to get out of the old habit, thought, concept, and logic.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to get out of the old Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The only way to do this is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not pray superficially but from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we pray, we should also make a thorough confession of all our failures, defects, shortcomings, wrongdoings, mistakes, and transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should confess our criticizing of others, our backbiting, gossiping, and vain, idle words.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our confessing should not be once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to confess every day, several times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way we will pray ourselves into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We will be happy, rejoicing, and joyful the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We will be persons filled with the Spirit and possessed by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We will become different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not speak negatively but always speak positively.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should no longer gossip, criticize, or speak idly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should simply speak Christ, speak grace, speak mercy, speak God, and speak the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This will change the very essence of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need such a change.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I hope we would all live in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Living in this way will cause us to be Christians who meet all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even when we are not in a meeting, we will be joyful and rejoicing persons.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then when we come together with others, we will still be this way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We will be very willing to open ourselves and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We will be able to present to the saints what we have, what we are, and what we know.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we come together with others, we will take the lead to be such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then the others, especially the new ones, will follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should come together with six to eight brothers or sisters to practice this kind of group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we are not able to have this kind of meeting with one another, then we will not be able to do it with the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Instead of taking the lead to be living, we may take the lead to be dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After five minutes of dumbness we may say, Let us open up to fellowship, but no one would fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This kind of meeting is dumb, calm, and cold.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There is no warmth, no spirit, and no life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In such a meeting the Spirit is quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>First Thessalonians 5:19 says, Do not quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We quench the Holy Spirit by quenching our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Sometimes when everyone is singing Hallelujah! in the meeting, we do not join in, or we sing in a cold way.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This quenches our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We need to join in and open up.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then our spirit will be stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When our human spirit is stirred up, the Holy Spirit within us rises up, and we receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must learn not to quench our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Our spirit is our most tender part and our most excitable part.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>No other part of our being can be excited in a proper way as our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Every spiritual person must be able to be beside himself in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we are too composed, we cannot be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The Apostle Paul knew how to weep Rom 12:15; Phil 3:18 and, at the proper time, how to be joyful Phil 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>A person who is too sober-minded never laughs and never weeps.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It is difficult for the brothers to be spiritual, because they control themselves too much.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The sisters, however, do not control themselves as much.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In this sense it is easier for them to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In the four Gospels women such as Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Susanna Luke 8:2-3 were all spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Judas, on the other hand, had a very clear, sober mind, a mind that considered how much money he could gain by betraying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We must learn not to quench our spirit, and we must learn to release our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We should all learn to be females.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Then we will have the capacity to have proper group meetings.</S>
