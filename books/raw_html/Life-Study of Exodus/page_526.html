<h2 class="head2">The Precious Resurrection of Christ</h2><p>Exodus 30:23 speaks of fragrant calamus. This calamus signifies the precious resurrection of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 2:6; Col. 3:1). After we experience the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death, we are ushered into resurrection. For example, suppose a sister experiences the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death applied to her shopping. Spontaneously she will have the experience of being in resurrection. She will experience the precious resurrection of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">The Power of Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection</h2><p>The cassia in 30:24 signifies the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. In Philippians 3:10 Paul expresses the desire to know the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. In a foregoing message we pointed out that cassia functions as a repellent. It repels snakes and insects. Likewise, the power of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection also functions as a repellent. It repels the demons and all negative things.</p><h2 class="head2">The Mingling of Divinity with Humanity</h2><p>The mingling of divinity with humanity is typified by the blending of the olive oil with the four spices. We have seen that the olive oil signifies the unique God, and that the four spices signify man as the leading one in God&rsquo;s creation. Therefore, the mingling of God and man is typified by the blending of the oil and spices.</p><p>Do not listen to those who say that there is not such a thing in the Bible as the mingling of divinity with humanity. There is a clear revelation of this matter in the Word. In Exodus 30 we have a type of the mingling, but in the New Testament we have the fulfillment. The fulfillment of the type is the mingling of the divine Spirit with our regenerated human spirit. Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.&rdquo; Here we see the mingling of the Spirit with our spirit. Furthermore, 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; This proves that our spirit has been joined to, mingled with, the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">The Power for Responsibility</h2><p>The power for responsibility is also an element in the compound Spirit. I can testify that when I walk in the all-inclusive Spirit, I have the power to bear responsibility. Recently it was necessary for me to spend twenty-one hours in fellowship with certain brothers. We had six long meetings. I could not merely sit in these meetings, but I had the responsibility to lead the fellowship and direct it. My wife was very concerned that I would be exhausted. Knowing that a large conference was scheduled very soon, she encouraged me not to tire myself out. Nevertheless, I can testify that in those days I experienced the all-inclusive Spirit with the element of power for bearing responsibility.</p><p>The fact that the compound Spirit typified by the compounded ointment contains the element of power for responsibility is indicated by the five elements of the compounded ointment and the three times five hundred shekels of the four spices. In the Bible five is the number of responsibility (Matt. 25:4, 8). The number five is seen in the five elements of the compounded ointment. As we pointed out in the previous message, we see the number three signifying the Triune God, with the three units of five hundred shekels of the four spices. The middle unit is split in half and signifies the cutting of the Lord Jesus on the cross. Furthermore, the number three signifies resurrection. After the cutting, we have the calamus signifying resurrection. Therefore, here the number three signifies the Triune God in resurrection. When we experience the compound Spirit, the Triune God in resurrection becomes our portion. This is the power, the capability, for bearing responsibility.</p>
