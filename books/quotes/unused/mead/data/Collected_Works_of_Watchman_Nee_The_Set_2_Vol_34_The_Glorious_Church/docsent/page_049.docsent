   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In eternity God did not plan to have silver, because silver represents redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God knew that men would sin and need redemption, but this was not something of His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In God's work there is redemption, but in His eternal purpose there is no redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, the New Jerusalem in this respect is the same as the garden of Eden there is no silver.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that in eternity future, we will be brought to the place where there is no trace of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today, however, we cannot disregard or lightly esteem the silver.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If anyone thinks he has no need of silver today, he must ask God for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot go on without silver.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we have no silver, we have no redemption, and we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But redemption has no part in God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the New Jerusalem we will not be able to find any silver.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows us that God will wipe away all history of sin, because redemption is not included in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the New Jerusalem man will no longer need redemption, because they will sin no more.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God will bring us to such a firm ground that there will be no possibility for us to fall again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is a life within us which has nothing to do with sin and which requires no redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That life in us is from Christ and it is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As Christ Himself needs no redemption, we who have a portion of His life will no longer need redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, in eternity there is no need of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thank God that we have His redemption today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thank God that although we have sinned, the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from every sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, God has shared the life of His Son with us, a life which forever needs no redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One day we will live completely by this life and the history of sin will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Redeeming silver will no longer be of any use.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must see that the fall is not in the purpose of God, redemption is not in the purpose of God, and neither is the kingdom something in the purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fall is not in God's purpose; it is something which happened on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Redemption is not in God's purpose; it is the solution to the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And the kingdom is also not in God's purpose; it is also the solution to the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because of the fall there is redemption, and because of the fall there is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All these things are but remedies; they are not in the purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even so, we would never make light of redemption and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there was no redemption, there would be no way to solve the problem of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If there was no kingdom, could the matter of the fall be solved?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, we must bear in mind that God did not create man that he might sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God created man for His own glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This line is straight; this heavenly line is straight.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Revelation 21:21 also says, "And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A street is a place for communication, and since the street of this city is of pure gold, the people who walk upon it will never be dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today those who have bathed still need to have their feet washed John 13:10 in order to maintain their fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we walk on the street of this world, we cannot avoid gathering some dust, and our fellowship with God is thus frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in that day nothing can dirty us; nothing can frustrate our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In eternity there will be nothing which can defile us; all our life and living will be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The end of verse 21 tells us that the city is "like transparent glass."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How much of our situation today is not transparent!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But in the future, in God's presence, we will all be transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even so, today we should not have many hiding places and many veils.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not pretend to be godly before men in order to win their praise.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hypocrisy, pretense, and veils none of these are transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When our actual condition is not so good and we pretend to be good, we are not transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many times our words and our actions are quite unnatural.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We imitate others in our speaking, in our conduct, and in the way we do things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In so many ways we imitate others instead of being ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is not being transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All artificiality and imitation are not transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We certainly do not need to live before God by any self-made holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must remember that real spirituality is to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Holiness which is full of bondage is not the holiness of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All play-acting and all pretense must be abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, we need to confess many things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Among the brothers and sisters we need to learn to confess to each other and not to cover our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever we have sinned against others, we should not try to rationalize it away, but confess it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every Christian should be transparent today, for in that day, in the presence of God, we will all be transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The street in the New Jerusalem is transparent as glass.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Everything is visible there.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since it will be so in that day, we must learn today to be such people those who are real, those who are transparent, those who never act what they are not.</S>
