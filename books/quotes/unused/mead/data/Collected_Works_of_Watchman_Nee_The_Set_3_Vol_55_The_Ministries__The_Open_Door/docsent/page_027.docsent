   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am the only believer on the ship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have been here for six months already.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am lowly and weak, possessing nothing, but the God of mercy wants His grace to be perfected in a person as lowly as me.</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Truly, the gospel is not of the letter, but it is the out-flowing of life and the result of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I echo the words of Madame Guyon which you wrote to me long ago: "Just as air fills a vacuum, so also does God fill those who empty themselves."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have nothing to say but, "Praise the Lord for His great love!"</S>

   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I feel that the Lord has especially laid hold of a group of brothers there who are somewhat clear regarding the inward leading of life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Recently, the church has been greatly touched by the news that some brothers and sisters in Shanghai made absolute consecrations and that the work is spreading everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The saints here really hope that God would send an elderly servant here to edify them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They all treasure the news from Shanghai.</S>
