<p>The true meaning of the universe is a story of God and His relationship with man, and this story, this relationship, is a mystery which has two sections.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Mystery of God</h2>
<p>Colossians 2:2 says, &ldquo;The mystery of God, Christ.&rdquo; The mystery of God is manifested in Christ, so Christ is the mystery of God. To use a more colloquial expression, we could change <em>mystery</em> to <em>story.</em> God&rsquo;s entire story is in Christ. Apart from Christ, man cannot find the story of God. Verse 9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; All matters concerning God&mdash;all His stories, all the mysteries that man cannot understand&mdash;are in Christ. Christ is the mystery of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Mystery of Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:4-6 says that the mystery of Christ is the church. Christ Himself is a mystery, but all the matters concerning Christ, all the stories of Christ, and all the contents of the mystery have been placed in the church; therefore, the church is the mystery of Christ.</p>
<p>Colossians speaks of the mystery of God, and Ephesians speaks of the mystery of Christ. We need to make a distinction between these two: the mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church. Although these two are one, there are particular details concerning each. Colossians speaks of the Head, Christ, and Ephesians speaks of the Body, the church. Just as Colossians tells how Christ is the Head, Ephesians tells how the church is the Body. The head and the body must be put together before we have a complete person; this is a great mystery.</p>
<p>Christ, the Head, is the mystery of God, and all the stories of God are in Christ as the Head and related to Christ. On the other hand, the church, the Body, is the mystery of Christ, and all the stories of Christ are in the church as His Body. These are two aspects of one mystery. The mystery of God is the mystery of Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the mystery of God.</p>
<p>All the stories of God are in Christ, the Head; all the mysteries of Christ, the Head, are in the Body, the church. Thus, when we speak of the mystery of God, we are emphasizing the stories of God that are manifested in Christ, and when we speak of the mystery of Christ, we are emphasizing the stories of Christ that are manifested in the church. Christ plus the church is a great mystery. First Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: / He who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; This verse speaks forth a story of God and man, man and God. If we would know the mystery, story, and matters of God and man, man and God, then we must know Christ and the church. Christ is a mystery, and the church is a mystery. Christ is a part of the mystery, the first step of the mystery; the church is another part of the mystery, the second step of the mystery. Christ is the mystery of God, and the church is the mystery of Christ; all the stories of God are in Christ, and all the stories of Christ are in the church. Therefore, if we want to know God, we must know Christ, and if we want to know Christ, we must know the church.</p>
<p>This mysterious story began in eternity past and passed through many generations by being hidden in God Himself. God did not tell anyone; He did not even reveal it to the angels who serve before Him every day, including the archangel Michael. Even the patriarchs and prophets in the Old Testament who were closest to God did not know about it. Only at the beginning of the New Testament did God reveal the church. Thus, apart from the characteristics of being eternal, heavenly, and spiritual, the church also has the characteristic of being mysterious. The church&rsquo;s nature is mysterious because it was a mystery hidden in God. The second section of the course of the church involves its being hidden in God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
