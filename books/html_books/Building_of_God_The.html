There is the line of life, for example, from the beginning of the Scriptures to the end. There are also the lines of redemption, sin, and even the enemy of God, Satan, the devil. The building of God is a very important line in the entire Scriptures. This line, however, has been neglected today by many Christians. It is difficult to find a message in a book or given from the platform dealing with the building of God.<p>In the very beginning of the Scriptures there is the thought of life and building and the thought that life is for the building of God. The first two chapters give us a blueprint of God&#8217;s plan, and as we know, a blueprint is for building. In Genesis 2 there is the tree of life, and with the tree of life there is the flow of living water (vv. 9-10). In this flow of living water there are the precious materials for God&#8217;s building: gold, bdellium (pearl), and onyx stone (vv. 11-12).<p>At the beginning of the Scriptures there is life with the materials for the building, and at the end, the ultimate consummation and conclusion of the Scriptures, there is a building, which is signified by the holy city, the New Jerusalem. This building, with life as its center, is built with gold, pearls, and precious stones. This shows us that the Scriptures are, on the one hand, a book of life, and on the other hand, a book of the record of God&#8217;s building. In the entire Scriptures there is much concerning building, so we can say that the Scriptures are a record of building.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S CREATION AND GOD&#8217;S BUILDING</h2><p>We first need to see the difference between God&#8217;s creation and God&#8217;s building. In the sixty-six books of the Scriptures, only the first two chapters of Genesis deal with God&#8217;s creation. After His creation, God&#8217;s work is the work of building. The greater part of the Scriptures, from the third chapter to the end, deals with the building of God.<p>As we have seen, at the beginning of the Scriptures there is the garden of Eden, while at the end of the Scriptures there is a city. A garden is a natural scene, a scene of nature, but a city is different; it is a building. When God completed His creation, He had a garden, but He did not have a building. The result of creation was a garden, but that was not His satisfaction. Therefore, from that time God began to do a further work, not a work of creation but a work of building. It is only after His work through all the generations is completed that God will have not merely a garden but a building.<p>With God&#8217;s creation there is nothing of God Himself in His creatures. In His building, however, God builds up something by mingling Himself with His creation. In God&#8217;s creation He did a work with His hands, not with Himself, but in His building God works with Himself as the material. In His building God mingles Himself very much with His creation. Therefore, God&#8217;s building is a divine mingling of God Himself with man as His creature.<p>We are a part of both God&#8217;s creation and God&#8217;s building. As merely a part of God&#8217;s creation we have nothing of God within us, but as a part of God&#8217;s building we have something of God within us. If we do not have anything of God within us, we are not a part of His building; we are merely a part of His creation. What is God building? It is the building of Himself with humanity.<h2 class=head1>THE ARK SIGNIFYING CHRIST AS THE BUILDING OF GOD AND MAN</h2><p>The first building of God in the Scriptures is Noah&#8217;s ark (Gen. 6:14-16). The ark is a type of Christ the Redeemer to be the Savior to us. With Him there is redemption, deliverance, salvation, safety, and refuge. Why then was the ark a building? We realize that Noah&#8217;s ark is a type of Christ, but we may not realize why it needed to be a building. Here is a divine thought which has been neglected by many people.<p>To make a building simply means to put different materials together. Christ the Redeemer and Savior is a building. Christ is not only God but a God-man; He is God built together with man. Originally, Christ was only God. John 1:1 says that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God. However, verse 14 says that the Word became flesh. The Word as God mingled Himself with humanity. This was a building. Verse 14 says that when Christ as the Word of God was incarnated in the flesh, He tabernacled among us. The incarnated Lord is a tabernacle, a building of the divine material mingled together with the human material. In Christ is divinity and humanity. His two natures are the materials which are mingled together and built up as one. Christ as the Savior, who is God incarnated as a man, is the building, the mingling, of divinity with humanity, a building of God with man.<p>Before we were saved, we were only a creation and not a building. At most, we were part of the material for the building. However, now that we are saved, God has mingled Himself with us. He has mingled the divine nature with our human nature, making us a divine building.<p>The numbers three and five are often used in the building of the ark. The ark was three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high. Moreover, it had three stories, not two or four, with one opening for light. Three is the number of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-and five is the number of responsibility, just as we have five fingers on each hand for responsibility in doing things. Five is composed of four plus one. One signifies the one God, while four is the number of the creatures, such as the four living creatures in Revelation 4:6-8. Four plus one signifies the Creator added to the creatures to be a building. Christ is the very God mingled with creation, the &#8220;one&#8221; mingled with the &#8220;four.&#8221; As the real &#8220;five,&#8221; Christ is the God-man, God mingled with man, who bears the responsibility for us before God. Moreover, in Him as the ark there are the &#8220;three stories&#8221;-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE TABERNACLE AND THE TEMPLE SIGNIFYING THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH HIS CREATURES</h2><p>The numbers three and five occur many times also in the building of the tabernacle in Exodus (25:8-9). Many items were measured by three and five. Just as the ark had three stories, the tabernacle had three parts-the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. The width of the boards of the tabernacle was one and a half cubits; two boards matched together equaled three cubits. The height of the boards was ten cubits, divided into an upper and lower part of five cubits each, just as the Ten Commandments were written on two tablets of five commandments each.<p>There were three furnishings in the Holy Place-the showbread table, the lampstand, and the altar of incense. Likewise, three items were hidden in the ark of the testimony. There are many other occurrences of three and five in the tabernacle. Again, three signifies the Triune God, and five signifies the adding of God to His creatures. Therefore, the building of God is the mingling of God Himself with His creatures.<p>There are also many things to say about the temple (1 Kings 6:1). The temple is a full picture of the mingling of God with His creatures. Again, in the temple there is the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. These signify the three &#8220;stories&#8221; of the Triune God. When the Lord Christ came in incarnation, He said that He was the temple. On the one hand, when He became flesh, He was the tabernacle, but in John 2:19 He said, &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&#8221; His body was a temple, the house of God which the Jewish people destroyed, but the Lord rose up again after three days. This further indicates that the Lord Himself is a building.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH AS THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</h2><p>The principle of the Lord being a building is that God mingles Himself with humanity, and this is the principle of God&#8217;s building in general. Therefore, the church also is the divine mingling of God Himself with humanity. The church is not something of the old creation. It is God&#8217;s building composed of God Himself as the divine material mingled with man as the human material. In this sense, the church is a hybrid. A hybrid is a mingling of two lives and natures into one entity. The mingling of a plum and a peach, for example, is a plant hybrid. The church is a divine hybrid as the mingling of God with man.<p>We may speak much concerning the building of the church, but we must realize that the building is the mingling of God with man. The more we are mingled with God, the more we are built up together. It is impossible for us to be built up together without God. Even if we could be built in this way, that would not be the building of God; it would merely be a building of people. The church as the building of God is not a combination or composition of humans. Rather, it is a mingling of God with humanity.<h2 class=head1>THE NEW JERUSALEM AS THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION OF THE MINGLING OF DIVINITY WITH HUMANITY</h2><p>After the church, God&#8217;s building becomes the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2). Noah&#8217;s ark, the tabernacle, the temple, Christ, the church, and the New Jerusalem are all God&#8217;s building. However, these are all different aspects of one building, not many buildings. In the New Jerusalem we can find items related to Noah&#8217;s ark, to the tabernacle of Moses, and to Solomon&#8217;s temple with the old Jerusalem. We can certainly see Christ as the house and temple of God, and we can also see the church. Therefore, the New Jerusalem is the ultimate expression and consummation of God&#8217;s building.<p>The New Jerusalem contains the names of the twelve tribes of Israel and the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (vv. 12, 14). The twelve tribes of Israel are the representatives of the Old Testament saints, while the twelve apostles are the representatives of the New Testament saints. This shows us that the New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the saints in the Old and New Testament times.<p>Moreover, God is the light of the New Jerusalem, and Christ is the lamp (v. 23). God is in Christ, and out of God in Christ flows the Spirit as the river of water of life (22:1). God the Father is the light, God the Son is the lamp, and God the Spirit is the river of living water. From the throne of God and the Redeemer at the center, the Triune God flows throughout the entire city for the mingling of God with His creatures. This is the real meaning of the building of God. Therefore, the New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the redeemed ones throughout the generations with God in Christ through the Holy Spirit as the center. It is a universally great corporate man mingled with God to be a living Body and a built-up city.<p>The New Jerusalem is a full picture of the mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed creatures, the mingling of divinity with humanity. Now God is no longer merely a God outside of man. He is a God within man.<p>Besides this one building, there is not another building of God. God has only one building in the universe. Why then did the Lord speak of &#8220;many abodes&#8221; in John 14:2? In 2:16 the Lord clearly indicated that the Father&#8217;s house is the temple. What then is the Father&#8217;s house in 14:2? This verse says, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.&#8221; How can we fit this verse into God&#8217;s building? When some preach the gospel, they tell people that if they do not believe in Jesus, they will go to hell, and if they do believe, they will go to a heavenly mansion, or a heavenly hall. Should we believe that today, while God is building His church, He is also building &#8220;mansions&#8221; in heaven? Many times I have been condemned for preaching that there are no &#8220;heavenly mansions.&#8221; My intention, however, is not to preach away the heavenly mansions but to help the children of God know what the real building of God is. The real building of God is not a heavenly hall but the mingling of Himself with man, His creature.<p>Certain hymns contain the thought that God is a God in heaven and that someday we will go to heaven. Do not think that I do not believe that there is a heaven. I certainly believe that there is a heaven and that God is in the heavens, but heaven where God is now is not the eternal habitation of God. We can prove this with Revelation 21:2, which says, &#8220;And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&#8221; In eternity God will dwell in the New Jerusalem, which comes down from heaven. We may have the thought to go to heaven, but God has the thought to come down from heaven. The habitation of God in eternity is His divine building, the New Jerusalem, the mingling of divinity with humanity.<h2 class=head1>THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF THE SCRIPTURES</h2><p>We need to be adjusted in our thinking. If we trace the history of the thought concerning the &#8220;heavenly mansions,&#8221; we will find that it comes from the teaching of Roman Catholicism based on superstition. We do believe that there is a paradise prepared by God, but we must realize and remember well that the divine thought in the entire Scriptures is not that God is seeking a physical habitation. A physical habitation can never satisfy God. The central and divine thought of the Scriptures is that God is seeking a divine building as the mingling of Himself with humanity. He is seeking a living composition of living persons redeemed by and mingled with Himself.<p>After His creation, God began and is still carrying out the work of the divine building. Even today God is doing the work of the divine building, which is to mingle Himself with man. We preach the gospel not merely to win souls or save souls from hell but to minister God Himself through the Spirit to man so that God can be mingled with man. In this way we gain the materials for the divine building. Likewise, we minister Christ to the saints so that they can be mingled and built up together with Christ. This is the basic and central thought behind what we do.<p>If through my ministry I have not been able to help anyone to be mingled with Christ more and more, my ministry is a complete failure. The success of a ministry is in ministering Christ into people and helping them to mingle with Christ. Before we come under such a ministry, we may have only a little of Christ, but after we come, we gain much Christ. This ministry ministers Christ to us, helps us to grow in Christ, and mingles us with Christ all the time. This carries out the building, which is the divine mingling of God Himself with man.<p>To be mingled with God day by day is a deep, basic, and central matter. Husbands should love their wives, and wives should submit to their husbands, but for husbands merely to love their wives means little. The real love that is worthy before God is the love that is a mingling of Christ with the husbands. If Christ is mingled in the love of a person, there is the divine building. Some people say that Japanese wives are very submissive to their husbands. However, simply to submit to a husband means little. The submission of the wives should be something of Christ mingled with them. If there is something of Christ mingled with a wife&#8217;s submission, there is the divine building. Both the love of the husbands and the submission of the wives must be the mingling of Christ with man, that is, the divine building.<p>Remember well that after His work of creation, God&#8217;s work of building is to mingle Himself with man. In every spiritual experience, God must be mingled with us as the divine building. It is not sufficient to be humble or to love and submit. There must be the divine building, which is the mingling of God within. By this word we can now understand what the building of God, the house of God, and the dwelling of God are. The dwelling place of God is the mingling of God with man. This is also the building of the church. By the grace of God, may we more and more see the mingling of God with man as the real, divine building.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE HOUSE OF GOD IN JACOB&#8217;S DREAM</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gen. 28:10-22; John 1:51; 14:2-6, 20; 1 Pet. 2:5</h1><p>In the Scriptures there is first the creation of God and then the building of God. As we saw in the previous chapter, at the conclusion of the work of God&#8217;s creation there was the garden of Eden, and at the conclusion of the work of God&#8217;s building there is the holy city, the New Jerusalem. A city is very different from a garden. In a garden there is the natural scenery of the things created by God. A city, however, has the significance of building. It is not something of nature but something built up. We must remember these two pictures-a garden and a city.<p>After the completion of God&#8217;s creation in Genesis 2, there was the garden of Eden, in which God placed the man created by Him. God placed man before the tree of life because God&#8217;s intention was to build man with God by his experience of God as life (vv. 8-9). With the tree of life, there was a flowing river, and in the flow of the river there were precious materials for the building (vv. 10-12). We can see this clearly with the help of the record in the last two chapters of the Scriptures. In the last two chapters of Revelation there is a city built up with these precious materials, a city of gold, pearl, and precious stones. This reveals that after God&#8217;s creation, God intends to do another work-to build Himself into man and to build man into Himself.<p>The entire Scriptures reveal these two works of God, the work of creation and the work of building God into man and man into God. The building of God is the mingling of divinity with humanity. Therefore, at the end of the Scriptures there is a city as the building of God, and that city is the mingling of God with all the redeemed persons, including the Old Testament and New Testament saints, composed together as a container to contain God and be mingled and permeated with God. This is the mingling of God and man as the building of God.<h2 class=head1>THE HOUSE OF GOD AND THE GATE OF HEAVEN</h2><p>In Genesis 28 God reveals for the first time that He will build Himself with man by bringing heaven to earth and earth to heaven in order to join heaven and earth together. The story of Bethel in verses 10-22 is wonderful and full of the divine principles concerning God&#8217;s building. The entire Scriptures are needed to expound this brief story.<p>Before that time, man was a wanderer. When Jacob had his dream at Bethel, he was a homeless wanderer, having no rest. He even laid his head on a bare, hard stone as his pillow. If we read this portion carefully, however, we will realize that not only was man a wanderer, a homeless person, but even God Himself was homeless, having no resting place. In this situation, God gave Jacob a simple dream about a ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven. On that ladder the angels of God ascended and descended. After Jacob awoke, he said something wonderful. He said, &#8220;This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven&#8221; (v. 17). Truly, such a naughty young man as Jacob could not have said something so wonderful by himself.<p>In speaking of the gate of heaven, he indicated that heaven was open, and there was the possibility for people to enter into it. In other words, there was the possibility for people to enter into God. A ladder is a way, like a street, except it is vertical. That ladder was a vertical way between earth and heaven, that is, from man up to God and from God down to man. With this ladder, this vertical way, is the opening of heaven where God is. This signifies that there is an access for man to touch God and contact God.<p>As far as the opened heavens are concerned, this place is the gate of heaven, while as far as the very spot on the earth is concerned, it is Bethel, the house of God, the dwelling place and resting place for God. The resting place for God is not in heaven but on earth. We may want to go to heaven, but God wants to come down to earth. Matthew 6:10 says, &#8220;Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth.&#8221; God is desirous to come to earth because earth has been corrupted, usurped, and occupied in a wrong way by the enemy of God. God&#8217;s desire is to recover this earth. Today in Christianity there is a wrong concept. People often speak about a &#8220;heavenly home,&#8221; but there is not such a thing in the Scriptures. Rather, God&#8217;s intention is to have a dwelling place, a Bethel, on the earth.<h2 class=head1>THE HEAVENLY LADDER</h2><p>All the divine principles of God&#8217;s building are in this picture. The divine building is the opening of heaven to the earth so that heaven is joined to the earth and the earth is united to heaven by the heavenly ladder. To see what this ladder is, we must refer to John 1:51, which says, &#8220;And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&#8221; No doubt, this is a reference to Genesis 28. In Genesis 28 there is a ladder upon which the angels of God ascend and descend, while in John 1 this ladder is the Son of Man, upon whom the angels of God ascend and descend. Therefore, the ladder is the Lord Jesus Himself as the Son of Man, the incarnated Christ.<p>Moreover, in 14:6 the Lord said, &#8220;I am the way...; no one comes to the Father except through Me.&#8221; He is not the flat way but the vertical way by whom and through whom we come to God. As the way, He is the ladder. It is He who brings heaven to earth, and it is He who unites earth with heaven. It is He who brings God into man and man into God. He is the very way, the vertical way, to bring God and man together and to make heaven and earth one.<p>In 1:51, the Lord said that the angels of God ascend and descend not upon the Son of God but upon the Son of Man. In the first verse of this chapter the Lord is the eternal Word in eternity past as the expression of God. Then in the last verse of this chapter the Lord is the Son of Man in eternity future. How could the eternal Word become the Son of Man? It was by becoming flesh in verse 14. The eternal Word was incarnated to be the Son of Man. The Son of Man is God mingled with man, a God-man. He is a man of heaven yet on earth, a man on the earth yet still in heaven and from heaven. This wonderful Son of Man brings God and man together and makes heaven and earth one. Therefore, He is the real ladder.<p>Do not forget that John 1:51 is a reference to Genesis 28. With the heavenly ladder in Genesis 28 there was an open heaven and Bethel, the house of God on earth. This shows us that with the Lord Jesus as the heavenly, vertical way there is the opening of heaven and the house of God on the earth.<h2 class=head1>THE OIL POURED UPON THE STONE</h2><p>Genesis 28:18-19a says, &#8220;And Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head, and he set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it. And he called the name of that place Bethel.&#8221; Jacob gave the name Bethel to not only that place but to the stone. This is very significant. That stone, which was Bethel, the house of God, was the resting place of the wanderer where he could lay his head. Moreover, this resting place for man is also the very dwelling place of God. Not only the place, but the stone which had oil poured upon it, the pillow upon which man rested, is a Bethel, the house of God. Where man rests, God dwells.<p>For there to be a house of God on earth, there must be stones upon which oil is poured. In the Scriptures, oil signifies the Holy Spirit, the third of the Triune God who comes to visit man. When God is hidden in the heavens, He is the Father. No one can know the Father in Himself, and no one has ever seen the Father. When God comes out to express Himself to man and among man, He is the Son, Christ. Then when God comes upon people and into people to visit them in a subjective way, He is the Spirit. Therefore, oil is a symbol of the Triune God visiting people in a subjective way.<p>What then is the stone? To be sure, the stone is the material for the building. That is why in Jacob&#8217;s dream there was first the stone as the material and then the house of God, the building. After the oil was poured upon the stone, it became the house. Likewise, when we come to the Lord, we are living stones who are being built up as a spiritual house in the Spirit, by the Spirit, and with the Spirit (1 Pet. 2:5). We are the stones upon whom the Triune God has poured the Holy Spirit as the oil.<p>The building of God is a matter of God pouring Himself upon us as the Spirit. We are the stones, and He is the oil. When He pours Himself upon us, we with the oil become Bethel, the house of God, the temple of God in which the Spirit of God dwells.<h2 class=head1>BRINGING GOD INTO MAN AND MAN INTO GOD</h2><p>The main principle of the building of God is that God is brought into us and we are being brought into God. As we have seen, the Lord is the Son of Man as the heavenly ladder bringing God down to man and man up to God. By His incarnation He brought God to man. When He became flesh, He brought God into man. Before that time, God had never been in the flesh, but by the incarnation of the Lord, God came into man. Following this, there is a &#8220;U-turn.&#8221; After coming down with God, the Lord goes up with man. He brought God into man by incarnation, and then He brought man back into God by death and resurrection.<p>In the Gospel of John, there is the Lord&#8217;s coming and the Lord&#8217;s going. His coming was His incarnation, and His going was His death and resurrection. By His coming, He brought God into man, and by His going, He brought man into God. In John 7:33-34 the Lord told the people that He was going to a place where at that time they could not go, but after a while, in 14:2-6, He told His disciples that He would bring them to the place where He was. The place where He was is not heaven but God Himself. It is as if He was saying, &#8220;I am in the Father. The Father is the place where I am. I have brought God to you by My incarnation, but there is now the need for Me to die and resurrect. By My death and resurrection I will bring you into God. Then at that time you will be where I am.&#8221;<p>Christ is the way through which man can come not to the place of the Father but to the Father Himself. Verse 20 says, &#8220;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; These perplexing &#8220;ins&#8221; tell us that because Christ is in the Father and we are in Christ, we are in the Father. Therefore, where He is, we also are (v. 3). Before His death and resurrection, however, He had only brought God into man. Bringing man into God was accomplished by His death and resurrection.<p>Read the Gospel of John again. Then you will see the Lord&#8217;s coming and the Lord&#8217;s going. The Lord&#8217;s coming and going are the process of the divine building. The coming of the Lord brings God into us, and the going of the Lord brings us into God. By His coming and His going He mingles God with us.<p>The Lord did not speak in vain of the heavenly ladder in 1:51. The principle of the heavenly ladder is found throughout the entire book of John. This is a full picture of eternity to come. If we have the spiritual insight today, we will say, &#8220;O Lord, You are the heavenly ladder. Day by day the angels of God ascend and descend upon You. Day by day You bring something heavenly to earth and something of earth to heaven.&#8221;<p>On the day we repented and believed in the Lord, He as the heavenly ladder brought something heavenly into us, and He brought something of earth into God. The moment we received the Lord Jesus, He was the real heavenly ladder. At that time there was the opening of heaven, and there was a Bethel on the earth, the house of God as the dwelling place of God and the resting place of man. The Lord as the heavenly ladder brought God into us and brought us into God. He is the heavenly ladder to join heaven with earth and unite earth with heaven, that is, to mingle God and us, us and God, with one another.<p>This mingling is the divine building, the building of God. Throughout all the generations and unto the end of this age what God has been doing and what He still will do is to accomplish this divine building. God continually brings Himself through Christ to man, and brings man through Christ to Himself. This is the building of God.<p>Some time after the naughty Jacob had his dream, he became the father of a great house. The Old Testament speaks not of the house of Abraham or the house of Isaac but of the house of Jacob, the house of Israel. The house of Israel is the house of God. How could the house of a naughty young man become the house of God? It was by God coming to the people of his house and bringing them to God. This is the story of the people of Israel. God came to the people of Israel, and God brought the people of Israel to Himself.<p>In Exodus, God told the people of Israel to build a tabernacle. Throughout the tabernacle there is the mingling of two materials, gold and acacia wood. Gold signifies the divine nature, and acacia wood signifies the human nature. The building of God is the mingling of the divine nature with the human nature. We stress this matter so much because we need to realize that the building of the church is nothing other than the mingling of these two natures. We must have God mingled with us day by day by means of the heavenly ladder with an open heaven. This produces Bethel.<h2 class=head1>THE PRESENCE OF GOD, AN OPEN HEAVEN, BETHEL ON EARTH, AND THE HEAVENLY LADDER IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h2><p>As Christians, we have many meetings. Meetings are a part of our life. To not meet is to commit spiritual suicide. When we meet, however, how can we give people the sense, the feeling, that with us there is the opening of heaven, the vertical way from us to God and from God to us? How can we give the sense that our meeting together is Bethel, the house of God? The way is to have God mingled with us all the time. The more God is mingled with us when we come together, the more we cause people to sense the presence of God, an opened heaven, Bethel, and the vertical way as the heavenly ladder bringing God to man and man to God.<p>When people come to our meetings, they may be naughty young men like Jacob. They may simply be wanderers, but if we are mingled with God, they will sense a dream among us. They will sense the opening of heaven with a ladder and something ascending from the earth and descending from heaven. They will sense Bethel. We need to give people this sense. The wandering Jacobs who come into our meetings need to have such a dream. They should say, &#8220;What is this? Is there such a thing on the earth? I am in a dream!&#8221; They should see something different, wonderful, and strange. Eventually the naughty Jacobs will awake and say, &#8220;Here is none other than the opening of the heavens, the ladder as the vertical way for people to contact God, and Bethel, the house of God.&#8221; This is the church and the church life.<p>The church life is not merely to minister, to sing hymns, and to shout and cry out. If we are mingled with God, then even if we sit silently without praying or shouting, people will sense the presence of God. If we are not mingled with God, however, the more we shout, the more people will be disgusted. They will say, &#8220;What is this? If we want to hear shouting, it is better to go to a stadium. The shouting is better there. Why do we need to come here?&#8221;<p>Our coming together depends only on the mingling of God with us. Day by day we must realize what the real meaning is of the pouring of the oil upon the stone. We must truly know the mingling of God as the Spirit of life with us. If we have a daily life in the practical way of always experiencing the mingling with God, then whenever we come together, people will sense that they are in a wonderful dream. They could not have imagined that there is such a place on the earth. They will realize the opening of heaven and Bethel, the house of God on earth with a vertical way to bring God to man and man to God.<p>I have been to this kind of meeting many times. The first time I came to visit Brother Watchman Nee, I stayed in Shanghai. Many times in the meetings I felt that I was in a wonderful dream. The meetings were like a dream to me. I had not imagined that there could be such a fine thing on the earth. If someone had asked me how I felt at the time, I would have said, &#8220;This is the opening of heaven and the presence of the Lord!&#8221; Even when we went into the meeting hall before the meeting started, we sensed the Lord there. When we stepped into the meeting, no one dared to talk in a loose way, because the presence of the Lord caused people to be reverent. The meetings were often quiet. They started with gentle singing and silent prayers being offered, but we could sense the opening of heaven. We sensed the presence of the Lord as at Bethel. I can never forget what I experienced in those years.<p>By the sovereignty of the Lord, I was born into Christianity, and I was brought up in various Christian environments. I attended many different kinds of Christian meetings, including fundamental, Presbyterian, Baptist, Brethren, and Pentecostal meetings. Through all these experiences I can testify that the right kind of Christian meeting is not this or that but a meeting in which anyone who comes can sense the presence of the Lord, an open heaven, Bethel on the earth, and a heavenly ladder between heaven and earth, bringing God to man and man to God. This is a meeting of Christians as a building, a meeting of God and man.<p>This was a dream to Jacob as a wandering young man, but praise the Lord, this dream has become a reality! Throughout all the generations on the earth this dream has been fulfilled and will still be fulfilled. If we mean business with the Lord, we will experience the mingling of God with us. Then when we come together, we will have Bethel, which is the place with the opening of heaven, and Christ, who is the Son of Man as the heavenly ladder, the vertical way for people to contact God and for God to come to visit people to be mingled with humanity. This is the building of God. If we are going to talk about the building of the church, we must realize this. We need to have the dream of that wandering young man. Then we will have a resting place as the dwelling of God.<p>May the Lord be merciful to us for this. In these days we need to look to the Lord that He will deliver us from many different, improper concepts that we may realize the real way for Him to have a building on the earth. The real building is Bethel.<p>On the one hand, God has a church today, but on the other hand, He is still a homeless God. At the same time many people are wandering in the wilderness, restless and homeless. They need a dream. May we be faithful to see the mingling of God among us, so that we can afford them such a dream. Whenever those wandering people come among us, they must have a dream that heaven is opened to us, on this earth there is a Bethel, and between these two there is the heavenly ladder, the Son of Man, the Lord Jesus.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>LIFE AND BUILDING IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4; 10:10; 1:14; 2:19; 15:4; 14:2, 20, 23; 17:21-23</h1><p>As we have seen, God has two sections of His work according to His plan, the work of creation and the work of building. God&#8217;s creation is for His building. Creation was according to His intention to build something by mingling Himself with His creatures. The first two chapters of the sixty-six books of the Scriptures deal with God&#8217;s creation, while the third chapter to the end of the Scriptures deal with God&#8217;s building. God&#8217;s creation was completed in the first two chapters, but from the third chapter until today and into the future is the time for God&#8217;s building.<p>At the completion of God&#8217;s work of creation there was the garden of Eden, the scenery of creation, and at the completion of God&#8217;s work of building there will be a city, the New Jerusalem, which is a sign, a symbol, of God&#8217;s building. In the garden there were many created things, but there was nothing built. However, in the garden there were the materials for the building: gold, bdellium (pearl), and onyx, a precious stone. At the end of the Scriptures, these three items-gold, pearl, and precious stones-are built together in the city. The entire city of New Jerusalem is of gold, the gates are pearl, and the foundations of the wall are precious stones. All the above show us that in the whole universe, according to God&#8217;s plan, there are only two sections of the divine work: creation and building. Today we are in the period of God&#8217;s building and under the process of God&#8217;s building.<h2 class=head1>THE PRINCIPLE OF GOD&#8217;S BUILDING</h2><p>The principle of God&#8217;s building is that God builds Himself into us and builds us into Him; that is, God mingles Himself with us, divinity with humanity, as one building. To create is to bring something into existence out of nothing. Building, on the other hand, means that two things that are already here are put together. God is here, and man is here, but now there is the need of some work to bring God together with man as one and to bring so many persons together as one in God and with God. This is the work of building.<p>Now we know the principle of God&#8217;s building, and we know what God&#8217;s work is in these days, the period, the age, of building. What God always has been doing, and what He still is doing, is working Himself into us, working us into God, and bringing all of us together as one in God and through God. We may illustrate this with concrete. God is the cement, the Spirit is the water, and we are the stones. When the cement is put into the water and the stones are put into the cement, the stones are bound together by the cement and water. The result is a building of concrete.<p>God first carried out His building work by coming as the divine Person to be incarnated into humanity to build a man with God, that is, to build a God-man. In the four thousand years from the time of Adam to the time of Christ there were many millions of people, but not one of them was a building of God with man. Before the incarnation, God was God, and man was man. God and man, man and God, were never mingled as one until the day that God Himself was incarnated to be born in a manger as a man. This man was a unique man, God mingled with man, a man with God, a God-man. What God did to work Himself into man and work man into Himself was the beginning of the divine building.<h2 class=head1>LIFE BEING FOR BUILDING</h2><p>The Gospel of John deals with the matter of life. However, we must also see that this Gospel deals with the building. The apostle John wrote this Gospel, his Epistles, and the last book of the Scriptures, Revelation. At the end of Revelation there is a city with the tree of life. The city is the building, and the tree is the life. Therefore, in the New Jerusalem there are life and building. Life is for the building, and the building is of life.<p>In the Gospel of John, there is also life for the building. The Lord Jesus came that we may have life, and He came as life to us (10:10). John 1:1 and 4 say, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....In Him was life.&#8221; Moreover, verse 14 says that He was incarnated to be a man, and this very man is a tabernacle. That a tabernacle is a building shows that this very God with life in Him is for the building.<p>At the end of the first chapter of John, the Lord told Nathanael that he would see the angels of God ascending and descending upon Him as the Son of Man (v. 51). As we have seen, this refers to Jacob&#8217;s dream, which was a dream of building. In this dream there were the heavenly ladder and the open heaven. Jacob poured oil upon the stone which he had used as his pillow, and he called it a building, Bethel, the house of God. The house of God is man as the stones and the Holy Spirit as the oil poured upon him. When the Holy Spirit is poured upon us, we become Bethel, the house of God.<p>The Lord came in the flesh as a tabernacle, and He told us that He is the heavenly ladder, which is for Bethel, the house of God and the temple of God. This shows us that the Lord coming to be life to us is for the purpose of God&#8217;s building, the house of God. This is dealt with in the first chapter of John.<h2 class=head1>CHANGING DEATH INTO LIFE TO BUILD THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2><p>In the second chapter of John there are two stories, the story of how the Lord made wine out of water, and the story of how He cleansed the temple, the house of God. In verse 19 Jesus said to the Jews, &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&#8221; The Jews did not understand that the Lord spoke this about Himself as the temple. He Himself was the temple which the Jews tried to destroy, but He raised up the temple in three days, that is, by His resurrection He built up again what the Jews destroyed. Moreover, in and by His resurrection the Lord raised up and built up not only His physical body but also all the saints as the members of His mystical Body to be the temple of God, the church.<p>The first story in John 2 reveals the principle of the Lord&#8217;s coming to be life to us; it is to bring life out of death, as signified by making wine out of water. Then the second story reveals the purpose of the Lord&#8217;s coming to be life to us; it is for the building of the house of God. The way for the Lord to build up the house of God is to bring God into us and bring us into God to make us the abodes of God and to make God an abode for us, that is, to make God to dwell in us and us to dwell in Him so that God and we, we and God, become a mutual abode.<p>In the first chapter of John we have the Lord as the Word of God, God Himself, in whom is life. This very Lord was incarnated as a man; He called Himself the Son of Man. As the Son of Man, He is the heavenly ladder for Bethel, the house of God. Then the second chapter shows us that the Lord comes to be life to us, to bring life out of death, signified by the wine and the water, for the purpose of building up His mystical Body as the house of God. He accomplishes this by bringing God into man and man into God.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST ACCOMPLISHING THE BUILDING BY INCARNATION, DEATH, AND RESURRECTION</h2><p>In the entire Scriptures, it is mostly John&#8217;s books, his Gospel and his Epistles, that say that we are in God and He is in us; that is, we abide in God and He abides in us. John 15:4, for example, says, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you.&#8221; This mutual abiding is accomplished by the work of Christ. Christ was incarnated to bring God into man, and He went back to God with man. When Christ came, he came with God to man. He came with a gift, a present, which is God Himself. Then He went to God with a present for God, which is man. He came with God by incarnation, and He went with man by death and resurrection. His coming brought God into man, and His going brought man into God. By this coming and going He builds up the house of God by building God into man and man into God. By His coming and going He makes man the abode for God and makes God the abode for man. In this way, God and man, man and God, become a mutual abode. Then in the consummation of John&#8217;s writings there is a building, the New Jerusalem, which is built up with God mingled with man.<p>In John 1 through 13 we do not have the phrases, &#8220;You in Me and I in you&#8221; or &#8220;I in the Father and the Father in Me.&#8221; However, verse 20 of chapter fourteen says, &#8220;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; This refers to the building, which is accomplished first by His coming in incarnation to bring God into man and then by His going through death and resurrection to bring man into God. Without His death and resurrection we humans would be far away from God. Between us and God there would be a great distance, a great separation, comprised of the world, Satan, the flesh, lust, and other matters. But by His death and resurrection, Christ eliminated the distance and prepared the way to bring us near to God and into God. He is the way through whom we go to God. He takes away the distance, that is, He takes away sin, the world, lust, the flesh, and even the enemy, Satan. He takes away even death. He takes away everything that is a barrier or hindrance between us and God to bring us near to God and into God.<p>Now after His resurrection, He can say not only that He is in God and God is in Him but that we also are in Him and He is in us. By Christ, through Christ, and in Christ we are in God. This is the building of God mingled with humanity, which Christ accomplished by His death and resurrection.<h2 class=head1>THE FATHER&#8217;S HOUSE WITH MANY ABODES</h2><p>In this light, we can realize what &#8220;My Father&#8217;s house&#8221; with many abodes is in 14:2. This house is not a heavenly mansion. Rather, the Father&#8217;s house is the mystical Body of Christ with many members, and each member is an abode. Verse 23 also speaks of an abode. This verse says, &#8220;Jesus answered and said to him, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; Every believer, every regenerated and saved person, is a member of the mystical Body of Christ and an abode in the Father&#8217;s house, the Body.<p>In order to understand the first part of chapter fourteen, we need to take the context of the entire book of John. We cannot cut out the first two verses and interpret the abodes as &#8220;heavenly mansions.&#8221; By the context of the whole book, we can know the correct meaning of these verses. The Lord is not building a heavenly &#8220;hall.&#8221; He is building the mystical Body as the house of God with the many members as the many abodes.<p>We are some of those many abodes. The Lord has brought God into us and us into God to make God one with us and us one with God, to build God into us and to build us into God. This is why the writings of the apostle John often speak of us abiding in God and God abiding in us, or of us being in God and God being in us. It is also in the writings of this writer that we have the holy city as the building of God with the Triune God as its center and life supply. If we take all the works of this writer, we can find the correct meaning of his writings, which is life for the building.<h2 class=head1>ABIDING IN THE TRIUNE GOD AND DENYING OURSELVES TO KEEP THE ONENESS OF THE BUILDING</h2><p>We can never have the real building of the church without the proper, adequate experience of life. If we abide in Christ and let Christ abide in us, we will realize the building of the church. Life is for the building, and the building is of life. We must say, &#8220;Today I am in the Lord, and He is in me. Moreover, I am abiding in the Lord, and He is abiding in me.&#8221; While we say this, however, we should remember that He is the vine and we are one of the branches. Not only do we have something to do with the vine, but we also have something to do with the branches. We are built not only with the Lord, but with the Lord and all the members.<p>A vine has many branches, yet all the branches are one vine; they are not separated. When they are cut off the vine, they are many separated branches, but when they abide in the vine, they are all one in the vine. If we say that we are abiding in the Lord, we must check whether or not we are one with the other members. If we are not one with the other members, it is doubtful that we are abiding in the Lord. To be sure, in order to abide in the Lord, we must be one with all the other members. When the branches all abide in the Lord, all the branches are one in the vine. This is the reality of the building.<p>In all the New Testament, John 17 is the unique chapter that deals with the oneness of the church, the Body of Christ. In this chapter, the Lord prays several times that we may be one. According to verses 21-23, it is possible for us to be one only in the Triune God. When we are in the Triune God, we are one, but when we are out of the Triune God, we are separated. To be sure, when you are in God and I am in God, you and I are one, but when we are out of God, we are separated. We can never be one in ourselves. We can be one only in God, in the Lord, and in the Spirit. This is the way to have the building.<p>I can testify of these things through many experiences. Three brothers-a Cantonese brother, a Mandarin brother, and a modern American brother-cannot always be one; they are three different persons. Many times, however, they are one, not in being Cantonese, Mandarin, or American, but in God. At other times a brother may be stubborn in his peculiar mentality; then the other brothers are frightened of him. They simply cannot get through with him. We may all have had such experiences with the saints. Sometimes I have met some dear brothers who were stubborn, seemingly without sense and logic. At such times I wished for the stubborn brother to be broken so that we could be one in Christ. If someone is too much in himself, we cannot be one with him. Even if we pray together, we may fight. One brother may pray, and afterward another brother may pray something contrary to the first one. If everyone is in himself, and no one is in Christ, living and abiding in the Lord, there is no oneness. Rather, there is separation and individuality.<p>When we deny ourselves, we are in the Spirit, and when another brother denies himself, he is in the same Spirit. Then wonderfully and spontaneously we are one in the Lord. The Mandarin, the Cantonese, and the American all recognize that they have been put on the cross, and they all realize that they are in the resurrection of the Lord. We are in the resurrection, the resurrected Lord is in us, and we have Him as our life. We realize this fact and stand on it, denying ourselves. Then how wonderful it is! We are one in the resurrection life and in the resurrected Lord. We are built together, not by teachings or doctrine but by the death and resurrection of the Lord. In the death and resurrection of the Lord, we are built up together as one in the Lord Himself. There is no other way for us to realize the real building of the church.<p>This is why whenever we meet with the saints as the church, we must not insist on anything. This means that we must put ourselves aside and put ourselves away. We must forget about ourselves. If we all do this, the issue will be that we are all in the resurrection of the Lord, we are all in the Spirit, and we are all one in the Lord. Then the Lord will come out, not according to you, me, or anyone else, but according to Himself, the crucified and resurrected Lord. We have been put on the cross, and now it is the Lord who lives within us. This is the only way for the Lord to build up the church. There is no other way. It is not by discussion or by teaching. The more teachings we have, the more divisions we have, and the more discussions we have, the more opinions and the more divisions we have. The oneness of the divine building is possible only by our experience of the death and resurrection of the Lord. It is the cross and the resurrected Christ that bring us into God and bring God into us. It is by this death and resurrection that the Lord builds God and us in one another. This is the building of God.<p>As we shall see, the writers of the Acts and the Epistles also show us something concerning the building. Many times what they say is that the building is in spirit. It is in spirit and through the Spirit that we are built together as one in the Lord.<p>The divine building is the one Body, the one church, the one Bethel, the one corporate testimony of the Lord Himself. Eventually, there is the New Jerusalem as the completion. The New Jerusalem is not a physical place but a living composition of all of the living, redeemed ones in God, through the Spirit, having Christ as their life.<p>May the Lord reveal more and more to us concerning this building. I leave you with these two words: life and building. Life is for the building, and the building is of life. Life is the Lord Himself, and the building is the issue of the experience of the Lord as life. The more we experience the Lord as life, the more we realize the divine building among us.<p>Here I can give you only a brief hint concerning these matters. If you spend more time in considering these things, you will be very clear that after God&#8217;s creation, His intention is to work Himself into man and to work man into Himself to make man His abode and to make Himself man&#8217;s abode. The way for God to accomplish this is by the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Christ. By incarnation He came to impart Himself to man, and by His death and resurrection He went back to God to bring man into Himself. Now we can say that God is in us and we are in God, and we are abiding in God and God is abiding in us. We are one with God, and God is one with us. Now we and God, God and we, are a mutual abode for one another. As long as we realize that we have been crucified on the cross, and we realize the resurrection of the Lord, then we are in the spirit, and we are one with one another in the Lord as one corporate Body. This is the building of God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE BUILDING IN THE TEACHINGS OF THE EPISTLES</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 3:12; Eph. 4:13-16; Col. 2:19; 1 Pet. 2:4-5; Heb. 11:10, 16, 40; 12:22-24</h1><p>The building of God is a divine mingling of God Himself with man. From the entire Scriptures we can realize that after God&#8217;s creation, God&#8217;s intention is to work Himself into humanity and to work humanity into divinity. After God&#8217;s creation, what God has always been doing is to build Himself with man and to build man with Himself.<h2 class=head1>THE DIVINE ISSUE OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><p>If we pay our full attention to the record of the Gospel of John, we will realize that this Gospel is a matter not only of life but also of building. Life is for the building, and the building is of the divine life. Therefore, in this Gospel the divine issue is that we abide in the Lord and the Lord abides in us; we become the abode of the Lord, and the Lord becomes an abode for us. The Lord and we, we and the Lord, become the mutual abode of God and man. In the Scriptures we have such a sentence: &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you&#8221; (15:4). This is a short sentence, a small word, yet its meaning is very profound. Such a word could never be spoken in the Old Testament. This word could be spoken only after the Lord was incarnated as a man, crucified on the cross, resurrected, and transfigured into the Spirit. By His incarnation Christ brought God into man, and by His death and resurrection He brought man into God. In other words, by His incarnation He worked God into man, and by his death and resurrection he worked man into God.<p>In John 14:20 the Lord said, &#8220;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; That day was the day of resurrection. After that day, the disciples could abide in the Lord, and He could abide in them. Christ could come to them with the Father to make an abode with them. This is the eventual issue of Christ being life to us. The issue, the result, of the Lord coming to be life to us is that we become the abode of the Lord, and the Lord becomes the abode for us. This means that the Lord and we, we and the Lord, are built together as a divine building to be the mutual abode of God and man. We and God, God and we, mutually abide in one another. This is the building of God. It is something mysterious, yet very real and wonderful.<h2 class=head1>BUILDING WITH GOLD, SILVER, AND PRECIOUS STONES</h2><p>The central thought of all the Epistles is the divine building, the building of God with man. What the apostle Paul did was simply a work of building. Paul uses the word building many times. Regrettably, certain English translations use the words edify or edification instead of build or building, so many people understand this word improperly. What the apostle Paul did was simply to build people with gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12).<h2 class=head2>Building the Believers with the Triune God</h2><p>Gold, silver, and precious stones are not two items or four but three, because they correspond to the three of the Triune God. Gold signifies the divine nature; this is related to God the Father as the source and nature. Silver, the second item of the precious materials, is related to the work and person of the second of the Triune God. It signifies the redeeming work of God the Son. Because we were fallen people, we needed the redemption of Christ. The third item, the precious stones, signifies the transforming work of the Holy Spirit, the third of the Triune God. By the redemption of the Son of God we have received the nature of God. From this time on we are in the process of transformation by the Holy Spirit through all our environment and circumstances to be transformed from pieces of clay into precious stones. This is the work of the transforming Holy Spirit.<p>Here, therefore, we have God the Father as the source, the nature, signified by gold; we have God the Son with His work and person as silver; and we have God the Spirit, doing the work of transforming us from clay into precious stones. These are the three aspects of the work of the three persons of the Triune God.<p>With a building there is always the need of material. With what kind of material do we build up the believers? It is with none other than God the Father as the gold, God the Son as the silver, and God the Spirit as the precious stones. In other words, we build up the believers with the Triune God.<h2 class=head2>The Need of Redemption and Regeneration</h2><p>First Corinthians 3:12 says that silver is the second of the precious materials, but in Genesis 2:12 and Revelation 21:21 the second material is not silver but pearl, or bdellium. Pearl signifies regeneration. It is something produced, not created but generated. When a small grain of sand wounds an oyster and stays in the wound, a pearl is &#8220;regenerated&#8221; by the secretion from the oyster. In this way a grain of sand becomes a pearl. We are the grains of sand that wounded Christ and stayed in His wound. The divine life-juice of Christ continually secretes on us, causing us to become pearls.<p>With pearls there is no thought of redemption but only regeneration, which is the original thought of God. The original, eternal thought of God was not related to redemption. It was that we as created beings would be regenerated. In the process, however, sin came in and we became fallen. Now we need to be not only regenerated but also redeemed. The Lord Jesus needed to die not only so that we may have His life but in order to redeem us from sins. Therefore, at the time the Epistles were written, there was the need of redemption. That is why in 1 Corinthians 3 there is silver instead of pearl. Eventually, we are not only redeemed but also regenerated through redemption; that is, we have the silver, but we eventually become pearl. After we are redeemed, God accomplishes His eternal thought by regenerating us in His redemption.<h2 class=head2>Being Built with the Triune God to Be Full of God</h2><p>The material with which we build up the believers and the church is the Triune God-God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. God&#8217;s intention is to make Himself everything to us, to become our very nature to make us the embodiment of God Himself. The entire city of New Jerusalem is gold, signifying that it is full of God. Within the church, within the believers, there should be nothing but God Himself. God works Himself into each one of us as our everything. In this way we have the nature of God as the gold. We are regenerated in the redemption of Christ and transformed by the transforming work of the Holy Spirit to have the nature of God as the gold, the work and person of Christ as the pearl, and the work of the Holy Spirit as the precious stones. In this way we are built up with the Triune God-with God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>HOLDING THE HEAD AND GROWING WITH THE GROWTH OF GOD</h2><p>Any teaching in the church which is not in this line and for this very purpose, regardless of how scriptural it is, is a wind of teaching blowing people away from Christ and His Body (Eph. 4:14). The proper teaching for the building up of the church brings people into the Triune God to build the Triune God into people. According to Ephesians 4:13-16, the proper way to build up the Body is to realize the Head, Christ, and to have the Body life, the church life. In this way all the members are built up with the Triune God to function in, through, and with the Triune God. Then the whole church becomes a mingling, a building, of the Triune God with the saved and redeemed persons.<p>We should read all the Epistles again. In principle, all the Epistles without exception speak of building the believers as the church with the Triune God as the material. To build the believers is not merely to bring them back to the Lord, to make them right with the Lord. This is not good enough. To build up the believers is to impart and minister Christ into the believers, to work Christ more and more into them.<p>This can be seen in Colossians 2:19. Such a verse could not have come from the human mind. It says, &#8220;Holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God.&#8221; The Head is Christ, the second of the Triune God, the redeeming One; the joints are for the rich supply; and the sinews are for knitting together. We should pay our full attention to the phrase &#8220;grows with the growth of God.&#8221; When we hold Christ, the whole Body grows with the growth of God. Day by day continually God must grow within us. The element, the essence, of God must increase within us.<h2 class=head1>BUILDING BY IMPARTING AND MINISTERING CHRIST</h2><p>To build up the church and the believers is simply to impart, to minister, Christ to them. It is not merely to teach them to love others or to be humble. If this were all there is to Christianity, the Chinese people would not need it. The teachings of Confucius were better than this. Confucius taught two thousand five hundred years ago to love others and be humble. We do not need a Christianity that is a religion of teaching, teaching people to be good. The reality of Christianity is Christ Himself ministered to people and imparting Himself to people. The true Christian teaching is not to teach people to do this or not to do that; it is to minister Christ to people.<p>The Epistles of the New Testament are books that are full of the ministry of Christ; they minister Christ to people. When Christ is ministered to us, He is our love, humility, and patience toward others; He is our everything. It is not merely a matter of love; it is Christ as love. Likewise, it is not merely a matter of patience; it is Christ experienced by us becoming our patience. It is not a matter of good. Good is not of the tree of life; it is of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Therefore, the proper way to build up the believers and build up the church is not by teachings or by anything else, but by the Triune God. Do our teachings minister Christ to others? Do our gifts minister Christ to others? This is a big problem.<p>The apostle Paul spoke much about the building of God with the Triune God as the building materials. The apostle Peter did the same thing. He told us that the Lord is the living stone and that we also are living stones being built up together in the Lord to be a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:4-5). Similarly, the apostle John spoke about abiding in the Lord and the Lord abiding in us. The real meaning of abiding is the mingling, the building.<p>When we go to help a brother or sister, in what way will we help them? We must realize that to help the saints is to build, and in order to build there is the need of materials. The materials for the divine building are nothing other than the Triune God. Therefore, we must first experience the Triune God ourselves. We must experience God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. In this way we will have the materials in our own experience. Then when we go to visit and fellowship with the saints, we will know what to minister and with what we should minister. We will realize that the only way to minister to others is by the Triune God and with the Triune God. To build is to minister Christ as the Spirit to others so that they can be built with Christ. We must be very clear about this.<p>For nearly two thousand years there have been many teachings in Christianity. By the mercy and sovereignty of God, I have encountered many different kinds of Christianity. I was born in Christianity, raised in Christianity, and was taught in Christianity, and I became disgusted with Christianity. I saw one kind of Christianity that was a religion of heresy. I was in another kind of Christianity that was a religion of sound teaching. However, after so many years I was never built because nothing of God was wrought into me. Rather, I was just given teachings, such as the seventy weeks in Daniel 9, that are composed of seven weeks, sixty-two weeks, and the last week, which is divided into two parts of forty-two months. We calculated the number of years, months, and days. This was the way I was taught. I also learned much about the image in Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s dream, which had a golden head, silver breast and arms, bronze abdomen and thighs, iron legs, feet of clay and iron, and ten toes. I learned that this represents Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire, and that the ten toes are ten kingdoms. I grew sick of all these teachings. There was nothing of God and Christ ministered to us.<p>The proper way to build up the Body of Christ, which was taken by the apostles, is to build the Body with Christ, by Christ, and in Christ, having Christ as everything. The way to build is to minister Christ into people. Then these people decrease, and the Lord Christ increases. He is enlarged to become everything, and we become nothing. This is to grow with the growth of God. I love the term the growth of God. How much has God grown within us; how much growth of God is there among us as the church? It is not a matter of teachings or gifts; it is a matter of God Himself.<p>I appreciate Hymns, #513, written by A. B. Simpson, the founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. Stanza 1 says, &#8220;Once His gift I wanted,/Now, the Giver own;/Once I sought for healing,/Now Himself alone.&#8221; The Healer is different from the healing. We may have healing, but we may not have the Healer. As long as we have the Healer, we have everything. Likewise, to have the gift is superficial, but to have the Giver is something deep and solid. As long as we have the Giver, we do not need to worry about the gift, just as when Rebecca came to Isaac, she inherited everything that he inherited. We need to realize that we build up the believers and the church not by anything other than the Triune God Himself.<h2 class=head1>THE NEW JERUSALEM AS THE EMBODIMENT OF ALL THAT CHRIST IS</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate conclusion of the entire Scriptures. In the Gospel of John we see the Lord Jesus as many items. He was recommended by John the Baptist as the Lamb of God and as the Bridegroom. He is also the light, the life, the way, and everything. The New Jerusalem is the all-inclusive embodiment of Christ as everything. In the New Jerusalem Christ is the Lamb, and He is the Bridegroom to marry the New Jerusalem as the bride. In the New Jerusalem Christ is also the light, the life, the way, and the truth, the reality. The New Jerusalem is the embodiment of all that Christ is.<p>If we read the Gospel of John again, we can find many items that Christ is. Then when we come to the New Jerusalem, we can find all these items there. Everything that the Lord is, is in the New Jerusalem. Every item of the Lord in the Gospel of John is in the New Jerusalem as the all-inclusive embodiment of what the Lord Jesus is. This means that all that the Lord is has been wrought and built into the redeemed people and mingled with them as one. The ultimate picture in the record of the entire holy Scriptures is a building as the embodiment of all that Christ is. This is the building of God.<p>Hebrews 11:10, 16 and 12:22 speak of the New Jerusalem. The Old Testament saints, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, expected to share in the heavenly city, the New Jerusalem, the city which has the foundations. This heavenly city with the foundations is not a physical place. It is a building, a living composition, of all the redeemed ones composed together in God, through Christ, and with the Holy Spirit.<p>Hebrews 11:40 says, &#8220;Because God has provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.&#8221; This is a wonderful verse! If the heavenly city were a physical place, objective and outside of the redeemed ones and only to be expected by the redeemed ones, the Holy Spirit would not have said in this verse that we, the New Testament saints, are a perfection to the Old Testament saints. Without the New Testament saints the Old Testament saints could never be perfected. The Old Testament saints can be compared to a body; without legs, arms, and hands it could not be a perfect body. The upper part of the body needs the lower part as a perfection. The saints of the Old Testament time are merely a part of the holy city. Without the New Testament saints the holy city could never be perfected. The Old Testament part needs the New Testament part as a perfection. By this verse we can realize that the holy city is not a physical place beside or outside of the redeemed ones. Rather, the redeemed ones are the composition of this holy city, and this holy city is the composition of all the redeemed ones.<p>Hebrews 12:22-23 says, &#8220;But you have come forward to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem; and to myriads of angels, to the universal gathering; and to the church of the firstborn, who have been enrolled in the heavens; and to God, the Judge of all; and to the spirits of righteous men who have been made perfect.&#8221; The church of the firstborn is the composition of the New Testament saints, who have been enrolled in the heavens. They are not in heaven; they are simply enrolled in the heavens. The righteous men are the Old Testament saints. Verse 24 continues, &#8220;And to Jesus, the Mediator of a new covenant; and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks something better than that of Abel.&#8221;<p>These verses speak of coming forward to eight items. Some may argue that since the heavenly Jerusalem is the second item, the New Testament saints as the church are the fourth item, and the Old Testament saints, the righteous men, are the sixth item, the New Jerusalem must be something other than the saints. If we read these verses carefully, however, we can realize that these items are the &#8220;bricks&#8221; of the same building. For example, the Lord Jesus is the seventh item, and the blood of the Lord Jesus is the eighth; the blood is something of the Lord Jesus. In the same principle, the New Testament saints and the Old Testament saints are &#8220;bricks&#8221; of the holy city, New Jerusalem, which includes Mount Zion.<p>Therefore, the New Jerusalem is not a physical place, but a personal composition of all the saints redeemed by God and built up together with God and in God as a dwelling place for the satisfaction and rest of God. This is proven by Revelation 21, which says that the New Jerusalem is a composition with the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel and the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (vv. 12, 14). It is a composition of all the redeemed ones built up together in God and with God to be the building of God. In this building, God is the satisfaction to the redeemed ones, and they are the satisfaction to God. This building is the mutual rest and satisfaction for God and man.</body></html>
