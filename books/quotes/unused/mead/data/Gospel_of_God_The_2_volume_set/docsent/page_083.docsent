   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At the same time, we must also differentiate between ourselves and our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 5:8 says, "While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But 1 Corinthians 15:3 says that "Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be "for us" is a preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But to be "for our sins" is a kind of realization.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even if a person is not yet saved, he can still preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But he can only say that God sent His Son to die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But only those who have been saved can say that God sent His Son to die for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is because our relationship with the Lord Jesus is in the matter of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, we can say that the Lord Jesus died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Peter 2:24 says, "Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is a distinction here.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To a sinner, we can only say that the Lord Jesus died for him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We cannot say that the Lord Jesus died for his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It will help you to understand if I illustrate this by a simple example.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose I have borrowed some money, but have no way to repay.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A brother knows that my account number in the Shanghai Bank is No. 51.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose he deposits a sum of money into account No. 51.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then he writes a letter to me telling me that he has deposited a sum of money in the bank for me and that I can now repay my debt.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He has paid the money and has sacrificed himself to prepare the money for me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But let me ask, Has my debt been cleared yet?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I can pay back the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The money is in the bank.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the debt is not paid yet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is only when I go personally to the bank and withdraw the money and pay back the debt that I can say that this brother has paid the debt for me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the same way, the Lord Jesus has died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This death was prepared for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But it is only when we receive the Lord Jesus that we can say that He died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, brother, when you quote 1 John 2:2, you must be careful about the wording.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jesus Christ has become a propitiation for our sins, and not for us only, but also for the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You can see how accurate the Holy Spirit is in choosing the words through His apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the death of the Lord Jesus was not only for us, but for the whole world, so that the whole world may receive this death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One has to be careful here.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not add the words the sins of to "the whole world."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is unfortunate that many have not seen this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot add anything to the word of God, nor can we subtract anything from it Rev 22:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Finally, there is still one thing that we have to take note of.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is the difference between sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We cannot say that the Lord Jesus died for the sins of the whole world, for sins means all the wrongdoings and all the punishment that we need to bear.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the Lord Jesus died for the sins of the whole world, then all the wrongdoings of all the world were removed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whether a man believes or not, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the Bible is very careful in the use of words.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It only says the sin of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It does not say the sins of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>John 1:29 says, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The word "sin" is singular.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The problem of sin is brought into the world through one man and brought out of the world through one man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What is mentioned here is the "abstract" dealing of the problem of sin by the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Objectively speaking, sin entered the world in an "abstract" way through Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today the Lord Jesus is taking away and dealing with the problem of sin in an "abstract" way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This does not mean that He has borne the guilt of each individual sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If He has borne the guilt of each individual wrongdoing, then the whole world would have been saved already.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thank and praise the Lord that the Word of God does not have any loophole.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It never makes a mistake.</S>
