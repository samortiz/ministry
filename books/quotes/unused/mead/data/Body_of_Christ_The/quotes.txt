[1]  CONTENTS The Issue of the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity A Masterpiece as the New Man Supplied with the Riches of Christ unto All the
[2]  Fullness of God The One Body Built Up by the One Ministry Children of Light to Be the Bride of Christ PREFACE
[3]  Our burden in this book is to share that the New Testament revelation shows us a clear picture of how the church as the collection of all the believers is not an organization, but the Body of Christ, which is an organism.
[4]  When He redeemed us, He also made us an inheritance of God for God's enjoyment vv.
[5]  We are one with Christ in His divine life to be God's inheritance so that God can enjoy us as His enjoyment.
[6]  The issue that flows out of the dispensing of the divine Trinity is the church as the Body of Christ Eph 1:17-23 .
[7]  We, the members of Christ, have been transfused with the great power of God, which raised Christ from among the dead, seated Him in the heavenlies, subjected all things under Him, and gave Him to be the Head over all things vv.
[8]  We have to see that the church as the Body of Christ is an organism.
[9]  CHAPTER TWO A MASTERPIECE AS THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Eph 2:4-22 THE CHURCH BEING AN ORGANISM,
[10]  Every aspect of the church must be organic because the church is the issue of the living Trinity.
[11]  The Bible tells us that the embodiment of God, Christ, is life.
[12]  THE CHURCH BEING A MASTERPIECE AS THE NEW MAN What We Were and Where We Were
[13]  In all the local churches, there are some local affairs.
[14]  God desires to have a Body prepared for Christ to be the full expression of the Triune God.
[15]  Ephesians 3 is a chapter on the distribution of the riches of Christ.
[16]  God has a plan to distribute the unsearchable and untraceable riches of Christ.
[17]  The riches of Christ are firstly what Christ is to us.
[18]  God's plan as a mystery hidden in Christ was to distribute all His riches stored in Christ as His very embodiment into His chosen and redeemed people in order to make the church the very fullness of God, the expression of God.
[19]  The apostles' stewardship is to distribute to His chosen people what Christ is, what Christ has done, what Christ is doing, what Christ will do, and what Christ has attained and obtained.
[20]  Christ making His home deep down in our hearts is an organic matter full of life and has nothing to do with any kind of organization.
[21]  As Christ makes His home in our inward parts, we are filled with His untraceable riches resulting in all the fullness of the Triune God the Body of Christ as the full expression of the Triune God v. 19b .
[22]  From Paul's prayer we are strengthened; from being strengthened we proceed to Christ's making His home in our hearts; and from this we progress to apprehending the dimensions of Christ and knowing the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ until we are finally filled unto all the fullness of God.
[23]  The Apostle Paul prayed that the saints would experience Christ in all of His riches for the building up of His Body.
[24]  In Ephesians 3, he prayed that the Father would grant these members of the Body of Christ to be strengthened through the Spirit into their inner man v. 16 . The inner man is our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God to become a mingled spirit.
[25]  We need to explore the universally extensive field of the Christ whom we are in. When we apprehend the extensiveness of this universal Christ, we are led to know the knowledge-surpassing and unlimited love of Christ that we may be filled with the extensive Christ unto all the fullness of the Triune God v. 19 , which is the church as the Body of Christ.
[26]  The Body of Christ is one unique Body with one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father of all Eph 4:3-6 .
[27]  LIVING A LIFE THAT CAN CARRY OUT THE WORK
[28]  Verses 17-32 of Ephesians 4 is another section showing us how to build up the Body of Christ by the growth in Christ.
[29]  Verse 15 says that we need to grow up into Christ in all things, and then the rest of chapter four unveils the details of this growth in Christ to have a life that is suitable and adequate for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[30]  When we walk according to the life of God within us, we do not have a hardened heart, we are not in darkness, we care for the consciousness of our conscience, and we would not give place to the Devil v. 27 . We also need to walk in truth, that is, in the reality as it is in Jesus v. 21 . God is the truth, the reality.
[31]  In the previous chapter, we saw from Ephesians 4 that the church is one unique Body which is built up by the one New Testament ministry.
[32]  To live such a life we must realize that through baptism we have put away our old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the personified deceit, Satan himself Eph 4:22 , and that we have also put on the new man which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the personified truth, the Triune God Himself v. 24 . We need to be daily and continually renewed in the spirit of the mind, the wonderful mingled spirit which fills, occupies, and directs our mind v. 23 . Daily and hourly we should be under this renewing, that we might be transformed to be the proper materials for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[33]  Ephesians 4 also shows us that such a life requires that we no longer walk in vanity v. 17 and that we give no place to the evil one, the Devil v. 27 . We also should never grieve the Holy Spirit, who fills us and is continuously sealing us, making us full of the very nature of God and causing us to bear the very likeness of the One whom we love and to whom we belong v. 30 . Such a life is always willing to forgive others, to forget others' trespasses or offenses toward us, just as our Father God in Christ has forgiven and forgotten our offenses v. 32 . Such a life qualifies us and enables us to participate in the building up of the organism of the Body of Christ.
[34]  According to Ephesians 4, we need grace and truth for the life that qualifies us to participate in the building up of the Body of Christ.
[35]  As light in the Lord, we should walk as children of light Eph 5:8 .
[36]  God is light, and when we are in Him, we are in light.
[37]  The children of light should walk, not as unwise but as wise, redeeming the time because the days are evil v. 16 . To redeem the time is to live in the church by Christ, to live Christ in the church life.
[38]  Two great heretical groups, the Mormons and the Jehovah's Witnesses, also practice door-knocking.
[39]  We must realize, though, that Satan always tries to copy what God is doing.
[40]  As children of light walking in love and light, we will be prepared to be the bride of Christ.
[41]  Christ is the Head of the church in authority and the Savior of the Body in love Eph 5:23 .
[42]  Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her v. 25 . Because He loved the church, Christ gave Himself up for her for the purpose of sanctifying her, not only positionally but also dispositionally, from without and from within.
