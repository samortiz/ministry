   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APT TO TEACH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to shepherd the saints, the elders must be apt to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In shepherding others by teaching, we do not give them lectures or messages.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, we give them edifying and nourishing instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may not be eloquent, but we can still nourish others by instructing them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Ephesians 4, the shepherds and the teachers are one category.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that anyone who would be a shepherd must also be a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Likewise, a good teacher is also a shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some so-called teachers, however, do not know anything about shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They may give sermons, but they do not shepherd anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But in the Bible a shepherd is a teacher, and a teacher is a shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just as a mother shepherds her children by feeding them and caring for them, so we also need to shepherd God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, some need help in knowing the church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order for them to be clear about the ground of the church, someone needs to shepherd them by teaching them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Who will do this work?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all must rise up to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No matter how many elders we may have, they are not sufficient to fill the gap.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For the shepherding, there is the need for all the brothers and sisters to function.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We teach others by what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose a new one sitting next to you in a meeting cannot find the book of Haggai.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By helping him find this book, you teach him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps someone else is not familiar with a certain term that is used.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By having fellowship with him, you may help him understand the significance of this term.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the weak ones, new ones, and young ones need a great deal of such teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever someone renders them this kind of help, they are built up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, through receiving this kind of help, they also become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the way to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the previous chapters I encouraged the saints to open their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now I encourage you all to do the shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sisters, some of you have been in the Lord and in the church life for years, and you have attended many conferences and trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Surely you have received something from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now is the time to exercise yourselves to use the grace you have received and the gift you have been given to care for others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The way to grow is not by grouping yourselves together in a selective way; it is by eating and working.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>My health comes from these two sources.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I eat well, and I work with every fiber of my being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After I work, I rest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more I work, the better I rest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sisters, I encourage you to go to the weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you do this, the church meetings will be full of joy and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Oh, so many sick ones, hurt ones, and young ones need to be taken care of!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How can we come together and praise the Lord for our oneness if we are not willing to shepherd the saints?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever I hear this kind of praise, I wonder about the weak ones and the young ones and about those who do not come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I wonder who is taking care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no need to tell me how much oneness you have.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you go to the weaker ones and shepherd them, then your oneness is genuine and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I thank the Lord that you all are for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But we still need to be for the recovery in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>BRINGING BACK THE LOST SHEEP</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I hope that in the coming days many lost sheep will be brought back.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I can still remember my mother's concern for her seven children.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever one of the children was out too late, my mother would tell me that I should have no peace or rest until that one was home.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She told me that if I were not willing to go out after my brothers and sisters, I did not truly love them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, I had to go to look for the brother or sister who was not at home.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>My mother would not accept any excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the same principle, how can we be at rest until our brothers and sisters have been brought back to the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You may be at rest, but I am not at rest, for I am concerned for those who are not with us.</S>
