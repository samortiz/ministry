   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PSALMIST ASKING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO ANNIHILATE HIS ENEMIES,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>WHILE SEEKING TO PARTICIPATE IN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>IN HIS HELP, SUSTENANCE, AND SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalm 54 is in the same category as Psalms 52 and 53.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here the psalmist asked God to annihilate his enemies, while he himself was seeking to participate in the enjoyment of God in His help, sustenance, and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is hard to believe that a God-man could pray for such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 1 the psalmist says, "O God, save me by Your name,/And execute judgment for me by Your might."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On whom was judgment to be executed?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the psalmist, it was to be executed on his enemies, who were Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verses 2 and 3 continue, "O God, hear my prayer;/Give ear to the words of my mouth./For strangers have risen up against me,/And those who terrorize seek my soul;/They do not set God before them."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The strangers here are Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For the Gentiles not to set God before them means that they do not fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To them, there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verse 4 the psalmist goes on to say, "Behold, God is my help;/The Lord is among those who sustain my soul."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who sustained the psalmist's soul, helping God to save David, must have been Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is in verse 5 that the psalmist prays for the annihilation of his enemies, saying, "He will return the evil to those who lie in wait for me./Annihilate them in Your faithfulness."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead of asking the Lord to have mercy on them in His faithfulness, the psalmist prays that God will annihilate them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This does not fit in with the psalmist David's spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In typifying Christ as the fighting victor, it is all right for David to ask God to annihilate his enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But in his spiritual living, in his spirituality, it is altogether not right for him to hate his enemies, to ask God to destroy, to annihilate, his enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is against the nature of the spiritual life of God's chosen people, and even against God's holy word in the Old Testament, Proverbs 25:21-22, quoted by the apostle Paul in Romans 12:20.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, we cannot admit that David's spirituality is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then the psalmist says, "I will offer a freewill offering to You;/I will praise Your name, O Jehovah, for it is good./For He has delivered me from all distress,/And my eye looks triumphantly upon my enemies" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Is this the prayer of a spiritual man, or is it the utterance of a man in his natural concept?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After reading such a psalm, can we still hold David in high regard?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have learned that it is altogether not easy to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In particular, it is not easy to have the proper understanding of a psalm like Psalm 54.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In studying this matter, I have been helped by John Nelson Darby's use of the word sentiment in relation to the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Darby says that the Psalms are the expressions of the sentiments of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Regarding Psalms 52 57, I would say that here we have not merely the sentiments of the psalmists but their complex sentiments.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Their sentiments are a matter of mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To trust in God is certainly right, and part of Psalm 54 is an expression of David's trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But how can we justify David's praying, in the same psalm, for the annihilation of his enemies?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He hated them to such an extent that he asked God to annihilate them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must admit that in this psalm we have a mixture and that the sentiments of the psalmist are complex.</S>
