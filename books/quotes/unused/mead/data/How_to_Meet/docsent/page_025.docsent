   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HABIT OF EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To live by Christ, to take Christ as our life in our daily walk, is absolutely a matter of being in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the real practice of the exercise of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose you are quarreling or arguing with your roommate, your dear wife, or your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You know that when you persist in arguing you are out of the spirit; you are exercising your mind and your emotions, not your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You may feel that you are definitely right and the other party is wrong, but you are not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you do not live in the spirit and exercise your spirit in your daily walk, how can you possibly exercise your spirit to prophesy when you come to the meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you have been exercising your mind and not your spirit in all your daily living, when you enter the meeting you will do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You will consider this brother and that brother, you will criticize and analyze this brother and that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You will continue to exercise your mind and not your spirit this is your habit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You have built up this habit in your daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not exercise our spirit all the day, every day, how can we exercise our spirit to prophesy in the meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our homes, in our family life, on our jobs, we must practice continually the exercise of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to build up the habit of exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I may have many matters with which to quarrel with my wife, but if I turn just a little to the spirit, the spirit will indicate not to quarrel, not to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The spirit will tell me, Do not say that you are right, say O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Forget about so many things and just exercise the spirit to say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you do not exercise your spirit to say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah, in your daily life, it is rather difficult to come to the meeting to say, O Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you can do it in the meeting without doing it in your daily life, you must be an actor or actress, and you make the meeting place a theater with some kind of performance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The way we meet depends on the way we live.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How should we meet?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must live in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must live by taking Christ as our life, a life which is always expressed in the form of love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Love suffers, love endures, love forgives.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How may we express this love?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Just by exercising our spirit to contact the Lord and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do you think that if you would exercise your spirit all day to say, O Lord Jesus, you could hate others?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Can we banish darkness and hatred by struggling with them and resisting them?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more we do this, the more we will be in darkness and filled with hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we would simply turn to our spirit and say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah, the Lord would be with us and be expressed in the form of love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In one translation of chapter thirteen we have this word, Love never reckons others faults.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Love covers, love never reckons, love endures, love suffers, love believes and hopes all things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is this love?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is nothing less than Christ in my practical, daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we would enjoy such a Christ as our love, we need to exercise our spirit, not our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not exercise our spirit, sooner or later we will always reckon the faults and failures of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Exercise your spirit continually and you will enjoy Christ and experience Him; then when you come to the meeting, out of your habit of exercising your spirit, you will have the boldness to stand up and prophesy something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You will be able to say, I do not care for anything but the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is your habit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is my habit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With such a habit it is easy to prophesy, it is easy to say something about the Lord and for the Lord in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the way to meet; this is the way revealed to us through the book of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is our portion, Christ is everything to us, Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and we are joined unto Him in one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is by this way that we can live in Him, walk in Him, and have our being in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then when we come together, as in chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen of 1 Corinthians, we gather with such a background, we come together with such a standing, with such a daily life, with such an exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we need only take the initiative in the spirit to prophesy, to say something of and for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Is this my teaching?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the revelation of God in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It was buried, it was covered for centuries, but by His mercy it has been discovered.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This book of 1 Corinthians is so open to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is transparent from the first chapter to the last.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ is so much to us that we may live by Him in a practical way day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then when we meet together, out of such an experience of Christ, it is easy for us to exercise our spirit to share something of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are no longer dumb, but bold to speak for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the way for us to meet.</S>
