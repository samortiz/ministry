<h2 class=head2>E. Christ Breathing Himself as the Pneumatic Christ into His Believers as the Gentle Breath</h2><p>Christ, as the embodiment of the consummated Triune God, in the evening of His resurrection, breathed Himself as the pneumatic Christ into His believers as the gentle breath. This indicates that the entire consummated Triune God as the consummated all-inclusive Spirit has been wrought into the believers of Christ as their life and everything. After Christ resurrected from the dead, in the evening He came back to His disciples. He did not teach them anything. Instead, He breathed into them, and this breath was the Holy Spirit. In resurrection He is not the Christ in the flesh, but the pneumatic Christ. Through resurrection He became the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). After He breathed Himself as the Spirit into the disciples, they had the consummated Triune God in them. This is the consummating step of Christ’s ministry on the earth, that is, to have the consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit of life join together with the believers’ spirit as one wonderful mingling spirit (1 Cor. 6:17); the divine Spirit indwells the human spirit (2 Tim. 4:22) and the two work together as one spirit (Rom. 8:16).<h2 class=head3>1. The New Testament Being the Biography of Christ</h2><p>The New Testament as the biography of Christ unveils to us that Christ as the Christ of God, the Messiah of God (John 1:41), the anointed One of God (Dan. 9:26, lit.), the appointed One of God, fulfills God’s commission to Him with a threefold ministry.<h2 class=head3>2. The Threefold Ministry of Christ Being in Three Stages</h2><h2 class=head4>a. His Earthly Ministry</h2><p>The threefold ministry of Christ is in three stages. In the first stage it is His earthly ministry, which begins in His incarnation and ends in His breathing of Himself into His believers as the Spirit of life to bring His believers into an organic union with the processed and consummated Triune God (Matt. 28:19).<h2 class=head4>b. His Heavenly Ministry</h2><p>In the second stage it is His heavenly ministry, which begins with His outpouring, in ascension, of the processed and consummated Triune God, embodied in Himself, as the Spirit of power to form the churches and ends with the building up of His organic Body. This has produced the overcomers and will consummate in the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head4>c. His Kingdom Ministry</h2><p>In the third stage it is His kingdom ministry, which begins with His judgment of the believers at His judgment seat and ends with His judgment of all the dead at the great white throne. The kingdom ministry clears up the negative things in the universe. In His kingdom ministry, Christ gets rid of all the opposers of God, including Satan, to establish a kingdom on this earth with all His overcomers as His co-kings to reign over the nations on this earth.<h2 class=head3>3. Consummating God’s Eternal Economy</h2><p>All the ministries of Christ in the three stages consummate God’s eternal economy in the New Jerusalem as the center of the new heaven and new earth.
