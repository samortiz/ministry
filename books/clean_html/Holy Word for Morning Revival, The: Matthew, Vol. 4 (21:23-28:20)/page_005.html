<p class="bold">WEEK 16 — DAY 4</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 22:41-46</h2><p class="bold">41 &nbsp;Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them,</p> <p class="bold">42 &nbsp;Saying, What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He? They said to Him, David’s.</p><p class="bold">43 &nbsp;He said to them, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying,</p> <p class="bold">44 &nbsp;“The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet”?</p> <p>45 &nbsp;If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?</p><p>46 &nbsp;And <sup>1</sup>no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him anymore.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>We have seen that the last time the Lord Jesus came to Jerusalem He came not to work, but to present Himself to those who were to slaughter Him.…As portrayed in 21:23—22:46, during His last visit to Jerusalem, the center of Judaism, Christ was surrounded by the chief priests, elders, Pharisees, Herodians, and Sadducees, along with a lawyer, all of whom endeavored to ensnare Him by asking puzzling and insidious questions. First, the chief priests, representing the authority of the Jewish religion, and the elders, representing the authority of the Jewish people, asked Him concerning His authority (21:23). Their question was according to their religious concept. Second, the Pharisees, the fundamentalists, and the Herodians, who were zealous in politics, asked Him a question related to politics [22:15-17]. Third, the Sadducees, the modernists, questioned Him concerning fundamental belief [vv. 23-28]. Fourth, a self-approved lawyer asked Him a question concerning the law [vv. 34-36]. After answering all their questions wisely, He asked them a question concerning the Christ. This is the question of questions. Their questions were related to religion, politics, belief, and the law. His question was concerning the Christ, who is the center of all things. They knew religion, politics, belief, and the law, but they paid no attention to Christ. Hence, He asked them, “What do you think concerning the Christ?” This question of questions must be answered by everyone.</p><p>When the Pharisees were asked this question by the Lord, they replied that Christ was David’s son (v. 42). No doubt, according to the Scriptures, this answer was correct. Then the Lord said, “…If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?” (vv. 43-45). The question here is how a great-grandfather could call his great-grandson Lord. This was one question the Pharisees did not know how to answer.</p><p>Christ is God; in His divinity He is the Lord of David. He is also a man; in His humanity He is the Son of David. The Pharisees had only half the scriptural knowledge concerning Christ’s person, i.e., that He was the Son of David according to His humanity. They did not have the other half, i.e., that He was the Son of God according to His divinity.</p><p>Do not think that we can understand Christ adequately today. No, He is too wonderful and too far beyond our comprehension. We do not even fully understand ourselves, much less Christ. Do you know where your spirit is, or where your soul is?…When I was very young, I thought I knew myself thoroughly. But the longer I have lived, the more I realize how little I know. If we cannot understand ourselves, how can we adequately understand Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God?…Jesus Christ is the Son and…He is also called the Father [Isa. 9:6].…He is one person with two natures and two lives. However, it is beyond our ability to understand this thoroughly. We simply believe whatever the Bible says and praise Him for being so wonderful! We need to worship Him, take Him in, enjoy Him, and experience Him as the wonderful One.
