through the Ministry of the Word</h2>
<p>Every believer loves the Lord. When his love for the Lord is stirred up, he will look forward to the next bread-breaking meeting. If he receives a taste and a supply, he will surely want to come again. If every brother and sister were like the apostle Paul, there would be no need for us to stir up their heart. But many of the saints are new believers who truly need the help and the supply. If they come to the meeting time after time, but they do not know how to sing hymns and pray like others, they can only listen to others. If they continually hear the same tunes, they will feel that the meeting is tasteless, long, and tedious. Sometimes an entire meeting is like an elderly person going down the stairs; it causes people to break out in a cold sweat and nobody knows what to do. Such meetings cannot uplift people&rsquo;s spirit or satisfy them. It cannot make them willing to pay the price to come to the meeting again.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot complain about any decrease in the attendance in meetings. Those who take the lead in the meetings, particularly those who minister the word, bear the main responsibility. We need to minister the word in all the meetings to supply and give instruction to the saints. For example, after the new believers in northern China received help in fundamental matters for five years, their prayer and praise in the bread-breaking meeting was able to render much help to other new believers. They praised the Lord for His sweetness and for the fruit of His labor, declaring that they were satisfied with Him. These saints prayed, &ldquo;Lord, You are so sweet. From Your head to Your feet You are worthy to be anointed by us. Lord, from Your birth to Your death You are worthy to be anointed. Lord, You are satisfied when You see the fruit of Your labor. Today we are sitting in Your presence, and we are satisfied when we look upon You.&rdquo; Many people became open when they heard such prayers. In some prayers there is a supply through the ministering of the word. Prayers that are full of light can render a supply to others.</p>
<p>If our bread-breaking meeting does not supply people through the ministry of the word, it is very poor. New believers will feel that the meeting is meaningless if they do not gain much nor hear any speaking with spiritual content. We should not only stand on the proper ground but also be in a normal condition.</p>

Requiring One to Spend Time to Study</h2>
<p>Those who minister the word should spend time before the Lord daily, studying how to minister the word in the bread-breaking meeting. Our speaking in the bread-breaking meeting is not the same as speaking from the podium. It should not be educational in nature; rather, it should be with feeling, causing people to see the Lord&rsquo;s beauty, to appreciate and worship Him, and to be drawn to Him. Our speaking should not cause them to forget the Lord. On the contrary, our speaking should cause them to see the Lord and enter into His presence. We should speak concerning the Lord&rsquo;s work and person, His exaltation, His name, His glory, and His second coming. We might even say something concerning His power, but this depends on how we speak. We should always speak with feeling, touching on the fact that God&rsquo;s love is with power and that His power is manifested in His love. Such speaking is very sweet.</p>
<p>If we merely say that the Lord&rsquo;s power is great, even greater than atomic energy, the brothers and sisters may forget His loveliness. For this reason, we should consider the way we speak. We may say, &ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s power is in His love. Some mothers love their children but do not have the power to properly care for them. But our Lord is not like this. There is power in His love, and His power is manifested through His love.&rdquo; When we speak in this way, the saints feel that the Lord is both lovely and powerful. They will be brought to the Lord and into the Lord. Moreover, this kind of speaking will not interrupt the spirit of worship in the saints.</p>
<p>When we speak, we should pay attention to the atmosphere in the meeting. Sometimes we should speak at the beginning of the meeting or when the bread and cup are being passed. It is extraordinary and full of meaning when our words follow the bread as it is being passed. When the brothers and sisters are passing the bread, we speak concerning the bread; after the bread has been passed around, we can speak concerning the cup. This will give the saints a sweet taste. They will not feel that we are speaking. Rather, they will sense an atmosphere that brings them before the Lord. They may have the sweet feeling that the Lord is shedding His blood in their presence and that the flow of His blood is for them to drink. The supply provided by such a speaking is full of taste. This shows that speaking for the Lord requires a considerable amount of study.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Administration of the Church and the Ministry of the Word &nbsp; pg 54</div><br></body></html>
