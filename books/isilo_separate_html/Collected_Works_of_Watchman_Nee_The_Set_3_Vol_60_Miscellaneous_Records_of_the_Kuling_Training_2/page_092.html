There is no longer any need to keep the law. The matter of the Sabbath is a thing of the past. Romans 14:5 says that some judge one day above another, while others judge every day alike. Verses 1 through 6 of this chapter deal with two things: keeping or not keeping the day and eating or not eating meat. Some are vegetarians; they do not take meat. Paul said that these ones are weak in faith or weak in conscience. He also said that those who keep the day are weak in faith. In the Old Testament if a man would not keep the Sabbath, he would be stoned to death. In the New Testament when the Lord Jesus came, the Jews tried to kill Him because He did not keep the Sabbath. They were stopped, however, by a miracle. At the time of Paul, the apostle said that one day is the same as another day; all days are the same. What a great change! All days are the same. Keeping the Sabbath is a moral law; it is one of the items of the moral law. Consider the law: "Do not commit adultery." One cannot say that both those who commit adultery and those who do not commit adultery are all right, and that those who commit it commit it to the Lord and those who do not commit it do not commit it to the Lord. The keeping of the Sabbath does not earn one the righteousness of the law; it is a shadow of things that are coming. There is one part within the law which has to do with types. There is another part which has to do with righteousness. The types are already fulfilled. We cannot separate the law into ceremonial and moral parts, like the Judaizers do. However, we can say that a part of the law is typological and that these types are all fulfilled in the Lord Jesus. This means that we have a dispensational change.</p><p>In the Old Testament we find numerous commandments on keeping the Sabbath. But these commandments are for the Jews. By the time the kingdom comes, the Jews will still keep the Sabbath and offer sacrifices. In the New Testament Paul did not exhort anyone to keep the Sabbath, not even once. It would be surprising indeed if one should keep the Sabbath and the New Testament did not say anything about it. We can see that the dispensation has changed. We can see this clearly in the conference in Acts 15. Verse 22 of that chapter says that the apostles, the elders, and the whole church were gathered together. If the Sabbath was important, some decision should have been reached in the conference regarding it. It would be strange indeed for Christians to keep the Sabbath without finding any references to that decision. This shows that the Sabbath must be over. The New Testament tells us that according to God's plan, "all the prophets and the law prophesied until John" (Matt. 11:13). In God's work Christ is the end of the law. In the New Testament the Lord does not charge men to keep the law. Colossians says that the Sabbath is over. Paul said that it is all right to keep or not to keep the day. None of us live to ourselves, and none of us die to ourselves. Whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.</p><p>Finally, we have to see that nothing in the New Testament can be fulfilled by borrowing things from the Old Testament. The Roman Catholic Church says that keeping the Lord's Day is a keeping of the Christian Sabbath. This mixes Judaism with Christianity. Once the Judaizers come in, they try to bring the entire Jewish religion in. If anyone wants to keep the Sabbath, that man is not a Christian. Just as it is wrong for a Christian to keep the Chinese mid-autumn festival, it is wrong for him to keep the Sabbath. If we accept the Judaizers, we might as well throw away all hint of Christianity and simply become a pure Jew. Paul spoke in Galatians 4:10-11 to the Galatians: "You observe days and months and seasons and years..."&mdash;which include the Sabbaths and the Jubilee&mdash;"I fear for you, lest I have labored upon you in vain." Keeping the Sabbath annuls grace. We have to guard against the Judaizers' attempt to bring in the Sabbath.</p><h2 class="head3">A Final Word&mdash;the Law and the Sabbath<br />Being Altogether Over</h2><p>The Acts of the Apostles is a record of the history of Christianity; it does not give explanations to the facts. It only contains history, not doctrines. The whole body of truth from God, as presented in the entire Bible, was not completed until A.D. 96, which is the time of the fulfillment of the Lord's prophecy to His disciples when He said that the Spirit of truth would come and would bring them into all truths. It was also at that time that the power and influence of Judaism gradually disappeared from Christianity. At the time of the Lord's death, there was not yet a complete presentation of the Christian faith. The complete picture of the Christian faith gradually emerged and was not completed until the writing of the Epistles. We have to understand the progression of the Christian faith. In Acts 15 we do not see any dispute for the Sabbath. There was only the dispute for circumcision. Later, Paul even went up to the temple to take care of his vow. It is not surprising for the Jews to want circumcision, because they always wanted to draw back. I hope that the brothers will see the beginning, the development, and the completion of the Christian faith. Only then will we be able to ascertain the proper faith of a Christian.</p><p>At the beginning of the New Testament, when our Lord was on earth, He kept both the Sabbath and the circumcision. In Galatians the matter of the Sabbath was settled, and the matter of circumcision was also settled. Some of Paul's Epistles were written after A.D. 70, and it was then that a proper standing for the Christian faith was established. Before that time, the temple, the priests, and the law were still present. It was still easy for men to straddle the fence. It was still easy for men to enjoy two kinds of lambs. It was easy to hold onto Judaism on the one hand and to believe in Jesus on the other hand. This is the reason Paul wrote the book of Hebrews. The last clause in Hebrews 10:26 says, "There no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins." Christ has been offered as our sacrifice. No one can straddle the fence any longer. Here we see the great advancement and development of the Christian faith! Any truth, however, must receive its final verdict from the Word of God. Concerning the law and the Sabbath, the final word is in Colossians 2:14: "Wiping out the handwriting in ordinances, which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross." The law and the Sabbath are completely over. If the temple and the priesthood are still with us today, we will have a problem. It is easy for the Judaizers to bring in all kinds of "halfway" items. We have to remember one basic principle: In making a judgment concerning any truth in the Bible, we must not stop halfway. The Sabbath and the law are all "halfway" things. In teaching about the Sabbath, the Judaizers are bringing in Old Testament items that have been annulled already.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_091.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_093.html">Next</a> </body></html>
