   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A FOURFOLD GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today it is common for Christians to engage in fund raising to meet the need for material supply.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Often, fund-raising letters are sent out to encourage Christians to give.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you compare these fund-raising letters with what Paul has written in 2 Corinthians 8 and 9, those letters will be exposed as being worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Compared to what Paul has written, they are altogether lacking in value, life, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For the most part, they do nothing more than urge others to give money.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a sense, in these chapters Paul is engaged in fund raising.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But his way of handling material needs is absolutely in the Spirit and full of life, altogether different from the practice of today s Christian organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul does not merely talk about money; he speaks concerning the grace of God in a way that is full of life and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul s writing in these chapters has considerable spiritual weight.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we read 8:1-15 carefully, we shall see that grace here involves four parties: God, the giving ones, the apostles, and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, we may speak of a fourfold grace the grace of God, the grace of the givers, the grace of the apostles, and the grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, Paul is not merely raising funds.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Much more, he is seeking to stir up the saints to participate in the ministry to the needy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to participate in such a ministry to supply the needy saints, we need a fourfold grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE GRACE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 8:1 Paul mentions the grace of God given in the churches of Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This grace is the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 to bring the processed God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Grace is actually the Triune God becoming life and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By this grace the Macedonian believers overcame the usurpation of temporal and uncertain riches and became generous in ministering to the needy saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the day of Pentecost the believers put all their possessions together and had all things common.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Acts 2:44 and 45 say, And all that believed were together, and had all things common; and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They practiced what may be called a communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This practice continued in Acts 4: And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common v. 32 . Throughout the centuries many believers have appreciated the communal life in Acts 2 and 4 and have also tried to have all things common.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A certain group in north China practiced this kind of communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anyone who joined that group had to agree to give up his material possessions and have everything in common.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the communal life in Acts did not last very long.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even as early as chapter six, problems began to arise, and not too long afterward that communal life was discontinued.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the writings of Paul we can see that the communal life described in Acts 2 and 4 was no longer in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From Paul s Epistles we see that the proper Christian living is not a communal living, a living of having all things common; it is a living by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This grace comes from four directions; from God, from Christ, from the apostles, and from the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE APPROVEDNESS OF AFFLICTION</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Continuing his word about the grace of God given in the churches of Macedonia, in verse 2 Paul says, That in much approvedness of affliction the abundance of their joy and the depth of their poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Macedonians were in affliction, in suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That affliction was a test to them of how much they could be approved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is what Paul means by approvedness in affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever we are in affliction or suffering, we should realize that God is testing us to prove where we are and what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The result of that testing in affliction, in suffering, is approvedness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are able to withstand the test and are approved by God, the result will be the approvedness of affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Macedonians were in that kind of situation.</S>
