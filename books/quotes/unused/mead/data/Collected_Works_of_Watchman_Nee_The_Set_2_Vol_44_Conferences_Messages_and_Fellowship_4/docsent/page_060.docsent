   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE GOD'S TWO FIRM FOUNDATIONS Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 2:19-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The verses above show us that the Lord never changes and the things He accomplishes also never change.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everything around us is changing, but there are two things which do not change.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, the Lord knows those who are His.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, those who name the name of the Lord should depart from unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two things are the firm foundations of God, and these foundations have been firmly established.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE LORD KNOWS THOSE WHO ARE HIS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second Timothy 2:19 says, "However the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal...."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A seal signifies that a decision has been reached, that a matter is settled a certain way, and that there will be no further change.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hymenaeus and Philetus could misaim concerning the truth, and Alexander the coppersmith could persecute Paul, and even all who were in Asia could leave the apostle, but the Lord knows those who are His.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some in the church may have departed from the way of truth, and you may be discouraged, thinking that man is always untrustworthy and that you no longer know who to trust.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brothers and sisters, I can be wrong, the church can be wrong, and everything that everyone else does can be wrong, but please remember that the Lord can never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we preach the gospel we bring people to the Lord; they are regenerated and are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But these saved ones can depart from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When this happens we may become very discouraged and may want to quit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But at such times we should realize that the Lord cannot be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even if ten, a hundred, a thousand, or more people leave, God's Word still holds true His firm foundation stands.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God knows those who are His.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not blame others for failing or for being wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should only put the blame on ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not criticize others for their unfaithfulness or error.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to believe that the Lord alone knows those who are His.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>EVERYONE WHO NAMES THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>DEPARTING FROM UNRIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who are the Lord's are surely apart from unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But how do we depart from unrighteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second Timothy 2:20-21 is an explanation of the second half of verse 19.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verses 20-21 say, "But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels but also wooden and earthen; and some are unto honor, and some unto dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, prepared unto every good work."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These verses speak of a great house, not a small house.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God cares for the matter of honor and dishonor, not the matter of usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God wants to know which vessels are honorable, not which vessels are more useful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is for value; He is not for utility.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He cares for quality, not for quantity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man has the misconception that God likes useful vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But God cares more for quality than for utility.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In an ordinary household, vessels of wood and earth are more important than vessels of gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A family can be without vessels of gold and silver, but it cannot be without vessels of wood and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, we are not talking about the usefulness of the vessels, nor the size of the vessels, but the value of them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Most people think that as long as a vessel is useful, God is pleased with it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But this is a wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What is important is the value of a vessel and its worth in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Five ounces of gold may be worth as much as five hundred tables, but these things are vastly different.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God is not concerned for the quantity; He cares for the value of a thing in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How different is God's view from ours!</S>
