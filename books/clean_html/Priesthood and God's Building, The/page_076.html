<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Lord as the Content</h2>
<p>It seems easy to describe the progression of a meeting, but in practice, much skill is needed. First, we need to know the Lord in order to have content for the meeting. Second, the brothers and sisters should coordinate with one another. To know the Lord is one matter, but to apply what we know in a meeting is another matter. We need to know the Lord and learn to coordinate with others to function in prayer in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Considering the Lord&rsquo;s Suffering</h2>
<p>Let us consider the Lord&rsquo;s suffering as an example of the content for a meeting. According to the Bible, the Lord&rsquo;s life of suffering can be divided into three major sections. The first section began with the Lord&rsquo;s birth and ended when He began to minister. His sufferings began from the time of His birth. The second section covers the period of His ministry; this suffering lasted for three and a half years on the earth. The third section includes the suffering in His crucifixion. When the Lord Jesus was praying in the Garden of Gethsemane before He went to the cross, His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground (Luke 22:44). This was the beginning of the suffering in His crucifixion. The Lord Jesus&rsquo; suffering in His crucifixion is the last section of His suffering. The first two sections of the Lord&rsquo;s suffering can be further divided into nine crucial points.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Suffering in His Birth</h2>
<p>When the Lord was born, His mother wrapped Him in swaddling clothes and laid Him in a manger because there was no place for them in the inn (2:7). This depicts the suffering in the Lord Jesus&rsquo; birth. Being wrapped in swaddling clothes indicates that there was no blanket, not even clothing. This implies a state of humiliation. Being laid in a manger indicates that even though He was born as a man, He did not have the status of a man. When we were born, we were not placed with cattle but with men. However, the Lord Jesus was laid in a manger, the place for cattle. There being no place in the inn denotes that there was no place for Him. These three brief points summarize the Lord Jesus&rsquo; suffering in His birth. The Lord Jesus was the Lord of the universe, the great God, but He became an infant. He went from being lofty to being lowly, from being great to being small, and from being rich to being poor. If we compare the Lord&rsquo;s status prior to His birth, we will realize how much the Lord suffered in His birth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Suffering in His Growth</h2>
<p>The Lord also suffered in His growth. A person&rsquo;s birth and growth are two different matters. Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, but He grew up in Nazareth, a despised place. Bethlehem is a small city, but in the eyes of the Jews, it is the city of the royal family. Bethlehem is even called the city of David (vv. 4, 11) The highest king of the Jews&mdash;the Lord Jesus&mdash;was born in Bethlehem, the city of the royal family, but He did not grow up there. He stayed in Bethlehem for only a short period of time, and then He was forced to flee to Egypt (Matt. 2:13-15). When He returned to Israel, He did not go back to Bethlehem but to the region of Galilee. He lived in a small city called Nazareth; thus, He was called a Nazarene (vv. 21-23), which was a derogatory title. In John 1:45 Phillip found Nathanael and said, &ldquo;We have found...Jesus...from Nazareth.&rdquo; Nathanael reacted by asking, &ldquo;Can anything good be from Nazareth?&rdquo; (v. 46). In John 7:52 someone even said, &ldquo;Search and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee.&rdquo; Although the Lord was born in the respected city of the royal family, He grew up in a despised, small city.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Suffering in Poverty</h2>
<p>Isaiah 53:2 says, &ldquo;He grew up...like a root out of dry ground. / He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him, / Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him.&rdquo; This indicates that the Lord came out of a poor family. A poor family is like dry ground that is without a rich supply of nutrients. After the Lord Jesus was born, His parents took Him to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices according to the law. They did not have a lamb to offer but only a pair of turtledoves or two young doves to offer (Luke 2:22-24). This was the sacrifice offered by the poorest Israelites. Leviticus 12 clearly speaks of a lamb as the preferable sacrifice to be offered on behalf of a newborn. Verse 8 says, &ldquo;If she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons.&rdquo; Joseph and Mary&rsquo;s offering indicated their poverty. The Lord was born into a poor family.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being a Poor Man</h2>
<p>The Lord grew up in Nazareth, lived in a poor family, and was Himself a poor man. He seldom carried any money in His pocket. When some people came to take the temple tax, He did not have any money in His pocket. Rather, He told Peter to go fishing to obtain a stater from the mouth of a fish to pay for the tax (Matt. 17:24-27). When the Pharisees and Herodians joined forces to tempt Him, asking Him if they should give tribute to Caesar, He did not take out any money from His pocket; instead, He asked them to show Him a coin (22:15-19). All these accounts show that the Lord Jesus was poor.</p>
