         <h2 class="head1">OUR BEING CORRESPONDING TO<br />
THE WORDS IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>We can illustrate the need for our being to correspond to the Bible with the matter of repenting and believing in the Lord. The Bible says that we should repent and believe into the Lord (Acts 20:21; John 3:16). If we read the Bible but do not have a daily experience of repenting and believing into the Lord, our being will not correspond to the words in the Bible. Thank the Lord that we are in accord with the Bible on this point.</p>
<p>In addition to the Bible speaking of repenting and believing into the Lord, it also says, &ldquo;He who believes has eternal life&rdquo; (6:47). Furthermore, the Bible says, &ldquo;I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God&rdquo; (1 John 5:13). We need to ask ourselves whether or not we are experiencing eternal life. I believe that many of us would respond that we have eternal life because God is in us. But how can we know that God is in us? We can know because there is a sense of joy and satisfaction in our inner being, but if this sense of peace is lacking for any reason, we will not be able to see the pillar of cloud clearly. Even if our inner being becomes darkened so that we cannot clearly see the pillar of cloud, we should remember that we also have a pillar of fire. When we do not have a clear inner sense and it seems as if the Spirit is not present, we should not forget that we still have the Bible. The Bible says, &ldquo;Everyone who believes...would have eternal life&rdquo; (John 3:16). This is the Word of God. Although we may feel dark within, even to the point that we have no sense of God within us as life, the Word still says that those who have believed into the Son of God have eternal life. If God says this, it is so. This is the Word, like the pillar of fire, shining in a dark night to enable us to go forward on our path.</p>
<p>We know that a ten-dollar bill is worth ten dollars because we can plainly see the words <em>ten dollars.</em> The Bible is God&rsquo;s unlimited treasure house, and the value of its content is real and can be received by us, just as we can receive ten dollars worth of goods when we have a ten-dollar bill. If we do not know the words in the Bible, we will suffer a big loss. This would be like using a ten-dollar bill to receive only five dollars worth of goods. This would be quite regrettable.</p>
<p>In order to know the Bible, we should read it every day and even memorize it. The more we memorize, the better it will be. We should memorize not only John 3:16 but also the Lord&rsquo;s words in verses 14 and 15: &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life.&rdquo; We know that we have eternal life because the Lord said, &ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life.&rdquo; Since we have believed, we have eternal life. If a person who has believed into Him says that he does not have eternal life based on his feelings alone, he is calling the Lord a liar. Who is more reliable&mdash;the Lord who says that everyone who believes may have eternal life or the person who says that he does not have eternal life based on his feelings? We should believe the Lord&rsquo;s word; otherwise, we are treating Him as if He were a liar.</p>
<p>It does not require much effort to have a proper regard for the Bible. It is enough to simply acknowledge what the Bible says. When the Bible says that we should repent, we should acknowledge this and repent. When it speaks of believing into the Lord, we should simply believe and receive. When it speaks of having eternal life, we should say, &ldquo;Amen. Praise the Lord! We have believed, and we have eternal life.&rdquo; We know these things because they are spoken of in the Bible. Some may say, &ldquo;Even though the Bible says that I have eternal life, I do not feel as if I have eternal life. What should I do?&rdquo; To those who ask such a question, we should respond, &ldquo;Your feelings do not matter, and they cannot change the truth in the Bible.&rdquo; When I am speaking, I concentrate my whole being on my speaking, and therefore, I do not necessarily feel a ten-dollar bill in my pocket, but it is still there. Our feelings are not reliable. Sometimes we may feel that we have a one-hundred-dollar bill in our pocket but realize that it has been stolen only when we reach into the pocket.</p>
<p>It is not our feelings that matter but the facts in the Bible that matter. The Bible says, &ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life.&rdquo; Since we are believers, we must acknowledge that we have eternal life. We should not read the Bible but ignore the facts in the Bible. If this is our situation, our being will not correspond with the Word. It is sufficient to simply believe the words in the Bible. Since God says in His Word, &ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life,&rdquo; we should say to Him, &ldquo;Amen! I believe! I have eternal life.&rdquo; We should not rely on our feelings. God never lies. If we say that we have believed but do not believe that we have eternal life, we are regarding God&rsquo;s words as a lie and God as a liar. Hence, in order for our being to correspond to the Bible, we should not rely on our feelings but believe in the words in the Bible. When God speaks, we should believe.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
