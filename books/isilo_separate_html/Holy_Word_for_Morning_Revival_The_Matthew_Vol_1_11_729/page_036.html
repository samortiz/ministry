Here the Lord uses three illustrations-the giving of alms, praying, and fasting-to reveal how we are filled with the self and the flesh. We must do our righteous deeds in secret, for our Father is in secret. We all need some secret growth in life, some secret experiences of Christ. Following this, we find the pattern of prayer (vv. 9-13). However, it is not the pattern for all prayers. The prayer in John 14-17 is related to life, whereas the prayer in Matthew 6 is a prayer of warfare against God&#8217;s enemy for God&#8217;s kingdom.</p><p>The fifth section of the King&#8217;s decree (vv. 19-34) concerns the riches of the kingdom people. Actually, the Lord is dealing with the underlying matter of anxiety. In ancient times, the children of Israel had to labor by tilling the ground, sowing the seed, watering, and harvesting. This was their duty. But whether or not they received the harvest depended on God. Their responsibility was to labor without having any anxiety. Likewise, we must fulfill our duty, our responsibility, but not for the sake of our anxiety. Our duty is to give, to lay up treasures in heaven.</p><p>The sixth section of the new King&#8217;s decree on the mountain (7:1-12) concerns the principles of the kingdom people in their dealings with others. Actually, His intention here is to encourage us to forget ourselves and to take care of others. If we take care of others, we will not judge them, criticize them, measure them, nor impose requirements on them. To help them we must be blind, considerate, sympathizing, and full of mercy.</p><p>The seventh and last section of the King&#8217;s decree (vv. 13-29) concerns the ground of the kingdom people&#8217;s living and work. In this section, there are four crucial words that reveal the consummation of the kingdom&#8217;s constitution: gate, way, will, and house. No one can fulfill the requirements of this constitution unless he has been regenerated and possesses the life and nature of the heavenly Father. To enter in through the gate is simply to begin walking on the way, a way that is lifelong. Our way is full of limitations, restrictions, and constrictions. But the limitations are not a frustration; rather, they will speed us on our way. Remember two things are needed for our entrance into the kingdom of the heavens: to call on the Lord and to do the will of the heavenly Father. Through calling on the Lord, we have been regenerated with the divine life, whereas our doing the will of the Father is to live that life.</p><p>Finally, the kingdom&#8217;s people living and work must be founded on the word of the new King. Hearing His words and doing them, we are likened to a prudent man, who built his house upon the rock. The house built upon the rock will not fall because it is built according to the constricted way, the way of doing the will of the Father. However, to build with our opinions, human concepts, and natural ways is to build upon sinking sand. When tested, this house will fall. This is to build with wood, grass, and stubble, a work that will be burned by the testing fire (1 Cor. 3). This is the Lord&#8217;s conclusion of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_035.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
