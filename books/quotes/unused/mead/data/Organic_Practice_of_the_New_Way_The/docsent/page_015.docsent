   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Examples of Prophesying</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I hope that in the future we will see more of the prophesying in our meetings, even to the point that it will be more than the teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is also no need to have too many testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this way, the content of the meetings will be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are speaking, there is the need to have the biblical materials.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, in the praises of Mary the mother of Jesus in Luke chapter one, many words of the Old Testament were quoted throughout the whole passage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This shows that she was full of inspiration, that her view was broad and her choice of expression fresh, with much revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was a good example of a proper prophesying vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>46-55 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before this, the blessing of Elizabeth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>42-45 , and following this, the prophecy of Zechariah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>68-79 were in the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only were there the words of the Bible and the fresh utterance, but the broad view and the spiritual revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When all these elements are added together, we have the prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This kind of prophesying cannot be acquired in two or three days.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is the need to live this kind of life for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Prophesying is the highest expression of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we live this way, spontaneously, we will be able to speak for God, to speak forth God, and to speak God into others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Week by week, if all prophesy this way, doubtless all the saints will receive the enlightening, the cleansing, the nourishing in life, the help in the truth, and the spiritual perfecting to be built up together into the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, everyone needs the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the small group there is the fellowship, the prayer, the reading of the Bible, the mutual care, the learning of the truth, the pursuit of the growth in life, and the perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First we are perfected in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By the time we come to the prophesying meetings in the church, everyone will be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By then, the Body of Christ will be built up, and we will have succeeded in having the proper Christian meeting and service.</S>
