<h2 class="head2">The Details of the Living<br />
of the New Man in Ephesians</h2>
<p>To put on the new man is to put on the church life, which is to live the church life. However, merely living the church life is not sufficient; we need to go further and live out the new man. This is my burden in this chapter. The new man has been created, and we know that we need to put on the new man, but much more we need to live out the new man. Verse 24 of chapter 4 speaks of putting on the new man. The section from verse 25 through verse 9 of chapter 6 deals with the details of the practical living out of the new man. Verse 25 of chapter 4 says, &ldquo;Having put off the lie, speak truth each one with his neighbor.&rdquo; Verse 1 of chapter 5 says, &ldquo;Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.&rdquo; Being imitators of God is not the same as monkeys mimicking people. Monkeys do not have the human life, so they can merely mimic people. We can imitate God, however, because we have His life. God is our Father, and we are His beloved children. It is easy for children to imitate their parents because they have their father&rsquo;s life and nature. Since we have the life and nature of our Father God, we can imitate Him and live out His life.</p>
<p>Verses 7 and 8 say, &ldquo;Do not be partakers with them; for you were once darkness but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light.&rdquo; The word <em>them</em> in verse 7 refers to people in society. We should not be partakers with them, which is to put on the old man. We were once darkness like people in society. However, we are now light in the Lord, so we should walk as children of light. Verse 15 says, &ldquo;Look therefore carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise.&rdquo; The subsequent verses describe how to walk as the wise: by redeeming the time (v. 16), by wives being subject to their husbands (v. 22), by husbands loving their wives (v. 25), by children honoring their parents (6:2-3), by parents nurturing their children in the discipline and admonition of the Lord (v. 4), by slaves being obedient to their masters and serving them with good will (vv. 5-8), and by masters treating their slaves well (v. 9). We are foolish if we do not honor our parents. Likewise, parents are foolish if they do not properly nurture their children. Husbands who do not love their wives and wives who are not subject to their husbands are also foolish. This long section concerns how to live out the new man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Expression of the New Man<br />
Being the Reflection of God</h2>
<p>When we put on the new man and live the church life, we will have the expression of the new man. This expression is not a matter of being angels or of shouting Hallelujah and Amen daily. The expression of the new man is a real human being. Man was created according to God&rsquo;s image in order to be God&rsquo;s reflection. The intrinsic element of the created human nature is close to God&rsquo;s nature. Confucius said that the way of great learning is to develop the &ldquo;bright virtue,&rdquo; the bright and shining moral virtue, which is the conscience in the human spirit. The bright virtue is also the &ldquo;innate knowledge and ability&rdquo; taught by Wang Yang-ming, a Chinese philosopher of the Ming Dynasty. Zachariah 12:1 says that when God created the heavens and the earth, He also created a spirit within man. Proverbs 20:27 says, &ldquo;The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, / Searching all the innermost parts of the inner being.&rdquo; The spirit of man is the lamp of God within man, and it has the function of the conscience, enabling man to reflect God. This function is not found in birds or animals. For this reason people say that a person who does not act according to his conscience is the same as an animal.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that the human spirit has been damaged by Satan. Nonetheless, this organ is still in man. Even if a person is deep in sin, his conscience will still tell him whether his behavior is proper. Honoring one&rsquo;s parents does not come from teaching. When a person grows up and becomes familiar with human affairs, he spontaneously has the feeling to honor his parents. This feeling comes from his conscience. The Chinese sages taught people to develop the conscience using their innate human ability. However, man&rsquo;s conscience has been damaged. Therefore, even though it still has a little brightness, it is deficient.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit of a Regenerated Person<br />
Having the Righteousness<br />
and Holiness of the Reality of God</h2>
<p>The spirit of man, which is the lamp of Jehovah, was damaged when man fell. This lamp is lit at the time of a person&rsquo;s regeneration. Regeneration is to have another life enter into us. This life is the life of God. This divine life enters into us with the divine nature to be our life so that our spirit can be regenerated. This is spoken of in Ephesians 4:24. The new man was created according to God, and in the new man there are the righteousness and holiness of the reality. Righteousness is to be according to God&rsquo;s ways, and holiness is to be according to God&rsquo;s nature. This means that the new man created by God is the same as God in His ways and in His nature. If we have God&rsquo;s ways and nature, we will reflect God.</p>
<p>Hence, what a regenerated person lives out does not originate from the innate knowledge and ability of his natural life but from the divine life and nature that he obtained through regeneration. As regenerated people participating in the new man, we need to live out this most excellent life. God did not say that a believer should separate himself from his community or from his family. Sakyamuni taught people to become buddhas, and Taoism teaches people to become immortals. However, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is for us to be real humans reflecting Christ. After man fell, God came to regenerate man and recover man so that man might be uplifted. Confucius taught people to be proper by developing and enhancing the bright virtue within the limits of man&rsquo;s innate ability. However, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is for man to have God&rsquo;s life and thus be uplifted. For example, all human beings have a God-created desire to honor their parents. Even before we were saved, we had this desire. Confucius&rsquo;s teachings are principles concerning human relationships that tell people to develop and enhance the bright virtue within man. Such teachings are good. However, the day that we heard the gospel and believed in the Lord Jesus, our being was uplifted, and our respect and love for our parents deepened. This is the result of God&rsquo;s life entering into us.</p>
<p>We must admit that we sometimes still live out our fallen nature even though we are saved. A sister might feel that her mother is lovable, but when her mother does or says something displeasing, the sister will glare angrily at her mother. However, because the sister is a Christian, she will not have peace in her conscience and will ask the Lord for His forgiveness and the cleansing of His blood. Furthermore, she will confess her mistake to her mother and may even cry. Many of us can testify that after believing in the Lord, our humanity was uplifted. This uplifting did not come from teaching, nor is it the result of our endeavor. Rather, the divine life has entered into us and uplifted our humanity. This is the living out of the new man as described in Ephesians.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
