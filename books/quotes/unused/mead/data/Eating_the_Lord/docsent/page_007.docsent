   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD BECOMING SMALL ENOUGH TO ENTER INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brothers and sisters, you have to see the significance of this case.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>People invariably address the Lord Jesus according to their religious concepts, regarding Him as a great man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, the Lord clearly reveals to us that He is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to know the Lord not according to the religious concept but according to the revelation in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today, the whole world sees Christ in the same way as the Canaanite woman did.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, some say that Christ was a religious teacher, others say that Christ was the founder of a religion, and still others say that Christ was a great man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These are what the unbelieving Gentiles say.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in the eyes of the Christians, Christ is greater and higher.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am not saying that the Lord Jesus is neither great nor high.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, you have to realize that this notion is according to man's religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since the creation of man, God has always revealed Himself to man and placed Himself before man as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all know that fruit trees are not gigantic trees.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, neither apple trees nor vines are tall.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, trees such as fir and cypress, which are used for pillars, are very tall.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the fruit trees were several hundred feet high with fruit hanging from them, at such a height how could we get the fruit to eat?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, I firmly believe that the tree of life presented in the Bible must be a small and short tree.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some Bible scholars suggest that the tree of life is a grapevine because the Lord Jesus once declared, "I am the true vine."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Regardless of this, the tree of life cannot be very tall or high.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hallelujah, when God appeared to man the first time, He did not appear as a great One but rather as a tree placed before man!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then when Jesus came, men regarded Him as a tremendously great religious person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, He said, "I am the bread of life."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Bread is even smaller than a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God has always placed Himself before men as a small One; He never manifested Himself as a great One.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is because only by being small can He enter into man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we take Him into us, He is delighted.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many of you are very familiar with Paul's Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let me ask you, "In Paul's fourteen Epistles, how many times did he write that he bowed his head and prostrated himself before God?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are only a few instances.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, he repeatedly said, "Christ in me" and "Christ in you."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, he said, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me"; "It pleased God to reveal His Son in me"; "My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you"; "Christ in you, the hope of glory"; "That Christ may make His home in your hearts" Gal 2:20; 1:15-16; 4:19; Col 1:27; Eph 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When something gets into you, which is greater, you or that thing?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hallelujah, you are greater!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you praise the Lord, you truly should tell Him, "Lord, I praise You, I am greater than You!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>O Lord, You are smaller than I!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you dare not praise the Lord in this manner, it proves that you are still being influenced by your religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the morning try to boldly say to the Lord, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am great, and You are small."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you do this, I can guarantee that your spirit will leap with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord will then say, "Here is a man who knows Me thoroughly."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not misunderstand me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am not saying that the Lord Jesus in His person is smaller than you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Himself He is many times greater and higher than you are.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, He has indeed become a small Jesus in order that you may eat and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Moreover, when He left Jerusalem and withdrew to Tyre and Sidon, He became even the crumbs that fell under the table.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The bread on the table is comparatively big; the crumbs under the table are truly small.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"O Jesus, I praise You as the crumbs.'</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today You are not a whole Jesus; You are Jesus as the crumbs!'"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>About fifteen years ago in a long-term training here, I searched through the Bible and tried my best to find all the titles of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is Christ, Jesus, Emmanuel, Son of God, and so on.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We found about two hundred seventy titles.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, I did not include "the crumbs" as a title.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This morning I want to add another title: The Lord Jesus is also called the crumbs.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord Jesus is not only the bread of life but also "the crumbs."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I repeat, Jesus in Himself is great, but in order for us to eat and enjoy Him, He willingly humbled Himself and took the form of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Man, in his natural concept, called Him "the Son of David" which was a traditional form of address.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, the Lord Jesus said, "I am the children's bread, even the crumbs.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I am not the crumbs on the table but rather the crumbs under the table."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Oh, the Lord Jesus is in the place where you are in a fallen condition, in Tyre and Sidon.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Tyre and Sidon were not respectable places, yet the Lord withdrew to those places.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although He is holy, He humbled Himself and condescended to be with us, to approach the unrighteous sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As the great God, He approached the lowly men.</S>
