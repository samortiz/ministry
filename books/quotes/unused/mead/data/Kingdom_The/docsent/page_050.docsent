   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SOULISH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The soulish life denotes not only the soulish being, but also the power and strength by which we do things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we do things in the church and in the Lord's work according to our being and according to our strength, that is a display of the soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The soulish strength must be dealt with because the more we depend upon it, the more we live in the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not only must the self hidden within the soul be dealt with, but also the soulish life, the soulish strength, and the soulish being must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whatever we are and whatever we can do must be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This must be put on the cross and kept there all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because we are believers in Christ, we all have the kingdom of God in our spirit, but we also have the kingdom of Satan in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whatever we have, whatever we are, whatever we can do, and whatever we keep in our soul must be completely dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is good to take no thought, but that is only a part.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must realize that whatever we are, whatever we have, and whatever we can do in our soul must be dealt with because the satanic kingdom is in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more our soul is crossed out, the more opportunities will be afforded to the indwelling Christ to spread Himself from our spirit into our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this way our soul will be purified and saturated by the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then the kingdom of God will increase, spread, and come again within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the way to have the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the way to have power and impact and the blessing of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the central and strategic point of our Christian life related to the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we all must concentrate our seeking and our attention to this one thing: to bear the cross and always afford the Lord the opportunities to spread Himself from our spirit into our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we will have the practicality of the kingdom life.</S>
