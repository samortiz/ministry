Paul prayed that we would see the transmission of the great power of God toward the believers. This great power operated in Christ in raising Him from the dead, in seating Him at the Father's right hand far above all, and in subjecting all things under His feet. This power also gave this resurrected, uplifted Christ to be the Head over all things. God's great power is now operating within us and upon us. This power was wrought in Christ, making Christ the Head over all things for the transmission of this power to the church, the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</P><P>We need to realize that God's nature, God's life, Christ's element, and the Spirit's essence have been imparted into us. Furthermore, there is a power toward us. God's power toward us is surpassingly great (v. 19). This power is a divine transmission that raised Christ up from the dead, uplifted Him to the heavens, subjected everything under His feet, and gave Him to be the Head over all things. This transmission may be likened to a current of electricity. That current is a transmission of electric power from the power plant.</P><P>In addition to the divine impartation, the divine dispensing, there is such a divine transmission. The dispensing of God the Father's nature and life, of God the Son's element, and of God the Spirit's essence is intrinsic and is within us to touch our being. The transmission of the divine power is both within us and outwardly upon us to empower us. We have the threefold dispensing within us, intrinsically strengthening us within. We also have the divine power "electrifying" us to empower us. The Body of Christ is the issue of the inward imparting of the Triune God into our being and also the issue of the inward and outward empowering of the divine transmission of God. We are those enjoying the threefold dispensing and the onefold transmission. The church is the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God and of the transmission of the empowering God.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Intrinsic View of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
