   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW GOD ACCOMPLISHES HIS INTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My intention in sharing this is that we would have a full scope of the revelation in God's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This full scope impresses into us that God's intention is to have a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's intention is to have the Body, the church, as the counterpart of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can God accomplish His purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first two chapters of the Bible show us how.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God put His created man in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, God is putting all of humanity in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The tree of life is the Triune God, the incarnated God realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's intention is for men to open up their mouths to call on the Lord Rom 10:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then the tree of life will get into them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you receive the Lord Jesus, you receive the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the tree of life gets into you, there is a living river flowing within you and a spring of water within you gushing up all the time John 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By this flowing of the living river, the precious materials will be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that by the tree of life with the flowing river, we men of clay, of dust, will be transformed into gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are the worthless dust, the clay, but we have some amount of gold within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Praise the Lord that the gold within us is being increased all the time and the dust is being reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Regardless of how dusty we are, we all will eventually become gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These precious materials are not individualistic pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All of them are built up together into a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the end of Genesis 2, the rib is built into one bride.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Revelation 21 and 22 the gold, pearls, and precious stones are built together as one city, one bride, the consummation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I hope we can see this picture from the Bible concerning how the church comes into being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many Christian leaders and teachers have a wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They think that the more doctrines they give people, the more the church will be built up, but this is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, the more doctrines you give people, the more divisions and sects you will create.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Doctrines divide.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you insist on your doctrine, and I insist on mine, we will be divided into two groups with two opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church does not come into being by doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church comes out of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is a life entity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must be brought into the full realization of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church can come into being only by life.</S>
