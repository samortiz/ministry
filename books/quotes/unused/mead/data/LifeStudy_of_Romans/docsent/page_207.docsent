   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DISPENSATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ISSUING IN SONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Such a dispensation issues in sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It transforms sinners into sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once we were sinners, enemies of God, but now we are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 14 says, For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We know that we are sons of God by the fact that we are led by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Day by day, we are led by the Spirit who indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Perhaps you may desire to go to a certain place, but instead the Spirit leads you to the meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We often are inclined to do things that are contrary to God s nature, but the indwelling Spirit is stronger than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, He leads us, and we follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such experiences are a sign and a proof that we are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another proof is seen in verse 15: For you have not received a spirit of slavery to fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As sons of God, we cry, Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through the dispensing of the Triune God, we have truly become God s sons in life; we are not sons-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we were merely sons-in-law, we could not call, Abba, Father, so sweetly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is illustrated by a man s relationship to his father and to his father-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he calls his father Dad, it comes naturally and feels very sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if he uses this term with respect to his father-in-law, it does not come naturally or feel sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fact that we are God s sons in life is proved by the sense of sweetness we enjoy whenever we call, Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As sons of God, we have within us the life of God, the nature of God, and the Spirit of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE FIRSTFRUIT AND THE INTERCEDING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to verse 23 we also have the firstfruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The firstfruit of the Spirit is the first taste, the foretaste, of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today we have the indwelling Spirit as the foretaste of our enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This foretaste gives us the assurance that the full taste is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 26 reveals that the Spirit is also the interceding Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Inwardly, the Spirit is constantly interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may think that we alone are praying, only to discover that our prayer actually comes from the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because we are one with Him and the Spirit is mingled with our spirit, we cannot always discern what is of us and what is of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we pray, He prays, and when He prays, we also pray.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, our prayer is His prayer, and His prayer is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE ULTIMATE ISSUE OF GOD S DISPENSATION</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to verse 29, God s only begotten Son has become the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the issue of the dispensation of the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This dispensation makes us the many sons of God, the many brothers of the Firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These many sons of God and many brothers of the Firstborn are the members which constitute the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the ultimate issue of the dispensation of the Triune God is to produce sons to be the members which constitute the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is God s way to fulfill His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His purpose is accomplished neither by teaching nor by organization, but by the dispensing of Himself as the processed Triune God into our being.</S>
