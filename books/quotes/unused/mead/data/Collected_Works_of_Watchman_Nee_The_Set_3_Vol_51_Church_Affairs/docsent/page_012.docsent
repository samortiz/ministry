   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE OVERSEERS All the Meetings Being Uplifted</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If this meeting is strong before God, all the other meetings will spontaneously be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This meeting is the center of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If this meeting is high, all the meetings during the week will be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concentrating One's Entire Being in This Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Taking care of a meeting of the overseers requires a great deal of spiritual strength.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You should concentrate your entire being, and the brothers who are with you should do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then you can consider things item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Watchtower of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This meeting is the watchtower of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The saints are not aware of many things, but you know them first.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The saints have not seen many things, but you see them first.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The saints have no feeling many times, but you have some feeling first.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is in this meeting that everything is sensed first.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before the difficulties around you are apparent, you can sense them in this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, many times when things happen, you have anticipated the situation and taken care of it already.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As time goes on, your eyes should become keener and keener.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You need to learn to use your eyes to look ahead to the things in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With more time your sense should become keener and keener, and you will be able to know what will happen and what will not happen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am not saying that there should be no prayer and no waiting on the Lord in your personal time, but I am saying that the overseers' meeting is the time for corporate dealing, and you should prepare for this meeting in your private time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you do not prepare in your private time, when you come to the overseers' meeting, you will have nothing to say; when you come each time, nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do you see this?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there is nothing happening in the overseers' meeting, it is an evidence, a proof, that every brother is lazy before God, that even all the responsible brothers are corporately lazy before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a few responsible brothers are strong before God, their eyes will be open, they will watch and observe, and spontaneously many things will be going on with them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The High Priest bore the breastplate of the twelve tribes of Israel, and he bore it all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that he could not take it off.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You should learn to bear the breastplate every day, and then you will discover something concerning God's people every day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not one of our overseers' meetings has enough time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may feel that three or four hours or five or six hours have passed by very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes in the meeting of the overseers you need to cut your words short because there is no more time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once the meeting of the overseers is strong, it will be easy for other things in the church life to be strong, because in the meeting of the overseers you can have much consideration about all the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the gospel meeting has become weak, we need to concentrate all our strength there, and the saints need to do likewise.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The meeting of the overseers is the watchtower of the church, the place to keep the watch.</S>
