   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ breathed the Spirit into the disciples John 20:22 , and He poured out the Spirit upon the disciples fifty days later Acts 2:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This was after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before His resurrection, there was no possibility of having the essential Spirit entering into our being, and no possibility of having the economical Spirit poured out upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both of these matters took place based upon the fact that resurrection was consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was the resurrection of Christ that made the Spirit available and applicable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His entering into us as the essential Spirit is for life, and His being poured out upon us as the economical Spirit is for power; these two aspects of the Spirit are the parts of the reality of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts is a book of the testimony of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Acts mentions clearly that the disciples were witnesses 1:8 , witnessing of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today, Christians preaching the gospel stress the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the early apostles, like Peter and Paul, stressed the resurrection of Christ in their preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, they also spoke of the death of Christ, but this death is not the consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The consummation is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Resurrection is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God, Christ, and Christ's death and resurrection have been compounded into this one compound Spirit, who is the very reality of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Resurrection is a person because Christ said that He is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Life and light are also a person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ said that He is the life John 14:6 and the light John 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Love is also a person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible says that God is love 1 John 4:8, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But no verse says that Christ is death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can say Christ's death, using the possessive case, because death is not the consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The consummation is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The processes through which the Triune God passed consummated in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, resurrection is the very consummated God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must have a clear view of the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is the resurrection, the resurrection is the compound Spirit, and the compound Spirit is the consummated God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This view of the resurrection is according to the divine revelation of the Holy Bible.</S>
