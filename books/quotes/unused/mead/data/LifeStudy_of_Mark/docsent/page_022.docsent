   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FORGIVING THE SINS OF THE SICK A Sinner Paralyzed by Sin</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While the Lord was in a house at Capernaum, speaking the word to those who were gathered together, a paralytic carried by four men was brought to Him 2:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This paralytic signifies a sinner paralyzed by sin, one who is unable to walk and move before God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Mark 2:4 says, And not being able to bring him to Him because of the crowd, they removed the roof where He was; and having dug through, they lowered the bed on which the paralytic was lying.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Their zeal in seeking the Slave-Savior s healing compelled the seekers to break through the proper barrier something which might be considered a wild deed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then through the roof they lowered the bed, a small mattress or pad, on which the sick man was lying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 5 says, And Jesus, seeing their faith, says to the paralytic, Child, your sins are forgiven!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This faith, issuing from hearing the word of Christ Rom 10:17 , indicates that the seekers had heard of the Slave-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Seeing their faith, the Lord called the paralytic a child.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This loving word of the Slave-Savior implies kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here the Lord s human virtue was expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord said to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sins were the cause of his sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Slave-Savior s word here touched the cause so that there might be a different effect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once the sins were forgiven, the sickness was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is important and meaningful that the first incident in this section on the carrying out of the gospel service is a case of forgiving the sins of a sick person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that in carrying out the gospel the first thing that must be done is to help people have their sins forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our Basic Problem</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As fallen human beings, our basic problem is our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When God created man, man was pure, clean, and without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the end of Genesis 1 God looked at His creation and said, Very good.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a great matter for God to utter such words as very good.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man had been created in the image of God and according to the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, God breathed into man the breath of life, and man became a living soul Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This breath of life became the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, man in God s creation has the image of God, the likeness of God, and a spirit within him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a creature, he was clean, pure, and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, according to Genesis 3, the evil one, the Devil, the enemy of God, came in to poison the man created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man was bitten by the serpent, and sin was injected into man s being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the problems of mankind are the result of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because of sin, the situation of fallen mankind is hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because of sin, everyone has been corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do you not believe that mankind, including you, has been corrupted?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do you not believe that your neighborhood, your city, and your country have been corrupted by sin?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The whole world has been corrupted by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, in carrying out the gospel service, the first thing we must do is to show people how they may have their sins forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because all the problems of mankind are the result of sin, sin must be dealt with if people are to be restored to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many of us can testify that in the past we tried our best to get a good education so that we might have a promising future.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nevertheless, the problem of sin remained unsolved and caused more and more corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But on the day we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him, our sins were forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 2:1 through 12 we have a case showing us that the first task done by the Lord as the Slave-Savior in carrying out His gospel service was to forgive sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This was the reason the Lord said in 2:5, Child, your sins are forgiven!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This word was probably a shock to the paralytic and to the four who had brought him to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They no doubt had never thought that the cause of his sickness was sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But much to their surprise, the Lord told the paralytic that his sins were forgiven.</S>
