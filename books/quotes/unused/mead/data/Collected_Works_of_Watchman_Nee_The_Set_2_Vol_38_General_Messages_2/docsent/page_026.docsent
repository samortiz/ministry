   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-SIX THE TESTIMONY OF GOD Scripture Reading: Psa 119:125 GOD'S TESTIMONY BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AN EXPRESSION OF GOD HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We often talk about the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What actually is the testimony of God, and what does it refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word testimony is used in the Old Testament more often than it is used in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We would like to point out two places in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Pentateuch, especially in Exodus, the word testimony is used quite frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word covenant in the phrases the ark of the covenant and the tablets of covenant is testimony in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The other place is in Psalm 119.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The uses of the word testimony in Psalm 119 and in the Pentateuch open our eyes to see its meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Psalm 119 often speaks of the word of God, His laws, statutes, ordinances, and commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the same time, it also frequently speaks of God's testimony, which is placed side by side with His word, ordinances, statutes, and commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should keep God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should keep His laws, ordinances, statutes, and commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Psalm 119 also shows that we should keep God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This expression sounds unfamiliar, and it is difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in God's Word and in His mind, His testimony is the same as His word; it is the same as His ordinances, laws, statutes, and commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A testimony is the same in nature as an ordinance, etc.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers not only show that God's testimony is equal to His word and ordinances, but that the two tablets of stone, upon which the laws were inscribed, were called the tablets of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The two tablets were placed in the ark, and it was called the ark of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God inscribed the law on two tablets of stone and called them the tablets of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He also called the ark the ark of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This shows us what a testimony is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A testimony is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is God's heart, demand, or standard.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The two tablets of testimony in Exodus are a good picture; they were set before men to show them God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is God's standard?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's standard expresses God Himself; it shows the kind of God that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's testimony is made for Himself; it manifests God's absolute standard.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When this testimony is manifested among men, it becomes the law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With God it is a testimony, and among men it is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It testifies to God's demand on His side, and it dictates to man what he should keep on his side.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In God's hand it is the testimony, and in man's hand it is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In God's hand it is His demand, and in man's hand it is his duty.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When it is put before man, it tells him what he ought to do; it also testifies of what man has done wrong and what the nature of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When this testimony is placed in man's hand, it testifies of his wrongdoings, showing how much he has come short of God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When this testimony is in God's hand, it testifies of the kind of God that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A testimony is God opening His mouth to declare what He is in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the New Testament, this thought is more obvious.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus came as a testimony to the Father, while the Holy Spirit came as a testimony to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church maintains the testimony of Jesus Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To testify Christ means to tell others about who He is and what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On God's side, the testimony is God Himself, and on man's side, the testimony is a tremendous matter it is the law within man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not offend this testimony, and God will not lightly regard any offense to this testimony.</S>
