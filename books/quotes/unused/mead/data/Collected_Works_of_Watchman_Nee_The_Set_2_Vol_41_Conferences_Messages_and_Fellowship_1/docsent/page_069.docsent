   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE TALKS 2 Date: November 21, 1935, afternoon</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Chuenchow GIFT AND MINISTRY The Ministries for the Ministries</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 4:11-12 speaks of four or five kinds of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The goal of these gifts is "for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These five kinds of gifts are for the purpose of perfecting the saints to participate in their ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The ministries of the believers are miscellaneous in nature, whereas the five gifts are specific they are for the purpose of helping the believers fulfill their ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These gifts are the ministries for the believers' ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are like the bank of the banks, or the central bank.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every bank conducts its own business.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In addition, the central bank helps to facilitate transactions between various banks.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These five ministries are also like the teachers of a teachers' college.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their goal is to produce teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, they can be called the teachers of the teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The job of the various ministries is to perfect the saints unto the work of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, they are the ministries of ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who help others in this way should have at least one of these five gifts, or they can have all five gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a man does not have any of these five gifts, he cannot have a part in these ministries of ministries because he cannot perfect others into their ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of course, an ordinary believer can do the work of these five gifts even when he does not have God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The result of his work is the same in nature as the work of those who have the calling for such ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Matthew 25 tells us that the Lord distributed talents to the slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some had five talents, some had two talents, and some had one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every slave had at least one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the distribution of these talents, we can conclude that some slaves signify those who have ordinary gifts while other slaves signify those who have particular gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who received one talent received ordinary gifts, whereas those who received two or five talents received special gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Prophecy" and "teaching" in Romans 12:6 and 7 refer to the gifts of prophets and teachers in Ephesians 4:11.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The gift of apostleship in Ephesians 4 does not just refer to those who have physically seen the Lord face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Joints of Supply</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the gifts in the church which do not belong to the five kinds spoken of in Ephesians 4 should submit themselves to these gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way, no one will be puffed up or become proud through his own gift.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ephesians 4:13 says, "Until we all arrive."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This proves that the work of the preceding five ministries has been going on continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This work will go on until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith, at the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It will go on until we are all joined to the Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means we still have apostles today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The condition in Ephesians 4:13-15 proves that the five gifts are still available and still exist.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 16 speaks of "every joint of the rich supply."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Man's physiological organs can be divided into two categories.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first category is the consuming organs which consume energy, such as hands and legs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The second category is the supplying organs, such as the mouth, the ears, and the eyes; they receive things from outside the body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The five gifts mentioned above are joints of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before the Lord, we must seek to supply other members.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When others are supplied, we also receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if we are not one of these gifts, we will have nothing with which to supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In that case, it is better that we receive the supply from the gifted ones.</S>
