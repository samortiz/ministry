In the Enjoyment of the Offerings<br>at the Annual Feasts</H2><P>God's dispensing is typified by the enjoyment of the offerings at the annual feasts (Lev. 23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Seven Annual Feasts Being Appointed by God<br>to the Children of Israel</H2><P>Seven annual feasts were appointed by God to the children of Israel. God ordered His peoples' lives in such a way that they were to have festivals, and every festival was a time for God's people to enjoy Him as a feast. The feasts afforded Him the opportunity to dispense Himself into His people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Feast of the Passover</H2><P>The Feast of the Passover signifies the salvation of the New Testament believers (vv. 4-5; 1 Cor. 5:7b). When children are learning something new, they prefer to hear a story rather than an instruction or a charge. We should learn to preach the gospel to people by using the pictures of the Old Testament. We should present the New Testament salvation using the picture of the Passover to teach people that God's salvation is based first on redemption by His blood and then on the life supply. If we present salvation in this way, we will stir up peoples' interest, and they will pay attention to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Feast of Unleavened Bread</H2><P>The Feast of Unleavened Bread signifies the sinless living of the New Testament believers for the whole course of their Christian life (Lev. 23:6-8; 1 Cor. 5:7a, 8). The Passover took place on a single evening, but the Feast of Unleavened Bread lasted seven days. In the Bible seven days always denotes a full course of time. Thus, the seven days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread denotes the full course of our Christian life, from the first day we were saved to the day when we will be raptured to meet the Lord or will rest by sleeping. The whole course of our Christian life should be unleavened, without sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Feast of the Firstfruits</H2><P>The Feast of the Firstfruits signifies the New Testament believers' enjoyment of the resurrected Christ (Lev. 23:9-14; 1 Cor. 15:12-20). The firstfruits signify Christ as the produce of the land.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_130.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_132.html">Next</a> </body></html>
