   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Teaching of Balaam and the Teaching of the Nicolaitans</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following the church in Ephesus, the other churches became more and more degraded by taking doctrines, such as the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans Rev 2:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If today we are still for certain doctrines, sooner or later all the other doctrines will creep in. Because Christians were for doctrines, there was the ground for the doctrine of Balaam to creep in. If they had not been for doctrines, they would have said, "No, we don't care for this doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no room, no entry, for any doctrines to creep in."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today's Christianity is too much for doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Too many there have itching ears, heaping up to themselves teachers 2 Tim 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some prefer to have a famous theological doctor or missionary come to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When there is a good speaker, the church buildings are crowded, but when the prayer meeting comes, only a few persons attend.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes only the pastor, his wife, and the janitor attend the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord said, "But I have a few things against you, that you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam" Rev 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Among so many doctrines, the doctrine of Balaam and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans crept into the church in Pergamos.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Teaching of Jezebel</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To the church in Thyatira the Lord Jesus said, "But I have something against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices" v. 20 . The evil woman Jezebel was prophesied by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 13:33.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus sowed Himself as a seed which grew into wheat vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>3, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Out of the grains of wheat comes the meal for making a loaf v. 33 . The evil woman, signifying the Roman Catholic Church, not only mixed but hid leaven, signifying the evil things, the corrupting factor, in the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Roman Catholic Church took many hidden, pagan things as the corrupting factor and hid all these things under the covering of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It presents Christ to people, but something is hidden under the covering of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a hidden way it corrupts, damages, and ruins people, yet they have no consciousness of it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus hates such teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we must learn not to take mere teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not be offended by this word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you still intend to take mere teachings, you will become leavened, if not today, then eventually.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To grow into the wheat to produce the meal in Matthew 13 requires transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In two of the last parables in Matthew 13 there are the treasure hidden in the field and the pearl of great value vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>44-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The treasure in the field must be either gold, precious stones, or pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These things can never be leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all have to go on to have the growth and to have transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we are the fine meal, the fine flour, it is easy for us to be leavened, but if we all are transformed into precious stones and pearls, no one can leaven us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not care for mere teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>OVERCOMING THE TEACHINGS AND EATING JESUS AS THE TREE OF LIFE, THE HIDDEN MANNA, AND THE FEAST</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus promised those who overcome to eat of the tree of life, the hidden manna, and the feast Rev 2:7, 17; 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He said, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me" 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Revelation 2 and 3 there are three categories of eating: eating of the tree of life, eating the hidden manna, and feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the garden of Eden there was the tree of life to be eaten Gen 2:9, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the wilderness the children of Israel ate of the manna Exo 16:14-15 , and when they came into the good land, they held the feasts Lev 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today we are in the fulfillment of the tree of life, the manna, and the feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to overcome the present situation of degraded Christianity, and to overcome means to overcome all the teachings, the different concepts, and the different opinions and come back to Jesus, not merely to understand Him but to eat Him as the tree of life, the hidden manna, and our feast.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eating is the main thing we practice in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the local churches we do not care for the teachings or doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We only care for the eating of Jesus, the enjoyment of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the eating we have no opinions, so we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are for doctrines, we surely will have opinions; we will be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here we have the real recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The real recovery is to overcome the present situation of today's Christianity, that is, to give up all the doctrines and simply come back to the spirit, taking Christ as the unique nourishing factor to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the recovery of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church life is a life of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I do hope that we all will see this.</S>
