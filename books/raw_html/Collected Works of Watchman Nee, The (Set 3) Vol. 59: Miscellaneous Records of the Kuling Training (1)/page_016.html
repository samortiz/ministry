<h2 class="head1">KNOWING OURSELVES AS GOD KNOWS US</h2><p>Verse 13 of Hebrews 4 is equally as important as verse 12. These two verses are linked together. What is the standard by which God enlightens us, exposes us, and discerns the thoughts and intentions of our heart? What kind of revelation can be considered true revelation? Verse 13 says that we are naked and laid bare before God. We are fully exposed before Him; there is nothing we can hide. Any kind of covering merely veils our eyes; it does not cover the Lord's eyes. If God is merciful to us, we will be exposed and laid bare. We will know ourselves as God knows us. This is God's way of salvation. God wants us to know ourselves as He knows us. His salvation is not to crucify us on the cross again. The Lord has accomplished everything on the cross already. He has crucified us on the cross already. What we need from God is light to see our true condition. This is revelation. The light of this revelation will kill our outer man. This is how the outer man is separated from the inner man.</p><p>I have been saying this for many years. Although we have failed, I will still repeat the same thing today. One day God will shine a great light on us, and we will see. Just a small glimpse will precipitate the division of our soul from our spirit. The work of dividing the soul from the spirit does not occur in the spirit, but in the soul. God first points out our soul to us, and then we find out how much spirit we have. Once everything is laid bare before God's eyes and we see it as God sees it, our soul will not be able to stand up again. It will lose its steam. This seeing will move the soul away from the spirit. When the spirit and the soul are divided from each other, we will have a way to go on. This is a very solemn thing. The division of the soul and spirit is not a debate involving the parts of man, but a matter of light. God's word is sharper than a sword; it is an exposing and stripping word. Once this word shines, our soul is divided from our spirit. The dividing of the spirit from the soul brings us the knowledge of what is included in the soul; it does not bring us the knowledge of what is included in the spirit. Light has to come before we realize what is of the soul and how much our righteousness, goodness, zeal, and consecration are of ourselves. We can know how to go on only to the extent that we have been enlightened. We have to fall flat on our face and acknowledge, "I need the cleansing of the Lord's blood even for my tears of repentance. May the Lord grant me more light."</p><p>We do not know how this light comes to us. It can come to us through our conversation with the brothers, through a frank word from the ministry of the word, through the many trials that arise in our circumstances, or through the burden of many things upon our shoulder. We do not know how light comes, but we know that it has to come. If it does not come, there is no way for the soul and the spirit to be divided. We have to deal with this matter in a fundamental way. Unless we deal with it, what is the use of more theology or knowledge? If God grants us mercy and shows us light, we will see our true condition. Once light comes, we will not have to try to humble ourselves, love the brothers, or act humble. Spontaneously we will be humble. Spontaneously we will love the brothers and become humble. This is where the crux of our problem lies. Once the outer man and the inner man are separated, many problems will be solved spontaneously.</p><p>There are several results from the division of the inner man from the outer man. First, we will enjoy spontaneous fellowship with God. This fellowship will not need to be deliberate. Second, we will spontaneously know other men. Third, our spirit will be released in the course of our work. The power of the Holy Spirit will also be released. When others touch us, they will touch the spirit. Fourth, we will receive supply from many directions. The whole church will become our supply. What a rich life we will experience if we open up our entire spirit to the Lord!</p><h2 class="head1">THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN BRINGING<br />RICHES TO THE CHURCH</h2><p>When the outer man is broken, we will see the Body of Christ and the riches of this Body. As our outer man is broken, both we and the church are enriched. Today the brothers and sisters are starving to death because only one pair of hands is able to feed them; they are able only to listen to one man's speaking. They cannot receive supply from many people. We are poor today because we are not able to receive many things from others' spirit. When our outer man is broken, we may not be able to render help to others immediately, but at least we will be revived and begin to find supply from others. How much supply can a broken man draw from others! The whole church will become his supply. If the outer man is not broken, he will still act like an infant, and he will only recognize his own nurse. If there is not a supply from many sources, we will end up in poverty. This poverty is indeed unnecessary. May the Lord have mercy on us and grant us light to divide our soul from our spirit so that our outer man will be broken.</p><p>Prayer: Lord, we consecrate ourselves to You once again. You are the faithful and trustworthy Lord. It is better and safer for us to fall into Your hand than to remain within ourselves. You can arrange everything for our good. We do not wish to be those who are waiting for the light, but those who are open to the light. We are not here to wait for things to happen to us. Rather, we accept Your hand and acknowledge Your grace. Divide our spirit from our soul and break our outer man today.</p>
