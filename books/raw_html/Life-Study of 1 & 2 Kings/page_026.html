<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. The Dedication of the Temple</H2><P>Chapter eight is concerned with the dedication of the temple.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Tabernacle Being Merged with the Temple</H2><P>Verses 1 through 11 show us that the tabernacle was merged with the temple.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Tabernacle Being a Portable Precursor</H2><P>The tabernacle was a portable precursor moving through the wilderness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Temple Being a Consummation<br>of God's Building in Typology</H2><P>The temple was a consummation of God's building in typology built upon Mount Zion, a peak of Mount Moriah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Glory of Jehovah Filling the Temple</H2><P>The glory of Jehovah filled the temple (cf. Exo. 40:34), bringing the God who is in the heavens to the earth and joining the earth to the heavens. This should be our situation today.</P><P>In Genesis 28 Jacob had a dream and he called that place Bethel, meaning "the house of God." There heaven came down to the earth and the earth was joined to heaven by the ladder which Jacob saw in his dream. This ladder was a type of Christ who, as the Son of Man, keeps heaven open to earth and joins earth to heaven (John 1:51). Today the heavenly God comes down to the earth and the earth is joined to God by the very Christ who dwells in us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. His Blessing and Declaration to the People</H2><P>Solomon's blessing and declaration to the people were related to God's dwelling in the deep darkness and to God's promise to David that his son would build a house for God (1 Kings 8:12-21).</P>
