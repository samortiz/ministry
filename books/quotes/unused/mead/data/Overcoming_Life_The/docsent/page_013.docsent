   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECEIVING OF THIS LIFE A MIRACLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You may remember that Paul once said, For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure Phil 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whatever we work out is according to God s good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is God who causes us to work out everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is operating in us to make us holy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not have to exert our own effort, because everything is accomplished through God working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such a holy and perfect life does not come about by our own effort; it is absolutely a work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With many people, nothing short of a miracle can deliver them from their wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some people do not feel their failures; they do not realize how hopeless they are.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Others have given up on their temper, pride, or disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They realize that they will never overcome unless God performs a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is there anyone here who can overcome sin?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man s way is to suppress sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But God s way is to perform a miracle by removing the old man and cleansing the heart altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you realize the meaning of God s victory, you will be overjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A sister had an exceptionally uncontrollable temper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Her husband, children, servants, and everyone around her were afraid of her.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet she was a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was despairing to her to have such a hot temper.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A few years after she was saved, she received the Lord Jesus as her victory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Immediately after she had such an experience, she faced a great test.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The day after she had received the Lord Jesus as her victory, she woke up and came downstairs to the living room.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Her husband and the servants were hanging a chandelier from the ceiling.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The chandelier was expensive, but the husband and the servants were not being careful enough.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It fell to the floor and shattered at the very moment that she came down the stairs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When her husband saw her coming, he froze and wondered if there would be an explosion of temper.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To his amazement, she said calmly, Just sweep away the broken pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Her husband began to wonder.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the past she would have shouted and yelled when even a small cup or saucer broke.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He thought that this time she surely would be very mad.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When he saw her reaction, he asked, Did you sleep well last night?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Are you sick?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She answered, I am not sick.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God has performed a miracle on me and has taken away my old man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The husband said, This indeed is a miracle!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What a miracle!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thank and praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a miracle!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Mr. C. G. Trumbull, the founder of the Sunday School Times Company, is a person experienced in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He realized that the overcoming life is a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He testified once to an elder that after he received the Lord Jesus as his life, not only was his temper gone, but even his desire to lose his temper disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The elder asked, Do you mean to say that all of our old sins can be removed?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Mr. Trumbull answered, Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The elder then said, I believe that this is real in you because I believe in your word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But this can never happen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Later, Mr. Trumbull invited the elder to pray with him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After a long prayer, the elder also received this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some time thereafter, Mr. Trumbull met the elder again, and he told Mr. Trumbull, I have never experienced in my life what I experienced on that evening.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was a miracle!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is no struggling and no striving.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The cravings are gone, and even the desire for sin is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is indeed wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Not long after, he wrote a letter to Mr. Trumbull and told him of some improper evil influence existing among the board of directors at the place of his work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the past he would always try to suppress himself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But when he was in the midst of it this time, he was not touched and did not even have an inclination for such sins.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What a miracle!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Brothers and sisters, do you have some insurmountable barriers?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do you have some uncontrollable sins?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you do, the Lord Jesus can perform the same miracle on you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You may have been helpless in some areas for years.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But the Lord can perform a miracle on you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It does not matter whether your sins are spiritual, carnal, mental, physical, or dispositional.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It does not matter whether you can or cannot obey God s will or whether or not you are consecrated, and it does not matter whether or not you have confessed your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord can perform His miracle on you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you cannot consecrate yourself, the Lord can cause you to consecrate yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you cannot endure, the Lord can enable you to endure.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He can overcome all the sins mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God is able.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When He performs a miracle, everything becomes possible.</S>
