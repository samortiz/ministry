<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN<br />ON THE MOUNTAIN</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Friday evening, February 17, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</h1><h2 class="head1">TAKING THE WAY OF RECOVERY ACCORDING TO<br />THE PATTERN ON THE MOUNTAIN</h2><p>Watchman Nee: The Lord's intention concerning the church is one that is according to "the pattern on the mountain." A church must find out what the pattern on the mountain is. It must take God's standard as its standard before it will realize how wrong it has been. What is the condition of the church that we are trying to match? Only as our eyes are drawn to the glorious church ordained by the Lord in the Scripture will we realize our shortage and lack.</p><h2 class="head2">The Reason for the Church's Failure</h2><p>The basic reason for the failure of the church is that it cannot meet its own need of begetting and nourishing the new ones. Changes in membership of a church should not come solely as a result of movement of saints to and from other localities. When a church is strong, the number of brothers and sisters moving out of the church is small. When a church is weak, the number of brothers and sisters moving out of the church is great. A businessman pays much attention to the influx and outflow of economic forces such as capital. A church also should pay much attention to the influx and outflow of its members. A church may have three to four hundred brothers and sisters, but it may be very short in care and shepherding. In a year's time, many new ones are added, but many old ones leave also. This is a drain on the church life. For this reason, a church must not only be good at preaching the gospel and gaining new ones, but must give itself to edifying the believers. The first responsibility of the church is to save men. The second responsibility is to perfect and nourish men. If a church saves a hundred people in a few months, yet loses a hundred at the same time, it is a total failure. This is the reason I say that a church's failure lies in its inability to keep the children it has begotten.</p><h2 class="head2">The Law of the Work of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>If a church is strong, it will be in full control of everything; it can dictate at will the number of sinners it saves. In order for the church to be strong, it has to work according to the pattern on the mountain, a pattern which the Lord revealed. If it does not work according to the Lord's pattern, it will be very hard to bring in men. But if the church works according to the Lord's pattern, it can tell itself to increase by five hundred, and it will increase by five hundred. Or it can tell itself to increase by a thousand, and it will increase by a thousand. If we take the Lord's way, it will not be a surprise to save three or five hundred people. It will not be a surprise to even save three or five thousand people. Some of our brothers call the Lord "the Son of Revival." Whether or not He is the Son of Revival depends on whether we work according to the law which He has revealed to us through the Holy Spirit. Those who know the law according to which the Lord works agree with my word. If the church knows the law of the Spirit and works according to this law in preaching the gospel, it will experience no obstacles in its saving work. Once the church rises to the standard, men are saved and revival comes.</p>
