Keeping the Commandments<br>of Jehovah Their God,<br>Walking in His Ways and Fearing Him</H2><P>"Therefore keep the commandments of Jehovah your God, walking in His ways and fearing Him" (v. 6). God has His ways as well as His commandments. The children of Israel were not only to keep His commandments but also to walk in His ways. The principle is the same with us today. We should walk in the Lord's way, in the New Testament way.</P><P>The children of Israel were to keep God's commandments, walk in His ways, and fear Him, for He was bringing them to a good land, a land of waterbrooks, of springs and of fountains, flowing forth in valleys and in mountains, a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, pomegranates, olive trees with oil, and honey, a land in which they would eat bread without scarcity and in which they would not lack anything, a land whose stones were iron and from whose mountains they could mine copper (vv. 7-9). The first aspect of the good land mentioned here is its water. Concerning this water, first there were the fountains, which were the source, and then the springs and the brooks, the outflow. The water in the good land flowed forth "in valleys and in mountains." This indicates that Christ flows in different environments. We have our ups and downs, but Christ flows both in the ups and in the downs.</P><P>In the good land the children of Israel would have not only water but also an abundance of things to eat. Furthermore, they would have iron and copper out of which to make weapons to use in fighting against the enemy. Thus, in verse 10 Moses said, "You shall eat and be satisfied, and you shall bless Jehovah your God for the good land which He has given to you."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Being Careful Lest<br>They Forget Jehovah Their God<br>by Not Keeping His Commandments,<br>Judgments, and Statutes</H2><P>"Be careful lest you forget Jehovah your God by not keeping His commandments, His judgments, and His statutes, which I am commanding you today" (v. 11). Today we should be careful lest we forget God by not keeping His Christ.</P><P>In verses 12 through 16 Moses continued his warning, telling the people to be careful, lest when they had eaten and were satisfied, and had built houses and dwelt in them, and their herd and their flock had multiplied, and their silver and their gold had multiplied, and all that they had had multiplied, their heart would be lifted up and they would forget Jehovah their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, who led them through the great and awesome wilderness and brought forth water for them out of flint rock, who fed them manna in the wilderness, that He might humble them and test them in order to do good for them in the end. Then Moses went on to warn the people not to say in their heart, "My strength and the might of my hand have gotten me this wealth" (v. 17). Instead, the people were to remember Jehovah their God, for it was He who gave them strength to gain wealth, so that He might establish His covenant (v. 18). Finally, Moses warned them that if they would forget Jehovah their God and go after other gods and serve them and bow down to them, they would surely perish (vv. 19-20).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Deuteronomy &nbsp; pg 36</div><br></body></html>
