In this first lesson we want to cover something that you might never have heard before, something that happened in eternity past
The book of Ephesians tells us that before God created anything, when He was all alone, He had a good pleasure, a heart's desire
God desires this man to be filled with Him as life in order to express Him and have His dominion to represent Him
Before He could do so, Satan, God's enemy, came in to deceive man and to inject his own sinful life and nature into man
Through this, man fell into a pitiful condition, full of sinful acts and a sinful nature which ruined him for God's great purpose
He chose you because He wanted to, because it was His good pleasure to do so, not according to how good or capable you are
In the Bible, this word means two main things: maturity in God's life and the position to inherit all that God is
A child has his father's life, but because he is not full-grown, he cannot inherit all that his father may have to give to him
God has chosen and predestinated you not just to be his child, but eventually to be His son, one who is fully matured in His divine life
Before we go any further, we need to see something of great importance to our understanding of God's full salvation
When so many individual people receive Him as life, they become one with Him, and they are called the church, the Body of Christ
If you read Ephesians 3:9-11, you will see that the church is not a thing that just happened after many individual people were saved
According to Revelation 21 and 22, it will continue on into eternity as the eternal goal and dwelling place of God
They are many individuals who are being filled up with God as their life and are being built up together in Him
Not even the heavens with all of its marvels, nor the earth with all of its beauty, can compare with the church
It was absolutely planned by God in eternity past and carried out in His creation for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose
As you determine to read the Bible to find out more about God and man, you are using your will to make a decision
The soul is the part of man created by God for us to know Him, love Him and turn to Him so we can be saturated with God and express Him
The Bible calls it 'the inner man' and 'the hidden man of the heart' because it is deeper and harder to know than our other two parts
You need your body and soul to exist as a human, but if you have never come to God, you have never used your spirit
To be someone fully according to Gods purpose you also need to learn how to use your spirit to contact God to receive Him and to contain Him
He was not created to make a living or to be good and do good; He was created to express God in His image by being filled up with His life
It is made to express electricity by shining, but if electricity never comes into it, it can never fulfill its function
Though he has been made in Gods image and likeness to express Him man still needs Gods life to come into him before he can truly express God
They did not know God's purpose in creating them, nor did they realize their need to take God into them as life
Even though they had just finished a big feast which lasted all week, they were still hungry and thirsty for something more
In this lesson, we will learn more about these two trees, how man was deceived to eat of the tree of knowledge, and what was the result
While the tree of life represents God's life or God as life to man, the tree of knowledge represents Satan as the source of death
For this reason, he rebelled against God and became God's enemy, always seeking to exalt himself above God and to frustrate God's purpose
Before man could take in God's life, Satan came to Eve, Adam's wife, tempting her to eat of the tree of knowledge
As a result of her being deceived, Eve took of the fruit and ate it, and gave some to her husband, who also ate
The man God had created to contain and express Him as life disobeyed Him and received the satanic life instead
Now, rather than expressing God, the man created by God would express the sinful life and nature of God's enemy, Satan
On the objective side, man transgressed against God's righteousness by disobeying His commandment to not eat of the tree of knowledge
On the subjective side, man took in the satanic life and that life became a poison in him, constituting him a sinner with a sinful nature
The man God loved so much and had created to be His unique container and expression had been completely ruined by this sinful act
If He does not do something, man will die in his sins; he will be condemned by God and will be of no use to Him for His eternal purpose
His problem of disobedience to his mother was objective, having to do with him but not something inside of him
Because of our fall in Adam, our objective problem before God is very great, and we will soon face God's punishment
In God's eyes, when Adam sinned, we were included in this one sin, even though we ourselves may never have sinned in the same way
Because of this, when Adam was judged and came under God's condemnation, we were all judged and came under God's condemnation with him
Eventually, because of Adam's sin, man will be judged by God and cast into the lake of fire to suffer God's judgment for eternity
The Bible tells us that God prepared the lake of fire not for man but for Satan and his fallen angels who followed him to rebel against God
Rather than enjoying God's life and expressing Him, man has been condemned to die and to suffer Satan's judgment with him
By taking in the tree of knowledge, man did not merely do something wrong which could be solved by God's forgiveness
Today, because man's spirit has been deadened, men have lost their ability to contact God, and so many do not believe in Him
His mind became filled with vain thoughts and foolish reasonings that have turned him away from God and His purpose
We can see from this that man was condemned by God outwardly, or objectively, and ruined by the satanic life inwardly, or subjectively
His final destination is the lake of fire, which has been prepared by God for Satan and all those who have followed him
In other words, even if only one person in the whole world were lost, the Lord would still have come to the earth
The Father did not wait for His prodigal because all of His sons had become prodigal; He opened His arms to one prodigal who returned
John 3:1 says, 'See what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and we are
Because of His great love for us, it is guaranteed that we will be filled with His life and fulfill His eternal purpose
Remember, He said in Genesis 2:17 that if the man whom He loved ate of the tree of knowledge, he would surely die
God judged man according to His righteousness after man sinned in the garden of Eden; yet because He loved man, He also promised to save him
The birthright of a young prince is the kingship, that is, to become the king to rule and to enjoy all the privileges of being king
If the prince were kidnapped and taken away to another land, he would lose his birthright, even though he is still the son of the king
As the God-man, He was born of a virgin in Bethlehem, and lived for thirty-three and a half years as a genuine human being, yet without sin
On the third day, He resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit to give life to man, thus fulfilling the promise in Genesis 22:18
All of man's problems with sins before God were solved, and the head of Satan, the serpent who had kidnapped man, was crushed
Now, man can believe in this Jesus to be saved from sin and death, and to receive the life of God to fulfill God's eternal purpose
In this lesson, we begin to cover five objective aspects of God's full salvation that solved our problem before God
Read Ephesians 1:7: 'In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace'
We were destined to die in sin, but now we may come back to God, be forgiven by God, receive God's life, be filled with Him, and express Him
Since we have offended God, we need His forgiveness; yet we cannot be forgiven before His righteousness is fulfilled
Sins refer to offenses, and unrighteousness is the mark, the stain, on our behavior caused by the committing of an offense
Regardless of how righteous we are or how righteous we think we are, our righteousness is just a fraction of an inch high
Although you may be right with everyonewith your parents your children and your friendsyour righteousness will never justify you before God
Because of Christ's one righteous act, His death on the cross for our sins, we are all justified according to God's righteousness
The Apostle Paul said, 'Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ'
Not only so, but we also are boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation'
Regeneration means that in addition to the life we received at our birth, we receive another life, the life of God
It enabled God to redeem, forgive, cleanse and justify man according to His own righteousness, not simply because He loved man
Even if man were completely forgiven and reconciled, he still could not express God without receiving His life
He was a very wise and moral man, but the Lord Jesus told him that he needed to be born of water and of the Spirit
The life of God, which has come from the life-giving Spirit in Christ's resurrection, could be germinated in him
By experiencing the love of God in grace our old heart which formerly was cold and hard toward the Lord is softened to love and desire Him
How can we, the unholy people full of the satanic nature, become holy just by doing or not doing certain things?
In this lesson, we can see that we should not be satisfied with being forgiven or cleansed by God or even with being regenerated
In the process of metabolism an organic element filled with vitamins comes into our being and produces a chemical change in our organic life
If you would confess your sins to the Lord and say, 'Lord, forgive me,' He will come into your soul to transform you
We will be a corporate man in His image to express Him and with His full authority to represent Him for eternity
When we are glorified, we reach the climax of God's full salvation and enter into its full enjoyment for eternity
Colossians 3:4 tells us that 'when Christ our life is manifested, then you also shall be manifested with Him in glory'
It grows into all the parts of our soul and finally it fills and saturates even our physical body making us just like the Lord Jesus Himself
Through God's salvation, we the sinners become the sons of God, full of God's life and glory in order to express Him for eternity!
The result is that you are forgiven, justified, reconciled, and regenerated to become a child of God having His divine life and nature
He will forgive and cleanse us; we will be able to come to Him without any barriers so that His life within us will be free to move and grow
Let's read a few quotes from a booklet entitled 'Assurance, Security, and Joy of Salvation' to see how we are assured of our salvation
He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and Will not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life'
But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born
The Lord Jesus gives to those who receive Him by faith, that is, to those who believe into His name, the authority to become children of God
Loving the brothers in the Lord is an experience in the eternal life of God after we have believed in the Lord to be saved
We are sure that we are saved by the written Word of God, the Spirit's inward witnessing, and our experience of life
At the same time He transforms us from an old man to a new man, from being full of the satanic life to being full of God
Allow Him to spread in you by always following His leading within you and by confessing your sins and shortcomings to Him
Rather, it is a lifelong matter which the Apostle Paul and other writers in the Bible have likened to running a race
In His wisdom He has prepared both a reward for His faithful and diligent children and a punishment for his lazy and disobedient ones
Many people today do not believe that God will punish those believers who have been lazy and unprofitable to the Lord in this life
The Lord is loving and merciful and He will never allow one of His saved children to be lost in the lake of fire
His salvation assures us all that none of His believers will ever suffer the punishment which the unbelievers will suffer
In the passage in Matthew, the Lord clearly rewards His servants for profiting Him and punishes those who do not
According to the Bible, God will reward some of His believers who have been faithful and diligent, and He will punish those who have not
The Bible tells us clearly that at His second coming, the Lord will come to firstly judge all of His believers
Those who have been faithful will be ushered into the kingdom and a wedding feast to enjoy Christ for a thousand years
The unfaithful ones will suffer His punishment by being cast into outer darkness away from the Lord's presence
He placed him in front of the tree of life, but due to Satan's deception he chose to take the tree of knowledge instead
As a result of Adams sinning against God he fell under Gods condemnation objectively and received the satanic nature into Him subjectively
In the New Testament, Jesus, the Savior-God, came and fulfilled all these promises and prophecies given by God
He was incarnated as a man, lived for thirty-three and a half years as a proper human being, and was crucified for our redemption
In this redemption, forgiveness of sins, cleansing of sins, justification and reconciliation were all included
