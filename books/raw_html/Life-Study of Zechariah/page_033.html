<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. It Being Wonderful<br>Both in the Sight of the Remnant of Israel<br>and in the Sight of Jehovah</H2><P>The situation of Jerusalem in the restoration will be so pleasant that it will be wonderful both in the sight of the remnant of Israel and in the sight of Jehovah (v. 6). When the people see the pleasantness of Jerusalem, they may say, "This is wonderful!" and God may say, "Yes, this is wonderful!"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Jehovah Saving His People<br>from the Land of the East<br>and from the Land of the Going Down of the Sun</H2><P>Jehovah is about to save His people from the land of the east and from the land of the going down of the sun and bring them to Jerusalem, and they will dwell in it. They will be Jehovah's people, and Jehovah will be their God in truth and in righteousness (vv. 7-8). I believe that the land of the east is Babylon and that the land of the going down of the sun is Spain, for at that time Spain was considered the uttermost part of the earth, the place of sunset.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Children of Israel<br>Being Encouraged to Be Strong</H2><P>The children of Israel should be strong, those who heard the words from the prophets given in the day when the foundation of the temple was laid so that it might be rebuilt (v. 9). This is a word encouraging the children of Israel to be strong and bold and to finish the work of rebuilding God's house.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. The Remnant of the Children of Israel<br>Earning Wages, and Their Animals Too</H2><P>The remnant of the children of Israel will earn wages, and their animals will too. There will be peace for them to go out or come in. Jehovah will not be to them as He was in the former days (vv. 10-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Jehovah Causing the Remnant<br>of Israel to Inherit Blessings</H2><P>The vine will give forth its fruit; the land will give forth its produce; and the heavens will give their dew, that is, their rain. Jehovah will cause the remnant of Israel to inherit all these blessings (v. 12). Because of these blessings, the entire country will be fruitful and productive for the enjoyment of the people.</P>
