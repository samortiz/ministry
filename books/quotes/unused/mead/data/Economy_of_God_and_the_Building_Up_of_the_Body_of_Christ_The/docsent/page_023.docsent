   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Gates of Hades Not Being Able to Prevail against the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord continued by saying, "the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it the church ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The gates of Hades is the authority of Satan's darkness; it is also the authority of death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, it cannot prevail against the church, for the church is the Body of Christ, the Head, who sits on the throne in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All authority in heaven and on earth is given to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the church is His Body, the gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This ascended Head has already been crowned with glory and honor on the throne Heb 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He has also received authority from God the Father and has been made Lord and Christ Acts 2:36 and the Ruler of the kings of the earth Rev 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now He operates by His Spirit, which is the sevenfold intensified Spirit Rev 4:5; 5:6 , to apply all that He has accomplished and obtained to us for the building up of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the work of Christ in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Heaven, where He is, is joined to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The spirit within us is linked to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The book of Genesis in the Old Testament records the story of Jacob when he dreamed of a heavenly ladder in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the ladder there were angels of God ascending and descending Gen 28:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The heavenly ladder is a type of the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The place where the ladder was set up was called Bethel, and it was the gate of heaven Gen 28:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hebrews 4:16 tells us that we can come boldly to the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are now living on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How then can we come to God's throne in heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The key is the spirit mentioned in verse 12 of Hebrews 4.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Christ who is sitting on the throne in heaven is now also in us Rom 8:10 , that is, in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's dwelling place is this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Bethel is the house of God, the habitation of God, and the gate of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There Christ is the ladder, linking earth to heaven and bringing heaven down to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since our spirit now is God's dwelling place, this spirit is the gate of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here Christ is the ladder, joining us, the people on earth, to heaven and bringing heaven to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes when you wake up in the morning, you feel very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when you call "O Lord Jesus," immediately the ascended Christ will be transmitted into you like electricity, and you will be strengthened within.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes you feel tired and do not want to come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But as soon as you say softly within, "Lord!" something will start moving within you, and you will end up coming to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more you come to the meetings, the more you will be joined to heaven, and the stronger you will become.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the tiredness will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is Christ bringing heaven to us within, enabling us to overcome Satan's might of death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>CHRIST AS THE ASCENDED HEAD GIVING GIFTS TO MEN</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ephesians 4:8-11 shows us that this ascended Head gave gifts to men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After Christ ascended, He first gave some gifted persons to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These gifted persons are people who "stir up" churches and also perfect others to "stir up" more churches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The ascended Head gave four kinds of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first class is the apostles Eph 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These apostles receive the revelation of God's New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church Matt 16:16-18; Gal 1:11-12, 15-16; Eph 3:3-4, 8-11; 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, they receive the revelation, and the revelation makes their spirits burning and causes them to forget about themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They then go out to preach the revelation that others may also be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These apostles also preach the gospel of Christ to save the sinners chosen and called by God, bringing them to Christ Gal 1:16a; Eph 3:8; 2 Cor 11:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They do not preach the superficial gospel, one that tells people about going to heaven instead of hell; rather, they preach to others the all-inclusive Christ as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, the apostles are able to establish local churches and to appoint in them the elders for leading, shepherding, teaching, and overseeing Acts 14:23; 1 Tim 5:17; 1 Pet 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are also able to determine doctrines, to release the truth, to perfect the saints, and to build up the Body of Christ 1 Tim 2:7; Eph 4:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These are the four things that an apostle should do.</S>
