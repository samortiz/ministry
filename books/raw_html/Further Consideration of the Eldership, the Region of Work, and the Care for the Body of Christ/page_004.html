<P>The door is also wide open to the Lord's recovery in Russia. We have signed the order to have altogether one and a half million books printed in Russian. Some brothers there promised us that they had the means to distribute these books all the way from Moscow to Vladivostok. If one hundred proper brothers (not only qualified but also proper) went there, fifty churches could be raised up within a short time. But where are the proper brothers among us? Throughout the years, we have had many promising young ones, many crops, but when they were growing up, they got cut off by their pride.</P><P>The turmoil through which we have recently passed has become a cycle in the Lord's recovery. Nearly every seven to ten years there has been a turmoil to damage the crop. In 1978 there was a storm which cut off some good brothers. Then three years ago there was another turmoil. Some useful ones were cut off through this recent turmoil.</P><P>In the past Brother Nee warned us. He said that many pieces of pottery will be broken in the process of finishing the pottery. These ones who have been involved in this recent turmoil have been spoiled like this broken pottery. These dear ones could have been very useful, but their potential usefulness has been spoiled.</P><P>At the beginning of their church life in the recovery, they were quite humble and poor in spirit. They were under the ministry to be taught, nourished, and raised up. They really learned something, and they had a certain capacity from the Lord by His mercy. But they eventually began to be deceived, trying to overthrow the present ministry in the Lord's recovery. They were like a crop going on quite well, a crop which gave much expectation to the farmers. But a hailstorm came suddenly to damage that crop. This happened during my absence from the United States. A hailstorm came and damaged the crop. Once the crop gets damaged in this way, there is no way to recover it.</P><P>I have seen this several times in our history in the Lord's recovery in mainland China. When I was sent out of mainland China, we did not have many useful, proper brothers to bear the burden because of this kind of continual damage through pride. The enemy damages the recovery firstly by people's pride.</P><P>This is why I want to warn the young ones. Today a young brother may be very humble and obedient because he is learning. But we do not have the assurance that he will be the same after seven or ten years. We do not know what the result will be with this young brother. Pride is a big killer used by Satan. Satan may not take advantage of a young one while he is learning. But after a number of years, when this brother is just entering into the years of being useful in the hand of the Lord, Satan will seek to take him as prey through his pride. This is why we are short of hands today in this time of urgent need. I hope that you young people would be impressed that the enemy is crouching, waiting for the opportunity to take you as his prey. After some years, you will have learned something, and some capacity will be there. You will be useful. That will be the time for you to get caught by the enemy.</P>
