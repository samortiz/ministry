The first thing that happened in the degradation of the church was the turning away from the apostles' teaching
Asia was a province of the Roman Empire in Asia Minor, far away from Rome where Paul, who was in prison, was writing his Epistle to Timothy
Among the churches in Asia was the church in Ephesus, which was fully established by Paul's ministry as recorded in Acts 19
They received the gospel, the teaching, the edification, and the establishment from the ministry of the Apostle Paul
Because they turned away from Paul's ministry, the churches in Asia declined into a situation full of degradation
The degradation of the churches in Asia as recorded in Revelation 2 and 3 was due to their turning away from the proper ministry
Within thirty years after Paul's final Epistle to Timothy, these churches had reached such a point of degradation
Although they were weak, the Lord still appraised them highly, telling them that they had a little power and that they had kept the word
To turn away from the proper teaching is a terrible thing that will result in degradation and in picking up other teachings
If we turn from the ministry and seek to produce something different, we may give place to differing teachings
If the leading ones in a local church lay before the saints the riches contained in the Lifestudies the saints will be abundantly nourished
It is a fact of history in the Lord's recovery that any church which follows the ministry is strong and blessed
If you, then, speak something that is off from the ministry, surely the recovery will not follow that speaking
It is a dream to think that the entire recovery will follow the speaking that is different from that of the ministry
We have taught very strongly that each local church is not a Body of Christ; all the churches together are the one Body
If you speak something contrary to the taste of the Lords recovery your speaking will be rejected and you will be the first to suffer loss
Those who teach differently are not wise, for they do not know the environment, situation, and condition of the Lord's recovery
If you try to change the taste of the saints, you will be foolish, you will waste your time, and you will cause damage
If you feel that your teaching is better than that in the Lord's recovery, you should serve your 'food' to those who have a taste for it
For the long run in their daily living they will eat what matches their taste and reject what is contrary to it
If you can give messages that fit the taste of the Lord's recovery without using the Life-study Messages, that would be wonderful
Ministry in the biblical usage means to serve people with something, just as a waiter in a restaurant serves people with the courses of food
At the conclusion of his writing ministry, Paul wrote 1 Timothy to inoculate the church against all these poisons
There is a proverb which says, 'One sentence can build up the nation and one sentence can destroy the entire nation'
As we have seen, Paul tells Timothy in 1 Timothy 1:3 that he left him there in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently
We would all agree that to teach the way of Judaism is surely wrong, but what about teaching how to preach the gospel?
There is only one unique ministry that is justified, promoted, uplifted, and even glorified in the New Testament
In 1 Timothy 1:4 Paul went on to tell Timothy what those ones who were teaching differently should be occupied with-God's economy
Is there anything wrong with teaching people the Bible, with teaching people theology, or with teaching people how to preach the gospel?
The reason why their teachings were received is because they were scriptural things from the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament
We must realize that this is not a matter of being wrong or right, but it is a matter of 'cutting Christ's Body into pieces'
We may insist, stress, and emphasize a scriptural item which seemingly is right, yet actually it cuts the Body of Christ
If all the Christians today would be willing for the Lord to take away their different ministries, they would all be one
In the four Gospels Jesus Christ carried out God's ministry, and in the first part of Acts, Peter continued that ministry
In the second part of Acts, Paul's ministry was a continuation of Peter's to carry out God's New Testament ministry
In Antioch Paul was facing the number one apostle, Peter, and he was facing representatives of the most influential apostle, James
When some representatives came from James, Peter became a hypocrite and pretended that he had not eaten with the Gentiles
Not only was that a judgment on the rebellious Israel, but it was also the destruction of the base of Peter's work and of James' influence
If you look at todays situation you will realize that there are many different ministries in addition to this unique New Testament ministry
All of us need to learn this sober lesson and be on the alert not to deviate from the ministry of the New Testament
In Matthew 9 the disciples of John came to question the Lord Jesus, and they included the Pharisees along with themselves in their question
Before that time, the Pharisees were one sect, and there was another sect, a heretical sect, called the Sadducees
We need to realize that for John to be put into prison was sovereign of the Lord, and even for John to be beheaded was sovereign of the Lord
We must believe that God is sovereign, and we need to consider soberly why God allowed John to be imprisoned and later beheaded
The account of the shining of Moses' face in Exodus 34 does not tell us why Moses covered his face with a veil
According to Paul's interpretation in 2 Corinthians 3:13, Moses was afraid that the people would see the termination of his ministry
We all are happy to be used by the Lord in a certain service, but none of us would be willing to see that service come to an end
It was this kind of trouble that forced God, the sovereign One, to allow John to be imprisoned and even to have his life terminated
After John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus continued God's New Testament ministry, and He thoroughly accomplished that part of the ministry
On the day of Pentecost Peter used one of the two keys to open the gate for the Jewish people to enter into God's New Testament kingdom
When God was going on to use him with the second key to open the door for the Gentiles this contradicted Peter's background and tradition
Peter had the Spirit dwelling within him inwardly, but he could not understand the indwelling because of his background and his tradition
Peter had the outward outpouring of the Spirit and also the inward indwelling of the Spirit, but he could not understand the indwelling
Especially in the second one, he was very genuine and bold, because he recommended one who had rebuked him to his face
From what we have seen in the Life-studies of James and Mark, we can realize that even the situation in Acts 15 was not entirely pure
In other words, we could say that the weakness that was there in chapter fifteen was exposed in chapter twenty-one
In Acts 21 James was very bold to declare that there were tens of thousands of Jewish believers in Jerusalem zealous for the law
Some may argue that Paul was not weak, but that he was very strong to keep his word that to the Jews he became a Jew
It was very good for Paul to write the Epistles, such as Ephesians, Philippians, and the others written while he was imprisoned
Surely Barnabas was not a Judaizer, but because of his opinion, he took his way to carry out the so-called ministry
His ministry became a problem there, not because of Peter, but simply because there was such a thing as Peter's ministry
In Corinth, Peter's ministry and its following and Apollos's ministry and its following created a problem that almost caused a division
In any case, at Corinth there were problems due to these three kinds of service, that of Peter, of Apollos, and of Paul
We could not see in the Scriptures that Apollos was one hundred percent one with Paul in God's New Testament economy
The first meeting of the Lord's table in the Lord's recovery took place with Brother Nee and another brother and his wife
Eventually that brother became a problem to Brother Nee because he was not one with him in God's move at that time in China
If you are thoroughly one hundred percent one with me, we are like a roof that has no crack for the rain to come in
There was a reason for the problem in Corinth where some said, 'I am of Cephas,' 'I am of Apollos,' and 'I am of Paul'
Such a thing could happen there simply because the atmosphere, the flavor, the color, and the spirit among the three were not one
In the climate of the Lord's recovery today, there are some signs that some storms may come if we do not exercise our carefulness
In Pauls word to the Corinthians in 1 Corinthians 148 he was referring to the matter of speaking in tongues with a definite interpretation
He said that if there is not a definite interpretation of a persons tonguespeaking this is like sounding the trumpet with an uncertain sound
We may think that these are small things which are not related to the Lord's Person, to His deity, to His divinity, or to His Godhead
Some of the so-called workers, the leading ones, like to think that they can take another line, not following the one line in the ministry
They may consider this and speaking in tongues without a definite interpretation small matters which we do not need to pay attention to
We have to have our loins girded with Christ , and we have to wear Christ as a pair of shoes for our standing to fight the battle
In modern history there have been two world wars, but we must realize that the church today is undertaking a universal war
Most of their study is confined to a single galaxy, but many, many millions of galaxies and beyond form the space in which we are fighting
In his talk concerning the interpretation of tongues, he used an illustration-the sounding of a trumpet for the battle
Whether or not a certain church takes the ministry does not decide whether that church is a genuine local church
The title of this message does not say 'no uncertain sounding of the trumpet in the Lord's recovery' but 'in the Lord's ministry'
The citizens of the United States may say many things to criticize the government and the commander in chief of the Armed Forces
All the saints who have left the denominations, the divisive sects, and stand on the proper ground are a local church in their locality
To say that the ministry cannot depend upon a certain church does not mean that that church has been cut off from being a local church
For this reason, this ministry cannot allow anyone to pretend to be in it and yet still say something different
Paul never tried to force all the churches to follow him in his ministry, but Paul surely had a ministry for the churches
At Pentecost the current began to flow out of Jerusalem through Judea, through Samaria, and went up to Antioch
On the way of their first journey however the Spirit records that Paul began to take the lead and the Spirit began to refer to Saul as Paul
From this point on Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, took the lead in the apostolic ministry all the way, and Barnabas accepted that
Right after that solution was made as a decree to all the churches, there was a contention between Barnabas and Saul
They did not separate from each other because of a different opinion concerning the faith or concerning the headship of Christ
To us that is a small thing, but after Barnabas left Paul with Mark there is no more record of him in the Lord's move in the book of Acts
There is no hint that Apollos intended to carry on another flow, but whatever he was and whatever he did gave people a different impression
When Gideon was called to take the army to fight the battle for Jehovah, the Lord told him that he had too many
You may be a member of a local church and yet have nothing to do with the ministry to fight the battle for the Lord's interest on this earth
If you are only for your part of the world this may disappoint you, but if you are for the Lord's recovery you'll say, 'Amen'!
It is clear in the New Testament that Paul was taking the lead in the Lord's New Testament ministry on the earth at that time
He surely worked for the Lord's recovery, and he has made a good, proper, and adequate foundation for this recovery
Many of you who have given up high degrees and high positions for the Lord's recovery have to be faithful to your sacrifice
When we were on mainland China, only Brother Nee had a publication, and the Gospel Room belonged solely and uniquely to him
They may contain some biblical doctrines, but any point of life or light has been adopted from the publications of Living Stream Ministry
My intention in calling a writers' conference was to encourage you to write something, but not in the way that came out
Every human being on the earth needs to hear the truth, but our spreading of the precious truths we have received has been strongly limited
The points in our publications are full of life and light, but these brothers would not present them as they are
The Lord has commissioned us with His recovery, and He has surely opened up the New Testament to reveal many dear and precious truths to us
What the Lord needs is for thousands of His dear saints who love Him, who live to Him, and who know nothing but His recovery to take one way
If we spread these truths, we will become the faithful servants to serve food to the Lord's people at the appointed time
The Bible shows us very clearly that in Noah's age there was only one ministry; yet many ministers were there together building the ark
During the age of Moses, God desired to build the tabernacle with its furniture, the most important of which was the ark
In this ministry there was not only Moses himself Moses was one of many ministers and undeniably he was the leading one in that ministry
At that time, there were not two different ministries building the temple; hence, there were not two different leaderships
Anyone who had a part in the ministry of building the temple, including the stone-cutters and stone-movers, was a minister in that ministry
Now we have already seen clearly that the ministry spoken of in the Bible does not refer to a person, but to God's building work
Is it in the Orthodox church the Catholic church the Protestant denominations the state churches the private churches or the free groups
His present speaking is not concerning presbytery, baptism by immersion, tongue-speaking, gifts, healings, or evangelical movements
Peter was surely the apostle as the leader of the Lord's move at the day of Pentecost because he was a person who knew God's speaking
Whoever has God's speaking concerning the entire teaching of God's New Testament economy are the leading ones in His move
