<h2 class="head1">BEING BESIDE OURSELVES IN OFFERING</h2><p>The Bible also tells us about many people who were beside themselves in offering up their possessions and houses. Acts 4 mentions the disciples selling their all and laying the money they received at the apostles' feet (v. 34). Many people agree that we should be zealous, but they say that we should be careful, balanced, and not go to extremes. Yet throughout the past two thousand years, all those who have truly consecrated themselves to the Lord were men who risked everything to offer up themselves. The more a person loves the Lord, the more he consecrates. One brother asked me, "How can you love the Lord so much, and why can't I love Him as much?" I said, "If you give your money to the Lord, you will love Him. The Lord said that where your treasure is, there is your heart also." If you want your heart to follow the Lord, your money must first go to the Lord. When your money goes into the offering box, and you say, "Amen," your heart will go with it as well.</p><p>In Shanghai two sisters who were nurses each earned less than a hundred dollars a month. They saved their wages in the bank. After they heard the Lord's word, they were moved in their heart, and one after the other offered up all their savings.</p><p>Today many people are planning too much for themselves. They are not willing to offer up their all. They make reservations for themselves. The result is that the gospel has lost its impact. During every great revival in history, we find men who were beside themselves in loving the Lord, who risked all to offer up themselves. I am not exhorting you to give everything to the Lord, but you must be a person who is fully consecrated to the Lord.</p><p>One elderly sister once came to Mr. George Müller and said, "My seventieth birthday is approaching. By that time I will have saved enough money to buy a coat. This has been my wish for many years. I have been saving since I was forty-two years old, and I have been looking forward to the day when I would have such a coat. I have waited twenty-eight years. Today I can finally buy it. However, the Lord is touching me to offer up these fifteen pounds." When Mr. Müller heard this, he felt that this would cost the elderly sister too much, and he wondered whether she would later regret it. He dared not accept that money. Yet the sister was quite resolute and determined to offer it up. Later, Mr. Müller testified that he had thought that it was difficult for poor people to love the Lord. But the Lord had died for all, and when one was touched by the Lord, even a savings of twenty-eight years meant nothing to her anymore.</p><p>A few years ago I was working in Southeast Asia for a period of four months. At the end of my visit, we had a meeting. After the meeting, two children came to me while we were drinking tea. One was eight years old, and the other was twelve years old. They told me that they wanted to offer something. One handed me six dollars, and the other handed me eight dollars. This was the amount they had earned for their work during summer vacation. They intended to use that money to buy themselves a pair of shoes, but on that day they decided to offer it up for the Lord. I did not know if they were clear about what they were doing, and I asked their uncle if they were really offering this money. He told me that they were serious. It was hard for me to take that money. That money was the hard-earned money of the children. They had paid a great price to earn it. Since they were going to offer it to the Lord, I could not return it to them. I had to accept it, but I said to the Lord, "This is money from the children's sweat and blood. If I do not use it in the right way, I will be sinning before You."</p><p>Today we want all the young people to offer their time to the Lord. At the same time, we want them to offer themselves fully to the Lord. Some may have to give themselves to make money for the Lord. Such ones have to do their best to earn and offer. (Of course, we must earn our money through righteous means.) Some may have to offer themselves to serve the Lord full-time. We need both kinds of people. Does not the gospel need to be preached in many places? Is not the church taking the right path? If there were no need to preach the gospel, and if the church were on the wrong path, we could keep our money and save it for our own use. But if the gospel needs to be preached, and if the church is on the right path, we have to be beside ourselves for the Lord. We have to recalibrate the focus of our living. Formerly, we earned money for ourselves. Today everything has to be for the Lord. God's work in China should not be limited to the coastal regions or only to the Kwangtung and Kwangsi provinces. There are vast regions in the interior of China which have never heard the gospel. We have to rise up and be beside ourselves. We have to be beside ourselves in the preaching of the gospel and in offering up our all.</p>
