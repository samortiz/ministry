   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jacob was Esau s twin brother.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He struggled with Esau while they were yet in their mother s womb Gen 25:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the time of delivery came, the two fought to be born first in order to obtain the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When they were born, Jacob, who was the loser in the struggle, held on to the heel of the winner, Esau Gen 25:24-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even before they were born, God had already told their mother that the elder would serve the younger Gen 25:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This signifies that God had chosen Jacob, who was born second, to be the firstborn son, and that Esau, who was born first, had failed to obtain the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the two were not yet born, before they had done anything good or bad, God chose Jacob, that the purpose of God according to selection might remain, not of works, but of Him who calls Rom 9:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the history of Jacob, the divine revelation in the Bible points out especially this aspect.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, the Bible calls Christ the second Man 1 Cor 15:47 , indicating that He is spiritual and heavenly, that He comes from God, and that He is God s delight.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a second example, our regenerated man is the second man; it is spiritual, unlike the one from our natural birth, which is the first, is earthy, and is natural.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jacob, the younger son, the second, symbolizes the natural man who has been regenerated to become the spiritual man, who is loved by God Rom 9:13 .</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The promise that all the families of the earth would be blessed was given first to Abraham and then to Isaac; here, it was mentioned to Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God gave Jacob this promise so that the promise given to Abraham and to Isaac might be established and continued in him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, Jacob was one who inherited the promise, and all his descendants also were descendants who received the promise Rom 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The promise that God gave to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with his descendants was related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is the seed promised by God in whom all the families of the earth would be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To become the blessing to all the nations on earth, He, as the embodiment of the Triune God, became flesh, passed through human living, accomplished redemption, died and was resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit that He might enter into all who believe into Him to be their supreme blessing.</S>
