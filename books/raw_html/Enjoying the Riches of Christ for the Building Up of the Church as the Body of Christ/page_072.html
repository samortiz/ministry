<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE RECOVERY OF GOD’S BUILDING</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Ezra 1:3, 5, 7, 11; 2:1; 3:1-6, 8-13; 4:1-5; 5:1-2</h1><h2 class=head1>A FULL TYPE OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>In this message we come to a wonderful point that we call the Lord’s recovery. Ezra is a book of recovery, and today we also are in the time of recovery. Whatever is written in the New Testament concerning the church is typified in the Old Testament. In other words, in the Old Testament there is a full type of the church life. Regrettably, however, many Christians today do not pay attention to the type of the church.<p>Those Christians who do know that the history of Israel is a type of the church apply mainly the things that happened in the beginning of the history of Israel to the Christian life. They know, for example how to apply the Passover and the exodus out of Egypt to the Christian life. They may also know that the crossing of the Red Sea was a type of today’s baptism by water, and they know how to apply the eating of manna during the wandering in the wilderness. These are the things that happened at the beginning of the history of Israel. Not many Christians, however, know how to apply to the Christian life the things that happened at the end of the history of Israel. It is not fair to apply only the beginning and not the end of the history of Israel. The entire history of Israel was a full, complete, and entire type of the church life. At the end of the history of Israel there was a captivity, and after the captivity there was the return. Today also is a day of captivity, on the one hand, and of recovery, a return, on the other hand.<p>At the time of Solomon the temple was built, the glory of God filled the temple, and all the people of Israel were one to worship God. That was wonderful. However, the day of degradation came, and the enemy came from Babylon to destroy the city, burn the temple, capture the people, and carry away all the vessels of the house of God to Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar even put all the things of the worship of God into the idol temple. This was the captivity. Then after seventy years the Lord came in and told the people to go back. The people returned, and after they returned, they rebuilt first the altar and then the temple. This happened in the last part of the history of Israel.<p>We must look into church history to see what this typifies. The day of Pentecost was the day of glory. The temple in the New Testament, which is the church, was built, and the glory of God filled the church. However, that did not last very long. The day of degradation came in once again, and the church was damaged, destroyed, and scattered into captivity. History tells us that from a certain time captivity after captivity took place, and with captivity there is always the scattering, the divisions. We praise the Lord that at the end time the Lord has come back to recover and to call His people to return to today’s Jerusalem. We need to return to rebuild the church, to recover the building of God’s house on this earth. By the foregoing simple word we can see the type of the church and its fulfillment. With the history of Israel we have the type, and with the situation of today’s church we have the fulfillment.
