   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Authority in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to live in the Body, we also have to recognize the authority in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In a body, there is surely authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our human body is very orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the same way, God has placed the members, each one of them, in the Body 1 Cor 12:18 and has blended them together 1 Cor 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every member has his own place ordained by God, and everyone should be in order.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a fact with which we have to come to terms.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By doing so, we will neither overestimate ourselves nor despise others, and we will not have any complaints or feel mistreated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the members are under the authority in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the matter of the authority in the Body, first and foremost is the need for the authority of the Head flowing throughout the whole Body Eph 5:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In addition, there is deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the local churches there are the elders 1 Tim 5:17a , and in the work there are the leading co-workers 1 Cor 3:10a .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these are deputy authorities, carrying out the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, in the Body of Christ there is also order in authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the one hand, all the members submit directly to the Head Eph 5:24a .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the other hand, they submit to the deputies of the Head Heb 13:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we feel that we are submitting directly to the Head, we must also care for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is impossible for us to say that we are submitting to the authority of the Head without caring for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to take care of both aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should submit to Christ, and we should also submit to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only then is the submission proper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we would only submit to Christ, without submitting to the Body, that kind of submission will cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If no one cares for the Body, but everyone considers that he is submitting to the Head directly, division will result in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only by our submitting to the Head on the one hand and to the Body on the other hand can the Head be pleased and the Body preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Authority of the Spirit and the Body</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Following this, we have to consider the authority of the Spirit and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, we can see that the Spirit is Christ and is therefore the embodiment of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today, He is living and moving in the members Rom 8:11, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, if we are to live the Body life, we must submit to the Spirit and walk according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Otherwise, we are not living in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A person who lives in the Body must surely submit to the Spirit, for to submit to the Spirit is to accept the authority of the Head in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Members' Feeling for the Body</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since we are the members of the Body of Christ, we should have a feeling for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First, we must take the feeling of the Head as our own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Philippians 1:8 Paul said, "I long after you all in the inward parts of Christ Jesus.''</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that Paul took the inward parts of Christ Jesus as his own inward parts in caring for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This also means that he took care of the Body of Christ by taking Christ's feeling as his own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ's feeling became his feeling for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all should be like Paul, taking the feeling of the Head as our own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is most necessary for our living the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, we should not only take the feeling of the Head as our feeling, but also do so in the principle of caring for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul said in 1 Corinthians 12:25b-26 that "the members should have the same care for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if a member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it.''</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order for us to have the Body life, we must care for our fellow members and must be full of feeling for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we as members have the feeling of the Head in everything and care for the Body, we will take the Body as the rule in our mind, thoughts, words, and actions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should deny ourselves and should identify ourselves with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By doing this, there will be no separation or disconnection from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The life that we live will fully be the Body life, and the Lord will gain the expression of His Body.</S>
