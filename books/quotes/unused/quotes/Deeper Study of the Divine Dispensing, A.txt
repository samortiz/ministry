Chapters one and two contain messages given in Kota Kinabulu on the divine dispensing as seen from the Gospel of John
Chapters eight to ten are composed of messages given in Kuching on the divine dispensing as seen from 1 and 2 Corinthians
Chapters eleven to fifteen comprise the messages given in Petaling Jaya on the divine dispensing as seen from Ephesians
We still prefer holiness to being common, and we all want to be righteous and do not want to make mistakes or to wrong others
For this reason, He created man, not only according to His image, but with a spirit, so that man can receive Him and express Him
Only after we have understood the Bible a little will we understand ourselves, for it is the Bible that has unveiled to us God's revelation
It tells us that God created man according to His image with the purpose that He would enter into the created man
He wants to have a corporate man, who is the church, as His counterpart, His Body, for His corporate expression
These people become His believers, and He gathers them together in His life in various localities to be the churches in those places
In the Bible, the book that speaks most thoroughly and clearly concerning God being triune is the Gospel of John
In order that the whole melon could enter into the children through their little mouths, it had to pass through this process
Not only does the melon need to be dispensed, but it must also be digested and assimilated into the constitution of man
In John 14, one of the Lord's disciples, Philip, said to the Lord, 'Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us'
The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son becoming the Spirit is realized in the believers
The Triune God has dispensed Himself into us to become our portion, so that we can enjoy Him as our everything in the Divine Trinity
John 1 shows us that the Word who was God from the beginning became flesh and came among men, full of grace and reality
On the night of resurrection the Lord came into the midst of the disciples and breathed into them a breath saying Receive the Holy Spirit
Through this dispensing which is without measure, the processed Triune God is injected into us to become our all
As such He is the mingling of the Holy Spirit bearing the divine nature with the Lords incarnation human living crucifixion and resurrection
In this compound Spirit, there is divinity, humanity, the effectiveness of Christ's death, and the fragrance of His resurrection
Lord, calm our hearts, that we may be fully open to You, and may be fully delivered out of ourselves into Your Spirit
Later they returned to a small village in Galilee, Nazareth, where He spent thirty years in the house of a poor family
After three and a half years He was betrayed bound and condemned and He was crucified on the mount of Golgotha outside the city of Jerusalem
He is the grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died, releasing the divine life and bearing the many grains
In this Spirit there is divinity, humanity, the human living of Jesus, and His all-inclusive death with His resurrection power
The Spirit as the holy ointment anointing us within enables us to partake of all the elements of the Triune God
It tells them further that although the world is full of sufferings, they can trust in Him, learn to do good, and glorify God
Today, Jesus is not only our Redeemer and our Savior, He is also the dispensing God, dispensing Himself into all those who believe in Him
When He is dispensed into us, the believers, He becomes our grace and our reality, so that we have substance and are no longer empty
At any time, when a person believes in Him and calls on His name, He will enter into this one and will become his life and everything to him
John 20:22 says that when the Lord Jesus came into the midst of the disciples, He said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
To breathe in the name of the Lord Jesus is not only to breathe in the Lord as air, but to drink of the pneumatic Christ as the living water
He told the tempter that man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God
In the end, the supply you receive will not only be in your spirit, but will also be in your mind, emotion, and will
Not only can we pray-read two verses in the morning, but during the whole day we can always call on the Lord's name
We must not be affected by some teachings that say that one must fast or abstain from sleep before something will happen
Individually speaking, we the believers have God's life to live God's glorious living, that is, a living that lives out God Himself
Corporately speaking, when the saints come together, they live a living that glorifies God, which is the church life
The Father is in the Son, the Son becomes the Spirit, and the Spirit enters into us to be the reality of the Triune God
At the very beginning, it tells us that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God
If we receive Him, we will be regenerated; that is, we will receive the life of God in addition to having our life in the flesh
In this way, we will grow, we can bear the fruit of life, and out from us there will flow rivers of living water
The Spirit becomes the word, bringing with Him the abundant life, flowing out of us as the rivers of living water'
We can say that the main thing Paul's Epistles cover is the mystery of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
He was resurrected in the Father's glory, and He delivered us out of sin and death so that we can live in the newness of God's life
Based on his spiritual experience, Paul discovered that there is a law in the universe, which is the law of the Spirit of life
When God created man, He created him according to His own image, that is, according to what He is: love, light, holiness, and righteousness
The only difference is that His love light holiness and righteousness are divine whereas our love light holiness and righteousness are human
Although our ancestor sinned and has caused man to fall into sin, deep within us there is still love, light, holiness, and righteousness
When this life enters into man, he has Satan's nature, and he inherits another law, which is the law of evil and sin
Among the ancient Chinese philosophers, some said that man's nature is good, and others said that man's nature is evil
In a fallen man, there are these two opposing laws, one that compels him to do good, and the other that compels him to do evil
He forbids man to worship idols, and He tells man to honor his parents, not to kill, steal, commit fornication, or be covetous
The all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit will enter into us to be our life, and there will be a wonderful change
After we are saved, though we may still look like the same persons, actually, within us, another One is added, who is the Lord Jesus
After we have believed in the Lord and been saved, as far as the inner man goes, we are all the same; we are all people with God within us
In the same way, after we have believed in the Lord Jesus, it is wrong for us to try to do anything by our own effort
The law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8 has a capacity which operates in us daily to revive us and to allow us to overcome
We do not need to be revived and to overcome by ourselves, and we do not need to strive by ourselves to do good
Romans 6:13 tells us to present ourselves to God, and to present our members as weapons of righteousness to God
When you encounter difficulties or trials, you should especially learn to call from the depths of your being, 'O Lord Jesus'!
In our daily lives, it is difficult for us not to come into conflict with others or not to encounter unhappy incidences
Because of King Herod's jealousy, He escaped to Egypt and later returned to settle in Galilee, living in the little town of Nazareth
In addition, the Lord showed her that true worship is to drink of God as the living water and to contact in spirit God who is the Spirit
He wants us to worship in spirit and in reality, which is to drink of Him as the thirst-quenching living water
Every Lords Day our breaking of bread for the remembrance of the Lord is not a form of worship but an eating drinking and enjoyment of God
Rather, He wants us to open ourselves up and to contact Him with our spirit, eating and drinking Him in spirit
From His incarnation to His becoming the life-giving Spirit, every step was for the accomplishment of His dispensing
He has become the Spirit, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, for the purpose that we would partake of His divine dispensing
He is the Holy Spirit, the Triune God, Jesus Christ, becoming life and everything to those who believe and receive Him
For this reason, we need His daily salvation so that we can be a person with God and can live a life that is above that of ordinary men
The reason for this is that God wanted to have many sons who would have His life and who would be His expression
The ultimate purpose of God is to work Himself into us that He may be our life and everything to us so that one day we can become Him
When God became flesh and came to earth, He was both God and man, a wonderful God-man, having both divinity and humanity
After we are regenerated, this picture becomes the 'real' person, having His life and nature, and being the same as He is
May there be word upon word and Spirit upon Spirit so that every one of us would meet You and be touched by You
It was not until He passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, death, and resurrection that He revealed this matter to man
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
In this way, He became a sinless God-man, being the complete God as well as the perfect man, having divinity as well as humanity
At that time, the disciples knew that the Son was in the Father, the disciples were in the Son, and the Son was in the disciples
Paul also revealed to us in his epistles that we who are created by God are tripartite men, composed of spirit, soul, and body
When we go to school to receive an education, we are satisfying the need of the soul, so that we can have a strong soul
If we are right in all three parts of our being we will be persons who are healthy in our body strong in our soul and bright in our spirit
In Romans 8:9-10 Paul said, 'But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you
If we allow the Spirit of the Triune God to dwell in us, in our experience we will not be in the flesh but in the spirit
How does the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-work Himself into the tripartite man of spirit, soul, and body?
When you see an electric fan turning, you know that there is a law of electricity operating within the electric fan
Some have prayed much for the Lord to help them and to strengthen them so that they can honor their parents and control their temper
You need to see that one fact has been accomplished-that the electricity from the power plant has been installed into this house
For this reason we need to ask the Lord to enlighten our understanding and to turn our prayer so that we will not beg in a poor way anymore
In this way, there is an organic union between Him and us, a union in which He continually dispenses and we continually receive
The Triune God is not only our life, but He is also a law that is full of operations in order to continually dispense Himself into us
When we believe in the Lord, another law enters into us, which is the Triune God coming into us to be our life
In the same way, we human beings have the element, the nature, the capacity, the effect and the form of the human life
We do not have much concept that we need God's life, that is, to have the life of God in addition to our original human life
In the physical world, the grafting of branches is a simple matter which perfectly symbolizes this union of two lives into one life
If we graft the branches of the good tree onto the poor peach tree, the union of the two will produce large and sweet fruit
That which is large is grafted onto that which is small, and that which is small is mingled with that which is large
Unfortunately, although many of us are saved, we are not very clear about this matter, and do not know what is the real Christian life
The Triune God has been processed and has entered into us to be life in our tripartite being, that is, in our spirit, soul, and body
Under God's leading and shepherding, he eventually became God's mature prince, worshipping God and blessing others
He had subjected his natural life to God's life, and he had allowed God's life to regulate him within continually
There is only one thing that He did quickly, and that is in Luke 15 when He ran out to embrace the prodigal son
The Divine Trinity as the law of the Spirit of life is regulating us in a gentle way, dispensing the Triune God into us
Sin lends strength to the fallen body to commit sin, but death causes the corrupted body to be fully weakened and powerless
If we go along with the law of the Spirit of life, spontaneously we will be saved from the mortality of the body
Only by living according to the law of the Spirit of life can we be saved gradually from everything common and from the worldly thoughts
The more you fellowship with the Lord, the more your view, taste, and attraction for the common things will be gone
A low manner of living is one that is jealous of others that has no love that remembers only others shortcomings and that does not forgive
The law of sin and death causes us to sin, to love the world, to be common, to be defiled, and to be powerless in doing good
On the other hand, it enables us to reign in life and to subdue everything that is contrary to God's righteousness, holiness, and glory
Anything contrary to God's righteousness, holiness, and glory is subdued by the law of the Spirit of life when we go along with it
All these are the results of the continual dispensing and unceasing regulation of the Divine Trinity as the law of the Spirit of life in us
When we read the book of Romans, we can readily find out that its record is from the circumference to the center
As a result, the human body became corrupted and degenerated into the flesh, bringing mortality, aging, and dying with it
After he becomes old and is in his seventies or eighties, he may not like others to celebrate his birthday anymore
While we are living on the earth, we are frequently defiled by the filth of the world, and subconsciously we become common
Romans 12 also shows us that a person who lives in the church and in the Body of Christ should have a high standard of living
As the law of the Spirit of life, the Triune God also has His image, which is the image of the firstborn Son of God
Christ is God's firstborn Son, and in the end, we will become His many sons, being exactly the same as the firstborn Son, Christ
When Christ comes again, we will receive the full sonship, which is the transfiguration of our body to be the same as His glorious body
The result is that this body will be transfigured and will become the same as the resurrected and glorious body of His Son
The Triune God is anointing us unceasingly in this way, bringing into us the element of God so that we grow and are transformed
At the time we repented and believed, He had sought us out and had separated us from other sinners, convicting us concerning sin
Both the renewing and the transformation are the result of the operation of the Triune God as the law of the Spirit of life in us
Not only will our minds be renewed and our souls transformed, but we will also be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God
Death will be swallowed up by life, corruption will be swallowed up by incorruption, and our body will be fully redeemed
In the Old Testament, before John the Baptist came and before Jesus Christ was born, everything was revealed and was not a mystery
Today we are all sitting here without a special reason, and we are so warm towards each other, singing, shouting, praying, and interceding
After the Bible was written, it was translated into all kinds of languages on earth, and now everyone can read it
We read the Bible and we knew about the phrase the law of the Spirit of life but we did not know what this law of the Spirit of life was
At that time, he was the head of the nursing department of the Peking Hospital, the most famous hospital of the time
During the conversation, one doctor said, 'We cannot deny that, structurally speaking, the human body is too mysterious
Through observing the fact that an apple always falls down and does not go up, Newton discovered the law of gravity
Because the light of the Lord's truth among us has been shining brighter and brighter, we are clearer and clearer concerning this matter
In addition, in our fallen flesh, there is the law of sin and of death, which wars with the law of good in our mind and which captures us
The law of God outside of us is objective, and the law of good as well as the law of sin and death within us are subjective
In the beginning when God created man, He created for him not only a soul and a body, but also a spirit within his deepest part
Paul discovered that when he believed into the Lord Jesus, the Triune God entered into his spirit to be his life
Spontaneously, a law will be there doing the work of digestion gently and slowly, making the food our nutrients and our constitution
It speaks of the need for the children of God to go through suffering before they can be glorified and can become legal heirs
Not only does the whole creation groan; even we who have the Spirit within us as the firstfruit of the Spirit also groan
In other words God wants to gain sons from among the sinners so that they can be constituted the Body of Christ for the expression of Christ
The gospel of God is the subject of Romans; it begins from God's creation and proves God's existence by the heaven and the earth
The created man did not worship God according to His eternal power and divinity which are manifested in the universe
For this, God accomplished redemption in Christ for the fallen sinners, and through faith on the sinners' part redeemed them back one by one
They will receive more of the Lord's fatness and enjoy His divine element, and they will grow with the increase of God within them
In the previous messages, we have seen the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, and we have seen the results of this divine dispensing
The goal of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity within the believers is simply to have a Body expressed as the many local churches
In the Body of Christ, all the members coordinate together and function according to the measure of each one part
Sober-mindedness here means to not be careless or foolish, to consider things properly, without being too much or too little
We must not only consider ourselves from our own standpoint, but must know ourselves as we are in the Body of Christ
If God has set you in the Body of Christ as a little finger, and if you have the view of the Body, you will accept it with gladness
We must also be sober-minded, so that we can coordinate with others in the church and can be built up together
Many times, problems in the church arise because believers consider others and make judgments based on the natural view
We will function according to our own measure, and we will neither overstep others nor underestimate ourselves
If arguments are unavoidable even between husbands and wives, how can we avoid them among the brothers and sisters in the church?
If we are persons who have passed through the cross, it will be no longer we who live, but Christ living in us
When we live a life with the highest virtues, the church will become a coordinated and built-up Body that is expressed in all the localities
He said that some are still keeping the Sabbath, and others are still eating according to the ceremony of cleansing
Gods receiving is not based on the question of the Sabbath or the ordinances of eating but on mans believing in Jesus Christ the Son of God
When we receive in this way, according to God instead of according to doctrine or methods, we maintain the oneness of the Body of Christ
Romans 15:5 says: 'Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus'
No matter how different others are from us in doctrinal views or religious practices, we must learn to treat them according to Christ
Romans 14:10 also tells us that we should not judge others in anything, because 'we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God'
Romans 14:17 says: 'For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
God's kingdom is the sphere for God to exercise His authority and where God expresses His glory and accomplishes His will
From the whole chapter of Romans 16 we can see that all the churches and all the saints on the whole earth live in one universal fellowship
In chapter fourteen, in the matter of receiving those with different doctrines and practices, Paul was very broad and flexible
Here, he resolutely charged us to turn away from those who hold dissenting opinions and who make divisions and causes of falling
Both aspects are for the maintaining of the oneness of the Body of Christ, so that we can live the proper church life
No matter how many saints or local churches there are on earth, in the various places we all give glory to the only wise God
Lord, we thank You that in this dark age, we have Your bright holy word in our hands, as a lamp that shines in a dark place
God's economy, plan, arrangement, and purpose is to dispense Himself into His chosen, created, and redeemed people
In the previous messages, we have seen God's dispensing from the Gospel of John and from the book of Romans respectively
Corinthians 1:9 says: 'God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
The transmission of Christ resumes, and we can enjoy Christ as our power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
In the church life today, as long as we have Christ as our wisdom from God, all the problems will no longer continue to be problems
Christ as the righteousness from God to us is not only for justification concerning our past offenses, but is for our living today
Finally Christ as the redemption from God to us will transfigure our body through His divine life so that we will have the body of His glory
We need to realize that everything that God glorifies has to be redeemed by passing through the judgment of the cross
Today, in the church life, every day we need the all-inclusive Christ to be our power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
Superficially speaking, the book of 1 Corinthians deals with all the confusion, division, and improper situations in the church in Corinth
The real gospel is not only a matter of the redemption by the blood of the Lamb, but a matter of the life supply of the unleavened bread
While they ate, they had to gird their loins, with shoes on their feet, with their staff in their hand, and they had to eat in haste
Every time we come to the Lord's table to remember Him, we do not come for a religious worship, but to eat and drink of Him
In addition, He is the daily spiritual food that comes down from heaven, becoming our life supply for our journeying
Through this, Christ supplies us not only with the life-power for us to run God's race, but with the divine element for God to grow
The third pair is described in 2 Corinthians 1:21-22, where Christ as the compound Spirit is the anointing and the sealing
It is formed by one kind of oil mingled with four kinds of spices, typifying the fact that the Spirit of Christ is a compound Spirit
It includes divinity, humanity, death, the effectiveness of death, resurrection, the fragrance of resurrection, and other elements
When God joins us to Christ the Anointed One, we are anointed by God with Him; that is, we are anointed by the compound Spirit of Christ
Our God has a divine economy, which is to dispense Himself in Christ to His chosen ones, those who believe in Him
In this way God's element can be added into us day by day, and we can be gradually delivered from the natural self
Corinthians 3:11 says: 'For other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ'
For many years, among us we have spoken about the church services, and we have encouraged the saints to participate in them
The church services that we talked about were mostly business affairs, such as cleaning, hall arranging, ushering, and hospitality
While you are taking care of this special conference, it is right for you to do your best to meet the needs in the business affairs
When you come to the meetings, you should release your spirit, and you should pray in a strong way, one after another
If you practice this way again and again, exercising your spirit, your mind, your utterance, and your boldness, the meetings will be rich
By this, the spiritual function will be realized, and we will have a part in the ministry of the building up of the church
By this way, not only will all of us be able to serve in the meetings, but we will be full of spiritual service outside the meetings
When we behold the glory of the Lord with unveiled face, the Lord will also unveil Himself and will transfuse us with what He is
In this way, we will be constituted the ministers of the New Testament for the building up of the Body of Christ
We will also be able to have the New Testament ministry which bears the glorious image of Christ and which dispenses Christ
As we are being gradually constituted to be the ministers of the New Testament, we will be able to take up the New Testament ministry
Corinthians 4:7 says: 'But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us'
Corinthians 12:9a says: 'And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness'
Superficially, the words in the Bible say one thing, but when we dive into them and experience them, it is another thing
On the surface, the book is not too difficult to understand, but when one probes into it, he will realize that it is not too easy
Superficially speaking, the expressions 'to be holy' and 'to have the sonship' are not too difficult to understand
Gods economy that is His plan purpose and arrangement of things to accomplish His desire is carried out in ways very different from ours
By this, Paul became a son of God with the sonship, that is, the life, the position, and the nature of the Son of God
Some may say that since the Father's choosing was before the foundation of the world, there was no dispensing yet
In order for God to make us holy He gave us His holy nature and in order for us to become His sons and have the sonship He gave us His life
God has not only put His nature into us to make us holy, but has imparted His life into us to make us His sons
Without the redemption of the Son, even if the Father wanted to give us His life and nature, He could not do it
In ourselves we could never carry out such a sealing, but God has dispensed His Spirit as a seal into us to seal us
The Spirit within us is not only a seal that permeates and saturates us, but He is also a foretaste within us for our enjoyment
We did not laugh, jump, or shout; we simply prayed, met, sought after the Lord, and preached the gospel in a quiet way
We go to bed on time, sleep calmly, rise calmly, wash up, pray-read, take our breakfast, do our work, and study calmly
We should refrain from anything that gives us unrest and do the things that make us feel peaceful and make the Lord happy
We will enjoy the Father's continual transfusing and dispensing of the life of His Son and His divine nature into us
We do not need to do these things excessively; we simply need to do them in small portions over a long period of time
We must see first that whatever our God wants us to do, He does not want us to do it by our own striving, but by Him
The dispensing of God the Son is in His redeeming us so that we can be saved into Himself to be made God's precious inheritance
As a result, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as the Divine Trinity becomes our divine dispensing, and we enjoy Him every day
Finally, Ephesians 1 shows us that God's surpassingly great power operated in Christ to resurrect Him from Hades, the grave, and death
By such a transmission, the building and all of the electrical systems in the building 'enjoy' the dispensing of the electricity
Because Christ is so great, all-inclusive, all-extensive, and fills all in all, He needs a universal Body which is the church
In the previous message, we saw in Ephesians 1 the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity and how it has produced the church
Finally, the surpassingly great power that the Triune God operated in Christ is transmitted into us to produce the church
Paul shows us, those who have become the church, what kind of persons we were and how God worked on us to make us His masterpiece
The word for masterpiece in Greek means something that has been made, a handiwork, or something that has been written or composed as a poem
Not only a poetic writing may be considered a poem, but also any work of art that expresses the maker's wisdom and design
God has caused us who were useless ones, sinners dead in sins, to become in the universe something beautiful and expressive of God's wisdom
Before the eyes of the angels, and even before the eyes of the enemy, we are a sweet, beautiful, and wise poem written by God
In other words, we who were useless and were dead in sin have become, through God's grace of life, a song that is singable and enjoyable
The coming of God's grace was a living breath that was breathed into our dead heart, and we were enlivened within
In ourselves, we do not have the capacity to make ourselves alive, to stand up, and to ascend into the heavens
In the eyes of the circumcised Jews, we, the uncircumcised Gentiles, were defiled and unclean, like swine and like dogs
In this process, Christ passed through death, and through His work of death the divine life encased in His human shell was released
When the Lord was on the cross, on the one hand, He was dying there, but on the other hand, His death was His work
He did not run away from death and Hades; rather, He walked out of death and Hades and entered into resurrection
Now we, the Jewish and the Gentile believers, have no problem with each other, and we have no problem with God
Beginning from 2:18, we have God the Spirit bringing us to have access unto God the Father for a continual receiving of the dispensing
When we enter into Him, fellowship with Him, live before Him, and wait on Him, He gives Himself to us bit by bit as our grace
We have been made into a poem by God the Father, created into a new man by God the Son, and brought by God the Spirit unto the Father
In chapter one he shows us how the Body of Christ is produced and exists out of the dispensing of the Triune God
Paul shows us that in Christ's death and resurrection, He used His divine element as the material to produce a universal new man
It is this continual, steady, eternal dispensing that coordinates them together, constitutes them together, and builds them up together
It is also the household for the dispensing of His love, and as such, it becomes His eternal habitation in our spirit
God's dispensing is fully something that is in His economy, something in His plan, something in His purpose and arrangement
He exercised his stewardship to dispense God's rich grace, that is, the unsearchable riches of Christ, to others
According to the scriptural principle, precious materials are not created but are transformed from some previous elements
To use gold, silver, and precious stones for the building of the church is to use the Triune God as the element for building
What we have received from the apostles is a divine dispensing, which dispenses all the divine riches in Christ into us
The twelve gates are twelve pearls, which refer to the dispensing of life in the death and resurrection of Christ
When an oyster is wounded by a piece of sand, it secretes its life element around the sand, eventually producing a pearl
Although they are human, these people are born of God to have God's nature and God's life and to thus become God's genuine children
As such, these people become God's expression, and this expression becomes the Body of Christ, which is also the fullness of Christ
We gather around His Word to consider the revelation in the Word, and especially the vision revealed in the fourteen Epistles of Paul
Most Christians today have left the proper truth and have turned from the inward dispensing of Christ to human work, merits, and religion
O glorious Christ, Savior mine, Thou art truly radiance divine; God infinite, in eternity, Yet man in time, finite to be
Those who eat and drink of Him will have Him within them as their life and life nutrients, and will be able to live by Him
All things of the Father are Thine; All Thou art in Spirit is mine; The Spirit makes Thee real to me, That Thou experienced might be
God wants us to do everything by depending on Him, by taking Him as life, and by allowing Him to dispense Himself into us
Paul says that the Head has given gifts to the Body, such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
Not only do we have to feed them for two or three months; we may have to spend a year or two years to care for them
Corinthians 14 also teaches us that when the whole church comes together, everyone should have something to present to others
Paul says that we can all prophesy, that is, to speak for God, to speak forth God, and to speak God into others one by one
What we see today in Christianity as the Lord's Day morning worship service is a totally unscriptural practice
All those who build up the Body of Christ are either apostles, prophets, evangelists, or shepherds and teachers
God's dispensing is for the fulfillment of His eternal plan, which is the building up of the church as His Body and habitation on earth
God in His economy does the dispensing Himself in producing the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers
As we have seen, depending on the context, the Greek word oikonomia can be translated either economy or stewardship
In God it is a plan, a purpose, and an economy, but when God's economy comes to the apostles, it becomes a stewardship
It includes, first, the creation of the heavens, the earth, and all living creatures to produce the old creation
He needs man to become one life and one spirit with Him and to be joined and mingled with Him, before the new creation can be realized
In order to carry out such an economy, God must have stewards to serve, to minister, to manage, and to execute His economy
In the light of the New Testament teaching all the believers are priests whether Paul or Peter or any other brothers or sisters old or young
Some will say that they are of Paul, while others will say that they are of Apollos, and there will be division among us
The Bible also says that we all are priests, and we can all offer spiritual sacrifices, light the lamps, and burn the incense
We need to see that the service in the church, on one hand, is to supply Christ to others, and on the other hand, to perfect others
After we perfect others, the perfected ones will be able to do the same work that we can do, and perhaps they will do it even better
In chapters one, three, and four of 2 Corinthians, Paul described how he and the other apostles became dispensers of Christ
The anointing ointment symbolizes the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, who as the ointment of the compound Spirit anoints us
As such persons they became ministers who were able to minister Christ, transmit Him, and dispense Him to others

Paul's prayer was for us to be strengthened in our spirit, so that the Lord could gain every part and could settle down in our hearts

On one hand, through every joint of the rich supply, that is, through all the gifted ones, the Body will be joined closely together
On the other hand, through the operation in measure of each one part, that is, through every saint, the Body will be fitly knit together
In this way every part of the Body operates in its measure to supply the Body, and the Body will grow up and will build itself up in love
