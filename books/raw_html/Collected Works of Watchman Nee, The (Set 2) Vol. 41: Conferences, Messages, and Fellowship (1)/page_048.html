<h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRINCIPLE<br />OF THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />AND THE WORK OF EVIL SPIRITS</h2><p>We can also tell the difference between the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and that of evil spirits from the principle by which the two spirits work. There are two conditions for evil spirits to be poured out upon man or to possess man. First, the will must be passive. Those who are passive are easily possessed by evil spirits. Hence, a Christian should not be passive. Second, the mind must be blank. Many people are lazy in their mind; they do not like to exercise their mind. Such people are also easily deceived by evil spirits. There is a big difference in principle between the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and possession by evil spirits. The main distinction lies in the condition of the mind and the will. Those who have received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit have two characteristics: their minds are clear, and their will is not passive. These people act according to their own volition, and they are not driven by outside forces. The Holy Spirit expects us to exercise our will to cooperate with Him in an active way. This is absolutely different from evil spirits, who demand that man remains passive in his will in order for them to work on him. In this way we can distinguish between the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the outpouring of evil spirits.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION FOR THE<br />OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><h2 class="head2">Having No Hidden Sins<br />or Sins Which One Refuses to Deal With</h2><p>In order to have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, we have to fulfill a few conditions. First, we must not have any hidden sins before the Lord, nor any sins which we refuse to deal with. If a man has hidden sins, he may be deceived by evil spirits when he prays for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. When he gives ground in his heart for the evil spirits to come in, they will surely come in and possess him.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Being Passive in the Will</h2><p>Second, we have to actively ask for the Holy Spirit to come upon us. Possession by evil spirits does not require our active participation. All we have to do is passively wait and they will come. Some pray, "If this is the Holy Spirit, I will take it, and if it is evil spirits, I will not take them." These kinds of prayers are still too passive. The way we cooperate with the Holy Spirit is as follows: When the Holy Spirit comes, He will ask, perhaps with a small voice, how much we are willing to allow Him to occupy us. The degree to which we allow Him to come in will be the degree to which He occupies us. The decision is with us. Anything that acts contrary to this pattern is passivity and not the work of the Holy Spirit; it is the work of evil spirits. The Holy Spirit will only come upon us when we say that we want Him. The Holy Spirit does not act alone; we have to take the initiative, and then the Holy Spirit will respond. If the Holy Spirit prompts us to laugh, it is because we have first made up our mind to laugh. The Holy Spirit then supplies us the energy to laugh. This is the cooperation that I am speaking of. When we pray for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, we have to pray for the covering of the precious blood of the Lord at the same time. If we take care of what we have to do, the Holy Spirit will take care of what He has to do.</p><p>One brother was clinching himself very tightly. He prayed, "O Holy Spirit, if You want to come, please come." He prayed this way for a few hours, but the Holy Spirit still did not come to him. His prayer did not match the condition for the work of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the Holy Spirit did not come upon him. The Holy Spirit can only work when there is the cooperation of our will. This is like riding a horse. The reins of the horse are in the hands of the rider. When the reins are released, the horse can run as it wills, but no matter how fast it runs, the reins are still in the rider's hands. The same principle applies in the experience of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. On the one hand, we have to let go so that the Spirit will have the full freedom. On the other hand, our will has to fulfill its function. Otherwise, we will lose control.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REASON FOR THE OUTPOURING<br />OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>We also have to know the reason for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Peter said in Acts 2:33, "Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this which you both see and hear." Then in verse 36 he said, "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified." The word "therefore" in verse 36 refers to verse 33, which speaks of God exalting the Lord. "Therefore," that is, for the purpose of proving that Jesus is exalted, the Holy Spirit was poured out, as was seen and heard at Pentecost. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit was for the purpose of proving to the house of Israel that Jesus of Nazareth was exalted, and that He had won the victory. If the Lord was not exalted, there would not have been the possibility of the outpouring of the Spirit. Receiving the outpouring of the Spirit is not for the purpose of proving our faith or our victory. It is for the purpose of proving that Jesus is both Lord and Christ.</p><p>Thank and praise Him. If the exaltation of the Lord is a fact, the outpouring of the Spirit must also be a fact. On the contrary, if the Lord was not exalted, it would have been impossible for the Holy Spirit to have been poured out. The Lord was crucified and shed His blood for the forgiveness of sins. All those who believe in Him can receive the forgiveness of sins. In the same principle, one should not say that even though the Lord was exalted to be both Lord and Christ, he has not received the outpouring of the Spirit. This is impossible. We must be bold to say that the Lord has been exalted to the throne. May the Lord fill us. We need a full faith to believe in the Lord and His accomplished works.</p>
