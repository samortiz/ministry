<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Man Becoming Flesh<br>and Man's Sin Becoming Great</H2><P>In the further steps of the fall, man became flesh and man's sin became great, so man was judged by God with the flood (Gen. 6:3, 5-7, 13; 7:10-11, 17-23a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Man Rebelling against God,<br>Exalting Himself, and<br>Worshipping the Idols at Babel</H2><P>In the consummation of man's fall, man rebelled against God, exalted himself, and worshipped the idols at Babel in union with Satan to frustrate the divine economy (Gen. 11:1-9). Before this time, a strong man rose up by the name of Nimrod (Gen. 10:8-11). Nimrod, a type of Antichrist, built Babel and also Nineveh. Babel was a place of idols, and the names of idols were written on the bricks of the city. At Babel man rebelled against God, exalted himself, and worshipped idols.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. IN THE RAISING UP OF A NEW RACE OF MANKIND</H2><P>Let us now go on to see the divine economy and the satanic chaos in the raising up of a new race of mankind. The old race had become chaotic, so out of chaotic mankind God raised up a new race with Abraham as the head.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Divine Economy with<br>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God Calling Abraham<br>Out of the Land of Idolatry<br>and Bringing Him into the Land of His Promise</H2><P>Genesis 11:31 and 12:4 tell us that God called Abraham out of the land of idolatry and brought him into the land of His promise. The land of God's promise is the good land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Promising Abraham<br>His Blessing of the Gospel<br>to the Nations in the Seed of Abraham</H2><P>God also promised Abraham His blessing of the gospel to the nations in the seed of Abraham&#151;Christ as the centrality and universality of the divine economy (Gen. 12:2-3; 18:18; 22:18). Just as the seed of woman is Christ, so the seed of Abraham also is Christ.</P><P>Christ is the threefold seed: the seed of woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David (2 Sam. 7:12). As the seed of woman, the seed of Mary, Christ has accomplished redemption to defeat and destroy Satan and to deal with our sin and sins. As the seed of Abraham, Christ has brought God to us and has brought us to God. This is the blessing. As the seed of David, Christ has brought in the kingdom.</P><P>In this revelation concerning Christ as the threefold seed we have a full gospel. What is the gospel? The gospel is the good news that Christ has destroyed Satan, that He has redeemed us from our sins, that He has brought God to us and us to God for our enjoyment of God's blessing, and that He has brought us into the kingdom, where God reigns through His redeemed as His organism. This is the gospel regarding Christ as the threefold seed.</P>
