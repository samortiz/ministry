In this message we want to see the renewing process that we need to pass through in our Christian life for God's purpose
Brother Nee once told us that the book of 2 Corinthians may be considered as an autobiography of the Apostle Paul
He spoke the things of the old creation into being in five days, He created man on the sixth day, and rested on the seventh day
The first dispensation is the dispensation before law, or the dispensation of the fathers from Adam to Moses' giving of the law
The second dispensation is the dispensation of law from Moses' giving of the law to the first coming of the Lord Jesus
The third dispensation is the dispensation of grace from the first coming of the Lord Jesus to His second coming
After the fourth dispensation, the new heaven and the new earth are brought in with the New Jerusalem as the center
Some preachers promise people that if they believe in Jesus Christ, they will not only be saved but also receive many blessings
Many Christians, however, can testify that when they believed in the Lord Jesus, they did not have any outward peace in their environment
The Apostle Paul said that he rejoiced in his sufferings because he realized that all sufferings are the process to make us new
For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh'
Our young people may be looking forward to a promising, flourishing future, but Jesus never promised such a future
The sufferings we pass through are a process to transfer us from the realm of the old creation to the new creation
If we read Paul's Epistles closely, we can see that the churches he established were not glorious according to our expectation
The situation in the church life at times may seem very poor but we should not lose heart because we are going through a process of renewing
When we pass through certain sicknesses, our physical body develops resistances to those sicknesses to make us stronger
Proverbs 4:18 says, 'But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day'
Yesterday morning we may have had a revival, but this morning we need another one, and tomorrow we need another one
We may feel that many of the things which we pass through are not fair, but we need to realize that the cross is not fair
The Lord could respond to us in this way: 'Yes, the suffering itself is not fair, but My calling you to suffer is fair
Because we are human, according to our thinking and our consideration, what we are passing through is not fair
By these four items- the cross, the Holy Spirit, our mingled spirit, and the holy Word-we can receive the renewing
Because God has placed two people together in marriage and because they are so close to each other, they will offend each other frequently
One of Brother Nee's 'proverbs' for a healthy marriage life was that both the husband and the wife needed to learn how to say: 'I'm sorry
In that fellowship we pointed out that God has an eternal goal to produce a new creation out of the old creation
We saw that God spends a long time to take His people through a long process for the producing of a new creation
Sometimes we live in the spirit to live Christ, but most of the time we still live in our old habit, our old nature
After our time with the Lord in the morning, we may come to the dining table and confront something that is not so pleasant to us
What happened at the dining table, however, was not merely a sin, an offense, a mistake, a failure, or a defeat
While we are the new creation, though, we are even more the old creation because we are so much in our old habit
It is easy for quick persons to make mistakes, whereas slow persons are slow in doing things and in producing things
Although some talkative ones may function in the meetings, we should not think that all the functioning is of the new creation
We may be slow in our disposition, but many times God's nature is to do things immediately, especially in the meetings
We may be quiet in our nature, but God wants us to be a new creation to utter something in the meetings against our natural habit
After regenerating us, God has to renew us, sanctify us, transform us, conform us to His image, and glorify us
When the divine element comes into us, it renews us regardless of whether we are slow or quick in our natural disposition
We may be good saints in the church who have been kept and preserved by the Lord, but have we been renewed with the divine element?
According to our view and consideration, we always base our judgment of things upon whether something is good or bad
We deal with things too much according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and not according to the tree of life
We are reminded to pray and the eventual outcome of our prayer is not merely that we get corrected but that we get renewed
When we are going to discipline our children, we will consider whether we are disciplining them in ourselves or with God and through God
The father is doing the disciplining, yet his disciplining is the divine disciplining because it is full of God
Confucius also said that we need to be renewed day by day, but his concept of renewing was merely to have a change
We are renewed by the addition of God into our being, by having more of the divine element added into our being
Very few of today's Christian teachings would point out that the Christian life is not a matter of what we do or do not do
What God cares for is that His chosen ones would learn to cooperate with Him by allowing Him to be added into them day by day
It is correct to say that our old man should be replaced, but we should not say that our old man should be abandoned
Our old form is a form without God, but the new form is with God in us as our life, as our nature, as our appearance, and as our expression
Daily we need to contact God, open ourselves up to Him, and let Him come into us to be a new addition into us day by day
Philippians 2:13 says, 'For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure'
In the divine life which we have received and which we are enjoying, there is a renewing capacity according to its nature
In many medicines today there is a healing element and a killing element that kills the bad germs and bacteria within us
When we reject ourselves in the morning to receive God into us we have the sense during the day that a killing process is going on within us
Philippians 2:13 tells us that God is operating in us, and then verse 14 tells us to do all things without murmurings and reasonings
In the church the sisters are used to murmuring because they are emotional, and the brothers are used to reasoning because they are logical
It takes a long time in our life and it requires us to contact God, to receive God, and to get God added into us all the day
When we experience God in Christ daily, we will see that God's intention is to renew us bit by bit, especially to renew our habit
For this purpose God raises up all kinds of environments to consume our outward man so that our inward man can be renewed day by day
