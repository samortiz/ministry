   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Greetings to my brother in the Lord, Mr. Luan:</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When this war started, God said to me, "I am watching over them for evil" Jer 44:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I was very frightened at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, God showed me that believers and unbelievers should be different when they are faced with the same environment.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>While believers lose something in tribulation, they also gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There are many commandments and promises in the Bible that are now being fulfilled richly in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>These are things that we could not have gained in the days past.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>While I was praying for peace in this region, God said, "The time for the lovers of the Lord to be taken up to heaven is almost here."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Works of power will be with us daily, as you once said.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord's love during the past months has been more than words can describe.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If God gives me the opportunity, I will tell you about them in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I left Hangchow and passed through Fu-Yang, Tung-Lu, Jien-Teh, Lan-Si, Jin-Hwa, Yung-Kang, and Tsin-Yun; I am now in Li-Shui.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>During the first half of the year, I knew when I prayed that I would leave Ching Po High School.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I asked the principal to release me, but he would not.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After the war approached Hangchow, I came with Mr. Chiu to this place.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I am now in the Chung-Teh Elementary School of Jesus Chapel, Tai-Shan-Gung Alley, Li-Shui.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>My wife and Samuel are in Sheng County.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In my prayer and through the outward circumstances, I became clear that I should go to Kweichow.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God keeps pointing to Sinkiang, Tibet, Tsinghai, and Kweichow, where the gospel has not been fully preached.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God will not give the latter rains from heaven until the gospel has been preached to the ends of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Christ's second coming is near.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Perhaps we will not pass through the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The time has come for the church to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I still marvel at the last conference in Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Everyone shed tears on the last day.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>These tears were shed because Hangchow was to pass through tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Only Christ is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The believers will all be tested so that they will all give up the things of the earth to gain the things in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Allow me to tell you what is on my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Sometimes I do not know why God wants me to go where He sends me.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I have asked the Lord why I must pass through the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There have been two times when I could have died in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>One of those times I could have died painlessly without any worry.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Thank God for answering me.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I must finish the course God has set for me.</S>
