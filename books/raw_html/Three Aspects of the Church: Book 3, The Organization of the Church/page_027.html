	 <h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>We cannot speak of the organization of the church apart from God&rsquo;s authority and God&rsquo;s grace. Without God&rsquo;s authority and grace, there is a lack in the organization of the church. All that is left is a social group, a societal organization, not the genuine church with a proper organization. The organization of the church is under God&rsquo;s authority and in God&rsquo;s grace. If we do not submit to God&rsquo;s authority and are not enjoying God&rsquo;s grace, we should not speak of the organization of the church. In its essence the organization of the church is based on God&rsquo;s authority and God&rsquo;s grace. Offices come from His authority, and gifts come from His grace. Everyone who fulfills his office submits to God&rsquo;s authority; everyone who exercises his gift lives in grace. This is the organization of the church.</p>
<p>When we carry out our offices in the church, we must ask ourselves whether or not we are submitting to God&rsquo;s authority and whether or not we are living in fellowship with God. If we do not submit to God or live in fellowship with God, whatever we do will be worthless, even if it is scriptural. It will be nothing but human organization. It is not sufficient to measure ourselves only according to biblical principles. If we are not under God&rsquo;s authority and experiencing God&rsquo;s grace, even though we may be doing things according to biblical principles, all that we have is human organization. We need to be rescued from such a situation.</p>
<p>In the past many saints held firmly to biblical principles without realizing the significance of authority and grace. To speak about the organization of the church according to the letter in the Bible will produce merely another human organization. No matter how scriptural our practice may be, if it is only according to letter, it will still be human organization. In contrast, if we submit to God&rsquo;s authority and experience His grace, the condition among us will be according to the intrinsic principles of the Bible, even if our knowledge of the Bible is inadequate. Our being according to biblical principle is not a matter of letter or doctrine but a matter of spirit and life.</p>
<p>If we submit to God&rsquo;s authority in regard to the offices and experience God&rsquo;s grace in regard to the gifts, all the problems will be gone, and there will be no need for argument. In contrast, if we do not submit to God&rsquo;s authority or experience God&rsquo;s grace but are merely according to the principle of the letter in the Bible, sooner or later we will have disputes, and problems will arise among us. For the past century this has been the problem among the Brethren. May the Lord have mercy on us that we would never decide the matters of the organization of the church based merely on the letter in the Scriptures. We must see that the source of the organization of the church is God&rsquo;s authority and God&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:4-5 says, &ldquo;There are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distinctions of ministries, yet the same Lord.&rdquo; <em>Spirit</em> denotes grace, and <em>Lord</em> denotes authority. The basic matters in the organization of the church are authority and grace. To have an office we must submit to authority, and to have a gift we must experience grace. Whenever we touch the organization of the church, we touch the authority of the Head and the grace of God.</p>
<p>May the Lord rescue us from being right in principle but dead in practicality. In this way, may we be His living Body, coordinating together, standing in our proper place, and supplying others according to our measure. This is the condition described in Psalm 133: &ldquo;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is / For brothers to dwell in unity! / It is like the fine oil upon the head / That ran down upon the beard, / Upon Aaron&rsquo;s beard, / That ran down upon the hem of his garments; / Like the dew of Hermon / That came down upon the mountains of Zion. / For there Jehovah commanded the blessing: / Life forever.&rdquo;</p>
