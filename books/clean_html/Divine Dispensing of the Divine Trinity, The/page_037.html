<h2 class="head1">THE CHILDREN OF GOD BROUGHT FORTH</h2>
<p>Out of such a Christ ministered, the children of God have been brought forth. The issue of Christ ministered is that many have been born of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Have Eternal Life</h2>
<p>These children first of all have the eternal life (John 3:15, 16, 36; 1 John 1:2; 5:12-13, 20). To have the eternal life simply means to have some living dispensing. Because you have the eternal life, it flows within you. This flowing within you is just the dispensing of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Partake of the Fellowship of the Eternal Life by Abiding in the Lord and<br />
Walking in the Light</h2>
<p>We are partakers of the fellowship of the eternal life by abiding in the Lord and walking in the light (1 John 1:3-7; 2:6). The fellowship is just the flowing. There is a life that flows between God and us. Even between the members of His Body there is such a flow. This flow reaches all of us and even God Himself. So this is a kind of fellowship. Electricity is a good illustration. Within the lamps in a house and within the power plant itself there is the flow of electricity. That flow is the fellowship between all the lamps. The current brings every lamp into the fellowship with the plant. The power plant may be far away from the lamps in the house, but in the current of the electricity, the power plant and the lamps are in one fellowship.</p>
<p>Within us there is a flow. That flow is the eternal life, and that is the fellowship. We all are partaking of such a fellowship. To partake of such a fellowship may not be so substantial as partaking of the divine nature which Peter mentions (2 Pet. 1:4). But this fellowship is more enjoyable. For example, there are two ways to eat chicken: one is to eat the solid chicken, and the other is to eat soup made of chicken. When you are weak or sick, chicken soup is better than chicken. We may use the chicken to illustrate the divine nature, and chicken soup to illustrate the fellowship of the divine life. Which do you prefer? If you are a strong person you may like solid chicken. This is good, but it is more tasteful to eat the chicken soup. Don&rsquo;t forget, the chicken soup comes from chicken. Without a solid chicken, you could not have chicken soup. Likewise, without the divine nature, you could not have the fellowship of the eternal life. The divine nature is the solid thing, the substance. And the fellowship of the divine life is the fellowship of this substance. This is for the life dispensing. The way to partake of the fellowship of the eternal life is to abide in the Lord and walk in the light.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Be Taught by the Divine Anointing</h2>
<p>When you enjoy the fellowship of the eternal life by abiding in the Lord and walking in the light, you are under the teaching of the divine anointing (1 John 2:20, 27). The children of God are also brought forth to be taught by the divine anointing. The anointing may be considered as a kind of oiling. Many machines need to be oiled. If they are not oiled, they do not run smoothly. Instead they make a lot of noise. Sometimes we Christians make a lot of noise, either to our wife, or to our husband, or to the elders, or to the brothers. This means we are short of anointing. We need to get oiled. Hallelujah! We have a source of oil because the anointing is within us. All the time it anoints us. This again is life dispensing. This anointing teaches us, oils us, and regulates us all the time. If we are not regulated by the teaching of the anointing, we are not smooth. The holy anointment oils us, teaches us, and makes us so smooth. This is life dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Enjoy the Virtues of the Divine Birth<br />
with the Divine Seed</h2>
<p>We all have been born of God. We were born not just by our parents but also by God with a divine seed (1 John 3:9). This divine seed is just God&rsquo;s eternal life. There are virtues coming out of this birth and out of this seed. By the virtues of this birth and seed we can practice the divine righteousness (1 John 2:29), we can practice the divine love (1 John 4:7; 5:1), and we can overcome the world, death, sin, the Devil, and idols (1 John 5:4, 16-21). We can overcome everything because we have the virtues of the divine birth with the divine seed. In the spiritual language, virtue means life energy and even life energizing. Within us there is a kind of energy that energizes. This energizing is of the divine life, and the divine life comes from the divine birth. So the life energy, the life energizing, is a virtue. We can overcome the negative things because we have the energizing life. This energizing is just the dispensing of life.</p>
