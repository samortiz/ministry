   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In order to see this revelation, it will be helpful for us to reconsider how the New Testament is composed.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first three books, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are called the Synoptic Gospels; although they have some element of mystery, they are not Gospels of the eternal mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The eternal mystery is in the last Gospel, the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Synoptic Gospels can be more easily understood than John can.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John begins by saying, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" v. 1 . Then verse 14 says, "The Word became flesh." John the Baptist saw this One and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" v. 29 . He also saw the Spirit as a dove descending upon and abiding upon Christ v. 32 . Then at the end of chapter one of John, we can paraphrase what the Lord said to Nathanael in this way: "You recognize Me as the Son of God, but you will see the angels ascending and descending on Me, the Son of Man" v.51 . All of these verses show that John 1 is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to see this mystery, we need to know how to interpret all these figures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter twelve of John this Wonderful One was exalted by His disciples, but He did not accept their kind of exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That meant nothing to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, He said, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified" v. 23 . What a mystery glorification is! Then He explained that one grain of wheat, if it does not die, abides alone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if it dies, it will be glorified v. 24 . Christ as the one grain of wheat, through His death and resurrection, became many grains, and these many grains are the issue of His being glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Gospel of John explains the issue of His glorification in chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This issue is the universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, the three of the Triune God were incorporated from eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In John 14:10 the Lord told Philip, "I am in the Father and the Father is in Me."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This reveals that the three of the Divine Trinity are incorporated into one incorporation by Their mutual coinhering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 10 of John 14 unveils to us the beginning of this universal incorporation in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse11 shows that the three are also an incorporation by Their mutual work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They work together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One day the second of the Divine Trinity was sent by this incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Acts 2:23 indicates that the three parties of this universal incorporation had a council 1 Pet 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this council it was agreed to send the second into time to become a man Micah 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before the incarnation, this universal incorporation consisted of three parties.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then the second of the Divine Trinity brought this divine incorporation into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His disciples always wondered, "Who is this man?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They talked secretly among themselves about Him, but they did not know who He was intrinsically.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In John 14:20 the Lord told them that on the day of resurrection they would know that He is in the Father, that they are in Him, and that He is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These three ins reveal that the consummated Triune God and the regenerated believers became an incorporation in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 14 the Lord revealed that He came as the first Comforter and that another One would come as the second Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The second Comforter is the reality of the first Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is the Spirit of reality, and verse 17 says that this Spirit of reality would be in the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The in of verse17 as a general statement is the totality of the three ins in verse20 as a detailed statement.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Spirit of reality is in us, the totality of the Triune God is in us to incorporate us into the universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In eternity it was a divine incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By being enlarged, this incorporation became a divine and human incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This incorporation is the house of the Father, the universal vine tree of the Son, and the new man of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In John 16:12-15 the Lord told the disciples, "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit of reality declares all the things concerning Christ in the last twenty-two books of the New Testament, the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I began to love the Bible from the day I was saved in 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have spent the past seventy-one years studying the Bible, but it was not until recently that I saw so clearly that the goal of God's economy is the enlarged, universal, divine-human incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The unbelievers will go into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They have nothing to do with this universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But all of the believers will eventually be incorporated into this one great incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The final consummation of this universal incorporation is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Mainly three apostles Paul, Peter, and John present this revelation to us in their Epistles piece by piece and bit by bit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By the Lord's mercy, we have put these pieces together to see a full and complete vision of this universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The three aspects of the universal incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers are revealed in John 14 through 16: a house, a tree, and a child.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>John 16 shows us the child born of the Spirit v. 21 . This child is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, this child becomes the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Colossians 3 we are told that Christ is this new man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is every member and is in every member of the new man vv.10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In God's eyes the house, the tree, and the man in John 14 through 16 are all Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ is the house, the temple, the dwelling place of God; Christ is the vine tree; and Christ is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the previous message we saw the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this message we want to see the true vine and the new child, the new man.</S>
