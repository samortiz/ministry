<h2 class="head2">Tracts Not Being Intimidated<br />by Human Factors or the Atmosphere</h2><p>The third advantage of tracts is that they are not intimidated by human factors or the surrounding atmosphere. In large and well-prepared gospel meetings, a preacher can stand on the podium to speak solemnly of such serious subjects as sin and judgment. But when he has to preach to a person one-on-one, politeness, face, and other human factors pose limitations to what can be said. He cannot speak a serious word of warning forthrightly. It is hard to preach under such circumstances. If he points out sin and judgment too bluntly, he may lose a chance to see that person again. In conducting private evangelism, there are certain restrictions and difficulties in speaking what one really wants to speak. But if he gives out a tract which says, "We are all sinners, and we have all sinned before God; we all need Jesus," the other party can more easily receive it. The preacher may not be able to say many things, but he can pray for the other party as he reads the tract and then ask, "Do you feel that you have sinned?" This will not be very offensive. We do not want to offend others when we preach. However, we have to speak directly and honestly. Therefore, when considerations such as status, rank, face, or other human factors stand in the way, we can give tracts and pray. The advantage of a tract is that it is not intimidated by human factors. It is not influenced by the listener, and it speaks only the words of the truth.</p><h2 class="head2">Tracts Avoiding Much Debate</h2><p>The fourth advantage of tracts is that they avoid much debate. Many times in preaching to others, we fall into debates and arguments. Sometimes we meet a person who likes to argue. He does not have a heart for the gospel; his whole intention is to test us and embarrass us. When we try to testify to him, he tries to argue. We should not debate with him. Instead, we should present a tract to him in a sincere and calm way. This is a very good way of handling the situation. An argumentative person can do nothing to a silent and objective tract. For example, we may meet one of our relatives. He knows that we are Christians, and he may try to argue with us. At such times we should not say too much to him. We should only politely present a tract to him. No matter how much a person likes to argue, he can do nothing with a tract. The best thing to do with such a person is to give him a tract. The next day you can ask, "Have you read the tract I gave you? Do you want another one?" This will avoid any direct confrontational arguments. Of course, we have to pray much for him privately.</p><h2 class="head2">Tracts Not Being Limited by Time and Persons</h2><p>The fifth advantage of tracts is that they are not limited by time and persons. Tracts save men without the limitation of time. In order for a man to preach in person, there is the limitation of time and space as well as audience. A man cannot be in the same place twenty-four hours a day, but a tract is not limited by these factors. Tracts can testify for us beyond any limitation in time. It also is hard for us to testify to total strangers, but tracts can testify anywhere at anytime to anyone. Whether or not we know a person, tracts can testify to him. They are not limited by the kind of person who receives the tract. A man can read a tract at any time. Any time he is free, he can read a tract. If we give a man a tract, it can go where the man goes; it can testify to him anywhere at anytime. This is what makes tracts so convenient.</p><h2 class="head2">Tracts Being Able to Be Sowed Anywhere</h2><p>The sixth advantage of tracts is that we can sow them anywhere. In Ecclesiastes 11:1 and 6, Solomon said, "Cast your bread upon the surface of the waters....In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not hold back your hands." It is all right to sow randomly, because we do not know which of the seeds we sow will prosper. The apostle Paul said that he who sows with blessings shall reap with blessings (2 Cor. 9:6). In order to sow en mass, there is no better way than tract distribution. Anyone can sow with tracts anywhere. If we have to preach to three, five, or ten persons today, we have to spend much time with them. But it is not a problem to distribute one thousand to two thousand tracts a day. Some brothers have distributed more than one thousand tracts a day for over three years. This is mass sowing. No other method can be as easy as tract distribution when it comes to mass sowing of gospel seeds. No other method is as convenient. Many servants of God love to distribute tracts. They do not even waste their walking time; they seize this opportunity to pass out tracts everywhere. If one person is saved through the tracts that we pass out in one day, we have done a great job already. A new believer has to learn to pass out tracts in bulk. It is a pity if we do not take advantage of tracts effectively.</p>
