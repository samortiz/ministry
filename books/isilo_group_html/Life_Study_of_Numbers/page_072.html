Miriam Being Punished</H2><P>In verses 10 through 12 we see that Miriam was punished. Why is it that although two rebelled, only one was punished? Why did God punish the female but not the male? We may think that the male had borne more responsibility and that he should have been punished instead of the female. There were, I believe, two reasons why God punished Miriam but not Aaron. First, it is likely that Miriam took the lead in this rebellion. She was the instigator, the initiator, who stirred up Aaron. Miriam, not Aaron, was the main source. Second, it is not at all seemly for a female to rebel. Concerning rebellion, some allowance may be given to a male, but none should be given to a female. God punished Miriam to warn and alarm all the females among the children of Israel so that they would not follow Miriam.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Being Made Sick of Leprosy</H2><P>Miriam was punished by being made sick of leprosy. "The cloud removed from over the tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. And Aaron turned towards Miriam, and she was leprous" (v. 10). This was God's governmental dealing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Aaron Begging Moses for Her</H2><P>Aaron begged Moses for Miriam (vv. 11-12). Aaron had been instigated by his sister, and now he became her mediator, her intercessor. We should learn from this not to follow an instigator. If we follow such a one, we may eventually have to beg on his behalf.</P><P>In begging for Miriam, Aaron confessed their folly. "Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, do not lay upon us the sin in which we have done foolishly and have sinned" (v. 11). Then he went on to plead that she would not be as one dead. "Let her not be as one dead, the flesh of whom is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb" (v. 12). Aaron begged that Miriam would not die in such a pitiful way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Moses Praying for Miriam's Healing</H2><P>Moses prayed for Miriam's healing, saying, "Heal her, O God, I beg You" (v. 13). This is a further indication of Moses' meekness. If he had not been meek, he would not have prayed for her but instead would have let her die in her leprosy. If someone rebelled against you, would you pray for the healing of that one? Have you ever prayed in this way?</P><P>God heard Moses' prayer and judged her by shutting her up outside the camp for seven days (vv. 14-15a). The people were delayed on the march until Miriam was brought in again (v. 15b). "After that, the people set out from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran" (v. 16).</P><P>The principle in the case of Miriam and Aaron is the same with us today. I hope that the Lord will speak more to you than I have spoken so that we all may learn the lesson.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Numbers &nbsp; pg 72</div><br></body></html>
