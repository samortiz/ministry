 <h2 class="head1">THE SECOND MAN</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:47 says, &ldquo;The second man is the Lord from heaven.&rdquo; Here we see that Christ is the second man. In the eyes of God there are just two men: the first man, Adam, and the second man, Christ. There is no third man. As a man, Christ came to be the second man so that there could be a new start. The first man was rejected by God, but the second man is acceptable to Him. Although we were born into the first man, we have been reborn into the second man. Naturally, we were born in Adam, but spiritually we were reborn in Christ. Hallelujah, we are no longer in Adam, the first man, but in Christ, the second man!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAST ADAM</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45 says that Christ is &ldquo;the last Adam.&rdquo; This means that He is the last One and that no one succeeds Him. He is not only the second man, but also the last Adam. After the second man it may seem that there could be a third man or a fourth man. But because Christ is also the last Adam, we know that no one will come after Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SAVIOR</h2>
<p>Christ is also our Savior. According to John 4:42, He is spoken of as &ldquo;the Savior of the world.&rdquo; Our Savior is a man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JESUS</h2>
<p>Christ is also a man by the name of Jesus (Matt. 1:21). He was a Nazarene, and He grew up in the home of a carpenter (Matt. 2:23; 13:55). When He was full-grown, He Himself also worked as a carpenter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christ is also the Christ, God&rsquo;s anointed One. As Jesus, He is our Savior, and as Christ, God&rsquo;s anointed One, He accomplishes God&rsquo;s purpose. He is both Jesus and the Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD</h2>
<p>The man Jesus is also the Lord (Acts 2:36). Many Christians are not clear concerning the two aspects of Christ as the Lord. Because Christ is God, the Creator, He was the Lord before He came as a man. One day, He was born as a man named Jesus. How could this man, a Nazarene, be the Lord? Acts 2:36 says that after Jesus was resurrected and ascended, God made Him the Lord. As God, Christ was the Lord already; but as a man He still needed to be made the Lord. Thus, after Jesus ascended into the heavens, God appointed Him to be the Lord. Now the Lord is not only God, but also a man, the man Jesus. Peter&rsquo;s word in Acts 2:36 was spoken to the opposing Jews, the very ones who had crucified Jesus on the cross. Although they had crucified Him, God resurrected Him from the dead, placed Him on the throne, and proclaimed to the whole universe that He, the man Jesus, is the Lord. Today a man is on the throne to be the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPHET</h2>
<p>Acts 3:22 reveals that Christ is a Prophet, One who speaks for God. This was typified by Moses, who spoke to the children of Israel for God (Deut. 18:15, 18). Christ spoke to His disciples for God when He was on earth. Today He still speaks within us for God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLE</h2>
<p>Christ is also the Apostle. Hebrews 3:1 tells us to consider Jesus the Apostle. As the Apostle, Christ was the One sent by God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRIEST</h2>
<p>Hebrews 3:1 also indicates that Christ is the Priest. As the Apostle, Christ comes from God to us, and as the Priest, He goes from us to God. Hallelujah, Christ is both the coming One and the going One! He comes with God to us, and He goes with us to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KING</h2>
<p>Christ is also the King, even the King of kings (Rev. 17:14). Thus, Christ is the Prophet, the Apostle, the Priest, and the King. This should not merely be doctrine; every item must be our experience. Have you ever experienced Christ as your Prophet, Apostle, Priest, and King?</p>
