   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MODERN SCIENCE AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE LONG DAY IN JOSHUA</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this age of modern science, it seems that everything must be questioned before it can be believed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, this is very meaningless because the condition for obtaining truth is not skepticism, but impartiality and the lack of prejudice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Skepticism is a form of prejudice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, skepticism does not lead men to the way of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today, modernistic Christians think that one should not accept the biblical record blindly, but should first question it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This theory falls into the same trap.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before a person becomes a Christian, he has, of course, the right to choose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But after he has believed in Christ, his position is such that it no longer allows him to doubt the Bible which Christ has uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Dr. Rimmer is a modern-day renowned American scientist.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His position as the president of Research Science Bureau speaks for his knowledge in science.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is also a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To him the so-called "outmoded" Christian beliefs are not contradictory to science.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He often lectures in universities and has opened the eyes of countless young people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has shed much new light on the problems of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This message on the long day of Joshua is one of his lectures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Realizing that this message will render help to those who are uncertain and who have been shaken by the words of the modernists, I have asked Mr. Chow to translate it into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our belief does not need scientific proof.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But this may serve to remind those who believe blindly in their own version of science.</S>
