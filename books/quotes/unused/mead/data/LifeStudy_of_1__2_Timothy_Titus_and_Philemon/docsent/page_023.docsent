   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE SIX THE FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:14-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Timothy 3:14-16 is the most crucial portion in the four books of 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul has covered the matters of the differing teachings, the dispensation of God, the need for the leading ones to have a prayer life so that all the other brothers may follow, and the charge to the sisters to remain in faith, love, and holiness with sobriety.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, the elders have been established and the deacons have been appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A church that has all these characteristics is certainly wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now in verse 15 Paul tells us that the church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then in verse 16 he goes on to declare: "And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness, Who was manifested in the flesh, vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In these verses Paul presents an extremely high standard for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Among Christians today the standard of the church is far below God's standard revealed in 3:15 and 16.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to reach this standard, the church must have all the characteristics described in the first two and a half chapters of 1 Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There must be no differing teachings, and God's economy must be practiced continually.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The leading ones must have a prayer life, and all the other brothers must follow them to pray in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, the sisters should remain in faith, love, and holiness with sobriety.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then the government of the church must be established with the two offices of elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is our expectation to practice this kind of church life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We praise the Lord that in His recovery we have seen such a church life at least to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever God's standard for the church is attained as outlined in 1 Timothy, the church will function as the house of the living God and the pillar and base upholding the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is also the great mystery of godliness, the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only was the Lord Jesus the manifestation of God in the past; the church today should also be the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the goal, the aim, of these four Epistles written by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even though Paul witnessed the beginning of the decline of the church, he was not disappointed or discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because he had both insight and foresight, he could be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He knew that some day and somehow the church would reach God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The majority of the believers may decline, but a small number at least would be chosen, preserved, and established to practice the church life according to the divine standard.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We in the Lord's recovery can testify of the great difference between the recovery and today's organized Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Reconciliation between the two is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the saints should be encouraged that the situation in the Lord's recovery is heading toward God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This standard is that the church should function as the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and as the great mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church life today must be the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When visitors, including those who have not yet believed in the Lord, come to the meetings and behold such a manifestation, they will no doubt be greatly surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They may say, "What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is different from anything we have seen elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is even different from the church services in religion."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yes, the church is different; it is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every local church must reach this standard and continue according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There should be no decline; rather, we should maintain God's standard until the glorious appearing of our Head, the Savior, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 3:14 Paul says, "These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By "these things" Paul means all he has covered thus far in this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When he wrote this book, he was hoping to come shortly to see Timothy.</S>
