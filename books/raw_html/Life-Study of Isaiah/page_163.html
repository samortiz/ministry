<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Being the Cloud of Smoke<br>as a Shade by Day from the Heat<br>and the Brightness of a Fiery Flame by Night,<br>Both Being Created by God</H2><P>This covering canopy of glory is also a cloud of smoke as a shade by day from the heat and the brightness of a fiery flame by night against the darkness. Both the cloud of smoke and the brightness of a fiery flame are created by God (Exo. 40:34-35, 38; Num. 9:15-16). When the day of restoration comes, there will be over Mount Zion a cloud of smoke in the day and the brightness of a fiery flame in the night. We should not consider that the cloud of smoke and the brightness of a fiery flame are physical things. Isaiah tells us that Jehovah will create them. This means that they will be something which has never before existed, something which will be created by God. God's glory as the cloud of smoke and the brightness of the fiery flame will remain on Mount Zion all the time. In the day His glory will be as a covering cloud of smoke to be a shade from the heat. In the night His glory will be as the shining brightness of a fiery flame to keep God's people away from darkness. God Himself as the glory expressed in Christ will remain as a canopy over Mount Zion to cover His interests, which include His holy temple, His holy people, and all His holy convocations.</P><P>Our revised translation of Isaiah 4:5 conveys the proper spiritual meaning of Christ being a covering canopy of glory. This verse says, "Jehovah will create over the entire region of Mount Zion and over all her convocations a cloud of smoke by day, and the brightness of a fiery flame by night; for over all, the glory will be a canopy." The comma in the phrase "for over all, the glory will be a canopy" is very crucial. If the comma were removed from this phrase, this would mean that the canopy and the glory are two separate items and that the canopy covers and protects God's glory. This is against the spiritual principle. God's glory does not need anything to cover or protect it. Instead, His glory is always covering other things. The Concordant Version of Isaiah also puts a comma between "all" and "the glory." According to our revised translation, over Mount Zion, over the temple, and over the holy convocations, the glory will be a canopy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. An Overshadowing Tabernacle<br>of Grace in Humanity</H2><P>Christ will also be an overshadowing tabernacle of grace in humanity (Isa. 4:6, John 1:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Being Christ in His Humanity<br>That Expresses His Divinity</H2><P>This overshadowing tabernacle of grace is Christ in His humanity, which expresses His divinity (John 1:14b).</P>
