<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Last and Greatest Sign</H2><P>I hope we will all be impressed with the proper interpretation and understanding of this last and greatest sign in the entire Bible. Of all sixty-six books of the Bible, the New Jerusalem is the last and greatest sign. The last word is the deciding word. God, through creation, incarnation, redemption, resurrection, ascension, and all His transforming, building work through all these Christian centuries, will get a living composition of His redeemed people to be His dwelling and His counterpart to fully satisfy Him. We will join Him because we will be His counterpart.</P><P>The Lord Jesus told the Sadducees in Matthew 22:30 that in the resurrection there will be no marriage but that we will all be like the angels. The Bible does not tell us about physical matters or relationships in eternity. What it reveals is high and profound. We must be delivered from our human, natural mentality in considering the New Jerusalem as a physical abode. We must realize what is on God's heart. He needs an eternal dwelling, composed of billions of transformed and glorified living persons, to be His living dwelling place and His dear wife, His counterpart. This ultimate consummation makes it worthwhile for Him to bring creation into existence, to be incarnated, to die on the cross, to be resurrected, and to spend so many centuries to build the churches.</P><P>If the New Jerusalem were a literal city, it would be only half the size of the United States (cf. Rev. 21:16). The United States today has a population of about a quarter billion people. Through the generations, though, God will have saved billions of people. How could billions of people live in a city half the size of the United States? We should not follow the natural teachings but rather exercise our sober mind to see what God desires.</P><P>The Word is the truth. Thank God He has given us this book. We have something solid in human language that we can study again and again. The Lord Jesus told Peter that He would build His church upon this rock (Matt. 16:18). Peter tells us that we all as living stones are being built up a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5). Paul says he has laid the foundation, but we must all be careful how we build: we must build with gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:10-12). The thought of God's building is throughout the entire New Testament right to the end. This is why we say that the New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of God's building work through all the generations.</P>
