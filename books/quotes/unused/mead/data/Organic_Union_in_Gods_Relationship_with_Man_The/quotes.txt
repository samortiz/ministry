[1]  CONTENTS In the Creation of Man In Incarnation In Salvation In the Growth of the Believers In the Building Up of the Body of Christ In the Consummation of the New Jerusalem PREFACE
[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Seattle, Washington on September 3-6, 1993.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE IN THE CREATION OF MAN Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26a; Col 1:15a; Gen 2:7; Prov 20:27; Job 32:8; Zech 12:1; John 4:24; 3:6b; 1 Cor 6:17; Gal 5:16; Rom 8:4b; Gen 2:8-9; Psa 36:9a; John 1:1-4a; 14:6a; Col 3:4a; Rev 2:7; 22:2; Gen 2:16; John 6:57b; 15:5; Phil 1:20-21a OUTLINE In God's image and according to His likeness Gen 1:26a: Not in God's image and according to His likeness merely in form.
[4]  Not to produce a toy without life, but to produce a living and genuine manifestation and expression of God with His life.
[5]  As Christ being the living image of the invisible God in life Col 1:15a.
[6]  Thus, the man created by God in His image and according to His likeness must be in the organic union with God.
[7]  The general subject of this book is the organic union in God's relationship with man.
[8]  The crucial points in this book can be summarized by the following four sentences:
[9]  1 God created man for the purpose that man may take Him as life for man to live Him and express Him.
[10]  3 Christ saves man with His dynamic life that man may be able even to reign in His eternal life.
[11]  4 Christ builds up His Body by His believers growing up into Him, as the Head, in all things that His Body may be consummated in the New Jerusalem as the eternal manifestation and expression of the Triune God in His unlimited life.
[12]  The Lord saw the intrinsic significance of the threefold divine title the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, that is, that God is not only the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but He is the God of the living.
[13]  In Colossians 1:15 we are told that Christ is the image of the invisible God.
[14]  Still, we may ask what it means to say that Christ is the image of God.
[15]  Our Need to Live and Walk by the Spirit
[16]  Although in the past we have received much teaching concerning our spirit, I am burdened about this matter again because I realize that out of one hundred saints, it is difficult to find one who lives in the spirit and walks according to the spirit.
[17]  In Galatians 5:25 Paul said, "If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit," and in 5:16 he said, "But I say, Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh."
[18]  Romans 8:4 speaks of the righteous requirement of the law being fulfilled in those who walk according to the spirit, that is, the regenerated human spirit indwelt and mingled with the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God.
[19]  This verse indicates that we can be justified by God in His presence only if we do everything according to the spirit.
[20]  If we do not conduct ourselves according to the spirit, we cannot be justified before God.
[21]  They say that since Christ is our righteousness, we are justified by God.
[22]  First, Christ is our righteousness objectively for us to be justified by God that we may be saved.
[23]  However, if we are going on to live as a child of God and a member of Christ, we must live Christ Gal 2:20; Phil 1:19-21 , making Christ also our subjective righteousness Phil 3:9 .
[24]  In God's creation of man, God purposely breathed the breath of life into man that man might have an inmost organ to contact God, to make man himself a God-man.
[25]  The third striking point in God's creation of man is that after God created man, He put man before the tree of life Gen 2:8-9 .
[26]  The man created by God was complete and perfect, having a body and a spirit with a soul.
[27]  CHAPTER TWO IN INCARNATION Scripture Reading: Eph 1:5, 9-11; 3:9; Gen 3:15; Isa 7:14; Gal 4:4; Matt 1:20, 16; Gen 22:18; Gal 3:16; Matt 1:1; John 1:1, 14, 16-17; Rom 8:3m; John 1:1-4a; 14:6a; 10:10b; 12:24; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18; John 20:22; Col 3:4a; 1 Cor 6:17; John 15:1, 5; Gal 2:20a; Phil 1:20-21a OUTLINE God's eternal good pleasure of His will: As unveiled to the apostle Paul Eph 1:5, 9, 11.
[28]  AND ACCORDING TO GOD'S LIKENESS God's Image and Likeness Being Organic
[29]  Man was created by God as an entity with a frame, the outer part, and a spirit, the inmost organ.
[30]  God created the heavens, the earth, and myriads of living things: the herbs, the trees, the fish in the water, the birds in the air, and the beasts, the cattle, and all kinds of creeping things on the earth Gen 1:11-25 .
[31]  Before God created anything, He had a good pleasure within Him Eph 1:5, 9 .
[32]  Then God came in, not to condemn man or to curse man, but to give man a promise that the seed of the woman would come to bruise the head of the damaging serpent v. 15; Isa 7:14; Gal 4:4; Matt 1:20, 16 . That promise indicated that God Himself would come to be the seed of woman.
[33]  To Be a Man, to Be One with Man
[34]  God created man with the desire that one day He would enter into man.
[35]  The created man had His image, His likeness, and His breath of life as man's spirit, but he did not have God.
[36]  THAT HE MAY BE ONE WITH THE BELIEVING PEOPLE
[37]  After entering into His believing people, God becomes one spirit with them 1 Cor 6:17 in the organic union of the divine life.
[38]  In this organic union God and man are one person, signified by the true vine in John 15:1.
[39]  CHAPTER THREE IN SALVATION Scripture Reading: Rom 5:18b, 21b; 1 John 5:11-12; Rom 5:10; Acts 11:18; Gen 3:24; Heb 10:19-20; Rev 2:7; Heb 4:16; Eph 2:18; 1 Pet 1:3; John 1:12-13; Col 3:4a; 2 Pet 1:4b; 1 John 4:13; Phil 2:15-16; Matt 5:16 OUTLINE Through the all-inclusive redemption: Redeeming God's chosen people as sinners to be justified by God unto life, even unto the reign in the eternal life the Triune God Rom 5:18b, 21b; 1 John 5:11-12.
[40]  Reconciling the redeemed and justified sinners as God's enemies that they may be saved in the divine life of Christ Rom 5:10.
[41]  Bringing the fallen sinners back to the tree of life, to God as life Rev 2:7; Heb 4:16; Eph 2:18.
[42]  According to His counsel, His will, His good pleasure, and His heart's desire, in time God came to create Rev 4:11 .
[43]  At that time none of the angels understood what God was doing.
[44]  On this earth God created many different kinds of life in three levels: the vegetable life to show the beauty of the earth Gen 1:11-12 , the animal life to show the livingness of the earth vv.
[45]  Then, in Genesis 2 God brought the completed man as the high life on this earth to a tree not an apple tree but a tree of life, a life tree vv.
[46]  God intended that His created man with the human life would take Him as the highest life that he might be no longer merely a man but a God-man, no longer merely human, but divinely human.
[47]  He saved us by entering into us as the all-inclusive Spirit, as the consummation of the Triune God.
[48]  In His salvation He has redeemed us from our sinfulness and has terminated us in our sinful constitution.
[49]  CHAPTER FOUR IN THE GROWTH OF THE BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6, 15; 1 Pet 1:3, 23; James 1:18; Matt 13:3; 1 John 3:9; Rev 14:1-5, 14-16; 1 Cor 3:6-7; 1 Pet 2:2; Heb 5:14; Col 1:28; Eph 4:15b, 11-13; Col 2:19; Gal 5:25, 16a; Rom 8:4b; 1 Pet 2:5; 1 Cor 3:12 OUTLINE Having been regenerated by the Spirit with the life of God as the seed contained in God's word John 3:5-6, 15; 1 Pet 1:3, 23; James 1:18; Matt 13:3; 1 John 3:9.
[50]  Growing to be: The firstfruits as the overcomers Rev 14:1-5.
[51]  Having been planted and watered for God to cause the growth 1 Cor 3:6-7.
[52]  First, He created man; then He came to be a man in order to make man God in life and nature but not in the Godhead, not in the position and rank of God.
[53]  The Bible teaches us that when we believed in Christ, the Spirit, the consummated Spirit who is the life-giving Spirit and who is the pneumatic Christ, came to sow God as a life seed into us.
[54]  In contrast, those portions of the Word concerning God's creation of man in His image and according to His likeness, His preparing a human spirit by breathing His breath of life into man's nostrils, and His putting man in front of the tree of life, a figure of God Himself as life, are solid, like diamond.
[55]  GROWING UP INTO THE HEAD, CHRIST, IN ALL THINGS
[56]  We need to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things.
[57]  The believers grow by living by the Spirit Gal 5:25a .
[58]  OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22-23; Rom 12:5; Eph 4:15-16; Col 2:19; Eph 4:12; 1 Cor 3:12; Eph 3:9; 1:10 OUTLINE The Body of Christ, as the church of God, being an organism like the human body Eph 1:22-23: Constituted with all the living members of Christ Rom 12:5.
[59]  The subject of this chapter is the building up of the Body of Christ.
[60]  The Body of Christ, as the church of God, is an organism like the human body Eph 1:22-23 .
[61]  THE GROWTH OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Through the Members Growing into the Head, Christ, in All Things by Holding to Truth in Love
[62]  We, the members of Christ, must grow into the Head.
[63]  We can be a Christian, a member of Christ, and yet have many aspects in which we are not in Christ.
[64]  The building up of the Body of Christ will usher in the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God.
[65]  In Ephesians 3:9-10 Paul said, "And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is...in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church."
[66]  In Ephesians 1:10 Paul said that the church carries out the economy of God that all things can be headed up in Christ.
[67]  Hymn #840 Hymns is a very practical song concerning the building up of the Body of Christ.
[68]  THE NEW JERUSALEM Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 3:10-12; Rev 21:1; 22:1; 21:6; 22:17b; John 4:14; 7:37-39; Rev 22:2, 14; 2:7; 21:3, 22, 11 OUTLINE The New Jerusalem being the consummation of all the works of God's new creation out of His old creation in all the dispensations through the ages, including: The ages in the Old Testament: The age before the law, from Adam to Moses.
[69]  The New Jerusalem being the aggregate of God's organic union and mingling with His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people: The constitution of God as life in the redeemed humanity.
[70]  With the processed Triune God to be the flowing river of water of life as the very center and the very source of supply of the holy city Rev 22:1: To quench organically the thirst of God's people mingled and built together with God for eternity Rev 21:6; 22:17b; cf.
[71]  THE TREE OF LIFE BEING THE CENTER OF THE BIBLE
[72]  The twelve gates of pearl bear the names of the twelve tribes of Israel Rev 21:12 .
[73]  This indicates that these pearls are the twelve tribes of Israel.
[74]  Every day, without our being conscious of it, the indwelling Spirit adds the new element of God into our being, and with this new element, which is divine and is even God Himself, He transforms us metabolically.
[75]  Revelation 21:3 tells us that such a New Jerusalem is first the tabernacle of our God, God's dwelling place for eternity.
[76]  It also tells us that there is no temple in the city, but the Dweller, the Divine Trinity, who dwells in the tabernacle, is Himself the temple to be our dwelling place v. 22 . God dwells in us as the tabernacle, and we dwell in God as the temple.
[77]  It begins with the tree of life as the center, and it ends with the tree of life as the center, to carry out an organic union between God and us by our drinking of God as the water of life and our eating of Him as the tree of life.
[78]  The Age of the Kingdom, from Christ's Second Coming to the End of the Old Creation
[79]  In this age God will finish His work of producing the new creation out of the old creation by perfecting those of His chosen people who were not perfected in the foregoing ages.
