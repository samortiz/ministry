 <h2 class="head2">The Bible Ending with a Call and a Promise</h2>
<p>At the consummation of the Bible there is a call and a promise. The call is in Revelation 22:17: &ldquo;The Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who hears say, Come! And let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely.&rdquo; This is a call to come to drink of the water of life that proceeds out of the throne of the Lamb-God, the redeeming God (v. 1). This flow is the flow of the living God. The living Lamb-God flows Himself out as the river of water of life. When Jesus was on this earth, He sounded the same call. &ldquo;Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&rdquo; (John 7:37-38). The Bible ends with this eternal call and also with a promise. &ldquo;Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city&rdquo; (Rev. 22:14). The call at the end of the Bible is for us to come and drink, and the promise is that we will have right to eat the tree of life and to enter into God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BUILT INTO THE NEW JERUSALEM<br />
BY EATING CHRIST AND DRINKING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Today in the church life we are drinking, eating, and being built. We enter into the holy city not by walking in but by being built in. Peter did not walk into the New Jerusalem; he entered into the New Jerusalem by being built in. We need to be built in today. We need to begin not by trying to build others in but by being built in ourselves. The way to be built in is not by praying for the Lord to cut off our sharp corners and rough edges so that we will fit into the building. The more we pray in this way, the less we will be fit for the building. Dietitians know that it is the proper food that can change us. The proper spiritual food can regulate our disposition and our temper. Instead of trying to improve our character or disposition outwardly, we need to change our diet by eating the word and calling on the Lord in order to eat Christ and drink the Spirit. The proper diet is Jesus and His living word. If we eat Jesus, we will be the same as Jesus, and if we drink the Spirit, we will be spiritual.</p>
<p>We need to eat Christ as the tree of life and drink the Spirit as the river of water of life. As we eat Christ and drink the Spirit, we will be constituted with Christ and will corporately become the Body-Christ. Today the Body-Christ is the church life as a miniature of the New Jerusalem. If we are in the Body-Christ today, we can be sure that the New Jerusalem will be our destiny.</p>
