<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Body of Christ<br>Being Uniquely One Universally</H2><P>The Body of Christ is uniquely one universally (Eph. 4:4-6). Individually, we are members of the Body of Christ, and all the local churches are parts of this one unique Body of Christ. As those who are in the Body, we need to realize that we are one with all the saints in the entire universe. Ephesians 4:4-6 depicts a oneness that is universal: "One Body and one Spirit, as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all." In these verses we can see that the Triune God is mingled with the Body. The Body mentioned here is not local; rather, it is universal. This is the universal oneness of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Fellowship of the Body of Christ<br>Also Being Uniquely One Universally</H2><P>Since the Body of Christ is uniquely one universally, the fellowship of the Body of Christ also is uniquely one universally.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Fellowship of the Apostles</H2><P>The fellowship of the Body of Christ is the fellowship of the apostles&#151;the divine fellowship between all the believers and the Triune God. The term the fellowship of the apostles is used in Acts 2:42: "And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles." Then, 1 John 1:3 tells us that the fellowship of the apostles is not merely with us, the believers, but also with the Father and the Son. Here John did not mention the Spirit directly, because he was speaking in the Spirit. The Spirit was there already. The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the Body of Christ, the divine fellowship between all the believers and the Triune God.</P><P>The fellowship of the apostles is based upon the apostles' teaching. Fellowship always comes after teaching. If there is no teaching, there is no element or realm of the fellowship. Actually, the teaching is the element and the realm of the fellowship. By the Lord's mercy, today in the Lord's recovery we are under the apostles' teaching and in the apostles' fellowship. The fellowship of the recovery which we are in is the recovered fellowship of the apostles. This fellowship was lost, but it has been recovered. Today we are in the fellowship of the apostles, which is the fellowship of the Lord's recovery. If you are a Baptist, you are in the fellowship of the Baptists. But the fellowship of the Baptists is narrower than the fellowship of the apostles, so they cannot claim that their fellowship is the fellowship of the apostles. We need to see and have the boldness to say that we are in the fellowship of the recovery which is the recovered apostles' fellowship.</P>
