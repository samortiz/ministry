   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Confession in the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me first say a few words lest you think that I do not believe in confession or restitution.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christians ought to confess their sins and make restitution.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I admit that these are truths in the Bible, and as such, they should be applied.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But I must add that the Bible never considers confession to be a way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we think that we can be saved through confession, then the solution to the problem of our sins is still not clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are presuming that there is another method of redemption apart from the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may even surmise that we can deal with our own sins before God and man without the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1 John 1:9</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us come to a verse many love to quote, that is, 1 John 1:9, which says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are a number who, based on this verse, state that confession is indeed a requirement for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, I must draw your attention to several points in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, what is mentioned here is definitely not public confession.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First John 1:9 deals with our problem before God when it says, "If we confess our sins."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This differs from the current practice of open confession before men.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First John 1:9 does not say anything about open confession.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, the pronoun "we" in this verse is not like the same pronoun used in the books of Romans and Galatians in that it has nothing to do with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Epistle of 1 John is also different from the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John's Gospel shows us how an unbeliever can obtain life, whereas his Epistle tells us how one who has life proves before man that he possesses that life in fact.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His Gospel reveals the way to receive life, whereas his Epistle discloses how one who possesses such a life goes about demonstrating what he possesses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, properly expounded, the "we" in this verse does not refer to sinners, but to believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Gospel of John describes the way a sinner is justified by God, but 1 John indicates how a Christian may restore his fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Word here does not discuss how the world can believe in Jesus to have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It indicates how a person who has eternal life and is a child of God can have his sins forgiven by God and have his unrighteousness cleansed when he fails.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, this verse makes reference to the believers alone, those who have been saved and justified, those who possess eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Remember that, whereas an unsaved person is forgiven of his sins by faith, a saved one is forgiven by confessing his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sinners are pardoned by believing in the Lord, and Christians are forgiven by confessing their sins before their Father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First John 1:9 does not deal with the sins of a sinner but with those of a believer, not with the sins committed before one's salvation, but with those committed after one has been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Consequently, this verse has nothing to do with our present subject.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I would not be so strict as to say that this verse can be applied only to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, I would admit that one may borrow from a host of Scriptures and utilize them to get people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Recently a sister told me that a lady was saved by reading the phrase, "The seed is the word of God" Luke 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I do not know how this could have happened.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I first preached the gospel, I was convinced that it takes clear gospel Scriptures to get people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, much experience in recent years has taught me, and I say this reverently, that many are actually saved by strange verses.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One cannot imagine that verses as strange as some are can save people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am not insisting that no sinner could be saved by 1 John 1:9.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am saying that when John was moved by the Holy Spirit to write his Epistle, in his mind the ones referred to in this verse were Christians and not sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He originally intended them to be for Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although one may temporarily borrow this word and apply it to a sinner, he should not keep on borrowing it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Strictly speaking, such a verse refers to Christians and does not imply that one must confess his sins publicly and make restitution to others in order to be forgiven.</S>
