4) The accomplishment of the experience of the grace in God's economy is the organic Body of Christ, which consummates in the New Jerusalem
God's economy, the law of God in His economy, and the grace of God in His economy-these three things-are the subject of the entire Bible
From the first chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of Revelation, what is the entire Bible with sixty-six books concerned with?
God is infinite and intangible, yet He desires to gain the tangible man that He might enter into man to be man's life organically
God is concealed and invisible yet He desires to be united and mingled with the tangible man that He may have a visible tangible expression
God created man in His inward image and according to His outward likeness so that man may be like God within and without
Your picture bears your image, your form, and your likeness, but you are not in it and it does not have you as its life
God created man in His inward image and according to His outward likeness that man may look like Him and represent Him
He did not eat of the tree of life, which signifies God as his life, that he might have God's life organically and live out God
If he eats the wrong thing, taking it into him, this is a matter relating to life; it becomes a matter of life and death
Since man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which signifies Satan, Satan's nature entered into man
God's intention in His economy is to accomplish a goal, that is, for the Divine Trinity to gain man to be His organism
What God wants is to have an organism that lives out God to express God, manifest God, and be joined with God as one
Before the law was given, God first gave man a sweet promise; He promised the fallen sinner that the seed of woman would come
The law describes to us what kind of God He is, what kind of image He bears, and what kind of attributes He possesses
They charge us repeatedly not to have graven images or other gods besides Jehovah, nor make images or worship them
In other words, we should have only God, and besides Him, we should not have any other object which we worship and by which we are occupied
You have shed tears before the Lord but not for Him; you wept because you did not graduate from college, because you failed to obtain a Ph
The fourth commandment requires man to take only God and all that God has accomplished for man as man's satisfaction and rest
When the Lord Jesus came, although man still desired to keep the Sabbath, the Lord did not want man to keep it any longer
The keeping of the Sabbath means that you can take only God and all that He has done for you as your satisfaction, enjoyment, and rest
She had a peculiarity that while she loved to cook good meals for us, she had to do it all by herself and did not want us to do anything
If we would sit there and watch her doing everything and then praise her for doing such an excellent job, she would be very happy
We children knew that we just needed to wait for our mother to prepare the food for us and that we did not have to do anything
When the dumplings were done, we just praised her that her dumplings were really delicious; then she was very satisfied
While all of us were eating, she did not eat but just watched us and waited on us that we might have the enjoyment
To keep the Sabbath is to take God and everything that He has done for us as our satisfaction, enjoyment, and rest
The fifth commandment requires us to honor our parents and thus trace back to our source, our origin-the God who created us
The sixth through the tenth commandments require man to live out the virtues that express God according to God's attributes
If you violate any of these five commandments, you overthrow God's attributes and do not manifest God's virtues
God is holiness; He is transcendent, different from everything else, extraordinary, and distinct from all common things
God is righteousness; He is right, not crooked or biased, not twisted or distorted, but just, upright, and right in every way
He said that every one who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart
The law, therefore, exposes our condition, showing us that it is impossible for sinners to fulfill the requirements of God's law
The law of God makes it impossible for sinners to fulfill the requirements of God, because God's law is for the purpose of exposing man
The law itself is not weak, but the flesh of man that tries to work out the law is weak, so the law became weak and impotent
Since the law cannot give life and is impotent, being weak through the flesh of sinners, why did God add the law?
The law of God was added for the purpose of exposing man's inward, sinful nature and his outward, wicked deeds
When we are under law, we are just like children, and we need the law to be the custodian and child-conductor watching over us
As Christians, we are very familiar with the term grace, and we have often come across it in our reading of the New Testament
In the Old Testament the word 'grace' is used very little, because at that time God had not become flesh and could not become grace
No one knows how long God had been in eternity, and it is very difficult for anyone to know what He did in eternity past
What is covered from the first chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of Revelation is the content of that divine counsel in eternity
He was not qualified to be God's organism because neither his image nor his likeness was organic; he did not have God as his life
One of these two trees signifies God as the source of life, and the other signifies Satan as the element of death
After Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan's life and nature, even Satan himself, entered into him
Adam's transgression was not only due to his wrongdoing outwardly but due to his eating something wrong inwardly
Not only so, but after speaking such a word, God killed a lamb and used its skin to make coats for Adam and Eve
During that period, man fell from God into sin; this means that he fell from God's ruling into the ruling of his own conscience
Eventually, in Noah's time, God came in to execute His judgment by destroying the people of that generation with the flood
The seed of woman who would bruise the serpent's head is the seed of Abraham in whom all the families of the earth would be blessed
The predecessor of the new covenant was the covenant God made with Abraham based on the promise He gave to Adam
In this covenant God promised that Abraham would beget a son, a seed, in whom the families of the earth would be blessed
When the blessing that God gave to Abraham comes to us, it is grace; this grace is the seed of Abraham, which is also the seed of woman
During that period, the descendants of Abraham went down to Egypt and were under the slavery of Pharaoh for four hundred thirty years
Sixty years before Christ's birth, the Roman Empire conquered the king of the Jews and thus brought in the fall of the Jewish nation
One day God called His Son out of Egypt, and this Son is a corporate Son, who includes Israel as well as Christ
That new covenant was the new covenant spoken of in Jeremiah 31 as the continuation of the covenant that God made with Abraham
According to Romans 5, the law was something added; it was not something in the original plan but was inserted afterwards
The grace of Christ does not mean that Christ is Christ and grace is grace; rather, it means that Christ is grace
The love of God does not mean that outside of God there is something called love; rather, it means that God is love
A part of the grace of God in His economy is that Christ has become our redemption for the forgiveness of our offenses
When Christ in us is daily received, enjoyed, and experienced by us, that is grace being added to us, grace upon grace
In our experience of the grace in God's economy, first, we have faith and love through the Lord's superabounding grace
We have neither faith nor love, but when we allow the Lord to come into us, both faith and love from the Lord as grace come into us
If a jeweler is not able to convince you the first day, he will talk to you again the next day when you pass by his store
After we finish our speaking, many will believe because what is good is simply good, and what is precious is simply precious
In their experience of the grace in God's economy, the believers also receive the salvation in life in Christ's resurrection and ascension
We just need to believe into the Lord Jesus by calling on His name, confessing our sins, and praying to Him; then He will come into us
The believers' experience of the grace in God's economy enables them to obtain access into and stand in God's grace
The very Christ who is sitting on the throne in heaven is also now in our spirit, where the habitation of God is
In their experience of the grace in God's economy, the believers also receive God's abounding supply of all grace
Paul said that he did not live by his own righteousness but that he was crucified with Christ and it was Christ who lived in him
In their experience of the grace in God's economy, the believers display the riches of liberality in the depth of poverty
The life we have received does not merely save us from a few things; rather, it enthrones us as kings to reign over all things
If we have the experience of the aforementioned sixteen items, we are those who stand in the abundance of grace
Regardless of how much others criticize you, judge you, or dispute with you, never open your mouth and never reason
What God wants in His economy is for Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, to become the embodied grace to you
We have been crucified with Christ; now Christ is in us not only to be our life and life supply but also to be our person
Christ and we live together; two lives have one living, two natures are mingled into one nature, and two spirits become one spirit
Such a living is the organism for the processed and consummated Triune God to live among us organically for His expression
What God wants today is that we experience the grace in His economy so that the Divine Trinity may have an organism
If we only speak about these things, we are still speaking about the '; we do not have God as the organic One in us
In this message we come to the most crucial point, which is the grace in God's economy in the believers' experience
The Son is the embodiment and expression of the Father, and the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son
The first step, which is also the greatest step, of the process which the Triune God passed through was incarnation
It is amazing that one day the eternal God, the Creator of all things, was conceived in the womb of the virgin Mary
The eternal God, the infinite God, the Creator of all things, entered into the womb of a little virgin and stayed there for nine months!
The little child lying in the manger was the eternal God, the infinite Lord, and the Lord who created the heavens, the earth, and all things
Do not forget that this One who was a carpenter is the Creator of all things mingled with humanity as a small man
He had no attracting form or majesty that people would desire Him, but His words were with power, and His doings were with great might
During this time God counted Him as our substitute, who took the place of sinners, bearing our sins and being made sin for us
When He yielded up His spirit, the veil of the temple was split in two from top to bottom, the earth was shaken, and the rocks were split
In the evening of that day He again appeared to the disciples and breathed into them, saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
The Father as the source is embodied and expressed in the Son; the Son is realized as the Spirit and abides in the believers
As far as our spiritual life is concerned, we need the living water of life, the bread of life, and the breath of life as our supply
The indwelling Spirit, the processed Triune God, abides in the believers as the anointing and becomes their enjoyment in life
The Spirit, whom God has given to dwell in us, is the witness in our spirit, witnessing that we dwell in God and God in us
The indwelling Spirit is the element and sphere of God's indwelling that we may experience and enjoy His abiding in us
The Spirit, who dwells in our spirit, is also the basic element of the divine anointing to be our enjoyment in life
The anointing Spirit the pneumatic Christ the Spirit who speaks to the churches eventually becomes the counterpart of the church the bride
Such a processed and consummated Triune God is the grace enjoyed by all the believers in God's New Testament economy, even for eternity
In the garden of Eden, before man had eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man had no concept of good and evil
Satan came in and tempted man to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which is anything other than the tree of life
As soon as man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the concept of good and evil entered into him
The Pentateuch is full of what is right, what is wrong, what is good, and what is evil, but the Gospel of John is not
Today it is not enough to say, as the inner-life people do, that what God wants is neither good nor evil but Christ
If the older ones the younger ones the elders the deacons and the coworkers in the church all can see this there will be no more arguments
The arguments in the church all come from being right or wrong, from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
The New Testament believers' living under the grace in God's economy is a total living of experiencing the processed Triune God as grace
A total living is not the living concerning right and wrong, good and evil, or anything else, but the living of a living person
The living of this living person is the mingled living of the processed Triune God with the tripartite transformed man
He initiates, and we follow; He and we move together to live out a certain condition, which is called an organism, to express God Himself
The processed Triune God who has been consummated as the allinclusive lifegiving compound and indwelling Spirit becomes the Spirit of grace
At the end of the New Testament age, the Spirit of grace will cause the whole house of Israel to repent and receive the Triune God as grace
The compound, life-giving Spirit and the believers' regenerated spirit become one mingled spirit , not only united but also mingled
Now the compound Spirit is moving within us daily as the anointing that we may enjoy the processed Triune God as grace
We have the filthiness of our natural being, the filthiness of our flesh, the filthiness of our lusts, and the filthiness of the earth
In this message we come to the conclusion, which is the consummation of the believers' experience of the grace of God in His economy
Rather, we have forsaken God as the fountain of living waters to hew out for ourselves cisterns, broken cisterns, which hold no water
In Psalm 1 he related how he appreciated the law and meditated in it by day and by night like a tree planted beside streams of water
The entire book of one hundred fifty psalms shows us that the law is used by God to expose man in his sinful nature and evil deeds
God became flesh to dwell among us, full of grace, and of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace
It is by His becoming flesh to be a man that His divinity and humanity might be united and mingled to produce a God-man
The consummation of the believers' experience of the grace of God in His economy is the church as the Body of Christ
The Body of Christ is the ultimate goal of God's creation of man in His image and His intention for man to take Him as life
The Body of Christ is the final purpose of the law of God in His economy in guarding God's chosen people and bringing them to Christ
Otherwise, why would the law keep God's chosen people under its custody and serve as their conductor to bring them to Christ as grace?
When we read Psalm 51 a psalm of his confession of sin we can see that he knew grace and was clear concerning grace to a considerable extent
Because of man's natural concept according to human understanding, most consider the New Jerusalem a material city
Pearls signify Christ the Son in His overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection with all the virtues and attributes
All these precious materials are the products of our participation in and enjoyment of Christ in our spirit through the Holy Spirit
Day by day we need to be filled with Him, saturated with Him, permeated by Him, infused by Him, and transfused by Him
When we teach and shepherd others, we do not exhort them to do something; that is the way of religion, not the Spirit
After His incarnation, because His flesh, His humanity, was not the Son of God, He had to pass through resurrection and be 'sonized'
Originally, we were men of clay; however, in the New Jerusalem there is no clay but gold, pearls, and precious stones
We all need to pass through regeneration and transformation, and then we can become a part of the New Jerusalem
If we have not been burned and pressed, we remain natural wood, grass, and stubble and cannot be precious stones for building
If we are not willing to be transformed by being burned or pressed today, we will not be able to enter the New Jerusalem
Heaven and earth will pass away, but every iota and every serif of the words in the Scriptures shall by no means pass away
After the millennium, all the saved ones will eventually be in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth
During the millennium, only the overcomers will be in the New Jerusalem, and the defeated ones will not be there
Since the unique attribute of the Divine Trinity is oneness, the unique attribute of the organism of the Divine Trinity must also be oneness
In such a unique attribute of the Divine Trinity, the organism of the Divine Trinity also possesses the same unique attribute
In the organic Body of Christ, the creating of any divisions is an insult to and a contempt for the Triune God, whose attribute is oneness
The product of the grace in God's economy is a poem to exhibit the surpassing riches of the grace in God's economy
We have been saved by the surpassing and rich grace that we may carry out the good works that God prepared beforehand for us to walk in
On the one hand, we are to exhibit the rich grace of God, and on the other hand, we are to carry out what God foreordained
These good works must be the doing of His will that we may live the church life and bear the testimony of Jesus Christ
It was by grace, the Lord whom he experienced, that he labored for the Lord more abundantly than all the apostles
