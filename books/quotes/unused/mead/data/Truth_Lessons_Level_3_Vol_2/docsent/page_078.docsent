   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this sense, if we keep giving heed to the shining word of the Scriptures, we will have the kingdom as the day dawning in us and Christ as the morning star rising and shining in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that we will have His appearing as the morning star rising in our hearts to shine in the darkness of apostasy where we are today, before His actual appearing as the bright morning star.</S>
