<p>We are human beings, yet we have God&rsquo;s life and God&rsquo;s nature. Although we are humans, we have become children of God by the life of God. Unfortunately, Christianity has lost this truth and does not teach this truth. Rather, it teaches many insignificant minor items. The United States is the most superior and powerful nation in the world. It is first-class in almost all concepts except in the matter of the truth. Twenty years ago I came to America and spoke using the diagram of the three circles. This diagram covers the three parts of man&mdash;the spirit, the soul, and the body. When I spoke about the human spirit, many American Christians and even some preachers said that they had never seen in the Bible that man has a spirit. They knew that there was the Holy Spirit and the evil spirits, but they did not know that man has a spirit. For this reason, I spoke to them everything that is related to the human spirit from Genesis to Revelation. As a result, they were fully convinced.</p>
<p>Some people say that no one ever told the American Christians that man has a spirit. This saying is in fact not accurate because in the last one hundred years in America a few famous spiritual authors have mentioned the human spirit in their writings. For example, the diagram of the three circles is taken from the book <em>God&rsquo;s Plan of Redemption,</em> written by an American sister, Mary E. McDonough. When you open this book, you will see the diagram of the three circles. Although the author of this book was an American, the American Christians never read her book. However, I, a Chinese, read it and quoted it to them in my teaching.</p>
<p>There is a Christian group in Anaheim that strongly opposes our preaching that Christ dwells in us. They say, &ldquo;Christ is so great, and we are so small; how could He dwell in us? There is no such thing as this. Christ today is sitting on the throne and is not in us. Instead, He has sent the Holy Spirit as His representative to be in us. To say that Christ dwells in us is altogether heretical.&rdquo; The truth they teach is completely distorted because they think that the Holy Spirit in us is merely the representative of Christ. They do not see that the Holy Spirit is the Triune God.</p>
<p>In Galatians 2:20 the apostle Paul clearly said, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; How can people say that the Christ mentioned in this verse is not Christ Himself but a representative of Christ? In saying this, they are altering the Bible. Paul clearly said that Christ was not only in him but was living in him. This means that Christ was moving and working in him. The New Testament does not say that the Christ who is sitting in the heavens has sent merely a representative to be in us. Instead, the New Testament emphasizes that the Christ who is sitting in the heavens is also within us, that is, in our spirit (Rom. 8:10, 34; 2 Cor. 13:5; Col. 1:27; 3:1; 2 Tim. 4:22). Since He is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), and the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), He is omnipresent. Therefore, He can be at the right hand of God and in our spirit simultaneously. He can be in heaven and on earth at the same time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING OUR LIFE</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am...the life&rdquo; (John 11:25). Then Paul said, &ldquo;Christ our life&rdquo; (Col. 3:4). This is a more personal way of saying what the Lord said. Christ is not only the life, but He is also our life. We should have the boldness to say that Christ is our life, that He lives in us, and that it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us. This Christ, who is our life, lives in us as the Spirit of life. If Christ were not the Spirit, He would have no way to come into us.</p>
<p>The English word <em>pneuma</em> is an anglicized Greek word denoting &ldquo;spirit,&rdquo; &ldquo;wind,&rdquo; or &ldquo;air.&rdquo; Some tires have the word <em>pneumatic</em> printed on them, indicating that the tires must have pneuma, air, for the car to move. If you drive carelessly and one of the tires is punctured by a nail, you will have a flat tire, and your car will stop moving. Today there are many &ldquo;deflated&rdquo; Christians. We need to ask ourselves all the time, &ldquo;Am I full of pneuma or am I deflated?&rdquo; We must always be filled with pneuma. If we have a flat tire, we have to go to the gas station to pump it up. Similarly, if we are &ldquo;deflated&rdquo; inwardly, we have to turn to our spirit to contact the Lord, who is pneuma, so that we will be filled with pneuma, which is the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>On the evening of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came into the midst of His disciples. He did not teach them with a lengthy speech nor instruct them on how to conduct themselves. He did only one thing&mdash;He breathed into them. Formerly all the disciples had been discouraged and disappointed, &ldquo;deflated&rdquo; to the uttermost. They had entirely lost heart, thinking that the Lord was dead and that they were altogether hopeless. However, when the Lord Jesus came, He breathed into them and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (John 20:22). This is the holy breath, through which the Lord dispensed Himself into them to be their life and everything.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth, Life, the Church, and the Gospel-The Four Great Pillars in the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
