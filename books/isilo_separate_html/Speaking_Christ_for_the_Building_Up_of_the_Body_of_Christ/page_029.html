AND BEING BURDENED FOR THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>If we have seen that the new way to meet is better than the old way, we must endeavor to learn and practice this way and help others to do the same. We need much learning. We should pick up the burden to practice the new way with patience with ourselves and with others. In any aspect of human society it is not an easy thing to change a habitual way. This is true not only in a church like that in Taipei with about ten thousand people, but also in a church of only one hundred people. Even in a family of eight it is not easy to change a habit.</p>
<p>Some Chinese families living in the United States may find it hard to drop their habit of eating with chopsticks. Two members of the family may want to use forks, but the rest may insist on using chopsticks. They would say that without chopsticks the flavor in eating is spoiled and that with them every course tastes so good. To put away the old way of meeting and pick up this biblical way is a great change. Some older brothers and sisters and even some young ones who have been with us for a few years may not feel so happy about it. They may feel somewhat awkward. Therefore, we must see the vision of the scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ. We must take this new way or the Lord will have no way to go on.</p>
<p>In the way of Christianity how could the Lord edify His members organically for the development of their organic function that they may build up an organism, the Body of Christ? There is no possibility. We have studied and investigated and have seen that the Body of Christ cannot be built up in the old way of Christianity. At most an organized &ldquo;church,&rdquo; a group of people organized together, can be built up. However, that is not something organic. To build up an organism in an organic way we need all the spiritual organs of the saints to be developed. Therefore, we must take the new way. Sooner or later, if not at this time then in the following years, the Lord will work this out. He needs some to take this new way.</p>
<p>Two thousand years have passed and there is no Body of Christ as an organism which is built up. According to the record of the New Testament, the church at the time of the apostles was not better than it is today. At that time Paul suffered much. It was he who pioneered the way to bring the gospel to all of Asia Minor, and it was he who taught the saints there. He stayed in Ephesus for three years (Acts 19:1, 22; 20:31). He did much for the churches in Asia and wrote some epistles to them. However, by the time of his martyrdom, all who were in Asia forsook him with his ministry (2 Tim. 1:15) due mainly to different opinions. A proper Body of Christ was not built up at Paul&rsquo;s time, at the beginning of the church age. The seven epistles from the Lord to the churches in Asia confirm this (Rev. 2:1&mdash;3:22).</p>
<p>Two thousand years have passed and what is here today? Where is the built up Body of Christ? We must believe that the Lord Jesus cannot be defeated. He will surely do something. He is able. The reason He has tolerated the situation is that He would not do anything by Himself with His divine power alone. He likes to do things in the principle of incarnation. The principle of incarnation is that the divine power must be mingled with the human element. He needs us. On the side of the divine power, there has been no problem. Even two thousand years ago there was no problem. The problem is on our side, the human side. On the human side the greatest problem is the different human opinions.</p>
<p>We should not expect that since the Lord has shown us this new way and we have brought the new way into the recovery, all the churches will be happy to take it. To think this way is somewhat childish. Do not forget that we all are still human. Therefore, there is the need of some faithful ones, who have seen the vision and the need, to pick up the burden to pray. Prayer is first. Then we have to do something like the apostles, who were pioneers and good examples.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
