   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN RELIGION OR REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All worship and service that is apart from Christ, though seemingly worship and service to God, is of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From the human perspective these things may seem to be very good, but they do not have much value in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Serving in this way should be only an initial experience and should lead us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is the most pitiful thing if one who serves God stays merely in religious practices.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Any kind of religious service should be just an introductory experience that ushers us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From God's word we clearly see that only worship and service that are in Christ are of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Any worship, any service that is apart from Christ is of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE MYSTERY OF GOD BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From beginning to end God just wants us to have a relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must know that God had a purpose in creating the universe and that for generations before the time of the apostles this purpose was never told to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God hid this purpose in Himself and made it a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Colossians 2:2, the mystery of God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's purpose is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God created the universe for His Son, Christ, and God redeemed us also for His Son, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is God's purpose, but until the time of the apostles He never told anyone; rather, this purpose was hidden in God Himself as a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This hidden mystery of God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>GOD REVEALING THE MYSTERY TO THE APOSTLES</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the age of the apostles God opened the veil of the mystery to them Eph 3:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Immediately, this unveiling became a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God unveiled this mystery, which had been hidden throughout the ages, to the apostles and showed them that Christ is God's mystery, God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When this mystery was unfolded, what the apostles saw was Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the revelation that the apostles saw was the revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a revelation was unveiled to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Previously, Christ was hidden; neither Abraham nor David nor any of the prophets in the Old Testament knew Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although Christ was spoken of in the Old Testament, those in the Old Testament did not know that this Christ is the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was not until the time of the apostles that God lifted the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the apostles were able to say that God's mystery is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God does not want anything that is apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everything that is acceptable to God, praised by God, or counted by God is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE SERVICE THAT GOD DESIRES BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Deep within me I have a feeling that I cannot utter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The apostle Paul wrote so many Epistles, yet there was only one central purpose that the churches and the believers at that time would see that God's center is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Anything that is outside of Christ, no matter how pious, good, or religious, is of no value in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul said that although the Jews required signs and the Greeks sought wisdom, the apostles preached Christ crucified 1 Cor 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God did not want the apostles to preach signs or wisdom; instead, He wanted them to preach the crucified Christ as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why did He want this?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is because Christ is God's sign, God's wisdom, and God's power v. 24 . In the early church, some believers laid much emphasis on signs, and others very much stressed Greek wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The apostles, however, told them that service before God is not a matter of signs or wisdom but a matter of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today the service that God desires is not related to signs or wisdom but is of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is of Christ is actually just Christ Himself.</S>
