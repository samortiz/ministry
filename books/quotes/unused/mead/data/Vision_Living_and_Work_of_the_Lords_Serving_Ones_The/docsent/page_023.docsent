   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Releasing Messages concerning</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Building of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I left Taipei in April and returned in October.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On our return trip, I stopped in Hong Kong and held a conference there.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After seeing the situation of the most spiritual place in the West, I began to consider the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, in that conference I released messages concerning the building of God for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, those messages were not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After I returned to Taipei, I held another conference, and I released more messages concerning the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These messages were more complete.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In one message I said that I went to the West with the specific intention of seeing the most spiritual place in order to see the building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although their messages were spiritual, they did not have much building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Several of their elders had grievances, and even Brother Austin-Sparks said that he was considering moving to another place because they did not submit to his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After this speaking, the dissenting brothers among us began to plot about how to oppose me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Experiencing the All-inclusive Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>in the Midst of Adversities</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From that time onward, the sun blazed on me, the rain pounded on me, and ice and sleet fell on me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I experienced adversities in my human life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later the Lord led me to America, a Christian country with numerous seminaries and theologians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The light that we received from the Lord caused some believers in traditional Christianity to rise up to oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They despised me as a Chinese man teaching Westerners.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They published books to attack me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Taking words out of context, they alleged that I teach pantheism, because I said that Christ is our rock, our living water, our clothing, and our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They also asserted that calling on the Lord s name and pray-reading the Lord s Word were derived from Oriental Buddhism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They used every means possible to slander me; there are more than two hundred sixty publications opposing us, and the attacks are aimed at me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through the oppositions and attacks, I experienced adversities in my human life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, the Lord whom I serve, my wife, and the saints who are around me can all testify that none of the adverse situations touched me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before I went to America, the Lord used sixty years of adverse situations to prepare me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During the past twenty years, the Lord has used this ministry immensely.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Three hundred fifty churches have been raised up in North America, South America, Central America, Africa, Australia, and Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord has truly blessed His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the same time, the persecution and opposition has reached its zenith; this is the problem from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also have trouble within, that is, the rumors from dissenting ones among us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All of these constitute the adversities in my human life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul says, For me this will turn out to salvation through...the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By the Lord s mercy and grace, I can testify that I have experienced the all-inclusive Spirit the all-inclusive death of Christ and the human living of Jesus in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, most of what I understand of the Bible comes from my experience and not from doctrinal knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can I say that there is the element of human living in the all-inclusive Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I learned it from my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This message is a testimony of my experience of the all-inclusive Spirit and the all-inclusive death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our Lord Jesus was incarnated, lived a human life in His humanity for thirty-three and a half years, died, resurrected, and ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through this process He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through His death and resurrection, the two elements of human nature including human living and death were added to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today the life-giving Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
