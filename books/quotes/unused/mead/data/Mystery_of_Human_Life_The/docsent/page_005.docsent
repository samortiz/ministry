   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF FAITH IN CHRIST 1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE TWO BECOMINGS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God became flesh, born as a man called Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Please read the following verse:</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John 1:14</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1 Corinthians 15:45</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since this Spirit is the life-giving Spirit, He dispenses God with His life into His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the Bible says:</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1 John 5:12 2.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>REGENERATING MAN</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In his first birth, man obtains a physical life.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God...has regenerated us...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1 Peter 1:3 Jesus said, Unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 3:3</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A pig cannot participate in the sheep s kingdom and live a sheep s life by education, improvement, or regulation; it must possess the life of a sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Similarly, man cannot participate in God s kingdom and live a divine life by education, improvement, or regulation; he must receive the life of God!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE MEANING OF BEING A CHRISTIAN</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A Christian is one who receives God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God first dispenses Himself into our spirit and then spreads from our spirit into our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Finally, He fills and saturates our spirit, soul, and body with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible calls this final stage glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Romans 8:30</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through this, we can be transformed and conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Romans 8:29</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the purpose of human life!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the meaning of being a Christian!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is what God has planned for you!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>WHAT MUST YOU DO NOW?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now that you have realized God s plan, you should do four things:</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>TURN YOUR HEART TO GOD REPENT</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Repentance is not to be remorseful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Repentance is neither to turn over a new leaf.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Repentance is to have a change in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Previously you had your back towards God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whether you were doing good or evil, you were turned away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Your mind was turned away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now listen to what the Lord Jesus said:</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Matt 4:17 2.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>BELIEVE RECEIVE</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To believe is not to nod your head, nor to agree, nor merely to be appreciative.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If someone gives you a watch, it is not enough for you just to nod your head in agreement and admire the watch.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You need to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Believing is just receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Read the following verse:</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>John 1:12 3.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>CONFESS CALL</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Being a Christian is an open matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God requires that your heart believe and that your mouth confess.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If your heart does not believe, you cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If your mouth does not confess, neither can you be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But:</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>...if you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Romans 10:9 4.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>BE BAPTIZED TESTIFY</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Baptism is a testimony before men.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All believers should be baptized in order to be saved not only before God, but also before men.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord Jesus said:</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Mark 16:16</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Through baptism, God transfers us from the kingdom of Satan into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>For this reason, the Lord Jesus said:</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>John 3:5 NOW PLEASE PRAY:</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>"Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I am a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I need You.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Come into my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Take away my sin.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Fill me that I may have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I receive You right now as my Savior and life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I give myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I ask this in Your name, Amen!"</S>
