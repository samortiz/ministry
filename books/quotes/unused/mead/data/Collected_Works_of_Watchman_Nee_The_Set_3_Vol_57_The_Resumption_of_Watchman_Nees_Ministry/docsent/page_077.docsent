   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Desolation Continuing until Now</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The condition at the beginning was very different from what it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We cannot live on earth as if the church has never been degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We cannot offer up sacrifices like Cain did.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The principle of Cain is to live as if a fall had never existed, when in reality there was a fall.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before Cain, there was Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God commanded that Adam had to eat bread in the sweat of his face.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was Adam's curse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Cain's mistake did not lie in the fact that he tilled the land and was punished.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His mistake lay in the fact that he did not condemn Adam's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He went out to till the land without any sense of remorse.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When a man sins and does not have the realization that he is sinning, he has fallen into the principle of Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some are obviously in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet they feel like they have never sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Abel tended the flock, and God accepted his sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God accepted it because Abel acknowledged the existence of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He realized the value of the shedding of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Cain was different; he acted as if nothing had happened, as if there was no need for judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, while we live on this earth today, we cannot live without a sense of desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why do we leave the denominations outwardly and separate ourselves from others?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is because the church has fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are so many sects today, and so many people are nominal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Under such degraded conditions, we cannot be dull in our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE ADVANCE OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, from another angle we may say that the church has been advancing for the last two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Outwardly speaking, the church is in desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet among the faithful lovers of the Lord, God's recovery works have become deeper and deeper, and more and more numerous as time goes on.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While I was in Foochow, I told some sisters that the history of the church is like our own personal history.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Please tell me, as far as our own history is concerned, when are we the richest?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The minute we are saved, we are justified, sanctified, and regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have Christ living within us, and we have the Holy Spirit as our power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All these things are obtained as soon as we believed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although we may not realize that we obtained these things, they are all there within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When does a Christian become poor?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It happens when he gradually drops all these riches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why a person falls into darkness and trials soon after he is saved; he loses all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After some days the Lord's mercy causes such a one to regain some of what he has lost.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Still later trials come, and he becomes fallen again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord's mercy comes upon him once more, and he is revived and recovers all the lost riches again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every time we regain something, it becomes more solid in us than before.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, all of these things will become part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During his lifetime Jacob rose many times and fell many times.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But at the end of his life, he could worship God leaning on the top of his staff Heb 11:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He regained all that he had lost.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was able to come back to God like one who is fully saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Age of the Fathers until the Time</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>of Luther's Reformation</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The same is true with the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The revelation in Ephesians reached the highest point.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But this does not necessarily mean that the experience of the church in Ephesus was the richest.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church in Ephesus was like a new believer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>During the advance of the church, truths such as justification by faith, sanctification, the oneness of the church, preaching the gospel, and the truth concerning the cross have become clearer and clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whatever has been recovered at a later stage is clearer than that which was present at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>From the letters that the church father Clement wrote to the church in Corinth, we can see that those men were less clear than we are concerning the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even Augustine's Confessions and Thomas Kempis's On the Imitation of Christ do not contain as much truth as we have seen today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Among their revelations, there are treasures, but there is also sand.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to see that the church stands in between these two contradictions today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Outwardly speaking, the church is becoming worse and worse.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Inwardly speaking, its nature has become better and better.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In his books J. N. Darby described the church as a house in ruins.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yet many do not realize that the church is a house of revival at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No one after Paul was able to match Paul's revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He saw the truths in a very clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Unfortunately, he is gone today.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If he were still alive, we could ask him how he feels about today.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On the one hand, the outward church has become more and more fallen and degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But on the other hand, the inward nature of the church has become better and better.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once a truth has been recovered, it can never be lost again.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The truth of justification by faith was recovered in the midst of fiery trials.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It can never be lost today.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Let me ask you if the church could ever lose the truth of justification by faith, even after another thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The books of Romans and Galatians speak about justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But during the two thousand years of church history, one thousand years saw this truth lost.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, once this truth was recovered, it will never be lost again.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The book of Galatians was with the church for fourteen hundred years before Martin Luther, but the truth of justification by faith was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today, through the recovery of Luther, the truth of justification by faith can never be lost again.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Formerly, men argued in doctrine about justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Because many have shed their blood or been burned to death for this truth, it can never be lost again.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What the church has inherited today can never be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All the truth becomes more and more solid as time goes by.</S>
