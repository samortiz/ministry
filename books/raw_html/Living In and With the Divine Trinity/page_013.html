<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Triune God So Loving the World That<br>He Gave His Only Begotten Son,<br>That Everyone Who Believes in Him<br>Should Have Eternal Life</H2><P>John 3:16 says that [the Triune] God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should have eternal life. The world in this verse refers to mankind. God so loved mankind that He gave His only begotten Son for what purpose? It was so that everyone who believes in the Son should have eternal life. God gave His Son, and we receive eternal life. He loved mankind to such an extent that He gave His only begotten Son to us. Then we receive eternal life by believing into His dear Son. God's giving His Son to us is His dispensing. The Son is the embodiment of the Father. When the Father gave His Son to us, that was God giving Himself in His embodiment to us. If we receive His Son, His embodiment, we receive eternal life. This indicates that eternal life is the Son, the embodiment of the Triune God. To receive eternal life is to receive the Son as the embodiment of the Triune God as a gift from Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Triune God Sending His Son into the World,<br>Come of a Woman, That We Might Have<br>Life and Live through Him</H2><P>First John 4:9 says that [the Triune] God sent His Son, the only begotten, into the world that we might have life and live through Him. This verse reveals the dispensing of the Triune God in the Son that we might have Him as life and live through Him. Galatians 4:4 says that [the Triune] God sent forth His Son, come of a woman. God dispensed Himself into us as the gift of life through incarnation by being born into a woman.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Triune God Sending His Own Son<br>in the Likeness of the Flesh of Sin</H2><P>Romans 8:3 says that [the Triune] God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin. By sending His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, God came to dispense Himself into us as the gift of eternal life. The truth in Romans 8:3 can be seen in the type of the brass serpent in Numbers 21 referred to by the Lord Jesus in John 3:14: "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up." The brass serpent lifted up by Moses was in the likeness of a serpent, but within it there was not the poison of a serpent. Likewise, Christ was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but within Him there was no sin. By being lifted up on the cross as the brass serpent, Christ dealt with Satan, the old serpent (John 12:31-33; Heb. 2:14). This means that the serpentine nature within fallen man has been dealt with so that man might have eternal life. This is the way that the Triune God came to dispense Himself into His chosen people.</P>
