<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE REIGN OF SOLOMON</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Kings 7:1-12; 8:1-66</H1><P>In this message we will continue to consider Solomon's building the temple of God with his own palaces.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. His Palaces Built<br>in Association with God's Dwelling</H2><P>Solomon built his palaces in association with God's dwelling (7:1-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Built with the Same Materials<br>as Those for the Temple</H2><P>Solomon's palaces were built with the same materials as those for the temple. This indicates that his palaces were on the same rank as God's dwelling. God's dwelling was for God to be worshipped by His people. Solomon's palaces were for him to administrate his government over the people. Solomon's government was the governmental administration of God over His people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Indicating That God's Government<br>Should Go Along with His Worship</H2><P>The fact that Solomon's palaces were built in association with God's dwelling indicates that God's government over His people should go along with His worship by His people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Typology and the New Testament Reality</H2><P>In typology the king's palaces and God's temple were separate, whereas in the New Testament reality these two are one building. We, the New Testament believers, are on the one hand God's priests to serve, to worship, God and on the other hand God's kings to reign for God.</P>
