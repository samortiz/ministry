   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DAILY SAVED BY HIS INDWELLING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all realize that Jesus died on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>So, through His death we received forgiveness from our sins, and we were reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But after His death, He was resurrected to become the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 to live within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now He lives within us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is by this indwelling life of Christ that we are daily being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are daily saved from our bad temper, our shortcomings, our dissatisfactions with our husband or wife, and so many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I can testify that even today I have been saved at least eighteen times.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I was not saved by His death, but by His indwelling life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once today something came to me from the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A few days ago I had cast away that burden.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Psalm 55:22 tells us to cast our burden upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the original language it means to throw away your burden.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So I did throw away this burden to the Lord, and the burden was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But today Satan tried to bring the burden back to me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I turned to the Lord and said, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, You are my life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Immediately the burden went away.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So I was saved from this burden by the living Jesus who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I will give you another testimony of being saved by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This evening when my wife called me to dinner, a little temptation came to speak negatively about someone to my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But again I began to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Immediately I had the deep sensation that I should not say those things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So I was saved again by the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Much more we shall be saved by His life!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I said that I was saved eighteen times today, but it may have been more than eighteen times.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only today, but every day I am saved by Jesus living within me as my life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more I take Him as my life in my daily walk, the more I am saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now let me say something to the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I hope they will not be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We know that all human beings like to gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the sisters are experts in gossiping.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It would be very difficult for the most spiritual sisters not to gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if the sisters would take Jesus as their life, this living Jesus would save them from their gossiping.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then they could save their strength for praying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no need for us to waste our time and strength in gossiping.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can be saved by the living Jesus within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we will have more time and strength for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Much more we shall be saved by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>REIGNING IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then Romans 5:17 says, For if by one man s offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are not only saved by His life, but we can also reign as kings in life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A king is one that is above all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everything is under him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Praise the Lord that we can reign in life!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All things will be subdued under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are reigning in Jesus who lives in us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This Jesus living within us is even the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is the kingdom, and within Him, we can be a king subduing and conquering all things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sometimes a brother will say, By God s mercy I was barely saved from losing my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Well, this is good, but it is too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What we need is to be king over our temper, not to be barely saved from our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then we can tell our temper, Be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I m the king over you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All people like to be a king, but no one can be king over his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our temper is usually a king over us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But by Christ living in us as our life, we have the position to reign in life over our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are not only saved, but also reigning in life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From Romans five we must go on to Romans six.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Here we see how we can be saved in life and how we can reign in life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The reason is that we all have been baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him Rom 6:3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Here is one place where I appreciate the King James Version.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It says that we all have been baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is not unto, but into.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We all have been baptized into Christ, and this means to be baptized into His death.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>So by burial we have been put into death.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This means that the baptism into Christ is a kind of termination.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We all have been buried into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We all have been terminated in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This gives Christ the opportunity to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Our termination is His germination.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We are terminated in Him, and He is germinated within us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Now He lives within us, and we walk in newness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We were first buried into Him and then we were resurrected with Him to walk in newness of life as He lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the indwelling of Christ.</S>
