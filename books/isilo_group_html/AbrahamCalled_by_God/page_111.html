We all can testify that at a certain time the Spirit of God came to us. Perhaps you would say, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize that God the Spirit came to me. I only know that someone preached the gospel to me.&#8221; As that person was preaching the gospel to you, you were attracted by what he said and were willing to receive it. Although you did not understand everything he was saying, something deep within you was responding. In our mentality, many of us said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like this,&#8221; but deep within our spirit we said, &#8220;This is very good.&#8221; In my early ministry in China I did a great deal of gospel preaching. When the learned Chinese, who thought of Christianity as a foreign religion, heard our preaching, they said in their mentality, &#8220;This is a foreign religion; I don&#8217;t like it.&#8221; But, as many of them later testified, while they were saying this, something deep within them said, &#8220;This is what I need.&#8221; What was it that caused them to respond in this way deep within? It was the Holy Spirit reaching them.<p>Rebekah never dreamed that she would be selected to be Isaac&#8217;s wife. According to the custom of the time, she simply went to draw water late in the afternoon. But on this day something special happened. Before she came to the well, Abraham&#8217;s servant was already there. This indicates the Spirit&#8217;s coming to the human race (v. 10). Before we ever heard the preaching of the gospel or came to a gospel meeting, the Holy Spirit was already there waiting.<p>In Genesis 24, Abraham&#8217;s servant, who had come to a well (v. 11), asked a woman to give him a drink of water (v. 17). In John 4, the Lord Jesus, who had come to Jacob&#8217;s well (John 4:6), also asked a woman for a drink. Preachers often say that we are thirsty and need the living water to quench our thirst. But have you ever heard that the Holy Spirit is thirsty and needs you to quench His thirst? In Genesis 24 we see a servant who was thirsty after his long journey, and in John 4 we see a Savior who was thirsty after His tiring journey. Who was more thirsty in Genesis 24, the servant or Rebekah? The servant was. Likewise, who was more thirsty in John 4, the Lord Jesus or the Samaritan woman? The Lord Jesus was. Hence, as we preach the gospel, we must tell people that the Father, Son, and Spirit are thirsty for them.<p>Rebekah did not have the sense that she was thirsty; neither did she feel the need for a husband. It was the servant who was thirsty. By the time he had reached the city of Nahor, he was thirsty both physically and spiritually, thirsting for the woman who would be the proper wife for his master&#8217;s son. In John 4, the Lord Jesus also was thirsty both physically and spiritually. As you are reading this message, the Holy Spirit is even now thirsty for you. Will you give Him a drink and quench His thirst?<p>When we heard the preaching of the gospel in the past, we did not realize that the Holy Spirit was thirsty for us. We might have thought, &#8220;Why is this preacher so ambitious to convince me?&#8221; But that was not the ambition of the preacher; it was the thirst of the Spirit. As you were listening to the preaching of the gospel, did you not sense that someone was desirous of having you? At the time you were saved, you felt that someone was chasing you. On the one hand, you said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like this&#8221;; on the other hand, something deep within you said, &#8220;You cannot run away.&#8221;<p>As Rebekah went to draw water from the well that day, she was completely innocent, having no idea of what was to happen to her. She did not realize that by giving a man a drink of water and by drawing water for his camels she would be caught. But the father far away had made a plan to take a woman from her race as the wife for his son and had commissioned his servant to carry out this plan. Thus, the servant came to the city of Nahor and purposely waited there by the well. He was a real hunter hunting for a wife for Isaac. If Rebekah had never spoken to the servant, she would not have been caught. But, as we have seen, what happened did not depend on her. The servant had already prayed that the Lord would give him success, saying, &#8220;Let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master&#8221; (v. 14). While he was still speaking in this way, Rebekah came. When he asked her for a drink of water, she not only gave him a drink, but said, &#8220;I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking&#8221; (vv. 18-19). Although Rebekah did not realize it, in doing this, she was caught.<p>Many of us can testify that, at the beginning, we did not think well of Christ. But at a certain time something deep within began to love Him. When I was a youth, I did not understand very much about Christ, but I did love Him. Although I could not explain it then, I simply began to love Him. But now I know the reason: in eternity, the Father had planned to catch me. Although I am just a little man, I am more than worthy of being caught by God. We all have been caught by Him according to His plan. Let me ask you, did you desire to be saved or to be a Christian? None of us did. But one day we heard the name of Jesus and responded to it in love. This is the sign that we have been chosen. Who brought the servant to the city of Nahor where Rebekah dwelt? And who brought Rebekah to the well where the servant was waiting? Undoubtedly, it was the Spirit of God. Our being saved did not depend on us. It was the result of the Father&#8217;s plan and the Spirit&#8217;s commission.<p>Abraham&#8217;s servant eventually reached Rebekah through the satisfying water (v. 14). God&#8217;s chosen ones are the satisfying water to the Holy Spirit. Today the Holy Spirit comes to seek God&#8217;s chosen ones as Christ did at the well of Sychar (John 4:7). If anyone responds to Him and satisfies His desire, this is a sign that he is one of those chosen for Christ and that he will be gained by the Holy Spirit for Christ.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_110.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_112.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Abraham-Called by God &nbsp; pg 111</div><br></body></html>
