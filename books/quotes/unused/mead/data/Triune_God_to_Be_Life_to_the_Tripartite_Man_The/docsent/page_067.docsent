   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ADAM'S DEATH BEING THE WAY TO DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND CHRIST'S DEATH BEING THE WAY TO LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Adam's death is the way to death; Christ's death is the way to life 1 Cor 15:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you die in Adam, you go into death, but if you die with Christ, you go into life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are two kinds of death among mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One is the death of Adam, and the other is the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because we were in Adam, our destiny was to die.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But by believing in the Lord Jesus, we received a transfer out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today we have nothing to do with Adam, because we are now in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ's death is now our transit through which we enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today we are living to die.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To die is to enter into the cross, but the cross is not our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The cross is just a transit for us to enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A believer lives to die, that is, he lives to enter into the death of Christ, which is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then the cross becomes a transit to enter into the realm of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The cross is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On one side of the cross, we live to die.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the other side of the cross, we die to live.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the Christian life, and all of our work in the gospel is a part of our living unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The cross of Christ is central and universal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is the centrality of the way to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to live under the cross from the beginning of our Christian life to the end. This is what it means to live to die.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After being crucified, we die to live.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Morning to evening, all day long, day after day, throughout our Christian life, we live to die and we die to live.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>WE CHRISTIANS HAVING BEEN</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST THAT WE MAY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>LIVE BY HIM, IN HIM, AND WITH HIM</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We Christians have been crucified with Christ that we may live by Him, in Him, and with Him Gal 2:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We were crucified about two thousand years ago with Christ, but we are also being crucified today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever we have a problem with other brothers or sisters, we must realize at that moment that we are crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we are living to die.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we have the realization that we have been crucified, the outcome is that we live by Him, in Him, and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First, we go into His death through the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second, we go out of His death into His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we live in resurrection, we die to live but we still live to die.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then as we die in the death of Christ, we enter into resurrection once again that we may live by Him, in Him, and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, there is a cycle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We live to die, and we die to live.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>WE CHRISTIANS LIVING TO DIE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THAT WE MAY LIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We Christians live to die that we may live Christ 2 Cor 4:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To live to die means we have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since we have been crucified with Christ, we now live to die that we may live by Him, in Him, and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To live by Him, in Him, and with Him simply means to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To live Christ means to live by Him, not by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You still live, but you no longer live by yourself but by another One.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You live in Him and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You are in the transit of His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You live, yet not by yourself but by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You live, yet not in yourself but in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You live, yet not with yourself but with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is what it means to live Christ.</S>
