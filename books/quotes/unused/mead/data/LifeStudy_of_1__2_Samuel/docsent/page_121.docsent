   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT GOD'S DESIRE TO BUILD HIMSELF INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND TO BUILD US INTO HIM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO PRODUCE A MUTUAL ABODE Scripture Reading: 2 Sam 7:12-14a; Eph 3:17; Rev 21:2, 9</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message I still have the burden to speak on 2 Samuel 7:12-14a.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE DIVINE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>IN THE BIBLE BEING PROGRESSIVE Man in Creation and in the Fall</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The divine revelation in the Bible is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the very beginning, in Genesis, God created man with a good nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that there was nothing sinful or evil in the man created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When God looked at what He had created, including man, He saw that it was "very good" Gen 1:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the beginning of man's history, God put man into a pleasant garden in front of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God commanded Adam not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, telling him that in the day that he ate thereof he would die 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that God wanted man to partake of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, man fell.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The conscience was activated, and fallen man thus feared God and worshipped Him, realizing that he should do good and abandon evil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, Abel received the revelation of God's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Redemption did not come at Abel's time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, it was anticipated in God's foreknowledge, and this anticipated redemption was revealed to Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later, a little more of the divine revelation was given to Enoch and to Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Case of Job</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the time from Adam to Job, the divine revelation was somewhat ambiguous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Job was a person who feared God, who worshipped God, and who endeavored to build himself up to the uttermost in his integrity, uprightness, and perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Job tried his best to practice his integrity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, God stripped Job of everything to show him that his need was not integrity nor perfection nor the highest standard of morality; his only need was God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God seemed to be saying, "Job, I do not want you to build yourself up in your integrity or perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I want you to build yourself up with Me. You should not be a man of integrity or perfection you should be a man of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Job, you need to realize that what you lack is Me. You do not need perfection or integrity you need Me."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the time of Job, the divine revelation had not proceeded very far.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What had been revealed was mainly that man needed God, that man had been created by God and for God, and that he needed to receive God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A man should be solely, wholly, and absolutely a man of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus far, nothing had been revealed concerning God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we stop with the book of Job, we may think that it is sufficient for us to have God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, to have God is not adequate, for, as we will see, God wants a building.</S>
