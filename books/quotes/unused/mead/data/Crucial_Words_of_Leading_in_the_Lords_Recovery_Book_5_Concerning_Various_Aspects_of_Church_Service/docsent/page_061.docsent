   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TEN DEADENING FACTORS TO THE SMALL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have observed that some small groups are going on strongly, but others are not doing so well.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have studied this situation with some brothers, and we came up with ten factors that deaden a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A small group that suffers from one of these ten factors will fall into a deadened situation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, if a meeting is too long or drags on it becomes deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is a common fault among the saints who meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One saint may feel that a point has not been covered sufficiently.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Fearing that others might not be clear, he takes five minutes to strengthen the point.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then another saint feels that the point is still not complete and something needs to be added.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this way the meeting drags on, and the spirit of the meeting collapses and dies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although explanations are necessary, as long as the main points are stated, there is no need to repeatedly add explanations until the meeting cannot be rescued.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second, a meeting will be deadened if it is disorganized and without focus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every Life-study message has a subject.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to grasp the subject, speak it strongly, and then conclude with it so that every person in the meeting knows the content of the message.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should never allow small details to distract us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the saints do not know the subject, the meeting will become disorganized and without focus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Third, a meeting will be deadened by the spread of gossip and the stirring up of discord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After meeting for a while, the saints become familiar with each other, and it is easy to chat about different things that can stir up gossip and discord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The small group should be a place that supplies life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the saints begin to gossip, the small group becomes a place to spread germs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must ensure that no gossip originates from our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Otherwise, the gossip will be passed on to another person in another small group, and eventually the entire church will be contaminated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fourth, a meeting will be deadened if a person gives a message and the rest criticize.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a person continually expresses his feeling or his view, others may not interrupt him, but inwardly they will criticize him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because we have heard many messages, we have become experts in critiquing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should avoid this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In a small group it is best that no one gives a message or criticizes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Fifth, a meeting will be deadened if the meeting is inflexible and routine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we do not care whether or not the saints enjoy reading the message but instead insist on covering the message according to a schedule, we are not flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sixth, a meeting will be deadened if the meeting is full of anecdotes and reminiscences.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A person may appear to be using the Life-study, but he is actually recounting an event that occurred many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is rather easy for those who have been saved for many years to tell stories.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In principle, it is best to share a new experience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In other words, we should speak about our recent enjoyment of the Lord over the past week.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This surely will bring a fresh feeling to others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Seventh, a meeting will be deadened if the saints talk freely and express the self.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some brothers and sisters have no opportunity to speak in the big meetings and grasp the opportunity in the small group meeting to talk freely and express themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This causes others to lose interest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The saints come to the group meeting because they desire to obtain God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are not interested in other things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eighth, a meeting will be deadened if the saints make extravagant food and strive to have the best love feast.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the small groups we are enjoying the Lord s word; we are not competing for the best snacks.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eating and drinking are not the purpose of the small group.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we always strive to make better snacks, we have confused the aim with the means.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Snacks in the small groups should not be forbidden, but snacks are not our focus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ninth, a meeting will be deadened if the saints solicit business or borrow money in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should never use the small groups to solicit business or to sell merchandise.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The saints are not our customers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When such a situation arises, it must be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Tenth, a meeting will be deadened if there is no preaching of the gospel or no new ones in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a deadening factor to any small group.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The absence of new ones in a small group violates the spirit of the small group and is also against the purpose of the small group.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even if the same saints attend the meeting every week, rain or shine, that group will decline if there are no new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The small group meetings are not only for us; they are to spread the gospel and uphold the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If every small group can avoid these ten deadening factors and week by week focus on life, truth, and new ones, the small groups will surely be living and successful.</S>
