In the Old Testament there is no distinction between sin in the singular and sin in the plural. However, in the New Testament there is a difference, and this difference is very significant.</P><P>Let us list all the occurrences of the word sin (noun), in both its singular and plural forms, that are found in the New Testament. In the original language, sin is armatia.</P><P>Sin in singular form: Matt. 12:31; John 1:29; 8:34 (twice), 46; 9:41 (twice); 15:22 (twice), 24; 16:8, 9; 19:11; Acts 7:60; Rom. 3:9, 20; 4:8; 5:12 (twice), 13 (twice), 20, 21; 6:1, 2, 6 (twice), 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23; 7:7 (twice), 8 (twice), 9, 11, 13 (three times), 14, 17, 20, 23, 25; 8:2, 3 (three times), 10; 14:23; 1 Cor. 15:56 (twice); 2 Cor. 5:21 (twice); 11:7; Gal. 2:17; 3:22; 2 Thes. 2:3 (KJV); Heb. 3:13; 4:15; 9:26, 28; 10:6, 8, 18; 11:25; 12:1, 4; 13:11; James 1:15 (twice); 2:9; 4:17; 1 Pet. 2:22; 4:1; 2 Pet. 2:14; 1 John 1:7, 8; 3:4 (twice), 5, 8, 9; 5:16 (twice), 17 (twice).</P><P>Sins in plural form: Matt. 1:21; 3:6; 9:2, 5, 6; 26:28; Mark 1:4, 5; 2:5, 7, 9, 10; Luke 1:77; 3:3; 5:20, 21, 23, 24; 7:47, 48, 49; 11:4; 24:47; John 8:21 (KJV), 24 (twice); 9:34; 20:23; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31; 10:43; 13:38; 22:16; 26:18; Rom. 4:7; 7:5; 11:27; 1 Cor. 15:3, 17; Gal. 1:4; Eph. 2:1; Col. 1:14; 2:11 (KJV); 1 Thes. 2:16; 1 Tim. 5:22, 24; 2 Tim. 3:6; Heb. 1:3; 2:17; 5:1, 3; 7:27; 8:12; 9:28; 10:2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 17, 26; James 5:15, 20; 1 Pet. 2:24 (twice); 3:18; 4:8; 2 Pet. 1:9; 1 John 1:9 (twice); 2:2, 12; 3:5; 4:10; Rev. 1:5; 18:4, 5.</P><P>After reading the many Scripture verses above, we will see how wise God was in the writing of the Bible, and we will truly say to Him, "O God! We worship You!"</P><P>The difference between the uses of sin and sins is this: Whenever the Bible refers to man's outward sinful behavior, such as pride, envy, lying, and so forth, it uses the plural form-sins. The singular form, sin, in the Bible never refers to the outward sin, but it does have two different kinds of usage.</P><P>First, it refers to sin as a master and power which controls or dominates. This is the sin which is ordinarily referred to as the source or the root of sin. The phrases the source of sin or the root of sin are not scriptural, but we will borrow them for the moment. The Bible does not mention either but rather, speaks of sin reigning and lording like a master. Singular sin refers to the sin that dominates, drives, and causes us to commit sin.</P><P>Second, it refers to the whole problem of sin. Whenever the Bible speaks of God forgiving sin, it always uses the plural form, sins, because we need to be forgiven of the sins in our outward behavior. The sinful nature within us cannot be resolved by forgiveness. Saying that God forgives the singular sin is incorrect, for God forgives only the plural sins. Since the singular sin is the master, the power, it is not something that we are directly responsible for; therefore, it cannot be solved by forgiveness. The plural sins need forgiveness because these refer to our conduct, for which we need to bear responsibility and for which we deserve a punishment. Therefore, forgiveness is needed. All "confession of sin" in the Bible should be "confession of sins," the plural number and not the singular number. Sin in its singular form does not refer to man's behavior and, therefore, does not require confession. The plural sins however signify man's conduct and require confession. The death of Christ is to save us from sins. "You shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins" (Matt. 1:21). This means that the Lord Jesus saves us from the sins of our behavior. He saves us from numerous sins.</P><P>When the Lord Jesus said to the Jews, "You will die in your sins" (John 8:24), He was saying that they would die in their sins (plural) and not in sin (singular). The Bible does not say that Christ died for our sin (singular), but it always says that Christ died for our sins (plural).</P><P>"And you, though dead in your offenses and sins" (Eph. 2:1). This refers to sins (plural) not sin (singular). This means that we lived in the sins (plural), such as pride, uncleanness, envy, etc. We were dead in sins (plural) not in sin (singular).</P><P>To "take away sins" in Hebrews 10:4 refers to the taking away of sins (plural). In Hebrews 10:2, "Would have no longer had the consciousness of sins" is also sins (plural).</P><P>Why do we no longer have consciousness of sins after the Lord's blood has cleansed our conscience? Our conscience accuses us of sins (plural), specific sins, such as temper, pride, etc., before God. Since the blood of the Lord Jesus has obtained for us the forgiveness of these sins, our conscience is no longer conscious of sins. The plural sins do exist, but the blood has dealt with them. If the Lord's blood cleansed sin (singular), then sin would no longer be in our experience. For if the blood washed sin (singular), it would mean that we would never again feel the power of sin, which is the power that drives us to commit sins. This is certainly not so. The blood of the Lord Jesus has cleansed us so that our conscience is no longer conscious of our past sins. This does not mean that we no longer have sin but that our conscience is no longer conscious of sins. We are not condemned by our conscience, because we are cleansed by the blood.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 20: Questions on the Gospel &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
