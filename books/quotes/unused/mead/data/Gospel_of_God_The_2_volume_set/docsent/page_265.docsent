   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING THE CONTINUAL CLEANSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AFTER WE HAVE BELIEVED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The question now is this: What should we do if we sin again?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What should we do if we become filthy again?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the sins we committed before we were saved have been washed away by His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But what should we do about the sins that are committed after we are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not want to be chastised.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not want to lose the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not want to suffer the hurt of the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What can we do before God?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us consider 1 John 2:1: "My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A Christian's goal is not to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>John wrote these words so that we would not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the status that Christians possess, it is possible for us not to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Unfortunately, according to actual history, we often do sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Positionally speaking, we should not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But experientially speaking, we often do sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no need to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But sin is an unshakable fact.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John continues, "If anyone sins."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we are dealing with the problem of a Christian who sins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is a little one of God; he belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he sins, what should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It does not say that we have an Advocate with God; rather, it says that we have an Advocate with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, this verse refers to the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It refers to those that have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If anyone among the saved ones, the children of God, sins, he has an Advocate with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not a dispute in a law court, but a matter within a family.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word Advocate in the original language is paracletos.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Para means alongside of.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be alongside of means that you are there and another is there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are in Shanghai, and this one is also in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you go to Canton, this one also goes to Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is like railway tracks.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You cannot have one track in Szechwan and another in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Cletos means helper.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A paracletos, therefore, is someone who is alongside helping.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You can run away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But wherever you run, the paracletos will be there also.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many who help are very good, but they sometimes come too late.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There may be a lot of rice in Shanghai, but the starving ones in Szechwan will not be able to get it, because it is not alongside.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Greeks used the word paracletos to refer to a defense lawyer in court.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose that you do not understand the law, and others accuse you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Others may sue you or take advantage of you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But you do not have a way to answer them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now there is a paracletos to answer for you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Others charge that you have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But your paracletos will say that you do not have sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He will answer for you like a defense lawyer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The meaning here is to have someone next to you to speak for you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a Christian sins, there is One with the Father speaking for him.</S>
