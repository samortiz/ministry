   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FOUR INTRODUCTION 4 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:23 2:11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider 1:23 2:11.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these verses Paul gives the reasons for his delay in coming to Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>B. The Reasons for Delay 1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To Spare the Corinthians</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1:23 Paul says, But I call on God as a witness against my soul, that to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For Paul to spare the Corinthians was to forbear.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The apostle would not come to visit the Corinthian believers with a rod for discipline, but would come in love and a spirit of meekness for building 1 Cor 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to avoid any unpleasant feeling, he refrained from coming.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He treated them leniently and would not come to them in sorrow 2 Cor 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He did not like to lord it over their faith, but longed to be a fellow-worker of their joy 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He calls on God to witness this for him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>a. Calling on God as a Witness against His Soul</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to verse 23, Paul called upon God against his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The apostle called on God to be a witness against his soul, that is, against himself, if he was speaking falsely.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To call on God is not only to pray to God or ask Him to do something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To say, O God, or, O Father, is not just to pray; it is to call upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Christians today do not have a calling spirit, a strong spirit in which to call upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the circumstances or situation allowed it, I would like to call, O my Father, or, O Lord Jesus, continually.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is a difference between calling and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, someone may pray like this: Father God, You are faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You never change.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Help me to be faithful and unchanging also.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although this is a good prayer, it may not be very living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may also pray to the Lord Jesus in a manner that is not so living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may say, Lord Jesus, I thank You that You love me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lord, I also love You.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But, Lord, You know that I am weak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lord, please help me in my weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many Christians pray like this, but they may pray with little heart and with no exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They may not even understand what it means to exercise the spirit in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus said, God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Worshipping God includes praying to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since to pray is to worship, and since the Lord Jesus says that our worship of God must be in spirit, then our prayer must be in spirit also.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The words we use to express ourselves in prayer are secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The primary matter is that we exercise our spirit to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we pray, we need to call on God, exercise our spirit, and say, O Father, O my God, my Father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is to call upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God the Father is happy to hear us calling on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the Lord s word in John 4, the Father today is seeking those who worship Him in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I do not know of a better way to exercise the spirit than to call upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not necessary to call aloud.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Often it is not convenient or suitable to call aloud.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, others may be working or sleeping, and your calling in a loud way would disturb them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even by calling in a very quiet way, our spirit is exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul wrote all his Epistles in a careful manner and with much consideration regarding the use of words.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 1:23 he did not say, I ask God ; neither did he say, I pray to God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Instead, Paul said, I call on God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This calling upon God implies the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul was a person who lived in spirit and who worshipped God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we do not live in spirit, it certainly will be difficult for us to worship God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In verse 23 Paul called upon God as a witness against his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that he called upon God to witness for him in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here Paul seems to be saying, Brothers in Corinth, I did not behave in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If I had done this, God would witness against me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I am not a person living in the soul and behaving in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I did not resolve in the soul to come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If this had been my situation, God would be a witness against me.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is interesting that Paul did not say, I call on God as a witness for my spirit to testify that I resolve in my spirit to come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the contrary, he called on God to witness in a negative way against his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He called upon Him to testify that he did not resolve anything in the soul, that is, in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God would witness against such a resolving in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This kind of negative witness is sometimes stronger than a testimony from the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The reason Paul did not come to Corinth was that he wanted to spare the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It was not because he was fickle and was saying yes and no at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Paul did not want to come to Corinth with a rod to discipline them; rather, he wanted to spare them and come to them in love.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He called upon God to witness of this concerning him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Paul is a good example for us to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>By the Lord s mercy, we all need to learn of him and follow him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Paul was a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He was spiritual, he was constituted of Christ, he was experienced, and he was mature in the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As such a person, he wanted to spare the Corinthians and for this reason had not yet come to Corinth.</S>
