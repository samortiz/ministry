   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Relationship between the Church and Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We also need to see the relationship between the church and life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, the church has been regenerated by God and possesses the regenerated life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is of life because every member of the church has been regenerated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was young, at least two books told me that regeneration is simply a renewal, that "everything in the past died yesterday, and everything henceforth is born today."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I could not accept this saying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1954, I came across a book by Brother T. Austin-Sparks, in which he said that regeneration is to have God's life in addition to our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That was the day I became truly clear about what regeneration is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Regeneration is to receive another life, God's zoe life, in addition to man's psuche life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not have Christ as God's life, we do not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, 1 John 5:12 says, "He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since the Son of God is this zoe life John 11:25; 14:6; Col 3:4 , once we have the zoe life, we are regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Being born from our mother's womb was our first birth for us to receive the psuche life, which is the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That was our regeneration for us to receive the zoe life, which is the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, the church is out of the zoe life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, the church grows in life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The matter of growth is mentioned many times in the New Testament, such as arriving at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Eph 4:13 , the growth of the Body v. 16 , and growing with the growth of God Col 2:19 . All these refer to the growth of the zoe life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the life of God grows in us, we grow in this life unto maturity and arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Third, the church is transformed in life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When life grows, there is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a flower blossoms, that is its transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Initially, flower seeds are not pretty, but the more they grow, the better they look and the more they are transformed to be beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Children grow and change daily so that they become bigger and more mature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To become grown-up is to be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the zoe life, we do not grow worse or change for the worse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, we grow stronger and become newer, even rejuvenated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we are born of life, grow in life, and are transformed in life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Fourth, the church is built in life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without the zoe life, there is no building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The natural human life, being divisive and individualistic, does not care for building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the zoe life likes the building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only the zoe life can cause us to be built together.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, the church is unique in the universe, though it also appears in localities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although there is one church in each locality, there is still only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the contents of the church are Christ, the Spirit, and life, and the appearance of the church is one church in one locality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we truly love the Lord, we must grow in life, live by the Spirit, and live in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually, we are manifested as the church in every locality to be the expression of the Triune God as the shining golden lampstands, the ultimate consummation of which is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the above items comprise the church.</S>
