	 <h2 class="head3">God&rsquo;s Eternal Plan Being for Christ</h2>
<p>Moreover, God&rsquo;s plan for the church is altogether for His Son (Col. 1:16; John 3:35; Heb. 1:2). God not only intends that His Son accomplish this plan, but He also desires that His Son inherit this plan. Whatever His plan accomplishes is for His Son. The church is the Body of Christ, and this Body is for Christ. God desires that Christ would have a Body.</p>
<p>In typology, God is typified by Abraham, His Son is typified by Isaac, and the church is typified by Rebekah. All of Abraham&rsquo;s plans were for his son Isaac. In the same way, God&rsquo;s entire plan, God&rsquo;s arrangement, is for Christ. Hence, this plan was made in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Everything Being Christ</h2>
<p>Third, everything is Christ. The expression <em>in Christ</em> does not imply only that Christ is the One who accomplishes and inherits God&rsquo;s plan but also that everything in this plan is Christ. When the kingdom comes, we will be able to see Christ in many things and matters in the kingdom. In the new heaven and new earth there will be nothing that is not Christ. Christ will not merely be expressed; He will be everything. Even today, whenever we fellowship with a saint who is deep in the Lord, we sense that he has Christ in him and that coming to him is the same as coming to Christ.</p>
<p>A day will come when all things will be Christ. No matter what we touch, we will sense Christ. In that day all things will be headed up. Today people in the world have no way to be united, because they lack Christ. Things are not in harmony, because they lack Christ. We must wait for the day when God has worked Christ into all things and when all things are Christ; only then will all things be in harmony.</p>
<p>Today people in Christianity speak of oneness, but they are not one. Even if there is some oneness among them, it is merely outward. Genuine oneness is in Christ because oneness is simply Christ Himself. When we are in ourselves, we are not one and can never be one. However, when we live in Christ and when we give Christ the way and the ground in us through the cross, the result is oneness among us. This oneness is simply Christ. Hence, God&rsquo;s plan in Christ has a deep significance; that is, God intends to work Christ into all things.</p>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;Since God Himself is the resource, His power is the energy, and His wisdom is the means, in God&rsquo;s economy where is God?&rdquo; Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; First Corinthians 1:24 tells us that Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. In the economy of God&rsquo;s eternal plan God Himself is the resource, God&rsquo;s power is the energy, and God&rsquo;s wisdom is the means; moreover, Christ is God Himself, God&rsquo;s power, and God&rsquo;s wisdom. Hence, after God made this plan, He appointed His Son to be the anointed One, the Christ. His Son is the Christ, the One who accomplishes His plan, inherits His plan, and is everything in His plan. Thus, everything in this plan is full of Christ and wholly Christ. Every item and even every moment are Christ Himself.</p>
