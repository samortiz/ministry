   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. Three Measures Being a Convenient Unit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why does the Bible say three measures here?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The number three is frequently used in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Abraham took three measures of meal and made bread for the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It seems that three measures can be easily held in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a common measure, a common unit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is like measuring flour or rice by packets or sacks.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the ancient days the most convenient unit was three measures.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Confusing the Word of God</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The problem is that the woman has sown confusion into the food of God's people!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She has destroyed their food!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>She has brought all sorts of heresies into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By introducing the heresies into the church, Catholicism has confused the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This work of the Roman Catholic Church results in the world creeping into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The woman now assumes great authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She has taken control of worldly affairs as well as spiritual affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She has not only established a large church on earth, but has even extended her dominion over the nations of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, the church has taken over political power as well as religious power.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It has indeed become a big tree.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the same time, it has truly mingled leaven with the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Whole Being Leavened</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word of the Lord here is quite serious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The second part of Matthew 13:33 says, "Until the whole was leavened."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Please bear in mind that today, the lump of meal is not yet fully leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All orthodox students of prophecy agree that the power of Roman Catholicism has not diminished.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord says that this will go on until the whole is leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today, Roman Catholicism has been leavened to quite a serious extent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It has been leavening for over a thousand years!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But we cannot say that the lump is fully leavened yet.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord says that one day the whole will be leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The power of Catholicism will continue to expand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It will not stop until its end comes, when it is fully consumed by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word of the Lord is quite serious here: "Until the whole was leavened."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here the Lord tells us that the power of Roman Catholicism will continue to expand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How great has the Roman Catholic Church become!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How numerous are the heresies found in it!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The leaven has gained more and more ground.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord's supper has become the Mass, and the bread has become the flesh of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Transubstantiation, the doctrine of turning the bread into the actual flesh of Christ as soon as one touches it, has prevailed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are incense, crucifixes, and rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>People put their trust in various organizations and names.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Catholic Church is more tightly controlled than any country or state in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are all kinds of organizations within it, and one could not understand all of them even if he spent several years to study them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the one hand, it has confused the doctrine of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the other hand, the tree has become very large.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Pope Becoming the Universal Overseer</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here I will quote some words from some of the popes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The popes call themselves universal overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Originally, an overseer was an elder of a local church, and the elders of the local churches were called overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Eventually, one of the overseers became a bishop and ruled over other elders of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Still later, the bishops began to take control over other churches, and then eventually, over the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, the pope called himself the universal overseer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One of the popes said, "I, the Pope, am the king of kings, and my laws precede all laws."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This was the written declaration of a pope concerning his papal authority.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Does this declaration sound like something that should come out of the mouth of one who follows the lowly Jesus of Nazareth?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Not at all.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Infallibility of the Pope</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the Vatican Conference in 1870, a decree read, "The Pope of Rome cannot change or improve on his own words."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Imagine how great the authority of Roman Catholicism has become!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Anything can be improved upon except the words of the pope of Rome!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>His words are the supreme command and cannot be improved upon.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What kind of spirit is behind these words?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Clearly, man's authority has usurped God's authority!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The above statement applies to all proclamations by any pope.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We can find numerous claims similar to this one.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One pope in Rome published a message called "The Scheme."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At first, Roman Catholicism believed that only the church was infallible.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But this message extended this claim by telling everyone that not only was the church infallible, but the pope was infallible as well.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The pope could not be wrong in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Chinese expression bu-neng-tzo-wu for infallible may not sound that strong in Chinese, but in Greek, Latin, and English infallible is a very strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Only God is infallible, but Catholics say that the pope is infallible as well.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is heresy and leaven.</S>
