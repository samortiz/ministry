   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JOSHUA MESSAGE TWELVE THE ALLOTMENT OF THE LAND 2 Scripture Reading: Josh 18 22</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many spiritual items concerning Christ and the church are revealed in the New Testament in principle but not in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is especially true in the matter of gaining Christ, experiencing Christ, and enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the book of Ephesians Christ is revealed as being all-inclusive because He is the One who fills all in all Eph 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is not only all-inclusive but also all-extensive because His love is immeasurable in its breadth, length, height, and depth 3:18-19a .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ s love is just Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If His love is immeasurable, He is immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Ephesians 3:8 Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His riches are so plentiful and vast that they are untraceable.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although Ephesians reveals a Christ who is all-inclusive, all-extensive, and unsearchably rich, in this book we cannot find the detailed ways to gain this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The detailed ways to gain Christ, experience Christ, and enjoy Christ are not in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, Joshua 13 22 provides the detailed way to possess and enjoy the land, which is a type of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The good land was spacious, stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Euphrates, but the children of Israel did not possess all the land.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even with what they possessed, they still needed a detailed way to allot the land in order to gain and enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The way was by casting lots.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the book of Joshua the word lot is used in the sense of casting lots 18:8,10 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Humanly speaking, we know that casting lots depends on fortune, but God is our fortune, and the outcome of the casting of lots was according to what He had ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When God created the earth, He had a clear view concerning the situation of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was clear, for instance, that Jerusalem and the surrounding district were for Judah, out of whom Christ would come.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was foreordained, but it still had to be realized by casting lots.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s ordaining hand was present in the casting of lots to direct the result.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that the division of the land did not depend upon Joshua, upon the high priest, or upon anyone other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a result, there was no ground for the tribes to complain about the portion of the land allotted to them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way of allotting the land was fair, and it caused everyone to be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At this juncture, I would like to emphasize the fact that Christ in Himself is uniquely one and always the same.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As to Himself there is no change; He is the same yesterday, today, and forever Heb 13:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, in our experience and enjoyment Christ is of many sizes and types, as indicated by the different kinds of burnt offerings and meal offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What Christ is to us in our experience does not depend upon Him it depends upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We gain Christ, experience Christ, and enjoy Christ according to what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, someone who is diligent in pursuing Christ will experience a larger Christ than someone who is lazy in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Recently I have been considering that we may regard the twelve tribes of Israel as a picture of the believers from the first century until today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Galatians 6:16 says that we are the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that among God s New Testament elect there should be twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first tribe was the early apostles, who brought in the New Testament revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The second tribe was the church fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The third tribe was the martyrs in the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fourth tribe was the reformers in the Roman Church, before the papal system was established.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The fifth tribe was the Protestants, and the sixth was the mystics.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Protestants became shallow and dead, so there was a reaction from the mystics, including Madame Guyon, Father Fenelon, and Brother Lawrence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The seventh tribe was the Moravian brothers under Count Zinzendorf.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The eighth tribe was the British Brethren under John Nelson Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Brethren became full of dead knowledge, there was a three-way reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First, there was a reaction from the inner life Christians, including Andrew Murray, Jessie Penn-Lewis, and T. Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was the ninth tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second, there was a reaction from evangelical Christians, including C. H. Spurgeon, D. L. Moody, Charles Finney, Hudson Taylor, William Carey, and David Livingstone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was the tenth tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Third, there was a reaction from Pentecostal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This was the eleventh tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The twelfth tribe is the recovery, which has recovered the New Testament revelation back to the early apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the recovery the truths from Matthew to Revelation have been recovered by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In particular, the Lord has recovered the truths concerning the all-inclusive Christ and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The truth in the recovery is the consummate truth of the past nineteen centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are standing on the shoulders of all the tribes that have gone before us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, the truth has been extracted, condensed, and crystallized for us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let us now consider from chapters eighteen through twenty-two more of the details concerning the allotment of the land.</S>
