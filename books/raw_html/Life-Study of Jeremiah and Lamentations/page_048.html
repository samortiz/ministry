<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ISRAEL'S SIN AGAINST JEHOVAH<br>AND<br>JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT UPON ISRAEL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ISRAEL'S HYPOCRITICAL WORSHIP TO JEHOVAH</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Jer. 7&#151;10</H1><P>In this message on Israel's sin against Jehovah and Jehovah's punishment upon Israel, we will begin to consider Israel's hypocritical worship to Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. ISRAEL'S (ACTUALLY JUDAH'S) HYPOCRITICAL<br>WORSHIP TO JEHOVAH THEIR GOD</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Worship of Superstition</H2><P>Israel's (actually Judah's&#151;7:21; 9:26) hypocritical worship to Jehovah their God was a false worship and was a worship of superstition.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Trusting in the Words of Falsehood<br>concerning the Temple of Jehovah</H2><P>In their superstitious worship, Israel trusted in the words of falsehood that said, "The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, these buildings are the temple of Jehovah" (7:4). To them even the temple had become an idol and something of superstition. Thus, Jeremiah told them not to say these words regarding the temple of Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Doing Many Wicked Things<br>and Then Coming and Standing before Jehovah<br>and Saying That They Would Be Delivered</H2><P>On the one hand, the people of Israel worshipped God; on the other hand, they were given to stealing, murdering, committing adultery, swearing falsely, burning incense to Baal, and going after other gods. After doing such things, they would come and stand before Jehovah in the house which is called by His name and say, "We are delivered!" (vv. 9-10). By saying this they were deceiving themselves and cheating themselves.</P>
