<h2 class="head1">II. OF ABIJAH</h2>
<p>Second Chronicles 13:1-21 gives us an account of the reign of Abijah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Defeating Jeroboam the King of Israel</h2>
<p>Abijah defeated Jeroboam the king of Israel (vv. 2b-20). In this matter Abijah was quite good.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Proclaiming the Apostasy of Jeroboam</h2>
<p>Abijah proclaimed to Jeroboam and all Israel the apostasy of Jeroboam. Abijah and Judah took the fundamental standing, and Abijah advised Jeroboam not to fight against them with whom Jehovah stood (vv. 4-12). Here we see that Abijah stood on the fundamental ground to make a proclamation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jeroboam and the Children<br />
of Israel Being Defeated</h2>
<p>Jeroboam and the children of Israel were defeated by Abijah and the children of Judah, and Jehovah struck Jeroboam to death (vv. 13-20). This indicates that Jehovah stood with Abijah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Indulging in Sexual Lust</h2>
<p>Abijah also indulged in sexual lust by marrying fourteen wives and begetting twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters (v. 21).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. OF ASA</h2>
<p>In 14:6&mdash;15:15 we have an account of the reign of Asa.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Asa Building Fortress Cities in Judah</h2>
<p>Asa built fortress cities in Judah, for the land was quiet and there was no war against him during those years, because Jehovah had given him rest (14:6-8). Asa was good, and God was pleased with him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Asa Defeating the Cushites</h2>
<p>Asa defeated the Cushites by calling out to God and trusting in Him (vv. 9-15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Asa&rsquo;s Further Reforms</h2>
<p>Asa carried out some further reforms (15:1-15). These reforms were in addition to those mentioned in 14:3-5 and 15:16, 18.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Through the Advice and Encouragement<br />
of the Prophet Azariah</h2>
<p>Asa&rsquo;s further reforms were accomplished through the advice and encouragement of the prophet Azariah the son of Oded (15:1-7).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Putting Away the Abominations<br />
from All the Land of Judah and Benjamin</h2>
<p>Asa put away the abominations (the idols) from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities that he had taken in the hill country of Ephraim and restored the altar of Jehovah (v. 8). The people had fallen to such an extent that they had given up the altar of God and had built altars for the worship of idols. But Asa dealt with that situation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Gathering All Judah and Benjamin<br />
and All the Sojourners with Them<br />
from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon</h2>
<p>Asa gathered all Judah and Benjamin and all the sojourners with them from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon (for many from Israel threw in their lot with him when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him), and they sacrificed to Jehovah from the spoil. They also entered into a covenant to pursue Jehovah and covenanted that anyone who did not pursue Jehovah would be put to death. Thus Jehovah gave them rest all around (vv. 9-15).</p>
<p>Although Asa was a good king, in chapter sixteen he did some things that were wrong. When Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, Asa formed an alliance with Ben-hadad king of Syria (16:1-6). Hanani the seer came to Asa and rebuked him for trusting in the king of Syria and not trusting in Jehovah (vv. 7-9). Asa became angry with the seer and put him in prison. At that time Asa also oppressed some of the people (v. 10). In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became severely diseased in his feet, &ldquo;yet even in his disease he pursued not Jehovah but the physicians&rdquo; (v. 12). Eventually, Asa died in the forty-first year of his reign (vv. 13-14).</p>
