[1]  First Corinthians is a book full of the riches of Christ.
[2]  In 1 Corinthians 1:2 Paul says, To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours.
[3]  Christ is the element and sphere that separated us, made us holy, unto God when we believed into Him, that is, when we were brought into an organic union with Him through our faith in Him.
[4]  In 1 Corinthians 1:2 Paul equates, by the use of an appositive, those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus with called saints.
[5]  In this verse the Greek words hagiazo translated sanctified and hagios translated saints are of the same root, which fundamentally means separated, set apart.
[6]  The saints are the separated ones, the ones set apart to God, and sanctification to God is the practical effect, the character in activity, and the consummate state produced by being sanctified.
[7]  In verse 2 immediately after revealing Christ as the Sanctifier, Paul unveils that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Sanctifier, is our portion: Those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours.
[8]  Verse 9 says, God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
[9]  To be called into the fellowship of God s Son is to partake of the fellowship of the union with God s Son, Jesus Christ, and to participate in Him.
[10]  The phrase into the fellowship of His Son, like the word in verse 2 concerning Christ s being theirs and ours, stresses again the crucial fact that Christ is the unique center of the believers for the solving of the problems among them, especially the problem of division.
[11]  He is the Lord of glory 2:8 for our glorification v. 7; Rom 8:30 . He is the depths deep things of God 1 Cor 2:10 . He is the unique foundation of God s building 3:11 . He is our Passover 5:7 , the unleavened bread v. 8 , the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, and the spiritual rock 10:3-4 . He is the Head 11:3 and the Body 12:12 . He is the firstfruits 15:20, 23 , the second man v. 47 , and the last Adam v. 45 ; as such, He became the life-giving Spirit v. 45 that we may receive Him into us as our everything.
[12]  In the previous message we saw that according to 1 Corinthians 1:9, God has called the believers into the fellowship of His Son, that is, into the participation in Him, and that to be called into the fellowship of Christ means to be called into the co-enjoyment of Christ as our unique portion.
[13]  Before mentioning Christ as the power of God and the wisdom of God in verse 24, Paul in the previous verse declares, We preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness v. 23 . This indicates that the Christ who is the power of God and the wisdom of God for the carrying out of God s economy is the crucified Christ, a Christ who did not do anything to save Himself.
[14]  First Corinthians 1:24 says, To those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
[15]  Here those who are called refers to the believers who were chosen by God in eternity Eph 1:4 and who believed in Christ in time Acts 13:48 .
[16]  To these called ones, the crucified Christ preached by the apostles is the power of God and the wisdom of God.
[17]  Christ became wisdom to us from God as three vital things in God s salvation: 1 righteousness for our past , by which we have been justified by God, that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life Rom 5:18 ; 2 sanctification for our present , by which we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will, with His divine life 6:19, 22 ; and 3 redemption for our future , that is, the redemption of our body 8:23 , by which we will be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His glorious likeness Phil 3:21 .
[18]  In the past we were unrighteous, always doing things unrighteously.
[19]  Now Christ is transmitted into us as our righteousness to take care of our past in order that in Him we would be accepted by God.
[20]  Christ as righteousness saved us in that when we believed in Christ and were justified in Him, we were regenerated in our spirit.
[21]  Christ as sanctification is now transforming our soul, thereby making us holy, yet our body still remains unsaved.
[22]  This is because God has put us into Christ, transferring us from Adam into Christ 2 Cor 5:17 through Christ s crucifixion and resurrection Gal 2:20 and by our believing and being baptized John 3:15; Gal 3:26-28 .
[23]  Christ as the content of the apostle s ministry is an aspect of the enjoyment of Christ as our portion.
[24]  In contrast to many so-called ministries today that scarcely know the mystery of God, the apostle s ministry was the New Testament ministry, a ministry that ministers the mystery of God concerning Christ and the crucified Jesus Christ.
[25]  In the eyes of human beings, the crucifixion of Christ is foolishness, but in God s eternal economy, it is something powerful, carried out in order to fulfill God s mystery, His eternal purpose Eph 3:9-11 .
[26]  What the apostle testified was the mystery of God, which is Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the expression of Christ Rom 16:25-26; Col 1:26-27; 2:2; 4:3; Eph 3:4-6, 9 .
[27]  Christ as the depths of God is also the things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man s heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him 1 Cor 2:9 .
[28]  To love God means to set our entire being spirit, soul, and body, with the heart, soul, mind, and strength Mark 12:30 absolutely on Him, that is, to let our entire being be occupied by Him and lost in Him, so that He becomes everything to us and we are one with Him practically in our daily life.
[29]  God has predestined Christ for us, He has prepared Him for us, He has revealed Him to us, and He has given Him to us as the deep things of God, the depths of God.
[30]  In 1 Corinthians 3:21b-23 Paul presents Christ as the center of God and all things: All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all are yours, but you are Christ s, and Christ is God s. The believers are the church, and all things are for the church.
[31]  Furthermore, the church is for Christ, and Christ is for God.
[32]  In other words, all things are ours for the church, the church is for Christ to be His Body, and Christ is for God to be His expression.
[33]  The all-inclusive Christ is God s center, God s centrality and universality, in the church as His fullness for His expression.
[34]  Third, the expression Christ is God s means that Christ belongs to God.
[35]  Here we see that God is the Head in the universe 1 Chron 29:11 , and Christ is the center of all things in the universe, and we ourselves, who belong to Christ as His members, are part of this center.
[36]  Through death and resurrection He was enlarged from the individual Christ to the corporate Christ Christ as the Head with the believers in Christ as the members of His Body John 12:24; Rom 8:29; 1 Cor 12:12 .
[37]  The Washer and the Spirit a. In His Name and in the Spirit of Our God
[38]  In 1 Corinthians 6:11 Christ is presented as the Washer and the Spirit: But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.
[39]  Moreover, by speaking of in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God, Paul indicates that we need to link the name of the Lord with the Spirit of our God.
[40]  In 1 Corinthians 7:22-23 Christ is revealed as the Master of the believers: The slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lord s freedman; likewise the free man who has been called is Christ s slave.
[41]  In keeping with this, Paul in Ephesians 6:5-7 says, Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ; not with eye-service as men-pleasers but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul; with good will serving as slaves, as serving the Lord and not men.
[42]  In 1 Corinthians 10:4 Paul goes on to say, All drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.
[43]  The spiritual drink in verse 4 refers to the living water that flowed out of the cleft rock Exo 17:6 , typifying the Spirit, who flowed out of the crucified and resurrected Christ, as our all-inclusive drink John 7:37-39; 1 Cor 12:13 .
[44]  In His crucifixion Christ, as the living, spiritual rock, was smitten by the authority of God s law in order that the water of life in resurrection could flow out of Him into His redeemed people for them to drink.
[45]  In 1 Corinthians 10:16-17 and 21 Christ is unveiled as the contents of the Lord s table.
[46]  This indicates that our partaking of Christ, our enjoying of Christ, identifies us with Him, making us one with Him.
[47]  On the other hand, the bread signifies the Lord s mystical Body constituted of many members regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, having been enlivened with the Triune God s life and brought into an organic union with the Triune God.
[48]  In 1 Corinthians 11:3 Christ is presented as the Head of every man, who brings man under God s headship and sets up the order between man and woman: Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.
[49]  First Corinthians 11:23-26 indicates that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the object of the believers remembrance.
[50]  The Lord s body being broken to be given as bread to us means that He gave His body for us that we may have His life; that is, through the breaking of His body on the cross, Christ released the life of God from within Him to impart it into us 12:24; 19:34 .
[51]  Christ is the object of the believers remembrance for them to eat and drink, declaring His death until He comes.
[52]  The bread and the cup are the elements of the Lord s supper, a feast, set up by Him so that we, His believers, may remember Him by enjoying Him as such a feast.
[53]  First Corinthians 15:10 unveils that for our experience and enjoyment, Christ is the grace of God.
[54]  Paul says in 1:4, I thank my God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus.
[55]  When we put together these three aspects of Christ, we see that Christ is the first, the second, and the last; as such, Christ is everything.
[56]  In the Bible there is a principle that the second always replaces the first Gen 17:18-19; 25:23; 48:18-19; 1 Sam 16:1; 2 Sam 12:14, 24-25; Rom 9:12-13 .
[57]  This principle is indicated by 1 Corinthians 15:46: The spiritual is not first but the soulish, then the spiritual.
[58]  The spiritual here denotes Christ the second man; the soulish denotes Adam, the first man v. 47 . According to human understanding, tradition, and practice, we should follow the one who is first, not the one who is second.
[59]  First Corinthians 15:24-25 reveals that for our experience and enjoyment, Christ is the coming King.
[60]  In this message we will begin to consider aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ as revealed in 2 Corinthians.
[61]  The apostles, who preached Christ according to God s promises and lived Christ according to their preaching, and the believers, who received Christ according to the apostles preaching, are joined to Christ, becoming one with Him, through whom they say Amen before God to the great Yes of God s promises, which is Christ Himself.
[62]  Christ, the anointed One, is full of ointment, full of anointing.
[63]  He is the Son of God whom God has anointed above all His partners, His companions Heb 1:9 .
[64]  Since we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are spontaneously anointed with Him by God.
[65]  God s attaching us to Christ issues in three things: 1 an anointing that imparts God s elements into us; 2 a sealing that forms the divine elements into an impression to express God s image; and 3 a pledging that gives us a foretaste as a sample and guarantee of the full taste of God.
[66]  The Lord Christ of v. 16 is the Spirit who pervades and animates the new covenant of which we are ministers v. 6 , and the ministration of which is with glory v. 8 . Compare Rom 8:9-11; John 14:16, 18 Vincent . The Lord of verse 16, is the Spirit...which giveth life, v. 6: meaning, the Lord, as here spoken of, Christ, is the Spirit, is identical with the Holy Spirit...Christ, here, is the Spirit of Christ Alford . All that transforming and indwelling Spirit is Christ Himself.
[67]  In 2 Corinthians 3:17 Paul tells us that where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
[68]  Second Corinthians 3:18 says, We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
[69]  Again, this expression strongly proves and confirms that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord Christ.
[70]  In 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul also tells us that we are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.
[71]  This means that we are being transformed from one degree of glory to another degree.
[72]  Second Corinthians 4:4-7 shows that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the image of God and the treasure.
[73]  The image of God refers to Christ as our outward expression, whereas the treasure refers to Christ as our inward content.
[74]  We should bear Christ as the image of God without, and we should have Christ as the treasure within.
[75]  Second Corinthians 4:4, speaking of the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, refers to four matters: illumination, gospel, glory, and Christ.
[76]  Verse 6 goes on to say, The God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[77]  This illumination, the enlightenment, that makes the glory of Christ s gospel known to us, issues from the shining of God in our hearts.
[78]  The glory of God manifested in the face of Jesus Christ is the God of glory expressed through Jesus Christ, who is the effulgence of the glory of God Heb 1:3 ; to know Him is to know the God of glory.
[79]  When we experience the glory of God shining in the face of Jesus Christ, this shining brings into us Christ as the image of God.
[80]  According to the context of chapter 4, the new creation in 5:17 is composed of those who have Christ as the treasure within and bear Christ as the image of God without.
[81]  2 To Live Not to Ourselves but to Him
[82]  In 2 Corinthians 5:14-15 the apostle Paul puts together Christ s constraining love with our living to Him, indicating that because we love Christ, we live to Him, not to ourselves.
[83]  It is quite meaningful that in verse 15 Paul does not say, No longer live for themselves but for Him ; rather, he says, No longer live to themselves but to Him.
[84]  Second Corinthians 5:18-21 reveals the complete reconciliation of the believers to God, and Christ as the means of this reconciliation.
[85]  This portion of the word shows three classes of people: the apostles who have been fully reconciled to God, sinners, and believers who have not been fully reconciled to God.
[86]  In 2 Corinthians 5:20 Paul goes on to say, On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God.
[87]  This indicates that eventually those who have been brought back to God in the Holy of Holies will enjoy Christ to the uttermost and even become the righteousness of God in Him.
[88]  In the organic union with Christ, those who have been reconciled to God in the second step become the very righteousness of God.
[89]  As we have pointed out, Christ not only died for our sins that we might be forgiven of our sins; He also was made sin for us that we might become the righteousness of God in Christ.
[90]  Through Christ s redemption, man, who is a sinner and is even sin, is made God s righteousness, being reconciled to the righteous God, and is made a new creation living to God for His eternal purpose.
[91]  OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST
[92]  You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, for your sakes He became poor in order that you, because of His poverty, might become rich.
[93]  In 2 Corinthians 10:1 Paul says that he entreats the Corinthian believers through the meekness and gentleness of Christ.
[94]  Because Paul lived Christ, the virtues of Christ became his.
[95]  The phrase through the meekness and gentleness of Christ indicates that Paul was one with Christ and that he took Christ as his life.
[96]  Therefore, he entreated the believers not by himself but through the virtues of Christ, particularly through Christ s meekness and forbearance.
[97]  Paul entreated others by Christ, in Christ, and with Christ.
[98]  In 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul says, I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.
[99]  Here we see that Christ is the believers one Husband, the unique Husband, for us to love.
[100]  In fact, to preach the gospel to others, to bring them to Christ, and to baptize them into the name of the Triune God are to present them as a pure virgin to Christ and to marry them to the Triune God embodied in Christ.
[101]  Christ is not only the factor of grace but also the embodiment of grace; that is, Christ is grace itself.
[102]  A man in Christ a person who always lives in Christ and is found in Christ refers to the apostle v. 7 , not as the old creation but as the new creation 5:17 . Paul then tells us that because of the transcendence of the revelations that he received, he could not avoid being proud; hence, the Lord gave him a thorn, a messenger of Satan, to keep him from being exceedingly lifted up.
[103]  In 2 Corinthians 13:3-5 Christ is unveiled as the powerful One in the believers.
[104]  Christ is not weak in us; He is powerful.
[105]  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ means that Christ is grace and that grace is Christ.
[106]  Likewise, the love of God means that God is love and that love is God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit means that the Holy Spirit is the fellowship and that the fellowship is the Holy Spirit.
[107]  The grace of Christ comes out of the love of God, but this grace comes into us, is conveyed to us, and is transmitted into us through the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
[108]  Therefore, in order to enjoy the grace of the Lord we must be in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, and as we are enjoying the grace of the Lord, we taste the love of God.
[109]  Today if we desire to enjoy the grace of Christ, we must be in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, and as we are enjoying the grace of Christ, we will spontaneously taste the love of God.
[110]  The love of God is the source, since God is the origin; the grace of the Lord is the course of the love of God, since the Lord is the expression of God; and the fellowship of the Spirit is the impartation of the grace of the Lord with the love of God, since the Spirit is the transmission of the Lord with God for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, with Their divine virtues.
