   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The glory of the light and the lamp are not side by side.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lamb is the One who redeemed us, the One who has accomplished full redemption to fulfill God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the throne of God and of the Lamb indicates that this throne is for the carrying out of God's plan through Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both God's plan and Christ's redemption are being carried out through this throne.</S>
