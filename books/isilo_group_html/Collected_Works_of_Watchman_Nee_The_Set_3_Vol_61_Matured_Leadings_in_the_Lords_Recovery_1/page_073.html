Otherwise, they will face difficulties when they try to serve the Lord or consecrate their assets to Him. Never hold on to joint assets or joint shares for too long.</p><h2 class="head2">Making Suitable Arrangements Immediately<br />after Handing Something Over</h2><p>After one hands something over, he has to select a few experienced and respected brothers with spiritual wisdom and discernment to make suitable arrangements for him. We want every penny that the brothers and sisters have handed over to be put to proper and good use.</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD TO HOUSEWIVES</h2><h2 class="head2">Doing the Best to Hand Everything Over<br />while Acting on the Ground of Righteousness</h2><p>Housewives must not offer up their husband's belongings. Neither should they offer up what belongs to their children. They should not be criticized for acting unrighteously. We have to know that God is the master of all things. He does not need anyone to steal or rob. We can only offer up everything that we have a right to dispose of. Before we offer up anything, we have to ask, "Do I own this? Will I cause a problem in my family by offering this?" God does not want us to steal; neither does He want us to rob. Unless our husbands and children are being unreasonable, we should not violate their rights.</p><p>Not many people in this world have consecrated themselves, and not many riches have been consecrated. This is the reason every consecrated person is precious and treasured by God. Not only is such a one precious; even his children are precious, and every hoof that he owns is precious. The money he consecrates to God is precious. When the Israelites left Egypt, God told them to not go empty-handed, but to take all their belongings with them. They did not leave one hoof behind (Exo. 10:26). A believer should learn to preserve his wealth so that he can offer it to God. God treasures the children of the believers, and He treasures every hoof that belongs to the believers. On the one hand, we should not take anything that does not belong to us, even if it is but a thread or a shoelace. On the other hand, as much as possible we should offer God everything that belongs to us.</p><p>Whatever we do, we have to stand firm on our ground. Brother Witness said that in the denominations, the number of men falls short of the money offered, but with us the money does not match the number of men. We have the people, but not the money. We do not want there to be any unnecessary disputes in the family because of our consecration. We do not want the Lord's name to be shamed. We should only consecrate by acting on the ground of righteousness.</p><h2 class="head2">Jewelry Should Be Sold as Quickly as Possible</h2><p>Concerning the jewelry offered up by sisters, we have to pay special attention to the teaching in Peter's Epistles. He said that it is always wrong for Christian women to have any kind of adornments (1 Pet. 3:3-5). Both male and female alike in the world consider gold more attractive than brass, and pearls and gems more precious than plastic goods in the streets. In the past some of us collected jewelry ourselves, or it was given to us by husbands or relatives. Now we have to sell all the items that are under our disposal. We spent time and money to acquire these objects. Now we have to spend time and effort to dispose of them. In particular, we should deal with our most cherished objects by disposing of them personally. We do not want another sister to buy them. Objects that have been consecrated to God should be sold to unbelievers, not to other Christians. We should be lenient and not criticize others, but we should be strict with ourselves. These things are dragging us down; they are sinking us. How can we place them on other sisters and burden them?</p><p>The money that we have offered up can be used to print gospel tracts or can be given away to needy saints or the poor. If we do not know how to give it away, the church can prescribe certain instructions on a slip of paper and you can send the money accordingly. It is all right to ask others to forward money for you, but the church will not do this for you. This makes it clear where your money has gone. All jewelry should be disposed of as soon as possible.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_072.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_074.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 73</div><br></body></html>
