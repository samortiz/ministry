   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation THE DIVINE ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE DIVINE DISPENSING MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT IN THE CONSUMMATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE FULL ACCOMPLISHMENT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF GOD'S REDEMPTION AND SALVATION IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AS FULLY SHOWN IN THE NEW JERUSALEM Scripture Reading: Rev 21:1 --22:5; 1 Cor 3:9b; 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Prayer: Lord, we worship You that You have brought us through so many days.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today You have brought us to the end, to the consummation, of the central line of God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, do cleanse us with Your precious blood, and cover us with Your prevailing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We trust in You for this last meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Give us a good ending.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You are the Alpha, and You are the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We trust in You as our ending.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, do cover us that we may be really protected in this hour, listening to Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not want to merely hear Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We also want to see something.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We want to enter into the intrinsic revelation of Your Body, the church, which will be consummated in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We want to feel the same way that You do, according to Your feeling, and we want to understand the same way that You do, according to Your understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lord, we are the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are Your counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lord, unveil everything that is on Your heart tonight in this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Help us in the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lord, we realize we are so weak in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Stand with us as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this message we have come to the end of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Any good writing always closes with something of the real thing it talks about.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are going to understand what the Bible talks about, we have to go to the end to see how it concludes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Most Bible readers appreciate the beginning of the Bible, but they do not pay much attention to the end of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is because their understanding deprives them of the preciousness of the ending of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their understanding is that the Bible ends merely with a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is very objective, having very little to do with us subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to this natural understanding, God spends many years and does so much just to prepare a mansion for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why not many pay attention to this part of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This shows us that the proper understanding means everything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many years ago, I began to realize that the end of the Bible could not be a physical city as a mansion into which we will enter to live for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the Bible really ended this way, it would be so low.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After having studied the Bible for a number of years, I realized to some extent the preciousness of the Bible and the contents of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Based upon this principle, I realized that the concluding figure shown at the end of the Bible must not be that low or that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It must be something very significant, very precious, and very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I began to hunt for material and books on the New Jerusalem from past writers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I found something of the truth concerning the holy city in the writings of Tersteegen, a German writer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Tersteegen indicated that the New Jerusalem must be something about the believers in Christ themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That opened my eyes a little bit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brother Austin-Sparks said a little more.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He pointed out that the New Jerusalem should be a figure, just as in the beginning of the Bible, God also uses figures such as the tree of life Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the whole universe, there is not such a physical tree the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are apple trees and peach trees.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are many kinds of trees, but who has ever seen or heard of a tree of life?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What is life?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Life is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, Brother Austin-Sparks said that this must be a figure of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A figure of speech is used to speak of something that is somewhat unseen, somewhat mysterious, and somewhat hidden, concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because something cannot be easily realized or apprehended, it is not possible to express what that thing is in normal terms.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why figures of speech are used.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The tree of life is a figure of speech.</S>
