   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lord of the Sabbath</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 28 we have a strong display of who the Lord is: So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates the Slave-Savior s deity in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He, the Son of Man, was the very God who ordained the Sabbath, and He had the right to change what He had ordained concerning the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the Lord of the Sabbath, He had the right to change the regulations concerning the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus indicated to the condemning Pharisees that He was the real David, the King of the coming kingdom of God, and also the Lord of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, He could do whatever He liked on the Sabbath, and whatever He did was justified by who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was above all rituals and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because He was present, no one should pay any attention to rituals and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I would call your attention to the word even in 2:28.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here the Lord says that the Son of Man is the Lord even of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His use of the word even here implies that He is not merely the Lord of one thing, but the Lord of everything, including the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord s word implies and indicates that He is the almighty God, the very One who ordained the Sabbath in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the One who had the authority to ordain the Sabbath, He also has the right to change it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the Lord could have said to the Pharisees, Why do you trouble Me?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am the Lord who ordained the Sabbath, and I have the full position and right to change it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whether I ordain the Sabbath or change it, I do it for the sake of man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Sabbath came into being for man s sake; man did not come into being for the sake of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You Pharisees would even let people die by the way you keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But on the Sabbath I care for feeding My followers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Genesis 2 I ordained the Sabbath because I wanted man to have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the Sabbath came into being for the sake of man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But now that I am here, I want to cancel the Sabbath in order to feed My followers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the Lord of the Sabbath, I certainly have the right to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How wonderful was the Lord s handling of the situation in 2:23-28!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He certainly is the best attorney, a heavenly attorney.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever He says is right.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In arguing with Him, the Pharisees did not have a case, for He is the almighty Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>CARING FOR THE RELIEF OF THE SUFFERING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>RATHER THAN FOR THE RITUAL OF RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 3:1-6 we see that the Lord carried out His gospel service by caring for the relief of the suffering one instead of caring for the ritual of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we have the last incident of the five recorded in 2:1 3:6, the case of the healing of a man with a withered hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This healing also took place on the Sabbath 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord s Move on Two Sabbaths</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mark 2:23 3:6 records the Lord s move on two Sabbaths Luke 6:1, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What He did on the first Sabbath indicates that He was acting as the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the Head, He is the real David and the Lord of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What He did on the second Sabbath signifies that He cared for His members.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On this Sabbath He healed a man s withered hand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The hand is a member of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord would do anything for the healing of His members.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sabbath or no Sabbath, the Lord is interested in healing the members of His Body who are in need, even healing the members who are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Regulations do not matter, but the healing of the members of His Body means everything to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In these two portions we have two cases of the breaking of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first instance of breaking the Sabbath took place in the grainfields; the second took place in a synagogue 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first breaking of the Sabbath was related to satisfaction, and the second was related to liberation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may be satisfied, but we may not yet be liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may not be free.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need not only satisfaction but also liberation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Have you been liberated?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Have you been emancipated?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Are you fully free?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You may be quite satisfied because you have learned to feed on the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, you may not have the assurance to say that you have been liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Actually, we need liberation even more than satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to the sequence in the Gospel of Mark, liberation follows satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we have not been satisfied, we shall not sense the need for liberation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our immediate need is to have our hunger satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First, the Lord satisfies our hunger, and then, as the divine Surgeon, He operates on us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once we are satisfied, He brings us into the operating room where He heals us and we are liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In 3:1-6 the operating room was the synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It was in the synagogue that the man with a withered hand experienced the restoring of his hand v. 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In verse 4 the Lord said to those in the synagogue, Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This word implies that the Slave-Savior was the Emancipator, who set the suffering one free from the bondage of religious ritual.</S>
