   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Leaven in Three Measures of Meal 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Leaven Being Wrong Doctrines,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Which Are Easy to Take</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Leaven refers to wrong doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus spoke about the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of the Sadducees.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Mark 8:15 there was the leaven of Herod.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, leaven in the Bible refers to wrong doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is quite clear that the fine flour in Leviticus 2:1 refers to the food of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In particular it refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Word of God shows us that the Lord Jesus is the fine flour, which is the food God gave to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Leaven is not allowed in this food.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God commanded the people of Israel to eat unleavened bread when they came out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, putting leaven into fine flour spoils the Lord Jesus as our food!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Originally, there was fine flour, but now leaven has been added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What happens when leaven is added to fine flour?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without leaven, bread is coarse, tasteless, hard, heavy, and difficult to digest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With leaven, bread becomes light and easy to digest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Leaven makes the flour tasty and easy to digest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many people feel that it is too hard to accept the Lord Jesus and His teachings; they find it hard to digest these things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who study the types of the Old Testament know clearly that fine flour refers to the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some feel that such a life is too weighty, hard, and solid; they cannot take it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The woman in the parable introduces many heresies into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She leavens the fine flour, making it easier for many to accept the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the world and every kind of heresy and doctrine are brought into the church, it is easier for someone to accept the Lord Jesus and His teachings!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is what Roman Catholicism has done.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Heresy of Confusion</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the truth concerning the church, the works mentioned above constitute a great mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The world is mixed with the church, grace is mixed with the law, and believers are mixed with unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The result is confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moreover, righteousness is mixed with mercy, paganism with Christianity, and religion with politics.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no greater confusion and fornication than that which is seen in Roman Catholicism!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It mixes Christianity with Judaism and Grecian art with the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It brings in every conceivable thing from the world!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The birds of heaven have come in. Leaven has been put into the meal, and it has become leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now it is light and puffy, and everyone can accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A person can be a Catholic as long as he is baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If he sins, he can buy an indulgence, which will deliver him from the sins of this life as well as the future purgatory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All kinds of heresies have come in!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a result, the meal is now leavened, and men can easily accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Roman Catholicism does not ask men to take the leaven; it only asks men to take the fine flour which contains the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Roman Catholicism gives us heresies as well as truths.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It believes that Christ is the Son of God and that the Lord Jesus died on the cross to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These two basic tenets of faith are there, but the fine flour has been leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>a. Three Measures Being a Convenient Unit</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why does the Bible say three measures here?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The number three is frequently used in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Abraham took three measures of meal and made bread for the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It seems that three measures can be easily held in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is a common measure, a common unit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is like measuring flour or rice by packets or sacks.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the ancient days the most convenient unit was three measures.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Confusing the Word of God</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The problem is that the woman has sown confusion into the food of God s people!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>She has destroyed their food!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>She has brought all sorts of heresies into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By introducing the heresies into the church, Catholicism has confused the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This work of the Roman Catholic Church results in the world creeping into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The woman now assumes great authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>She has taken control of worldly affairs as well as spiritual affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She has not only established a large church on earth, but has even extended her dominion over the nations of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In other words, the church has taken over political power as well as religious power.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It has indeed become a big tree.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At the same time, it has truly mingled leaven with the fine flour.</S>
