   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENJOYING ALL THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, we enjoy the Lord through the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the other hand, we enjoy the saints through the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The bread signifies the Lord and all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we receive the bread, we not only enjoy and receive the Lord; we also receive all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In receiving the bread, we declare that we enjoy not only the Lord but also all the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1 Corinthians 10 Paul says, The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ? v. 16 . In this verse Paul is not referring to the physical body of the Lord Jesus that hung on the cross for us but to the mystical Body that the Lord Jesus obtained in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We see this in the next verse, which says, Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread v. 17 . Though we are many, we are still one bread, one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The one bread that we share signifies this one Body, which includes us, the many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We share the one bread and declare that we receive and enjoy all our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, when we break bread, we may sense only that we are receiving the Lord and enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may not have much feeling toward our receiving the saints and enjoying them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please remember that the proper way to break the bread is to enjoy the Lord and at the same time to enjoy the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In a physical body each member enjoys the supply from the head and at the same time enjoys the supply from all the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No member can have an exclusive relationship with the head, and no member can receive and enjoy an exclusive supply from the head by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If any member becomes isolated, it loses the supply not only from all the other members but also from the head.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to maintain a relationship with the head, a member must maintain a relationship with all the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is this relationship that we declare when we break the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, we receive the Lord, but our receiving of the Lord is in all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the other hand, we enjoy the Lord, but our enjoyment of the Lord is through our enjoying all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are members in the Body, and we have a proper relationship with all the saints in the Body through which we maintain our relationship with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, when we break bread, we remember and enjoy the Lord, and we also fellowship with all the saints and enjoy them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not something that we do only on the Lord s Day, but even more, it is a declaration of our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We declare that this is the way we live every day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every day we have fellowship with our Lord, and we have fellowship with our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every day we enjoy the Lord, and we enjoy the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every day we receive the supply from the Head, and we receive the supply from other members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every day we live by the Lord, and we also live by the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today many children of God may know what it means to live by God and to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, not many children of God know what it means to live by the other members or to enjoy the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should enjoy not only the Lord but also the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should enjoy not only Christ as the Head but also the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should receive the supply not only from the Head but also from all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to be a proper, strong, vital, watering, and supplying member, we must maintain our enjoyment of these two aspects: enjoying the Lord and enjoying all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we consider the Lord to be the only source of our supply, we will miss a blessing because we will neglect the fact that the saints are an even greater source of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The saints can be a greater supply to us because ninety percent of the supply that the Lord gives us is through the saints Eph 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some may say that they always receive their supply from the Lord and do not feel that they receive much supply from the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If this is the case, the supply that they receive must be very little.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we desire to have a rich supply, we must learn to enjoy the Lord as well as the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are willing to enjoy the Lord and the saints, the supply that we receive directly from the Lord will decrease proportionally while the supply from the Lord through the brothers and sisters will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>NATURAL CONCEPTS</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>HINDERING CHRISTIANS FROM ENJOYING</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THEIR FELLOW MEMBERS IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some saints have said to me, It is surely right to receive the supply from all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, the brothers and sisters in our locality are not good enough, and there are not many who can supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we go to a brother, it seems as if he does not have much with which to supply us, and he has many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The sisters also have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Concerning the co-workers, elders, and deacons, some saints say, The co-workers in our locality are in a poor condition.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What kind of supply can we receive from them?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our elders are not any better, so what kind of supply can they give us?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The deacons are even worse, so what kind of help can we receive from them?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not only so, the condition of the brothers and sisters is poorer still.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, what kind of supply can we get from the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sometimes it seems that I am affected by what they say.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Their speaking is like a cloud of smoke that at times has even befuddled me to the point that their words do not seem unreasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, as soon as I am calm, I am clear within, because I realize that even a weak saint has a portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a saint does not have a portion of Christ, he must not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I have therefore asked those who complain, Are the saints whom you are referring to saved, and do you admit that the Lord is living in them?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When they agree, I would ask, The elders, deacons, and co-workers whom you feel are weak and have problems, are they also saved?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They would say, Of course they are.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then I would say, You speak of the weakness of the brothers and sisters as well as the shortcomings of the co-workers, elders, and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You also admit that Christ is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now I would like to ask: in the past have you seen something of the Lord s life coming forth from the saints?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Have you seen something in them that is for the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whenever I spoke with them in this way, all the saints who had complained would agree with me.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some saints have replied, There is no doubt that the saints are saved and that they all have the Lord s life in them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Co-worker So-and-so gave up the world for the Lord, and this can be seen in him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When some of the other co-workers were put in a difficult situation, they would not say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We appreciate their experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Sometimes I only needed to ask a few questions in order to turn all the negative speaking into something positive.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>None could deny that the saints they had complained about have a portion of the Lord and are for the Lord.</S>
