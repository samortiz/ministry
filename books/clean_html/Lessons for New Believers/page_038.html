<h2 class="head3">Introduction&mdash;to Lead the Meeting to the Subject<br />
according to the Feeling</h2>
<p>No meeting is without a subject or purpose. Once a meeting has begun, we need to lead it to the subject according to the feeling of the meeting. The introduction must be done through prayer, speaking, or singing. For example, at a meeting we may sense that the feeling of the brothers and sisters is that the Lord is in glory; hence, this is the feeling and subject of the meeting. We should rise up to offer a prayer, speak a few words, or select an appropriate hymn in order to lead everyone to the subject. This is the introduction.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Strengthening&mdash;<br />
to Strengthen the Spirit of the Meeting</h2>
<p>After the meeting is led to its subject, the spirit of the meeting may not be strong; thus, it may require some strengthening. Strengthening the spirit of a meeting also requires some skill. Selecting a hymn, offering a prayer, or speaking a few words are the ways to strengthen the spirit of a meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Uplifting&mdash;to Uplift the Spirit of the Meeting</h2>
<p>If the spirit of a meeting is not high enough after strengthening, it needs to be uplifted. This also requires some skill. The means to uplift the spirit of a meeting is also by singing, prayer, or speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Maintaining&mdash;to Maintain the Spirit</h2>
<p>When, through strengthening and uplifting, the spirit of a meeting reaches a peak, we should maintain it at this peak for a while. Sometimes after reaching the peak, a meeting goes down too quickly because of a lack in maintaining the spirit of the meeting. As a result, the meeting is not very rich. Thus, maintaining the spirit of a meeting is also very necessary.</p>
<p>The spirit of a meeting is seldom maintained by speaking. This is because speaking does not have much function in this step. Because it is difficult to select a fitting hymn, it is also difficult to maintain the spirit by singing. The most effective way to maintain the spirit of a meeting is for a few brothers and sisters to offer prayers with a strong spirit. I have been in several meetings when some brothers and sisters prayed one after another and thereby maintained the spirit of the meeting. Such meetings edify the spirit of the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Filling the Time&mdash;<br />
to Fill Up the Remaining Time of the Meeting</h2>
<p>Sometimes although everything is accomplished in a meeting, there is still time left because it is too early to end the meeting. The remaining time should be filled with singing, prayer, or speaking. Filling the time is similar to maintaining the spirit of a meeting, but there is a slight difference. Maintaining the spirit is keeping the spirit of a meeting at the peak after the peak has been reached. However, if a meeting does not have a peak, or if it is somewhat flat, and if it is not time for the meeting to end, there is the need to fill the time. The requirement for filling the time is not that high, but we should avoid routine practices. In filling the time there should be the addition of a spiritual atmosphere and flavor to the meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Ending&mdash;to End the Meeting</h2>
<p>The ending is to end a meeting. There is much involved in ending a meeting. We have many meetings that have a good opening but a poor ending. Ending can be compared to tying a knot. When we travel, we tie our luggage with a knot at the end of the rope after everything is bundled up. If the knot is not tied securely, the luggage will open up when it is being transported. A meeting that progresses through all the steps but has a weak ending will leave the saints without a solid feeling. In contrast, a meeting that is flat and weak in its progression but nevertheless has a strong ending will leave the saints with a good taste. The ending of a meeting is very important. Those who learn to take the lead in the meeting must learn this matter so that the meeting can end in a strong way.</p>
<p>We can end a meeting with a hymn or with some speaking, but the best way to end a meeting is through prayer. This does not mean that a meeting must always end with prayer. From our experience, however, we know that prayer is the best way to end a meeting. A meeting that does not end with prayer may cause the saints to feel that the meeting has not ended.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Sending Off&mdash;to Express<br />
the Lingering Riches of the Meeting</h2>
<p>Sending off is derived from Genesis 18 where Abraham sent Jehovah off. Sending off expresses the lingering riches of a meeting. There is the need of sending off when a rich meeting produces a lingering atmosphere. For example, when we sense such a lingering atmosphere, we can stand up and share a few words, even though a brother has already ended the meeting with prayer. This kind of sending off leaves the saints full of a pleasant taste. Instead of speaking a word, we may offer another prayer. Seemingly this is repetitious, but it is not. This is sending off, which strengthens the lingering air of a meeting.</p>
<p>It is also appropriate to send off with a short hymn. For example, after the bread-breaking meeting has ended, we may still sing the last stanza of <em>Hymns,</em> #33, &ldquo;Loving Father, now before Thee / We will ever praise Thy love.&rdquo; This is a sending off.</p>
<p>These are the eight steps in the progression of a meeting. It may not be necessary for a meeting to progress through the steps of maintaining the spirit, filling the time, and sending off. Even the uplifting step may not be necessary. The remaining four steps, however, are necessary in every meeting. Every meeting should have an opening, an introduction, a strengthening, and an ending.</p>
<p>A new believer may not be able to take care of these steps of progression in a meeting, but he needs to know these steps. Gradually, he should learn to take care of these steps in a meeting. We should bring all our meetings through this progression. This is not a law; rather, this is a spontaneous progression. After a meeting begins, there is an introduction, then strengthening, uplifting, and maintaining the spirit. If there is still more time before the meeting should end, there is the need to fill the time before the ending. If there is a lingering air after the ending, there is a need for sending off. A meeting with these steps of progression is rich and supplying.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Correction and Turning</h2>
<p>Apart from these eight steps of progression, there are two supplementary steps.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Correcting</h2>
<p>Correcting is to correct the selection of a wrong hymn. For example, a hymn on prayer may be selected in a bread-breaking meeting, a hymn to praise the Lord may be selected after we have begun to worship the Father, or a hymn to praise the Lord&rsquo;s glory may be selected while we are remembering the Lord&rsquo;s suffering. These hymns do not match the atmosphere of the meeting; rather, they distract the spirit of the meeting and must therefore be corrected. Sometimes we may wait until the hymn is sung and then select another hymn. Or we may immediately select another hymn, but this must be done carefully. The person being corrected may be offended if this is not handled properly. Any correction should be done gently. We must be skillful in correcting.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Turning</h2>
<p>Turning is to turn the subject of the meeting. For example, although the feeling of a meeting may obviously be the Lord&rsquo;s suffering on the cross, a brother calls <em>Hymns,</em> #127, which is on the Lord&rsquo;s exaltation. Singing this hymn cannot uplift people&rsquo;s spirit. A brother follows with a prayer, but the spirit is still not uplifted. Another brother may select a hymn on the Lord&rsquo;s love, but this still cannot move the spirit of the saints. However, when the subject is returned to the Lord&rsquo;s suffering, the spirit of the brothers and sisters is released through singing a hymn and prayers. This is because the feeling of the meeting was on the Lord&rsquo;s suffering. There was thus the need for turning.</p>
<p>Although there is the need for correcting and turning, they should not be practiced in a light way. If we do not know how to correct properly, we should not correct. If we do not know how to turn the subject in a suitable way, we should not do it. We need to have some confidence before correcting and turning. We should also be gentle and not harsh in order to avoid hurting others.</p>
