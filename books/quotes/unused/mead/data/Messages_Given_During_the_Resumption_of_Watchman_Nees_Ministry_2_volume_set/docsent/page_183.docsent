   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE FELLOWSHIP AND EXHORTATIONS 3 CO-WORKERS' MEETING 16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:6:30 p.m., Thursday, April 22, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nature:Testimonies by the co-workers, and exhortations</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>by Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>TESTIMONIES Consecration through the Lord's Love</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother Du Chung-chun testified: I once consecrated myself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For a few months I did not have a job, and I was left with twenty to thirty thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Others were hoarding, but I would not do that.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Others suggested that I should stock up on rice, but I did not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Later I almost committed suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I thought that I was quite good, that Satan would choose to attack me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I knew that Satan did not attack some others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This meant that they were worse than I was!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But then later I also did some hoarding.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I bought medicines.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, I was condemning others for hoarding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But on the other hand, I was doing the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is bad enough for a man to be sick; it is worse when others hold back medicines from him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From that time on, I dared not despise others any more.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I was like Thomas, who would not believe until he saw with his own eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I did not consecrate myself, and I became very unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Humanly speaking, consecration costs our life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But actually, it is the Lord who has loved us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a mother asks a child for something, and if the child loves the mother, he will surely give it to her.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But will the mother take the thing away and keep it for herself?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everything Being in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brother Lan Chi-i testified: I am a misguided man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I was brought up in a misguided environment, and I have been taught by misguided teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the age of thirteen I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although I was misguided, the Father who has begotten me is not misguided.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His leading and His demands are the same as His supply.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The supply to meet the demands does not come from us, but from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 1939, Brother Nee spoke on the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He said that if a person leaves Christ, he cannot survive, and that in the same way, if a person leaves the Body of Christ, he also cannot survive.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our work and our living, we have to be in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That revelation was like the shining of the sun to me; it outshone my dying lamp and made me feel ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Forsaking All for the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not Being a Loss but a Gain</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brother Chen Keh-san testified: After I was saved, someone said to me, "In what position you are called, you should remain in that position" 1 Cor 7:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I was deceived by this word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At that time I was the superintendent of the police department.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Later, when I dropped the world, I shed many tears.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet the Lord was moving within me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have dropped many things, but it was not because I was afraid of the Communists.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From age twenty-four to twenty-six, I was the superintendent of the police department.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After I was called, I felt that, should I have to give up the whole world to gain one soul only, it would have been worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I reckoned that even if I could get only one person saved during my whole life, it would be better than for me to gain the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But a few days after I said this, I got one person saved already.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You may think that what you have dropped is something great, but to the Lord it is a very small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What we have is very little.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord is the great ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Seemingly, when we forsake something, it is a loss to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Actually, it is a gain.</S>
