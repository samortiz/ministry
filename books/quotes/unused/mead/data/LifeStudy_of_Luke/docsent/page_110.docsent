   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>USING OUR MONEY TO BENEFIT OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I mention this to point out that we need to take the opportunity to use our money prudently to benefit others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Try to use your money to benefit others so that when it is out of use, others will do something for you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 16:9 the Lord says, Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that those who have been benefited by our proper use of money will welcome us into the eternal tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This will be in the coming age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the Lord Jesus comes back and we are received into His kingdom, some of us will have a number of people welcoming us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Who will be these welcomers?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They will be those who have received benefit in this age by our prudent use of money.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let me give a simple illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose you use an amount of your money to publish gospel tracts for the purpose of bringing people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who have been benefited by this use of your money will welcome you in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They may say, Brother, we want you to realize that we were saved through one of the tracts paid for by you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is an example of being welcomed into eternal habitations by those who have shared the benefit of our prudence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the parable in chapter sixteen the unrighteous steward took the opportunity, while he was still in the house, to help his lord s debtors to reduce their debt vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>4-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He took the opportunity to use money to benefit others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the same principle, while we are still on the way to the kingdom, we should use our money for the benefit of others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not use it for ourselves, for our luxury, amusement, pleasure, or indulgence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the contrary, we should use our money for others benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is a great deal of need, and there is much that we can do that will be a benefit to others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is to be prudent in serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot serve the Lord faithfully without using our money for the right purpose and at the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we claim that we are serving the Lord, but use our money in the wrong way, we are not honest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first thing an honest steward will do is handle his money properly and prudently.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I was studying English as a teen-ager, I read an article by Benjamin Franklin that was concerned with money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In that article Franklin said that it is easy to earn money but very difficult to spend it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was surprised by Franklin s word, for I thought it was difficult to make money and easy to spend it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But after reading that article I became convinced that it is easy to make money, but difficult to spend it in the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is difficult to spend money in a way that will not damage ourselves, others, or society.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Consider how much damage is done to society by rich people spending their money in the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the rich would use their money properly, they would benefit themselves, others, and all of society.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be sure, in order to serve the Lord as His stewards, we must handle our money rightly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some of us may say, I am not a rich person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because I am not rich, I don t have a problem with the way I spend my money.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, you may still have a problem with the money you have.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even though you are not wealthy, you need to learn how to handle your income.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>GIVING FAITHFULLY</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As one who has been serving the Lord and the churches for more than half a century, I can testify that any Christian group whose members give faithfully and consistently ten percent of their income will have money in abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Statistics concerning church finance prove this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Certain groups require their members to pledge ten percent of their income, and these groups always have money in abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The point here is not that we make a legal requirement of giving ten percent of our income.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The point is that those who faithfully give a tithe of their income never lack for money.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I would encourage the young people in particular to learn to give a portion of their income to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Young people, you should begin this immediately after graduation when you begin to work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Give a portion of the first wages you receive to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I can testify that this was my practice when I was young.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When I first earned money, even as a poor student, I set aside a portion to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps some of us have never considered this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, I encourage all the saints, especially the young people, to give the Lord a portion of whatever money they earn.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we do this, we shall learn to handle our money properly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who give to the Lord faithfully and consistently can testify that the more they give, the more they receive.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For us Christians, to be rich is to give.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The way to receive is to give.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord Himself said, Give, and it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, they will give into your bosom; for with what measure you measure, it will be measured to you in return 6:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here we see clearly that giving is the way to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For a church to be in poverty is a shame to the members of that church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Such poverty may indicate that the members are not faithful in their giving.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>May we all learn to serve the Lord as faithful stewards in handling money.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I encourage you to keep a record of your giving.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>During the course of a year, keep a record of everything you give.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then at the end of the year consider what percentage you have given to the Lord of what He has given you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I urge you all to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>According to the statistics I have studied and the testimonies I have heard, the more we give to the Lord, the more we shall be able to give.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For example, if you give ten percent one year, the next year you may be able to give twenty percent.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then if you are faithful to give a higher amount, you may be able to give even more the following year.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The point here is that the more we give, the more we shall be able to give.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When some hear this word about faithfulness and giving, they may say that they do not have enough faith to give consistently.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Actually, this is not a matter of our faith; it is a matter of our practice, and our practice is based on the Lord s faith and His faithfulness.</S>
