   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If believers acknowledge the fact that the Lord is the One with the seven stars, this will put the responsible ones in the church in a proper relationship with the Lord and a proper submission to the Lord and will preserve them from human manipulations and orders.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this way, no work will come into conflict with another work of the Lord in another place, and believers will not be confined to the care of one locality, one nation, or one sect alone.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In spite of the condition of the church, the Lord Jesus is the One with the full power of God's Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the same time, He has the full spiritual authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord reveals Himself here as such a One with power and authority because these are the things that are lacking in the church in Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the time of the Reformation, no two things were farther apart than the power of the Holy Spirit and the spiritual authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time, there was an organization which called itself the church and the bride of Christ, which considered itself well able to solve all problems and confessed the church as being eternally infallible, which considered one person to be the representative of Christ, who had unimaginable authority to deal with the affairs of the church and the disputes in doctrines of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although this organization has weathered many ages, in the end, it will be exposed as the greatest worldly organization in opposition to God and to His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although it may contain the most pious saints, these saints were there to support the Roman Pope to secure his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we study history, we will discover the way they helped the Roman Church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Surely these serve as our lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we think that we can remain in a wrong place just because genuine saints of God are there, we are grossly wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The goal of Satan is for good men to participate in evil works so that he can reap the benefit!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the time of the Reformation, God raised up men everywhere to oppose this kind of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was then that man separated the authority of the church from the spiritual power and would no longer consider the church as having both these things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everything Romish began to fall into confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the same time, man began to seek help from the powers of the world to release them from the reign of the Pope.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From this we can see that Protestantism was wrong in its government from the start.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It took the rulers of the world as the authority of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Roman Catholic Church, the church became the ruler of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Protestant churches, the world became the ruler of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of the many human ordinances and traditions, Protestantism has forgotten that the Lord is the One with God's seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because it has allowed the rulers of the nations to direct the offices of the church, it has forgotten the fact that Christ is the One with the seven stars.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although to a certain extent the church recognizes the Lord as having the power of the Holy Spirit and the spiritual authority, what is revealed here is not a Lord who has only some power of the Holy Spirit and who only has a few stars.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, He is the One with the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Needless to say, the number seven signifies completion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No matter how much the church has failed and how much it has gone along with the world, according to the intention of the Head of the church, all the powers and virtues of the Holy Spirit are still reserved for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He cares for the church, visits the church, and cherishes the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, the church has no excuse for its unfaithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the other hand, there is the source of supply for the faithful saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church is indeed in a position of failure already.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not only are the believers deceived by the heresy of Balaam, and not only has Jezebel raised up a family and begotten children in the church, but the church is at the point of death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In spite of this, Christ still has the spiritual power and the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This fact can never be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The fact that the Lord still has the power and the authority is itself a condemnation of the sin of the nominal church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, the Lord spoke this word as a comfort and blessing to His faithful people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although the nominal church is showing the signs of death, the Lord says that He is the One with the seven Spirits of God and that nothing can hurt His people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although everything has fallen into corruption, all the channels of blessings for the church are still there.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although Satan is evil, and although the church is weak, the riches of the Lord are not at all diminished.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everything that can produce and preserve goodness is still in the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those saints who are under the same circumstances as Sardis should receive comfort at this word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord taught the church in Thyatira to look to His coming and to consider Him as the unique hiding place in the midst of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord reminded them of the morning star so that they would have the light shining in their soul in a dark environment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To the church in Sardis, which was alive in name and dead in reality, the Lord comforted the faithful ones and assured them that the source of all power was not yet dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although the outward sources might have been stopped, He remained the same.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He wanted His church to know this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He desired to uphold and to preserve His faithful people, yet He did not deliver them with miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even in the Old Testament, the Lord was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the Israelites worshipped the golden calf, God did not perform a miracle to deliver them from this failure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, when Moses moved the tabernacle outside the camp, the spiritual power was with Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God's principle of work is not to avert man's failure by works of miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rather, it is the transmission of spiritual power that preserves His children in faithfulness and undefilement in the midst of uninterrupted failures.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Except for one case, all the prophets of Judah only prophesied; they did not perform any miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The one case was the sun returning ten degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These prophets testified, only to the degree that the people had left God's ordinances, that they should receive God's ordained truths, and that He was comforting the faithful remnant.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was only when the whole nation of Israel had openly and brazenly forsaken God under Jeroboam's leadership and had worshipped Baal that God performed miracles through Elijah and Elisha.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although in His grace and mercy God often sent His prophets to testify to Judah, before Judah's manifested failure, there were no miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, God's power had to be manifested to prove that He was Jehovah and that He was far greater than Baal.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If a sinner who is outwardly supporting the truth receives power, he will be strengthened in his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is both beneficial as well as being in accordance with the principle of God's work to testify with power against those who have forsaken the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before a man's failure is manifested, God is not willing to release His power.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is only when man has failed utterly that God stretches out His arms.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When man is still hiding his failures, and when his degradation is still buried like bones in the grave, God's power will only help him to disguise and camouflage his failures.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When man fails, God's love will uphold and comfort him with power.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the principle of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is perhaps the greatest principle of all.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If this principle is adopted by the believers, no matter how much they have failed, they will be able to count their days and will wait on God for His work.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Of course, we cannot be insensitive to the depth of our failures; it is right for us to be touched by it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Nevertheless, the sense of failure should not blind the eyes of faith from seeing the power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>On the contrary, one should know that this is just the time for God to work.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This will cause us to cast an objective eye although not an objective heart towards the church and will cause us to believe in the Lord's work and to believe that He will direct everything.</S>
