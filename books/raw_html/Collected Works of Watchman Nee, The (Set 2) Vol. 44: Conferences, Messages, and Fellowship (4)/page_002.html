<h1 class="msg">PREFACE</h1><p>Volume 44 of The Collected Works contains four sections that include various messages given by Watchman Nee in 1939 and 1940.</p><p>Section Eleven, comprised of chapters eighty-six through ninety-five, contains a series of ten messages from a conference given by Watchman Nee. While the location and date of the conference are unknown, it was most likely conducted in Shanghai in 1939. The main subject of the conference was God's eternal plan. The messages explain the two eternities and the meaning of God's eternal plan. They expound the Lord's prayer and its relationship to God's eternal plan. They point out Christ the Son of God and His place in God's eternal plan. They cover the origin of Satan, the purpose of the creation of man and his fall, and the work of Christ in fulfilling God's eternal plan. They expose Satan's organization and methods in frustrating God's eternal plan, and they conclude by revealing the position and responsibility of the church in God's eternal plan.</p><p>Section Twelve, comprised of chapters ninety-six through one hundred six, contains a series of messages given by Watchman Nee on the mystery of Christ. These messages were given in Shanghai in 1939.</p><p>Section Thirteen, comprised of chapters one hundred seven through one hundred thirteen, contains messages released by Watchman Nee in the mid-week meetings in Shanghai in 1939. The subjects vary in nature. Some cover the experience of life, and some cover spiritual principles. However, all the messages were given for the benefit of believers and for their growth in the spiritual life.</p><p>Section Fourteen, comprised of chapters one hundred fourteen through one hundred fifty-three, contains the record of mid-week meetings, Lord's Day morning meetings, fellowship with new believers, and other fellowship given by Watchman Nee in Shanghai in 1940. Chapters one hundred fourteen through one hundred twenty-three are included in this volume, while chapters one hundred twenty-four through one hundred fifty-three are included in Volume 45 of The Collected Works.</p><p>The contents of Volume 44 have been taken from notes by K. H. Weigh, which included the following list:</p><h2 class="head1">I.
