   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Question: At what point in a person's experience can we say that he has seen the matter of authority?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Watchman Nee: A man's experience of salvation relates to the amount of light he has received.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If a man receives enough light, he will feel the need for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The same can be said about the experience of authority; it depends on the amount of light a man has received.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a man receives enough light, he will touch authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His inner being will shrivel and be brought to submission.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When grass is exposed to the scorching sun, it can do nothing but wilt.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once a man touches authority in a genuine way, several things will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, those who have touched authority look for authority wherever they go.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They seek out objects of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the normal response of a person who has touched authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He no longer is the same as what he used to be, having no fear of anything or anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church is a "training institute" that trains Christians in the lesson of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Submission cannot be found anywhere in the world, and a Christian can only learn submission in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such submission is from the heart; it is not an outward performance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once a man learns submission, he searches for authority wherever he goes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, those who have touched authority are tender.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once a man touches God's authority, he is softened.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Something within him wilts away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is not able to be tough in himself any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is fearful of making mistakes, of falling into disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is easy to change such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Tenderness is a clear sign of an encounter with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who have touched authority are quite afraid of offending authority, even if by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Third, no one who has touched authority wants to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who have touched authority have no desire or interest in being an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A man who has met authority always remains under authority; he is always afraid of making mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, many people like to be God's counselors; they like to rule over others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These ones do not know anything about authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not like to be anyone's counselor or to give any proposals or opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do not like to rule over others, but those who have a natural inclination for these things have never touched authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even if we are an authority, we have to realize that there is authority above us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How do we know that our charge to those under us is acceptable to those above us?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who like to be God's counselor love to be an authority over others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No one is qualified to be God's counselor, but many people want to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A genuine authority goes through much deliberation, consideration, and prayer before he proposes anything or makes any decision.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is afraid of initiating anything that goes against the will of his authority, that is, the will of those above him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Problems often arise between husbands and wives because there is no realization of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When husbands and wives argue, authority is not the first priority; in fact, authority is set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A husband often says to his wife, "I am the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You must submit to me."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A husband who says this does not know what it means to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is how problems arise in many instances.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Fourth, those who have touched authority are very discreet with their tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A man who has genuinely touched authority has a disciplined mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His mouth is restricted, shut up, and he is fearful of any careless speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One of the greatest tests of a person is his words.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who have touched authority are sensitive to any word that is out of place, any criticism, or any word of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those who know authority are as sensitive to authority as they are sensitive to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This sensitivity is like the physical sensations of the body; as soon as it is triggered, there is a reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Fifth, those who have touched authority are fully aware of rebellion in others, just as a person who has had a genuine experience of salvation knows whether or not others are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Similarly, those who have had a genuine experience of dealing with sins know whether or not others are involved in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once we touch authority, we can turn around and identify the many rebellious acts in others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We find rebellious words here and there and find offenses against authority in many people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We find that many brothers and sisters whom we used to admire or revivalists whom we once respected have a spirit of rebellion behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We would not dare to criticize them, but we pity them, saying, "Such a brother or sister could have been a wonderful authority.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yet he has never touched authority himself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Oh, how much we need God's mercy!"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Such a consciousness instills fear in us and prayer for others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we have never touched authority, we are lawless, and we will not be conscious of any lawlessness in others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The first manifestation of lawlessness is rebellion, which comes from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once we touch authority, we detect the lawlessness and rebellion that is running rampant everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We realize that the principle of lawlessness has saturated the whole earth and even permeated the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We can bring the brothers and sisters into the same submission one by one by first touching authority and submitting to it ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I hope that after three or five years, we will all be different.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Everyone has to come under authority before he or she can be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We hope to see the testimony of authority manifested everywhere among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This will be something unseen and unheard of anywhere on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we subject our words and our spirit to those in authority, the church will have a testimony of submission and will be able to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If the church is submissive, many attacks from the enemy will be eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only after we have judged ourselves can we condemn the mistakes in others, and only then will our condemnation be accompanied by much supplication.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we all learn this lesson, the church will take a big step in the way of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is easier to submit to authority than to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we touch authority, our first reaction is to seek to submit to others and not to seek for submission from others.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Unless we are brought to this point, God cannot use us to be an authority.</S>
