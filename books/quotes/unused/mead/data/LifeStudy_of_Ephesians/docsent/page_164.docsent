   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-SEVEN HOW CHRIST GLORIFIES THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that 5:25-27 presents Christ in three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the first stage, the stage of the flesh, Christ gave Himself up for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the second stage, He as the life-giving Spirit is sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, in the third stage, He will present a glorious church to Himself as His Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>HOW CHRIST PRESENTS THE CHURCH TO HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to consider how Christ will present the church to Himself as a glorious church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was young, I thought that Christ was merely in the heavens and that the church was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>My concept was that at His coming back from the heavens to the earth, He would suddenly take up the church and present her to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to this concept, Christ is far away in the heavens, and we on earth are making ourselves ready to be presented to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I realized later, however, that this is a natural concept that makes Christ too objective.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s economy is altogether different from the natural concept and from religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In His economy, God is working Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, Christ will present the glorious church to Himself not by coming merely in an objective way, but by expanding within us and then by coming out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans 8 indicates that God has not only called us and justified us, but that He will also glorify us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Years ago I was taught that one day the Lord would suddenly descend from the heavens and sweep us up into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this concept of glorification is not according to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ will glorify us not by descending upon us from the heavens, but by coming forth from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The hope of glory is not the Christ in the heavens, but the Christ who is in us Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not take Christ as our life and our person, we shall have no way to enjoy the glory that is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to say, Lord Jesus, I take You as my life and my person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lord, I offer my heart to You.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Take my heart, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Possess it, occupy it, and make Your home in it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you practice this, spontaneously you will come to know the glory within you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE SHINING OF THE INNER GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many of us were taught that the light of God shines upon us from outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our experience of the Lord s shining, however, is different from this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to our experience, the light shines not from the outside, but from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you take Christ as your life and your person, do not expect the heavens to open and a great light to shine upon you in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If your experience is like that of so many, the Lord s shining will be inward, a shining from within.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a shining is an expression of the inner glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our hope of glory is Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, when God glorifies us, He will not need to send the glory from above; rather, He will cause Christ to shine forth from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that glorification is a subjective experience of the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>SWALLOWED UP BY CHRIST AS GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Contrary to the religious concept, our glorification will not be a sudden event.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, it will take place gradually as Christ expands within us and saturates us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ glorifies us as He eats us up little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all need to be eaten, devoured, swallowed up, by Christ as the glory within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Within us we have Christ not only as our life and our person, but also as the very glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may use the metamorphosis of an ugly caterpillar into a beautiful butterfly as an illustration of glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A caterpillar is not instantaneously transformed into a butterfly by a beauty that suddenly descends upon it and envelops it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No, the beauty of the butterfly is contained within the life of the caterpillar.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As the law of this life functions within the caterpillar, the caterpillar is gradually transformed into a butterfly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As this process takes place, the beauty of the butterfly swallows up the ugliness of the caterpillar.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the same principle, Christ is in us to be our hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As the indwelling glory, He takes every opportunity to expand within us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The inner glory saturates us and even swallows us up.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One day our entire being will be saturated with the divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On that day we shall be brought into glory in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is completely different from the religious teaching that tells us we must try to behave ourselves until someday when we hope to be suddenly transported into a realm of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to the religious concept, we must try our best to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we are pleasing to Him, one day He will swoop down from heaven and carry us away to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What a contrast between this and God s economy!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God s economy is to dispense Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As believers, we have Christ in us as our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our need is not to behave ourselves or to endeavor to please God; it is to take care of Christ as the hope of glory and to allow this glory to be our life and person.</S>
