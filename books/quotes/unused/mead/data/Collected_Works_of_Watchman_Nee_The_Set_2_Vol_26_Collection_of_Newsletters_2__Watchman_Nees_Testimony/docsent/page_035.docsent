   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Greetings to Mr. Nee, Mr. Kuang Hsiung, and Mr. Shou Ling:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our brother Mr. Witness Lee has already finished the work in P'u Men Ma Chan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This time he preached messages along two lines: the Body of Christ and the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thanks be to God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He really blessed us through the truth that was released; many brothers and sisters learned what the Body of Christ is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They also learned that being joined to Christ is so practical.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many people came to listen to the word this time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>More than four hundred brothers and sisters slept in the meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Together with those who did not sleep and eat here, there were more than seven hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was a great conference such that P'ing Yang has never seen before.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Lee spent the entire strength of his spirit and body in this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He spoke twice each afternoon and evening; each time he spoke for almost two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the evening meetings were over, he would sit outside under the stars with twenty or thirty responsible brothers surrounding him and speak about all the points of the truth and the matter of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The benefit we gained from these conversations was greater than what we received in the formal meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the morning of September 26, he left Ma Chan, but it was 7:00 p.m. when he arrived at a place near Chiang Nan Road.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He spent the night in a brother's home.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although Brother Lee was physically tired at the time, he still forced himself to keep going.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He passed through the localities of Yi Shan, Fang Yen Hsia, and Feng Chuan on the way back to fellowship and converse with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This made him even more tired.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The situation was so bad that he became sick with a headache and fever in Feng Chuan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Fortunately, the Lord's grace protected him; he began to get better last night.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He felt somewhat better this morning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Lee was very impatient to get to Hangchow to attend the conference, so he did not want to stay any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He left Feng Chuan at 6:00 a.m. and planned to get to Wenchow in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, when he arrived in P'ing Yang, the little steamer that runs along the river had already left; he had to stay at Brother Ts'ai Ch'i's house.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether or not he can go to Wenchow tomorrow all depends on his health.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In conclusion, Brother Lee's sickness came from the following natural causes: 1 On the round trip from Chiang Nan to P'u Men and P'u Men to Chiang Nan, he encountered rain and stormy weather; 2 there was too much work so that he was overtired; 3 the places he stayed were not quiet, and the food was not suitable to him; 4 our hospitality was insufficient; we did not meet his needs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These causes weakened our brother, so he returns with sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our hearts are so ashamed!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We really blame ourselves!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are very foolish and thickheaded.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not know how to serve the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brother Lee forgives us because of the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He has not blamed us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We hope that you will remember our immaturity and not blame us either.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Your brothers,</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yang Shih Ch'ing, Ts'ai Ch'i, Chen Ch'ing Fa</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>October 1</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A LETTER FROM BROTHER CHEN CH'ING FA</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Greetings in love to my dear brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Mr. Yueh Chiao:</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>My home received both your card, dated August 9, and your letter, dated August 14, a long time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I left my home in the middle of July to travel and only returned yesterday, so I am answering them after a long delay.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Please forgive me in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You asked about Mr. Su Sheng Ch'uan of Yi Shan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I will speak a few direct words in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Superficially, he appears to be walking in the Lord's way, but in reality he is going in the opposite direction from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This person is a great hindrance to us in the work here.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Please do not publish his writings in Collection of Newsletters or send him Collection of Newsletters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is speaking about his personal matters and not about the meeting in Yi Shan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>About three weeks ago, four co-workers and I sent a long letter to Mr. Nee and Mr. Lee about the recent condition of the work here.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We addressed the letter directly to the editor of Collection of Newsletters.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Have you received it yet?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am worried about it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Two weeks ago I read the Newsletter Paper and discovered something called, "The Condition of the Nondenominational Churches in Fu Ting, Tai Shun, and P'ing Yang."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It was signed by Brother Wang Yu T'ing and myself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After reading it, I did not know what to think.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I wondered whether Brother Wang Yu T'ing had really sent this news to that newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I think that many of the brothers and sisters who walk in the way with us must also have had suspicions after reading it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I met with Brother Yu T'ing later and learned what really happened.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some brothers from Tai Shun and Fu T'ing wrote letters to Brother Wang telling him about the condition of the churches there.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I also wrote a letter to him telling him about the condition of the work, and at the end of the letter, I told him about the beginning of the meetings in a few places.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Brother Wang put these letters together and sent them to the editor of Collection of Newsletters.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But the mailman was very careless and he delivered the letters to the office of Newsletter Paper.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The editors of the paper deleted all the portions that described the grace of God and that would edify the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They only published the hard words about leaving the denominations and thought it was church news.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I do not know what their motive was in doing this!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whether they are trying to slander or praise me, it is not important.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The most important thing is that I hope the brothers and sisters who walk in the way with us know what happened in this instance and do not have any misunderstandings.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Please send me a regular subscription to The Glad Tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Chen Ch'ing Fa</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>September 8</S>
