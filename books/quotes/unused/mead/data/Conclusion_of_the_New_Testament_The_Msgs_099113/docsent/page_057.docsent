   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Receive the Prize an Incorruptible Crown</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The prize in verse 24 is a reward as an incentive, and this reward is an incorruptible crown, which the Lord will award His overcoming saints who win the race.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This reward is in addition to salvation Heb 10:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eternal salvation is by faith, having nothing to do with our work Eph 2:8-9 , whereas reward is for our work after we are saved 1 Cor 3:8, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may not receive a reward but rather suffer loss, even though we are saved, because we are void of the work which the Lord would approve 1 Cor 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reward will be given to us according to our works at the Lord's coming back Matt 16:27; Rev 22:12; 1 Cor 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It will be decided by the judgment seat of Christ 2 Cor 5:10 and enjoyed in the coming kingdom Matt 25:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Apostle Paul strived to gain the reward 1 Cor 9:24-27; Phil 3:13-14; 2 Tim 4:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We, the believers in Christ, have all received His salvation through faith in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This has been settled once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But whether we shall be rewarded by Him depends on how we run the race.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1 Corinthians 9 Paul is running the course.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Philippians, one of his last Epistles, he was still running Phil 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was not until the last moment of his running, in 2 Timothy 4:6-8, that Paul had the assurance that he would be rewarded by the Lord at His appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With this reward in view, Paul charges the believers to run the race so that they may obtain the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By Exercising Self-control in All Things</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1 Corinthians 9:25 Paul speaks of exercising self-control in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All those who contend in the games, Paul says, exercise strict self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For instance, they watch their diet very carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If athletes exercise self-control in order to receive a corruptible crown, we should exercise self-control even more to obtain an incorruptible crown.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only by the exercise of self-control can we be runners in the race and contenders in the game.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By Putting Off Every Encumbrance and the Entangling Sin</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hebrews 12:1 says, "Let us also, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, putting off every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, run with endurance the race which is set before us."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Greek word translated "encumbrance" may also be rendered weight, burden, impediment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The runners in a race must strip off every unnecessary weight, every encumbering burden, that they may have no impediment to running the race.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is easy for us to pick up unnecessary burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if we would run the Christian race, we need to put off every encumbrance, every unnecessary burden or impediment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to Hebrews 12:1, we also need to put off the sin which so easily entangles us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here "the sin" refers mainly to the thing that entangles us from running the race.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Both the encumbering weight and the entangling sin frustrate us in running the race.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The encumbrances are outward, but the sin is inward, for it involves our sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Within our sinful nature there is something that often entangles us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to run the course of the Christian life, we need to put off the entangling sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Running with Endurance</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because there is much opposition to the Christian race, we need to run it with endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this reason, Hebrews 12:1 charges us to "run with endurance the race which is set before us."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to run the race, we must suffer the opposition with endurance, never growing weary or fainting in our souls v. 3 . 5.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Contending Lawfully</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"If also anyone contends in the games, he is not crowned unless he contends lawfully" 2 Tim 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>An athlete must contend lawfully to receive the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we would receive the prize, the incorruptible crown, we must contend lawfully.</S>
