[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Anaheim, California from February 22 through June 13, 1992.
[3]  The church is built up by means of gospel preaching, the teaching of the Bible, prophesying, and many other things, but according to an objective view of the New Testament, the highest of these things is prophesying.
[4]  The economy of God is God's household economy, His household administration, which is to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a house to express Himself, which house is the church 1 Tim 3:15 , the Body of Christ.
[5]  A. For an Organism to Express God in His Trinity
[6]  If we are going to prophesy, we must see what God's economy is.
[7]  God's economy is for an organism, and this organism is not for our interest, benefit, or attainments; it is for God's expression in His Trinity Eph 3:16-19 .
[8]  In order to prophesy, we need to see that in the universe there is such an economy of God, and according to His economy God desires to have an organism to express God in His Trinity with the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[9]  To build up the church as a religious organization is easy, but to build up the church as an organism through prophesying, we all need to see the economy of God for an organism that is constituted with the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[10]  The Body of Christ is the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with the believers as the unique Body in the universe Eph 4:3-6 .
[11]  In order to practice the church life according to the God-ordained way, we also need to realize the recovery of the Lord.
[12]  The first major item of the Lord's recovery is the recovery of Christ and of Christ as life to the believers for the church Col 1:15-19; 3:4a; Matt 16:16-18 .
[13]  The third major item of the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the unique oneness of the Body of Christ John 17:11, 22-23; Eph 4:3-6 .
[14]  Likewise, the Presbyterian church is proud of their seeing of the presbytery, that is, the ruling of the church by the elders; the Lutherans have denominated themselves according to Luther and his teaching concerning justification by faith; and the Methodists have formed a denomination and named themselves according to Wesley's teaching regarding the method for living a proper life.
[15]  Another item of the prerequisite of the practice of the church life according to the God-ordained way is to avoid churchlessness and division.
[16]  If we would practice the church life according to the God-ordained way, we must not neglect the goal of the God-ordained way the church Matt 16:16-18; Eph 1:22; 5:25-27 .
[17]  To summarize, the prerequisite of the practice of the church life according to the God-ordained way is first to see the economy of God, to know the Body of Christ, to realize the recovery of the Lord, and to avoid churchlessness and division.
[18]  I also believe that what I am going to fellowship with you in this message will be a help to all the saints in the Lord's recovery.
[19]  The way to have a clear view concerning the present situation of the Lord's recovery is by thorough prayer Eph 1:16; 3:14 .
[20]  When you hear the things spoken by the dissenting ones, do not take them at face value.
[21]  The dissenting brothers also accused me of controlling the churches by my trainings, conferences, messages, tapes, etc. On March 19, 1989, in a word spoken to the church in Anaheim upon his resignation from the eldership, one of the dissenters said, "There has been a pervasive control exercised over the church...The control has not been exercised so much directly, but very much indirectly, through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders' meetings." This word implies that whatever I do in my ministry teaching, training, publishing, and distributing audio and video tapes is all for the purpose of controlling the churches.
[22]  After I returned to Anaheim from Taipei in December 1987, a letter from one of the dissenting ones was waiting for me in my home.
[23]  From the spring of 1988 the dissenting ones began to teach the autonomy of the local churches.
[24]  Their teaching was based on G. H. Lang's book The Churches of God.
[25]  Beginning in the summer of 1988 and continuing through the remainder of that year, I spoke a number of messages exposing the fallacy of the teaching of autonomy see A Timely Word, pages 29-30; The Body of Christ, pages 17-19; A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need, pages 33-34; The Building Up of the Body of Christ, pages 30-32; and Further Light concerning the Building Up of the Body of Christ, pages 29-30, published by Living Stream Ministry .
[26]  from Life and Life Supply to Budgets, Numbers, Activities, and Other Practices, and This Change Has Affected the Nature of the Recovery
[27]  The dissenting ones also said that since 1984 the ministry has changed from life and life supply to budgets, numbers, activities, and other practices, and this change has affected the nature of the recovery.
[28]  The dissenting ones also raised questions concerning the matter of leadership.
[29]  In 1986 I gave a series of messages that were misunderstood and misused by them see Elders' Training, Book 7, One Accord for the Lord's Move, published by Living Stream Ministry .
[30]  Then, in the 1987 Summer Training I gave additional messages to point out that, actually, the New Testament leadership is not a person but is the teaching of the apostles see The God-ordained Way to Practice the New Testament Economy, chapter nineteen, especially pages 172-173, published by Living Stream Ministry .
[31]  In the previous message, we saw that we need to have a clear view concerning the present situation of the Lord's recovery to discern the present problems raised up by the dissenting ones.
[32]  The extract of the definition of the church ground is to keep the oneness of the Spirit inwardly and to take the differences outwardly, not allowing anything but the locality in which we live to separate us into local churches.
[33]  When the dissenters began to cause trouble in 1987, they claimed that I had changed and that my change had affected the nature of the recovery.
[34]  I admit that I changed from the old way of gospel preaching to the scriptural way of visiting people.
[35]  I also told people to turn from having church meetings with one man speaking and the rest listening to meetings in which all can prophesy according to the revelation of 1 Corinthians 14.
[36]  The opposing ones have also rejected the truth concerning deputy authority, claiming that they are under the direct headship of Christ.
[37]  If a country existed in which the people said that they did not want to have any man ruling over them, but that they just wanted God to be their Ruler, that country would be full of chaos and anarchy.
[38]  The church in Jerusalem was a young church, but it also had the problem of Ananias and Sapphira Acts 5:1-11 and the problem concerning the distribution of food to the widows 6:1 .
[39]  CHAPTER FOUR THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING 1 Scripture Reading: Heb 1:1-2a; John 1:1; Gen 1:6-7, 9, 11, 14-15; Psa 33:6a, 9; John 5:24; 14:10b; Num 11:29b; 1 Cor 14:31; 1 Thes 5:20; Amos 2:12b; 7:12-13; Jer 11:21; 15:19; 1:8-9; Psa 73:28a; 25:14; 73:17; Acts 6:4; 1 Thes 5:16-20; Col 3:16; Acts 19:6 I. GOD BEING A SPEAKING GOD
[40]  Since God is our Father, we as His children must follow Him to speak.
[41]  God created the old creation by His speaking Gen 1:6-7, 9, 11, 14-15; Psa 33:6a, 9 .
[42]  God said, "Let there be light: and there was light" v. 3 . Psalm 33:6 says, "By the word of Jehovah the heavens were made." God works by speaking.
[43]  X. THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR PROPHESYING A. Taking the Precious from the Vile
[44]  The first qualification for prophesying is to take the precious things from the vile, or worthless Jer 15:19 .
[45]  In order to speak the word of God, we have to separate all the vile, worthless things from the precious things.
[46]  If we do not keep the precious things separate from the vile things, we will lose the position to be the mouthpiece of God.
[47]  In Psalm 73 the psalmist was bothered at the prosperity of the wicked v. 3 . Then in verse 17 he said, "Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end." He could not understand until he went into the sanctuary of God, that is, until he contacted God.
[48]  In the Old Testament time God spoke through the prophets, but in the New Testament time God speaks in the Son Heb 1:2 .
[49]  We must realize that speaking is a strategic matter.
[50]  If we do not speak, we are unprofitable to the Lord.
[51]  In 1984 I went to Taiwan to fight against the killing practice of annulling the speaking function of the members of the Body of Christ.
[52]  You have to treasure your speaking for the Lord, because the Lord treasures your speaking.
[53]  If the saints do not speak, the riches of the Body of Christ will not be manifested and used.
[54]  for the Building Up of the Body of Christ
[55]  If we practice to prophesy, we will carry out the God-ordained way for the building up of the Body of Christ and annul the old way related to Christianity Eph 4:12 .
[56]  CHAPTER SIX THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING 3 LEARNING, EXERCISING, AND PRACTICING 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:4; Heb 5:12-14; 2 Pet 3:18; 1 Pet 2:2-3; Eph 4:13-16
[57]  According to God's creation, our mouth has many purposes.
[58]  Our mouth is used for breathing, drinking, and eating, yet the ultimate use of our mouth is for speaking.
[59]  To speak for God, to speak God forth, and to speak Christ into people, ministering the riches of Christ into another person's being, is the highest speaking.
[60]  To learn the person of God, we must first know that God's name in Hebrew is Elohim Gen 1:1 .
[61]  The Triune God not only exists and lives but also works, moves, and acts.
[62]  In Genesis 12 and 22, God prophesied to Abraham that in him and through his seed, all the nations would be blessed.
[63]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING 4 LEARNING, EXERCISING, AND PRACTICING 3 Scripture Reading: Luke 1:47; Psa 16:9; 108:1; Acts 2:26; 1 Cor 14:7-11; Acts 6:10; 7:55; 4:31
[64]  In this message we will continue our fellowship concerning the practice of prophesying.
[65]  To prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak Him forth.
[66]  All of us need to speak Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[67]  When asked why they do not speak in the meetings, some may say, "I do not know how to speak, and I do not have anything to speak, so I dare not speak.
[68]  In the exercise of your spirit Luke 1:47; Psa 16:9 , you must exercise your mouth and your voice at the same time.
[69]  The standard of speaking in the church meetings is the highest.
[70]  To speak in the meetings, we must exercise our spirit, our mouth, our voice, our speed, our gesture, and our accent in a proper way.
[71]  To play basketball, in contrast, is a small thing, yet even for such a small thing, the players must exercise and practice every day for many hours.
[72]  In the God-ordained way to practice the church life, we all have to learn to speak for the Lord.
[73]  In the past six years we have received much teaching concerning the God-ordained way.
[74]  This way, no doubt, has been ordained by God, but it has not been practiced adequately by us.
[75]  Although I appreciate and value the teaching concerning the God-ordained way very highly, at the present time what we need is the practice with the proper coaching.
[76]  We need to be transformed in the way that we act, the way that we move, the way that we work, the way that we speak, the way that we have our being, and the way that we meet.
[77]  At this point I would like to say a further word concerning the exercising of our voice.
[78]  After concluding my prayer, I opened my message with a word concerning our need to be in a divine trance Acts 10:9-10 in order to see the intrinsic view of the Body of Christ see The Intrinsic View of the Body of Christ, chapter four, published by Living Stream Ministry .
[79]  God's first step in the new creation was to become incarnated.
[80]  When we come to the meetings, as Christians we must move as transformed persons, not as persons who act.
[81]  When he acts, an actor dresses himself and conducts himself in a manner that is different from what he is normally.
[82]  When a young actor portrays an old man, he alters his appearance so that he looks like an old man, and he moves, gestures, and speaks to people like an old man.
[83]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You for all that You are to us, and we thank You for this time that we all could come together to seek after You in Your Word.
[84]  Prophesying is a matter of incarnation, but most Christians have made it a miraculous thing, like the speaking of human words by Balaam's donkey Num 22:28-30 .
[85]  If we tell God that we are tired and do not want to do or speak anything, God may say, "I am so pitiful.
[86]  In the previous two messages we have seen that we need to exercise our spirit, our mouth our tongue , and our voice our sound in the practice of prophesying.
[87]  In prophesying we also need to exercise our speed.
[88]  We should not speak too fast or too slow; rather, we need to speak with a good rhythm and a proper speed.
[89]  In our practice we also need to learn to paraphrase a short portion of the Scriptures.
[90]  For instance, John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
[91]  IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:22-25; 14:26
[92]  We have been greatly influenced by Christianity to think that among all the saints, only a few are useful and have some capacity to serve the Lord.
[93]  Some of the sisters may say, "I am only a small sister; I am not so useful."
[94]  However, 1 Corinthians 12:24 says that God has given more abundant honor to the weak ones.
[95]  From my youth I loved the United States, but all I knew of that country was by hearing others speak of it.
[96]  I do hope that from now on, when you listen to the messages concerning the God-ordained way, you will make a definite decision to take the definite steps to practice this way.
[97]  One day the Lord bothered Peter because Peter said something wrong concerning the Lord's person, concerning His paying of the tax for the temple Matt 17:24-27 .
[98]  When asked whether the Lord paid the temple tax, Peter said yes.
[99]  After pointing out to Peter that, as the Son of God, He did not need to pay the temple tax, the Lord charged Peter to go to the sea and cast a hook and take the first fish that came up.
[100]  If we mean business to practice the God-ordained way by taking definite steps, at least one-third of the church should go out weekly to contact people for the gospel.
[101]  Then, third, after one has been saved and nourished for several months, he surely will have a certain amount of growth in life.
[102]  At that time he will have entered into another stage, a stage in which he can be perfected.
[103]  For the group meetings, we can group together a number of the saints who have grown in life by being nourished.
[104]  Some of the saints may not have the burden to take up the step of offering the saved sinners as members of Christ, or the step of feeding the young believers, or the step of taking care of the grouping of the grown saints, but they may have a burden to practice prophesying.
[105]  I. TO BRING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY ON ITS TRACK
[106]  Although I have been speaking on the God-ordained way for seven and a half years, the "train" of the God-ordained way is still not on the track.
[107]  In order to bring the God-ordained way on its track, we need to be those who take the definite steps of the practicing and learning of the God-ordained way, practicing each step one by one.
[108]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE LABORING WAY Scripture Reading: Rom 15:16; 1 Cor 15:10, 58; Col 1:28-29; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; Acts 2:46-47; 4:24; 5:12; 6:4
[109]  In this message I would like to speak something very practical concerning the practice of the church life according to the God-ordained way.
[110]  The God-ordained way is the laboring way Col 1:29; 1 Cor 15:10, 58 .
[111]  Recently eleven full-time co-workers who had been trained in Taipei and had been sent to the countryside in Taiwan to raise up new churches were charged to return to Taipei and take care of the work among the students on the university campuses.
[112]  There are more than twenty universities in Taipei, and several of these are very large.
[113]  As we have mentioned previously, the first item in the practice of the God-ordained way is the universal priesthood of the gospel Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 2:5, 9 .
[114]  The best way to gain people for Christ is the biblical way.
[115]  Second, it is to get the proper word in the Bible digested into our being so that we can use what we have digested of the Word to cherish and to nourish others 1 Tim 4:6; 2 Tim 3:15-17 .
[116]  Third, we ourselves must be persons living on this earth with no other interest but Christ with His Body.
[117]  Once we possess these three qualifications, we must know that we need to bear fruit John 15:1-8, 16 ; we need to produce some members for Christ.
[118]  We need to realize that the Lord's recovery today is absolutely different from Christianity.
[119]  Thus far we have been speaking concerning the new way, or the God-ordained way, for at least seven years, beginning from 1985.
[120]  In my speaking concerning the God-ordained way, I have instructed you like a coach.
[121]  The Lord's recovery is for the producing of the overcomers.
[122]  We should not think that to overcome is merely a matter of overcoming our temper.
[123]  In Revelation 17 we are told clearly that near the beginning of the three and a half years of the great tribulation, after Antichrist begins to oppose and exalt himself above all that is called God or an object of worship 2 Thes 2:3-4 , he will burn the Roman Catholic Church Rev 17:16 , which is the great harlot mentioned by the apostle John in Revelation 17:1 and the evil woman mentioned by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 13:33.
[124]  Romans 15:16 tells us that the New Testament believers are the New Testament priests and that we, the New Testament priests, are priests of the gospel.
[125]  Then 1 Peter 2:5, 9 says that we as priests should be built up together to be a priesthood, that is, a priestly body.
[126]  Thus, if we are going to convert sinners into members of Christ, we must do it in a corporate way.
[127]  Some saints have said that they went to knock on people's doors, but they did not gain anyone.
[128]  In Matthew 25 the one-talented slave attempted to excuse himself by saying to his master, "Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow" v. 24 . To this his master replied, "Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not winnow" v. 26 . In this parable the Lord did not deny that He is strict in what He demands of His slaves for His work.
[129]  Concerning the practice of group meetings, many principles have been set forth in previous messages.
