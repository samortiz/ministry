<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Slaughtering the Seventy Sons of Ahab</H2><P>Jehu also slaughtered the seventy sons of Ahab (2 Kings 10:1-11). Jehu proposed to the rulers of Jezreel, the elders, and the guardians of the children of Ahab to make one of the children of Ahab to be the successor to the throne and to fight for the house of Ahab (vv. 1-3). The one who was over the household, the one who was over the city, the elders, and the guardians of Ahab's children rebelled. They killed all the seventy sons of Ahab and sent their heads to Jehu, and Jehu killed Ahab's great men, acquaintances, and priests until no one remained (vv. 4-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Killing the Brothers of Ahaziah King of Judah</H2><P>Verses 12 through 14 tell us that Jehu killed the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Slaying All Who Were Left to Ahab in Samaria</H2><P>Next, according to the word of Jehovah spoken to Elijah, Jehu slew all who were left to Ahab in Samaria (vv. 15-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Slaughtering All the Prophets of Baal</H2><P>In subtlety, Jehu slaughtered all the prophets of Baal and all his servants, priests, and worshippers. Then he burned all the pillars of the house of Baal and broke down the house of Baal and made it a latrine, thus eradicating Baal from Israel (vv. 18-28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Not Turning Away from the Sins of Jeroboam</H2><P>Although Jehu did some things that were right and pleasing to God, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, by which he caused Israel to sin, that is, the golden calves which were in Bethel and Dan (vv. 29, 31).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Jehovah Speaking to Jehu concerning His Sons</H2><P>In verse 30 Jehovah spoke to Jehu, saying, "Because you have done well in executing what is right in My eyes and have dealt with the house of Ahab according to all that was in My heart, your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel." This also indicates that to enjoy the good land we must be right. How much we enjoy Christ as our good land depends on what we are and how right we are.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Jehovah Beginning to Cut Away<br>Portions of Land in Israel</H2><P>In those days Jehovah began to cut away portions of land in Israel by Hazael striking them in all the borders of Israel (vv. 32-33).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. Being Buried in Samaria</H2><P>After reigning over Israel for twenty-eight years in Samaria, Jehu slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz reigned in his place (vv. 34-36).</P>
