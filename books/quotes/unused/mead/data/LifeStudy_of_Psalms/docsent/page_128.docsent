   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Our understanding of the Bible depends upon the measure of our growth in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Even today in our human life, our knowledge depends upon the measure of our growth in the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When someone is a child, we cannot expect him to understand that much.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As this child grows, he is able to understand more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, when he becomes a full-grown man, he can understand things properly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is difficult to understand the book of Psalms properly according to the divine concept.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have seen that at times David spoke things in the Psalms which were very wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then he spoke something which was altogether according to the human, natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to understand the Bible, we must exercise one principle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This principle is that God planned in His economy to make Himself one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The basic principle, the main principle, of Christ's birth is that God came to join Himself to man, to be a man, and to be one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the basic principle of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we read the Bible, we need to keep the principle of God's being one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should keep the principle that the Word of God as the divine revelation shows us that God's main purpose is to make Himself one with man and to make man one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In John 15 the Lord said, "I am the vine; you are the branches...abide in Me and I in you" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>5, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This shows us that God and the believers in Christ are one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We and God were once separate, but one day we, the wild branches, were grafted into Him in Christ Rom 11:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have been grafted into Christ as the tree, and this grafting has made us one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is needed now is for us to abide in Him that He may abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then He and we will be one, having one life, one nature, and one living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we see this, we will be fully adjusted in our understanding of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to hold the divine concept in John 15 where the Lord said that He is the vine, that we are His branches, and that we should abide in Him that He may abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Psalms 34 36, we can see that David was not acting as a branch who was one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In our understanding of the Bible, we have to pick up the proper principles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The main principle is that God desires to be one with His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, the oneness between God and man will be completed, consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All of God's chosen people will be consummated to be fully one with God to become the constituents of the holy city, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever we come to the Psalms, we need to hold this concept; otherwise, we can be misled.</S>
