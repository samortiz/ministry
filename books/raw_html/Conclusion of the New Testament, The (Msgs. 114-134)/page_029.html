 <h2 class="head3">l. This Precious Faith Given by God<br />
within Us through the Spirit as the Power<br />
and Christ as the Element Being<br />
the Key to Receive God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy, as the Law Given by God<br />
outside of Israel through the Angels and Moses Was the Key to God&rsquo;s Old Testament Dispensation</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The precious faith given by God within us through the Spirit as the power and Christ as the element is the key to receive God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, as the law given by God outside of Israel through the angels and Moses (Gal. 3:19) was the key to God&rsquo;s Old Testament dispensation (Gal. 3:23, 26). Two important words in Galatians 3 are law and faith. Before faith came there was the law, which was the key to God&rsquo;s Old Testament dispensation. Now in the New Testament the key is no longer the law but faith. Faith is the key for us to receive God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Faith has come to replace the law. This is the faith that is produced, formed, and given to us by God. Now this living faith is the key for us to receive all the blessings, even all the bequests, of the New Testament economy of God.</h2>
<p>The law was the principle according to which God dealt with His people in the Old Testament economy. &ldquo;Before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed&rdquo; (Gal. 3:23). To be guarded is to be kept in custody, to be kept in ward. To be guarded under law can be compared to sheep being enclosed in a fold (John 10:1, 16). The law was used as a fold to keep God&rsquo;s chosen people until Christ came. Because Christ has come, God&rsquo;s people should no longer be kept under the law.</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;unto&rdquo; in 3:23 can also be translated &ldquo;with a view to.&rdquo; This indicates that the shutting up has an objective or goal in view. It should result in bringing the guarded people to the faith.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:24 says, &ldquo;So the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.&rdquo; The Greek word for &ldquo;child-conductor&rdquo; can also be rendered escort, guardian, or custodian. It denotes one who cares for a child who is under age and conducts him to the schoolmaster. The law was used by God as a custodian, a guardian, a child-conductor, to watch over His chosen people before Christ came and to escort and conduct them to Christ at the proper time.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:25 goes on to say, &ldquo;But faith having come, we are no longer under a child-conductor.&rdquo; Since faith in Christ has come, we do not need to be under the guarding law any longer.</p>
<p>Just as the law was the basic principle according to which God dealt with His people in the Old Testament, faith is the basic principle according to which He deals with people in the New Testament. All those who refuse to believe in Christ will perish, whereas those who believe in Him will be forgiven of their sins and receive eternal life. In John 16:9 we are told that the Spirit will convict the world concerning sin because of not believing in the Son of God. This indicates that the unique sin which causes people to perish is unbelief. God&rsquo;s commandment to sinners is to believe in the Son of God.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:23 and 25 speak of the coming of faith. Verse 23 says, &ldquo;Before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed.&rdquo; This verse indicates clearly that there was a time when faith came and was revealed. Faith was not to be found in the Old Testament; it came with Jesus Christ. When Christ came, grace came, and faith came also. Faith has come to replace law. Thus, Galatians 3:25 says, &ldquo;Faith having come, we are no longer under a child-conductor.&rdquo; According to this verse, now that faith has come we are no longer under the law as our child-conductor. Faith and law cannot co-exist. Before faith came, we were under law. But now that faith has come and has been revealed, this faith replaces law. The law kept us and brought us to Christ, but now in our experience it should be replaced by faith. Faith characterizes those who believe in Christ and distinguishes them from those who keep the law (Acts 6:7; 1 Tim. 3:9). We are not keepers of law&mdash;we are believers in Christ. We are the people of faith.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:7 and 9 speak of those &ldquo;who are of faith.&rdquo; According to Darby&rsquo;s <em>New Translation</em>, this expression denotes the principle of faith. In his version he adopts the rendering &ldquo;on the principle of faith.&rdquo; To be of faith means to be on the principle of faith. We are those who take faith as our principle. Everything we do should be in keeping with this principle. By this principle we come to Christ, receive Him, and become one with Him in the organic union.</p>
