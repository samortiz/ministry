   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we consider the question of meeting, let us first say a few words concerning the nature of the Church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is the Head of the Church and "we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another" Rom 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Apart from Christ, the Church has no head; all believers are only members, and they are "members one of another."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Mutuality expresses the nature of the Church, for all the relationships among believers are of one member to another, never of a head to the members.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All those who compose a church take their place as members of the Body, not one occupying the position of head.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The whole life of the church, and all its activities, must be stamped by this characteristic of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the nature of the work is quite different from that of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the work there are active and passive groups.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The apostles are active, and those among whom they labor are passive, whereas in the church all are active.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the work, activity is one-sided; in the church it is all-round.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we recognize the fundamental difference between the nature of the work and the church, then we shall easily understand the scriptural teaching concerning the meetings which we are about to consider.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are two different kinds of meetings in Scripture the church meeting and the apostolic meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are to differentiate clearly between the two, we must first understand the different nature of church and work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once we see that clearly, a glance at the nature of any meeting will make it obvious to what sphere it belongs; but if we fail to realize the distinction, we shall constantly confuse the church with the work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the early Church there were meetings which were definitely connected with the churches, and others that were just as definitely connected with the work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the latter only one man spoke, and all the others constituted his audience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One stood before the others, and by his preaching directed the thoughts and hearts of those who sat quietly listening.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This type of meeting can be recognized at once as a meeting connected with the apostolic work, because it bears the character of the work, that is, activity on the one side and passivity on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no stamp of mutuality about it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the church meetings, "each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation" 1 Cor 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here it is not a case of one leading and all the others following, but of each one contributing his share of spiritual helpfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>True, only a few of those present take part, but all may; only a few are actual contributors to the meeting, but all are potential contributors.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Scriptures show these two distinct kinds of meetings apostolic meetings, which are led by one man, and church meetings, in which all the local brethren are free to take part.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The apostolic meetings may be divided into two classes for believers and for unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The meeting which was held immediately after the Church came into existence was an apostolic meeting for unbelievers Acts 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The gatherings in the portico of Solomon Acts 3:11 and in the house of Cornelius Acts 10 were of the same nature, and there are still other records of similar meetings in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were clearly apostolic meetings, not church meetings, because one man spoke and all the others listened.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul's preaching at Troas was to the brethren Acts 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether it was in the church or not, it was still apostolic in nature, for it was one-sided, the apostle alone speaking to the whole assembly, and not the various members taking part for their mutual edification.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul preached to the brethren at Troas because he was passing through that place, and any apostle passing through a place as he did would be free to respond to an invitation from the brethren to help them spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then when Paul was in Rome, the believers came to his rented room to hear him witness Acts 28:23, 30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This work again is specifically apostolic in nature, because one man is active, while the others are passive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second kind of meeting is mentioned in the first Epistle to the Corinthians:</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If therefore the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak in tongues, and some unlearned in tongues or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are insane?....What then, brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Let all things be done for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two, or at the most three, and in turn, and one should interpret; but if there is no interpreter, he should be silent in the church, and speak to himself and to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And as to prophets, two or three should speak, and the others discern.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if something is revealed to another sitting by, the first should be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets; for God is not a God of confusion but of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As in all the churches of the saints 4:23, 26-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is obviously a church meeting, because it is not one man leading while all the others follow, but each gifted one contributing to the meeting as the Spirit directs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the apostolic meetings there is a definite distinction between the preacher and his audience, but in this kind of meeting any gifted member of the church may be preacher and any may be audience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Nothing is determined by man, and each takes part as the Spirit leads.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not an "all-man" ministry, but a Holy Spirit ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The prophets and teachers minister the Word as the Lord gives it, while others minister to the assembly in other ways.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Not all can prophesy and teach, but all can seek to prophesy and teach v. 1 . An opportunity is given to each member of the church to help others, and an opportunity is given to each one to be helped.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One brother may speak at one stage of the gathering and another later on; you may be chosen of the Spirit to help the brethren this time, and I next time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everything in the meeting is governed throughout by the principle of "two or three" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>27, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even the same two or three prophets are not permanently appointed to minister to the meetings, but at each meeting the Spirit chooses any two or three from among all the prophets present.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That such assemblies are assemblies of the church is seen at a glance, because the stamp of mutuality is clearly upon all the proceedings.</S>
