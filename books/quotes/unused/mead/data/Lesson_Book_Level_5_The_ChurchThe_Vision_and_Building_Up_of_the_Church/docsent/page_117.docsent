   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ROYAL PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Peter 2:9 says, "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.''</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The royal priesthood is typified by the priesthood according to the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Genesis 14:18-20, Melchisedec came from God to bless Abraham with bread and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He came from God to bless man with the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After we go to God as a holy priest, separated unto God, we become saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then we need to go to God's people to bless them with God as the bread and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's table signifies Christ's death and resurrection for man's salvation and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the gospel, the good news, for fallen, sinful man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In addition, this is what we share in the church meetings to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE GOSPEL PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 15:16 says, "That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, a laboring priest of the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.''</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The gospel priesthood mentioned here is not different from the holy and royal priesthoods.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These three terms apply to three different aspects of the same priesthood in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are priests, and we are being built up as a priesthood, having Christ as the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The main function of the gospel priesthood is to preach the gospel to save sinners, so that they may be offered to God as acceptable sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Romans 15:16 talks about a minister of Christ Jesus laboring to offer the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1 Peter 2:9 talks about telling out the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And 1 Peter 2:5 talks about offering up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The functions of these three priesthoods are absolutely one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, the gospel priesthood includes the holy and royal priesthoods.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a gospel priest we need to come forward to God to be saturated with Him first.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then the Lord burdens us to pray for a certain friend.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We bring God to that friend as a royal priest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How do we bring God to him?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do it by telling him the virtues of Him who called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Virtues of Him'' means His excellence, His power, His energy, the strength of life received through the gospel that delivered us out of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As you tell your friend about His virtues, the word you speak brings faith into him Rom 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This word has the power to deliver him from darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then he will pray with you to receive the Spirit Gal 3:5 ; eventually, he will be baptized into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This gospel experience explains how we, as a holy priest, offer someone as a spiritual sacrifice to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to be the holy priesthood, the royal priesthood, and the gospel priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should always come to God to be filled with Him, bring God to people by telling out His virtues, and offer the repented sinners as spiritual sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do this not in an individual way but with others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are built up as we perform our priestly duties.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we are being built up, more priests become saved and are added to the priesthood to be built up together with us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is God's way to build up the church.</S>
