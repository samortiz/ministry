CONCERNING THE GROUND<br />OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE&rsquo;S LIVING AND WORK</h2><p>Before we consider 7:13-29, let us review what has already been covered in this constitution. We must be deeply impressed with the fact that the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is based upon the divine life and nature of the kingdom people. We need to keep in mind that the constitution of any people is always according to the life and nature of that people. No one can fulfill the requirements of this constitution unless he has been regenerated and possesses the life and nature of the heavenly Father. Those unbelieving philosophers and teachers who have quoted certain verses from Matthew 5 through 7 have not understood the words they were quoting. This constitution is not given to unbelievers. Because it is based upon the spiritual, heavenly, and divine life and nature of the kingdom people, only the kingdom people can live according to it. Moreover, not even the kingdom people can fulfill the requirements of this constitution if they do not live according to the divine nature and the divine life within them. This constitution is not given according to the natural life or to the human nature of the kingdom people. To repeat, it is formed according to the divine life and divine nature.</p><p>This constitution firstly reveals the nature of the kingdom people, as unfolded in the nine blessings in 5:3-12. Those items of the constitution that describe what the kingdom people should do and how they should act all correspond to the nature of the kingdom people. Whatever the kingdom people do is an expression of their nature. Their actions, behavior, speech, and outward deeds are the expression of their divine life and nature. What is within them is manifested in their outward behavior. The first section of the constitution, the section concerning the nature of the kingdom people, is therefore very basic. The second section covers the influence of the kingdom people upon the world, and the third deals with the law of the kingdom of the heavens. As we have seen, all the complemented and changed laws expose our anger and lust. Beginning in chapter six, the constitution of the heavenly kingdom proceeds to deal with the way the kingdom people perform their righteous deeds. This portion of the constitution digs out the self and the flesh. Following this, the next section tells us that the kingdom people should live on earth without any anxiety. We are not here for anxiety, but for the fulfillment of our duty under the care of our heavenly Father. He will feed us, clothe us, and supply all our needs. Nevertheless, we must fulfill our responsibility for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s purpose, yet without anxiety. In 7:1-12 the constitution reveals the attitude we should have toward others, how we should deal with them, and how we should take care of them. By the time we reach 7:12, nearly every aspect of our living and behavior has been covered. It seems that the constitution is now complete, perfect, and all-inclusive.</p><p>However, one thing remains to be covered: the fact that the kingdom people are on earth doing the will of God our Father. Hence, in the last section there is no dealing with anger, lust, the natural being, the self, the flesh, anxiety, or our attitude toward others. Instead, in this section we read of entering the narrow gate and walking the constricted way (7:13-14). We also see that we must build a house and do the will of the heavenly Father (vv. 24-27, 21). Therefore, the conclusion of the constitution of the heavenly kingdom ushers us through the narrow gate and to the constricted way; thus we may do the will of the heavenly Father and we may build a house.</p><p>As we consider the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens as a whole, we see that it fully reveals what the kingdom people are, what they should be, and what they should do. It also reveals where they are and where they are going. It reveals that on the constricted way, we must do the will of the heavenly Father and we must build a house according to the word of the heavenly King. In the last section of the constitution there is no anger, lust, self, flesh, anxiety, nor any word about our attitude toward others. Instead, there are four crucial words: gate, way, will, and house. Here we have the narrow gate, the constricted way, the will of the heavenly Father, and the house built upon the rock, which is the wise word of the heavenly King. If we are not the people described in the nine blessings and if we are not those fulfilling the complemented and changed laws, we cannot enter through the narrow gate, walk on the constricted way, do the will of the heavenly Father, or build a house on the rock. Thus, this last section is the consummation of the constitution.</p>
