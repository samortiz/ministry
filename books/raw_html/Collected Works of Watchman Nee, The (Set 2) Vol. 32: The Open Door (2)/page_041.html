<h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Brother Kwang-hsi:</p><p>May you be greatly strengthened and graced! From The Open Door I have realized that you are constantly engaged in outdoor evangelistic work. My heart is greatly comforted by this. We preach the gospel here once, twice, or three times a week. But I would say that what you are doing is the real gospel preaching. I only ask that the Lord would give us more time to pray. If we need one or two hours to prepare in prayer for a message to believers, we need at least three or four hours to prepare ourselves in prayer for a message to unbelievers. If you agree with this, please pray for me. Brother Leland Wang has returned to Hong Kong. Sister Ding is in Sitiawan, and Brother Wilson is here. He meets often at the Gospel Hall and preaches here five or six times. The Lord has used him. Thank the Lord! Peace be to you! Greetings to all the co-workers.</p><p>Brother Faithful Luk, August 12</p><h2 class="head2">Cebu, Malaysia</h2><p>Sister Lee in the Lord:</p><p>The work here has been much blessed, and many people are seeking after the truth. The Lord has moved the heart of Mr. X in the parish, who is now quite sympathetic towards our work. He is reading many of the books from the Gospel Book Room. I have only read half of Rethinking Our Work, but he has read it all. Except for the Lord's work through this person, I would not have been able to stay here. I have practically traveled through this whole place. I still look to the Lord for His leading in the future. Please do not forget to pray for the work, for Mr. X, and for me. I feel very weak and in need of perfection. The Lord willing, I will go to Singapore to receive help from the brothers and sisters. Bible Studies for Beginners is very suitable for our use here. Every time I buy some copies, they are distributed quickly. A month ago a few elderly brothers asked me to help them study the Bible at my sister's home. May the Lord bless this book.</p><p>Sister Hwang Bi-gwe</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Hsu Jung-jieh,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>Dear Sister Ruth in the Lord:</p><p>...I went with Brother Hu to Li-Suh with no other intention than to observe the situation. Thank the Lord that He has shown me some light concerning the future of the work. Both Brother Hu and I have the same leading and have decided to advance to Sikang through the upper tributary of Nu River. The natives around Nu River (a branch of the eastern tribe) are more zealous for the Lord's gospel than the natives of Li-Suh. These natives from the Nu River have invited Brother Hu to work there. (They are also part of the fruit of Brother Hu's former work.) However, we have decided that we will not do anything more than testify among them. We want to go to Gung-Shan County at the upper course of the Nu River and preach the gospel, because the gospel has not reached that part yet. If the Lord grants us the grace, a few local churches will be set up to shine for the Lord, and all the Nu natives in search of the truth will come and turn to the Lord. However, the journey is full of danger, and we need your prayer. In traveling to Li-Suh, we had to cut through wild mountains, shrubs, and forests. The paths are narrow, winding, and difficult to access. Sometimes we have to cross water, and sometimes we have to climb up cliffs with the help of creeping tendrils. Sometimes the rain washes away the roads, and we have to crawl along precipitous cliffs. The danger is great. We heard that the Nu River is more dangerous than the terrain. Whenever I travel along the mountain paths, I think of our Lord seeking for lost sheep. Then my strength is renewed, and I thank the Lord for His great grace. In two or three weeks I will begin the journey with Brother Hu. Part of Sikang province, east of the Jin-Sha River, is under the jurisdiction of Szechuan province. There are altogether eight or nine counties here. The area west of the Jin-Sha River is under the jurisdiction of the Tibetan government. Han Chinese who enter Tibetan land must pass through checkpoints, just as Westerners do. The procedure is quite troublesome. However, Tibetan merchants traveling to Yunnan do not need to pass through checkpoints; there is a great difference. I heard that Han merchants doing business in Tibet do not encounter much trouble. The only kind of people who encounter troubles are those who do not have a job and who carry propaganda materials. Therefore, it is not easy for us to enter Tibet and the Tibetan-ruled Sikang region to preach the gospel there. The Lama religion exercises great influence over this area, and there are obstacles everywhere. We ask that the brothers and sisters pray much for us. Peace to you in the Lord. My greetings to Sisters Wang and Chang.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, July 9</p>
