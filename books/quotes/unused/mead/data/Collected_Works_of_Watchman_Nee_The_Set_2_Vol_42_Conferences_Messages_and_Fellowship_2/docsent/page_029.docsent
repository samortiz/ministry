   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD IS SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: What does it mean to say that God is Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Answer: God is Spirit, but this does not mean that all spirits are God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is like saying that Brother Luk is a man, but this does not mean that all men are Brother Luk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>MATTHEW 5:28</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Question: What does Matthew 5:28 mean?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Answer: Matthew 5:28 says, "Every one who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It does not say "every one who sees," but "every one who looks."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Seeing is unintentional, whereas looking is intentional.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is a difference between seeing a person on the street and looking at him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Seeing him is unintentional, but looking at him is intentional.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is a sin to look at a woman for the purpose of lusting after her.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today the temptation of looking at a woman on the street is great because many women do not dress or walk properly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This can be a constant temptation to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While one is walking on the street, he naturally sees many women, but there is no need to consciously look at them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Seeing women is unavoidable, but looking at them involves the will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first glance is unintentional, but the second look is intentional; it constitutes adultery in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You cannot stop a bird from flying over your head, but you can stop it from building a nest on your head.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first glance does not involve the will; it is unintentional.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The second glance, however, involves the will; it is intentional and constitutes a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>DEALING WITH THE THOUGHTS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Question: How can we overcome our thoughts?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Answer: Satan knows us more than we know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our words and actions originate from our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many people say that their words are unintentional.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, however, everything we say is intentional, but the intention may be hidden in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thoughts that exist within will eventually be expressed in words Matt 12:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a Christian cannot control his thoughts, he has failed already.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are very few believers who have overcome their thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every temptation must first be translated into a thought before it will lodge itself in a person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to reject temptations, we must first reject the thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can we overcome our thoughts?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First, we must, as Romans 8:6 says, set the mind positively on the things of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second, we have to reject all wandering thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not reject wandering thoughts, they will eventually become sinful thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our thoughts are prone to wander when we pray, but at other times they wander also.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A brother asked me what he should do when he found his thoughts straying and when he was unable to concentrate as he prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I asked whether his thoughts wandered all over the world when he was not praying.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He admitted that they did.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is where the problem lies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If our thoughts are always wandering, it will be hard to keep our thoughts from straying and to concentrate in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to deal with wandering thoughts, we first have to ask the Lord to cover our thoughts with His precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should apply the weapon mentioned in Ephesians 6.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people do not wear any helmet on their head.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a result their thoughts tend to wander.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our whole body needs to be equipped, but we need more on our head than on any other part.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A helmet cannot be used as a weapon, but it can protect the head from attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, there is another problem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some say, "The more I reject wandering thoughts, the more they come and the more confused I become.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What should I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When this happens, we must not be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Remember that Satan will not persist.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When Moses went to Pharaoh, there were two Egyptian magicians 2 Tim 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Aaron turned a staff into a snake, and the two magicians did the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Aaron turned water into blood, and they did the same.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Aaron caused frogs to come to the land of Egypt, and they did the same.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But when Aaron struck the dust and turned it into lice, they could not do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Satan's temptations do not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we persist and are not discouraged, Satan will soon be stripped of his power.</S>
