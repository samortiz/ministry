In the very beginning of the Scriptures there is the thought of life and building and the thought that life is for the building of God
In this flow of living water there are the precious materials for God's building: gold, bdellium , and onyx stone
In the entire Scriptures there is much concerning building, so we can say that the Scriptures are a record of building
As we have seen, at the beginning of the Scriptures there is the garden of Eden, while at the end of the Scriptures there is a city
It is only after His work through all the generations is completed that God will have not merely a garden but a building
In God's creation He did a work with His hands, not with Himself, but in His building God works with Himself as the material
As merely a part of God's creation we have nothing of God within us, but as a part of God's building we have something of God within us
If we do not have anything of God within us, we are not a part of His building; we are merely a part of His creation
The incarnated Lord is a tabernacle, a building of the divine material mingled together with the human material
Christ as the Savior, who is God incarnated as a man, is the building, the mingling, of divinity with humanity, a building of God with man
One signifies the one God, while four is the number of the creatures, such as the four living creatures in Revelation 4:6-8
As the real 'five,' Christ is the God-man, God mingled with man, who bears the responsibility for us before God
Just as the ark had three stories, the tabernacle had three parts-the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies
The width of the boards of the tabernacle was one and a half cubits; two boards matched together equaled three cubits
His body was a temple, the house of God which the Jewish people destroyed, but the Lord rose up again after three days
The principle of the Lord being a building is that God mingles Himself with humanity, and this is the principle of God's building in general
We may speak much concerning the building of the church, but we must realize that the building is the mingling of God with man
Even if we could be built in this way, that would not be the building of God; it would merely be a building of people
In the New Jerusalem we can find items related to Noah's ark, to the tabernacle of Moses, and to Solomon's temple with the old Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem contains the names of the twelve tribes of Israel and the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb
The New Jerusalem is a full picture of the mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed creatures, the mingling of divinity with humanity
My intention, however, is not to preach away the heavenly mansions but to help the children of God know what the real building of God is
The habitation of God in eternity is His divine building, the New Jerusalem, the mingling of divinity with humanity
The central and divine thought of the Scriptures is that God is seeking a divine building as the mingling of Himself with humanity
Before we come under such a ministry, we may have only a little of Christ, but after we come, we gain much Christ
Husbands should love their wives, and wives should submit to their husbands, but for husbands merely to love their wives means little
Both the love of the husbands and the submission of the wives must be the mingling of Christ with man, that is, the divine building
After the completion of God's creation in Genesis 2, there was the garden of Eden, in which God placed the man created by Him
God placed man before the tree of life because God's intention was to build man with God by his experience of God as life
With the tree of life, there was a flowing river, and in the flow of the river there were precious materials for the building
In the last two chapters of Revelation there is a city built up with these precious materials, a city of gold, pearl, and precious stones
The entire Scriptures reveal these two works of God, the work of creation and the work of building God into man and man into God
In speaking of the gate of heaven, he indicated that heaven was open, and there was the possibility for people to enter into it
God is desirous to come to earth because earth has been corrupted, usurped, and occupied in a wrong way by the enemy of God
In 1:51, the Lord said that the angels of God ascend and descend not upon the Son of God but upon the Son of Man
That stone, which was Bethel, the house of God, was the resting place of the wanderer where he could lay his head
Not only the place, but the stone which had oil poured upon it, the pillow upon which man rested, is a Bethel, the house of God
That is why in Jacob's dream there was first the stone as the material and then the house of God, the building
When we come to the Lord, we are living stones who are being built up as a spiritual house in the Spirit, by the Spirit, and with the Spirit
When He pours Himself upon us, we with the oil become Bethel, the house of God, the temple of God in which the Spirit of God dwells
These perplexing 'ins' tell us that because Christ is in the Father and we are in Christ, we are in the Father
He is the heavenly ladder to join heaven with earth and unite earth with heaven, that is, to mingle God and us, us and God, with one another
The Old Testament speaks not of the house of Abraham or the house of Isaac but of the house of Jacob, the house of Israel
They will sense the opening of heaven with a ladder and something ascending from the earth and descending from heaven
If we are mingled with God, then even if we sit silently without praying or shouting, people will sense the presence of God
They will realize the opening of heaven and Bethel, the house of God on earth with a vertical way to bring God to man and man to God
When we stepped into the meeting, no one dared to talk in a loose way, because the presence of the Lord caused people to be reverent
As we have seen, God has two sections of His work according to His plan, the work of creation and the work of building
At the end of the Scriptures, these three items-gold, pearl, and precious stones-are built together in the city
The entire city of New Jerusalem is of gold, the gates are pearl, and the foundations of the wall are precious stones
All the above show us that in the whole universe according to Gods plan there are only two sections of the divine work creation and building
Now we know the principle of God's building, and we know what God's work is in these days, the period, the age, of building
When the cement is put into the water and the stones are put into the cement, the stones are bound together by the cement and water
God and man, man and God, were never mingled as one until the day that God Himself was incarnated to be born in a manger as a man
Jacob poured oil upon the stone which he had used as his pillow, and he called it a building, Bethel, the house of God
The second story reveals the purpose of the Lord's coming to be life to us; it is for the building of the house of God
In the consummation of John's writings there is a building, the New Jerusalem, which is built up with God mingled with man
Between us and God there would be a great distance, a great separation, comprised of the world, Satan, the flesh, lust, and other matters
By His death and resurrection, Christ eliminated the distance and prepared the way to bring us near to God and into God
He takes away everything that is a barrier or hindrance between us and God to bring us near to God and into God
Now after His resurrection, He can say not only that He is in God and God is in Him but that we also are in Him and He is in us
Every believer, every regenerated and saved person, is a member of the mystical Body of Christ and an abode in the Father's house, the Body
In order to understand the first part of chapter fourteen, we need to take the context of the entire book of John
The Lord has brought God into us and us into God to make God one with us and us one with God, to build God into us and to build us into God
If we take all the works of this writer, we can find the correct meaning of his writings, which is life for the building
When they are cut off the vine, they are many separated branches, but when they abide in the vine, they are all one in the vine
In all the New Testament, John 17 is the unique chapter that deals with the oneness of the church, the Body of Christ
Three brothers-a Cantonese brother, a Mandarin brother, and a modern American brother-cannot always be one; they are three different persons
At other times a brother may be stubborn in his peculiar mentality; then the other brothers are frightened of him
When we deny ourselves, we are in the Spirit, and when another brother denies himself, he is in the same Spirit
If we all do this the issue will be that we are all in the resurrection of the Lord we are all in the Spirit and we are all one in the Lord
The Lord will come out, not according to you, me, or anyone else, but according to Himself, the crucified and resurrected Lord
The more teachings we have, the more divisions we have, and the more discussions we have, the more opinions and the more divisions we have
The oneness of the divine building is possible only by our experience of the death and resurrection of the Lord
The divine building is the one Body, the one church, the one Bethel, the one corporate testimony of the Lord Himself
By incarnation He came to impart Himself to man, and by His death and resurrection He went back to God to bring man into Himself
After God's creation, what God has always been doing is to build Himself with man and to build man with Himself
In other words, by His incarnation He worked God into man, and by his death and resurrection he worked man into God
The issue, the result, of the Lord coming to be life to us is that we become the abode of the Lord, and the Lord becomes the abode for us
The Lord and we, we and the Lord, are built together as a divine building to be the mutual abode of God and man
Gold, silver, and precious stones are not two items or four but three, because they correspond to the three of the Triune God
Silver, the second item of the precious materials, is related to the work and person of the second of the Triune God
The third item, the precious stones, signifies the transforming work of the Holy Spirit, the third of the Triune God
It is with none other than God the Father as the gold, God the Son as the silver, and God the Spirit as the precious stones
When a small grain of sand wounds an oyster and stays in the wound, a pearl is 'regenerated' by the secretion from the oyster
Eventually, we are not only redeemed but also regenerated through redemption; that is, we have the silver, but we eventually become pearl
The material with which we build up the believers and the church is the Triune God-God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit
God's intention is to make Himself everything to us, to become our very nature to make us the embodiment of God Himself
The proper teaching for the building up of the church brings people into the Triune God to build the Triune God into people
According to Ephesians 41316 the proper way to build up the Body is to realize the Head Christ and to have the Body life the church life
In principle, all the Epistles without exception speak of building the believers as the church with the Triune God as the material
To build up the believers is to impart and minister Christ into the believers, to work Christ more and more into them
The true Christian teaching is not to teach people to do this or not to do that; it is to minister Christ to people
The Epistles of the New Testament are books that are full of the ministry of Christ; they minister Christ to people
The proper way to build up the believers and build up the church is not by teachings or by anything else, but by the Triune God
He told us that the Lord is the living stone and that we also are living stones being built up together in the Lord to be a spiritual house
When we go to visit and fellowship with the saints, we will know what to minister and with what we should minister
We need to realize that we build up the believers and the church not by anything other than the Triune God Himself
Every item of the Lord in the Gospel of John is in the New Jerusalem as the all-inclusive embodiment of what the Lord Jesus is
The ultimate picture in the record of the entire holy Scriptures is a building as the embodiment of all that Christ is
It is a building, a living composition, of all the redeemed ones composed together in God, through Christ, and with the Holy Spirit
Hebrews 11:40 says, 'Because God has provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect'
The Old Testament saints can be compared to a body; without legs, arms, and hands it could not be a perfect body
Rather, the redeemed ones are the composition of this holy city, and this holy city is the composition of all the redeemed ones
The church of the firstborn is the composition of the New Testament saints, who have been enrolled in the heavens
If we read these verses carefully, however, we can realize that these items are the 'bricks' of the same building
