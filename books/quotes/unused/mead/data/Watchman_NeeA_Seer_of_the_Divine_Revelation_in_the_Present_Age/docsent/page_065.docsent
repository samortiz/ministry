   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Impressed with Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whenever Watchman Nee was asked a question, his answer was always practical, to the point, clear, full of anointing, and filled with light.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His manner was very normal and open, and he was easy to approach.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He had a great capacity and a broad heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In spiritual matters, he climbed to the heights and touched the depths.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning God's principle and purpose, he was very rich in understanding and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was frequently misunderstood and evil spoken of, but he never attempted to explain or vindicate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once when asked why he would not make some effort to explain so as to avoid being misunderstood, he replied, "Brothers, if people trust us, there is no need to explain; if people do not trust us, there is no use in explaining."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only would he not explain or vindicate when being backbitten; he would not reason or argue even when rebuked to his face.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He belittled the matter of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Substantial amounts of money passed through his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was entrusted with large amounts to distribute in the Lord's work, and he also earned large sums in his business.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet, while receiving with one hand, he would distribute with the other.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On one occasion he said, "I believe that among the co-workers in China, I am the one who most frequently spends the last dollar."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was surely so.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All those close to him knew that he was often empty-handed, keeping nothing for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But for the Lord's work and for the need of the church, he would give anything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>BY A CLOSE ASSOCIATE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The following is the testimony of a close associate of Watchman Nee, Dr. Chang Yu-lan, who was a leading brother in the church in Taipei, Taiwan:</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Impression of Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Watchman Nee arrived in Chungking on March 6, 1945, and three days later attended a love feast to which he had been invited by the church in Chungking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He stayed in my home for ten days, and we continued to see each other for over a year.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Later he moved to a place nearby called Little Lung-kan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some of us would go to his home once or twice a week for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This continued for over six months.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I would always have some questions prepared and would ask them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His answers solved many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He always left a very sweet impression, yet one did not lose the sense of respect.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His attitude was gentle and meek, and his words were full of anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In conversation with him, there was no sense of distance but a sense of being watered and supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Frequently seven or eight brothers and sisters would surround him, talking and asking questions for several hours, but he never showed tiredness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The impression left by his words and manner are unforgettable.</S>
