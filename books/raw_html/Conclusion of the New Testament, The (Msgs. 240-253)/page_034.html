 <h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM<br />
ITS REALITY, ITS NATURE, ITS EXPRESSION,<br />
ITS RELATION TO GOD&rsquo;S GLORY,<br />
 AND ITS UNSHAKABLENESS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover one other aspect of the kingdom in its expression in the divine attributes and with human virtues&mdash;the shining as the light. Then we shall go on to consider the kingdom in its relation to God&rsquo;s glory and in its unshakableness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Shining as the Light</h2>
<p>In Matthew 5:14-16 we see that the kingdom is expressed in its shining as the light. In verse 14a the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;You are the light of the world,&rdquo; Here we see that the people of the kingdom of the heavens live a kingdom life to shine in the darkness of the world. The world, Satan&rsquo;s system, the dark human society, needs light. To the darkened world, the people of the kingdom of the heavens are a light effacing its darkness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Over the Outsiders as a City Situated<br />
upon a Mountain That Cannot Be Hidden</h2>
<p>In 5:14b the Lord Jesus goes on to say, &ldquo;A city situated upon a mountain cannot be hidden.&rdquo; As the shining light, the kingdom people are like a city situated upon a mountain. Such a city cannot be hidden. Ultimately, this city will be consummated in the holy city of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:10-11, 23-24).</p>
<p>The light in Matthew 5:14 is not an individual person; on the contrary, it is a corporate city. This indicates that the kingdom people need the building. If we are in the building of the church in a practical way, we shall realize that only by being built together can we be a city situated upon a mountain. This city becomes a shining light. If the saints in the church in your locality are not built up but instead are scattered, divided, and separated, there is no city there. And as long as there is no city, there is no light, because the city is the light. The light is not an individual believer; it is a corporate city built up as one entity to shine over the people surrounding it. In order to shine upon others, we need to be built up as a city upon the mountaintop. For this, we need to keep the oneness and remain one entity, a corporate Body. Then we shall be a shining light as the expression of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Over Those Who Are in the House<br />
as a Lamp on the Lampstand</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:15 says, &ldquo;Neither do men light a lamp and place it under the bushel, but on the lampstand, and it shines to all who are in the house.&rdquo; The shining of the light has two aspects: the outward aspect and the inward aspect. The light as a city on a mountain shines over the outsiders, whereas the lighted lamp on the lampstand shines over those who are in the house. As the city, the light shines upon people, but as the lamp in the house, the light shines into people. This indicates that our influence over others should not be just outward but also inward.</p>
<p>In order to be a lamp shining into others, we need to be without any covering. As the lamp on the lampstand, the light should not be hidden. This is the reason the Lord Jesus speaks about placing the lamp under a bushel. A lighted lamp under a bushel cannot shine out its light. Therefore, the kingdom people as the lighted lamp should not be covered by a bushel, an item pertaining to eating, a matter which causes anxiety (Matt. 6:25). Hiding the lamp under the bushel indicates anxiety concerning our living. If we are anxious about our living, this anxiety will become a bushel covering our light. Instead of being covered by the bushel, we must be on the lampstand. If we live without anxiety concerning our existence, caring only for Christ and the church, we shall touch the hearts of others and shine into them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. For the Glorification of the Father<br />
Who Is in the Heavens</h2>
<p>Eventually, our shining will be for the glorification of the Father, for it will give glory to Him. Concerning this, the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Thus let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens&rdquo; (Matt. 5:16). As regenerated children of God (John 1:12; Gal. 4:6), we should have good works. These good works are the behavior of the kingdom people through which others may see God and be brought to Him.</p>
<p>Our shining will glorify the Father because it expresses what God is. To glorify the Father is to give Him the glory. Glory is God expressed. When the kingdom people express God in their behavior and good works, others see God and give glory to God.</p>
<p>God hidden is God Himself. But when God is expressed, that is the glory of God. If as the kingdom people we have such a shining light, God will be expressed in this shining, and all those around us will see the glory, God expressed. When others see God in our shining, that is the glory of God. Therefore, the shining of the kingdom as light is for the glorification of the Father.</p>
