<P>John 5 tells us that whether or not we are in the tomb, we all are dead persons; but the Lord comes to us that we may have life. Moreover, His life is transmitted into us by His word. If we receive His word and believe the One who sent Him, we receive Him as life, which transfers us out of death into eternal life (v. 24). Again, this is the transmission, the impartation, the dispensing, of the Triune God as life in the Son into us.</P><P>In John 6 the Lord said that He is the bread of life (vv. 35, 48), the bread from heaven, and the living bread (v. 51). If we are thirsty, we must drink of Him, and if we are hungry, we must eat of Him. Those who heard the Lord's word in John 6 did not understand Him (v. 60). Therefore, He said, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" (v. 63). When we hear the Lord's speaking, we spontaneously receive the dispensing of Christ as God into us. After we sit in a meeting that is full of the Lord's speaking, we are filled with this dispensing.</P><P>John 7:37-39 says, "Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified." The drinking of the living water is God's dispensing.</P><P>In John 8:12 Jesus said, "I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." Light is for dispensing. Trees that receive adequate sunshine grow and blossom well, but a tree planted in the shade may not grow well because it does not receive the dispensing of the sunshine.</P><P>In John 9 a blind man came to the Lord Jesus. The Lord spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay (v. 6). The blind man received his sight (v. 7), and through his sight he received light. This was a receiving of the divine dispensing.</P><P>In John 10:1-9 the Lord Jesus said that He is the door of the sheepfold. On the positive side, the sheepfold keeps the sheep. It covers them in the winter and protects them at night, and it guards them from wolves. However, the sheepfold also keeps the sheep in a negative way from enjoying the pasture. Christ came to open the fold and call the sheep to follow Him out of the fold to receive sunshine and fresh air and to drink the fresh water and eat the green grass in the pasture. Christ is the real sunshine, air, water, and green grass. He is the pasture. This again is the dispensing of the Divine Trinity into His chosen people.</P>
