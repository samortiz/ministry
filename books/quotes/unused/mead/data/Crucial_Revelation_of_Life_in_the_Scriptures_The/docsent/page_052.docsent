   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Definition of Death</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Death always goes with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Death is the issue of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sin is the cause and death is the effect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we have sin, death is there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Death is the shortage of ability to fulfill God's requirements according to His divine standard.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God requires that we honor our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we cannot honor our parents, that is death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the eyes of God, death is with us because we cannot fulfill His requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord also tells us, "You shall be holy, because I am holy" 1 Pet 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we cannot be holy, this means that we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God wants us to be diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are sloppy, this is death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God requires that we be watchful, but we may always be sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that we are short of the ability to fulfill God's requirements and that death is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God desires that we be careful persons, but we may be careless day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many young brothers may seem to be living, but actually they are dead because they are short of the ability to fulfill God's requirements according to His divine standard.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Pattern of the Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From 1920 through 1925, the Lord did something miraculous in China by saving a number of college and high school students.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During that time a real change was taking place in China due to the young generation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Their concept was being revolutionized with the thought that man has to be free.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Chinese people had many teachings, customs, habits, traditions, and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Young people in the early 1920s in China desired to abandon these regulations so that they could be free.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the 1920s in China a young person was required to rise up when an older person entered the room.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A teenager did not have the freedom to say anything in the presence of his elders, and he could not sit down until they left his presence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was under this kind of environment that we young people in China were saved by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of the desire to be free from regulations, some who were saved had the concept that Jesus never regulated others and that He was not under any regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To them real freedom meant no regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, however, to have no regulations is looseness and death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By reading the Scriptures, we can see that the Lord Jesus was a very careful person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was neither sloppy nor loose.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Gospels give us a record of the Lord's feeding five thousand people at one time Matt 14:14-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These people were enjoying the Lord's teaching, but the hour became late, and they became hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The disciples asked the Lord to dismiss the people so that they could go and get something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But the Lord charged the disciples, "You give them something to eat" Mark 6:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Gospels record the miracle of the Lord's feeding five thousand with only five loaves and two fish, but we can also see that the Lord did everything in a very careful way and in a good order.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The disciples presented the Lord Jesus with the loaves and the fish, and He told the disciples to have the people sit down in companies of hundreds and fifties John 6:10; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Mark 6:39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows how orderly the Lord Jesus was.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before the people ate, He required that they sit down in an orderly way in companies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After such a great miracle of feeding the five thousand, the Lord Jesus instructed the disciples to pick up what was left over of the bread and of the fish.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Mark 6:43 tells us that the disciples "took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we were there with the disciples, we probably would not care about the fragments of bread and of fish.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the Lord Jesus was not careless.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When He was on this earth, He was so orderly and did everything in a careful way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God's creation testifies of His orderliness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is nothing chaotic about God's creation, but everything is in order.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our Need to Be Saved in His Life</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are sloppy, careless, or loose, this proves that we cannot fulfill God's requirements according to His divine standard, so death is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to be saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need His life so that we can be living, capable, and full of energy and ability to fulfill God's requirements according to His divine standard.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be living does not mean that we are merely active or lively but that we are able to fulfill God's requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is good for us to say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But suppose that God wants us to be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we cannot be quiet, that means that death is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we are required to be at certain places on time and cannot be there on time, this is death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The shortage of ability to be on time means that death is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the Lord tells us to jump and shout, we should be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the Lord wants us to be quiet, we need to be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our being one with the Lord proves that we are full of life because we are full of the ability and capability to fulfill the Lord's requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we are short of the ability to fulfill God's requirements, that is a strong proof that we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How we all need to be saved in His life!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to have some fellowship with the Lord concerning our need to be saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In our daily life, do we have the ability to fulfill the Lord's requirements?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we do not, we are short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A shortage of ability to fulfill the Lord's requirements according to His divine standard means that we are short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It means that death is with us and that we need the Lord's life to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Much more, we shall be saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To be saved is not a matter merely of being justified, forgiven by God, and saved from the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We need to be saved from the shortage of ability to glorify Him, to please Him, and to fulfill His requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We need more life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need life abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to be saved in such a rich way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We need to bring the fellowship in this chapter to the Lord in prayer so that we can be saved in His life in our daily life.</S>
