   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When God judged Satan and the universe that was under him, God also must have judged the angels which followed him and the living beings on the earth during that age which joined him in his rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After being judged, the rebellious angels became the "wicked spirits" in the air Eph 6:12, KJV margin , and the living beings became disembodied spirits, the demons lodging in the water with which they were judged.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Though Satan, the rebellious angels, and the demons were all judged by God, they are still moving and working today, because the judgment upon them has not yet been executed.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Dan 10:20 , some fallen angels are now imprisoned unto judgment 2 Pet 2:4; Jude 6 and the demons are still the unclean and wicked spirits working on the earth Matt 12:43-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The judgment upon them all needs to be executed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has judged Satan and all his followers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But this does not mean that God executed His judgment at the time He pronounced it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To condemn is one thing; to carry out the condemnation is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God judged Satan and his followers before Adam was created, but the execution of this judgment is still going on.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The executors will be the Christians, the church, the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why hasn't the judgment on Satan and his followers been executed?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because God is waiting for the church to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Judge has made His judgment, but He is waiting for some executioners to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Revelation 12 we see that the overcomers will execute God's judgment upon Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moreover, day by day in our homes, whenever we are victorious, our victory is an execution of this judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has declared His judgment upon the rebellious one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, this judgment will not be carried out until the church rises up to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now is the time for us to execute God's judgment over Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today the church must pray to "bind the strong man" and "plunder his house" Matt 12:29 , fight against the wicked spirits in the air Eph 6:12 , and cast out the demons Matt 17:21 wherever we see them working to damage people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God has judged the demons and confined them to the water, but He needs the church to bring in the age when the sea will be terminated Rev 21:1 and the demons which are now confined therein will have the judgment executed upon them Rev 20:13: the dead in the sea cannot be human beings, but must be the demons .</S>
