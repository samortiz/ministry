         <h2 class="head1">LEADING THE SAINTS TO HAVE<br />
A GENUINE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Presently, the most urgent thing is to help the young people to have a genuine knowledge of the Spirit, because the genuine experience of life is altogether a matter in the spirit. Spiritual life is a matter of the Spirit. The Gospel of John shows that we are born of the Spirit (3:6) and that we worship the Spirit with our spirit (4:24). When we are filled with the Spirit inwardly, the words that we speak will also be spirit, flowing out unceasingly to become rivers of living water (7:38-39). Genuine spiritual experience is altogether a matter of the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;He Who Is Joined to the Lord Is One Spirit&rdquo;</h2>
<p>A few verses will strengthen the young people&rsquo;s knowledge concerning their spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; All that the Lord is doing in us is related to our being joined to Him. Our spiritual life is the issue of being joined to the Lord. Without being joined to the Lord, we could not have any spiritual experience.</p>
<p>If a person does not have the Lord, he does not have life, because the Lord is life (John 14:6). Hence, in order to have life, we must have the Lord. First John 5:12 says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; Having the Son of God means that we are in union with the Lord, but we still need to understand how we are joined to the Lord. First Corinthians 6:17 tells us clearly that being joined to the Lord is a matter of being one spirit with him. We are joined to the Lord because we are one spirit with the Lord.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 6:17 is a great verse in the Bible. Strictly speaking, when the Lord comes to us, He comes as the Spirit, not as the Father or the Son. When we present this point to others, we should be precise so that there will be no misunderstanding. The Son is in the Spirit, and the Father is in the Son. We cannot receive the Son or know the Father without the Spirit. Our receiving of the Son and our knowing of the Father is entirely a matter related to the Spirit in our spirit. Even the Lord&rsquo;s entrance into us as life is a matter in the spirit. This point is confirmed by the fact that the Holy Spirit received by the disciples in John 20:22 is spoken of in Romans 8:2 as the Spirit of life.</p>
<p>When 1 Corinthians 6:17 speaks of our union with the Lord, it is in the context of our being one spirit with Him. The Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). When He comes to us, He comes as the Spirit. Moreover, when He enters into us to be our life, He enters as the Spirit. In order for us to receive the Lord, we cannot use our mind, emotion, or will. We also cannot gain Him by striving or studying. We must use our spirit to receive Him because His being joined to us is as one spirit.</p>
<p>We do not need to give too much knowledge to the young brothers and sisters; nevertheless, we know that students in high school and college pay close attention to matters related to reason. Therefore, we need to stress this point concerning the spirit. We must show them that God wants us to be joined to Him and that it is only through a union in one spirit that we can receive God and God can become everything to us. Since God is Spirit, He comes to us as the Spirit, and when He enters into our spirit to be our life, He enters as the Spirit. Therefore, we must use our spirit to receive God as Spirit.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 6:17 does not speak of two spirits but of two spirits that have become one spirit. In other words, two spirits&mdash;God the Spirit and our human spirit&mdash;have become one spirit. When we are joined to the Lord and become one with Him, this oneness is the issue of two spirits becoming one spirit. This means that the Lord, who is the Spirit, has come into our spirit to become one with our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;If Anyone Does Not Have the Spirit of Christ,<br />
He Is Not of Him&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Romans 8:9 says, &ldquo;If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.&rdquo; If we are of Christ, we have the Spirit of Christ. Anyone who is of Christ is joined to Christ; as such, such a one surely has the Spirit of Christ in him. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; This verse does not say that the Lord is one person and that the Spirit is another person. The Lord being the Spirit means that the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself. Just as our spirit is inseparable from us, the Spirit of Christ is just Christ Himself. Romans 8:9 speaks of the Spirit of Christ rather than just Christ because it is in the context of Paul&rsquo;s speaking concerning our union with Christ. If the Lord were not the Spirit, He could not enter into us and be joined with us. Neither could we be joined to Christ and be of Him. The fact that we belong to Christ, are joined to Christ, and have become one with Christ is altogether related to the fact that the Lord is the Spirit. As the Spirit, He can enter into our human spirit so that these two spirits can become one. This is the reason that verse 9 speaks of the Spirit of Christ instead of Christ.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Christ does not refer to another person. We should not think that Christ is one person and that the Spirit of Christ is another. We must always remember that the Spirit of Christ is Christ, that Christ and the Spirit of Christ are one. Christ is God who was incarnated, who died for our sins on the cross, who resurrected from the dead, and who has entered into us. However, when He enters into us, He enters as the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit of Christ is the resurrected Christ entering into our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 speaks of our being joined to the Lord from a positive perspective, whereas Romans 8:9 speaks of our being joined to the Lord from a negative perspective, that is, that anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ is not joined to Christ and does not belong to Christ. We must present these two perspectives to the young brothers and sisters until they understand.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
