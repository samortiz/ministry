<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Being Careful That There Not<br>Be a Base Thought in Their Heart</H2><P>In verse 9 the children of Israel were warned about not having a base thought in their heart with respect to lending to the poor brothers. "Be careful that there is not within your heart a base thought like this: The seventh year, the year of release, is near; and your eye be evil against your poor brother and you do not give him anything, and he cry against you to Jehovah, and it become sin to you." For an Israelite to refuse to lend something to a poor brother because the year of release was near was for the eye of that Israelite to be evil against the poor brother.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Their Heart Not to Be<br>Displeased When the Giving Was Done</H2><P>"You must give to him, and your heart shall not be displeased when you give to him; for on account of this matter Jehovah your God will bless you in all your work and in all your undertakings" (v. 10). The children of Israel were to be happy after the giving was done, knowing that God would bless them. We today should not be displeased when giving to the poor; instead, we should be happy, knowing that God will bless us and return much more to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. The Poor Not Ceasing in the Land</H2><P>"The poor will not cease being in the land; therefore I am commanding you, saying, You must open your hand to your brother, to the needy one with you, and to the poor one with you in your land" (v. 11). There would always be the poor in the land as a test to the children of Israel.</P><P>Chapters twelve through fifteen of Deuteronomy reveal that we need to hate apostasy, avoid division, be discerning in contacting people, protect our spiritual children, and be generous in giving. We need to realize that we will never suffer loss as a result of giving to the Lord. The Lord is rich, but some of His people are poor. Thus, we need to take care of the full-timers (the Levites), the sojourners, the orphans, the widows, and the poor brothers. We all should be those who avoid division and apostasy, who contact others with discernment, who protect the spiritual children, and whose heart and hand are always open to give something to help the needy ones.</P>
