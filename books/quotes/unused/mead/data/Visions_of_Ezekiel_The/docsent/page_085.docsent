   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Life will swallow up death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Where there is the rich and deep flow of life in a local church, much death is swallowed up.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If they remained lukewarm, the Lord would spew them out of His mouth Rev 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be lukewarm is to be in a marsh.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you give up the denominations, yet you are not absolute for the proper ground of the church, you are in a marsh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may also be in the local church life and not be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That is a marsh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even the Lord cannot heal a marsh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A marsh is a neutral, halfway place, full of compromise.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not remain in a muddy, marshy situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To walk or move in a muddy, marshy situation is very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To get into a marsh is very easy, but to get out of a marsh is very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must be absolute for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church life must be a place of absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church life must likewise be a place after its kind.</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you are in the Lord's recovery, come back all the way to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not come halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you come halfway, you become a marsh, and you will have no flow, not even a trickle.</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord desires and requires absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Learn to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By being absolute you will be in the flow, and the flow will not be a trickle, but a river to swim in. Everything shall live where the river flows.</S>
