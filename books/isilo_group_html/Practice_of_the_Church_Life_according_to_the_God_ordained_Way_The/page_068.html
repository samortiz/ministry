Thus, they said that the door knocking does not work. When asked how long they had gone out, they said that they had done it for only half a year. That is too short a time. It is better to spend five years, or even fifteen years, to go out to contact people for the Lord. Surely after such a time you will gain someone.</P><P>In Matthew 25 the one-talented slave attempted to excuse himself by saying to his master, "Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow" (v. 24). To this his master replied, "Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not winnow" (v. 26). In this parable the Lord did not deny that He is strict in what He demands of His slaves for His work. The Lord recognized that to gain people is not easy.</P><P>In fishing, if the fish swallow the bait but do not take the hook today, the fisherman must go back home to study the situation and to improve the hook that he is using. Then he must go again to try to catch some fish. If the next time is a failure, he must go a third time, then a fourth time, and perhaps even a tenth time. After the tenth time, on the eleventh day he may catch ten fish. If there is a will, surely there is a way.</P><P>You must budget your time, and you must go out to contact people. You can even stay home and use your telephone, your pen, and your prayer to contact people. There is a way. Then you need to learn how to speak to people by proclaiming to them the virtues of the Lord who saved you out of darkness into His marvelous light. To tell people the virtues of this One, you need to learn by studying. Do not "take it easy." We need to realize that nothing in the Lord's service is easy.</P><P>This is the first step in the practice of the God-ordained way. I encourage you to put the points in this message into practice for one or two years. I believe that in many localities there will be a result in only six or eight months. Through your practice, the example, the model, set up by you will stir others up. Then, gradually, in your church a habit will be built up to practice the New Testament gospel priesthood.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Nourishing and Cherishing the New Believers</H2><P>The second step in the practice of the God-ordained way is to feed the new believers. In John 21:15 the Lord said to Peter, "Feed My lambs." To feed the Lord's lambs is to nourish and cherish the new believers, just as a nursing mother cherishes and nourishes her infant. In order to feed the new ones, you need to learn how to make them happy. This is to cherish them. At times nearly every child is naughty. Instead of spanking or rebuking a child, a mother should learn to make her child happy. By dancing to her child or playing with her child, a nursing mother can make her child happy. After the child has been cherished, the mother can nourish the child. Likewise, after cherishing the new believers, we can nourish them. If we do not cherish them, they may not be willing to receive the nourishment from us.</P><P>I encourage you not to take my word lightly but to put it into practice. You might have brought some new ones to the Lord, yet eventually they did not become your remaining fruit. The reason may be that you did not know how to cherish and then nourish your new ones. In caring for the new believers you must learn how to render them some genuine help concerning their physical needs. Do not use any gimmicks. Gimmicks are falsehoods. Be diligent, be honest, be loving, and be sincere in helping people. Many people have physical needs, and many have problems. By caring for them you must learn how to help them.</P><P>Again I say, take my word and go back to study. I cannot tell you yet how to do these things, because I myself have not learned adequately. You must study the situation. If a certain way does not work, find another way. Learn to fulfill your own responsibility by studying and endeavoring to find a way to do it. In a secular occupation, you dare not go again and again to your supervisor to ask him how to do your job. You yourself must find a way. If you cannot find a way, you may be sent home and may lose your job. In carrying out our service to the Lord, we are too easy on ourselves.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_067.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_069.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practice of the Church Life according to the God-ordained Way &nbsp; pg 68</div><br></body></html>
