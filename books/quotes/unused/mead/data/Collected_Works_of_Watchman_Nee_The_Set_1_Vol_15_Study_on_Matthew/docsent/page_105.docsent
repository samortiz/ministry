   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Luke 21:36 also proves that not all, but only a portion, of the church will be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The records of Luke 21 and Matthew 24 are approximately the same, but Matthew emphasizes the Lord's coming and the tribulation, whereas Luke emphasizes the destruction of Jerusalem and the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, in Matthew there are questions Matt 24:3 and also many parables.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Luke there are none of these.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning Jerusalem, at the beginning there is the persecution in A.D. 70, and at the end there will be the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Luke 21:8-9 refers to the things before the end. Verses 10-19 indicate that the believers will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verses 20-28 show how Jerusalem will be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 28 it seems that all the saints will pass through the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verses 29-33 are a parable that guarantees that there will be such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there were not such a section as verses 34-36, we could say that all the believers will be raptured after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, in verse 34 the tone changes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 35 refers to the things of the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 36 mentions the condition for escaping the great tribulation, watch and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How can we escape?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is either by death or by being raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To stand this is not in the active voice but in the passive voice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It means to be put before the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This, of course, refers to the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Death is not a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not pray and hope for death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here the condition of the rapture is to watch and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not all those who are regenerated can be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One must pray always.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What should he pray?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He should pray that he can escape all the things that will come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We often pray for clothing and food.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We never pray for being raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a man does not know the terror of the great tribulation, he will not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 36 should have the words "counted worthy."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass is not a question of grace but a question of whether or not one is worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is it to be counted worthy?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God cannot receive a person to a place to which he does not want to go the story of the eagle and the cat .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some feel that heaven would be tasteless because their hearts are snared; they are like light-air balloons that are loaded with things and cannot ascend.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, Luke 21:36 puts down the first school and the second school.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>1 The second school says that man's rapture is not determined by his behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then, we would ask, can a person be on the bed of a prostitute and be an adulterer, yet be raptured?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>2 The second school also says that "all these things" do not refer to the great tribulation but to debauchery, drunkenness, and the anxieties of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But here it says, "All these things which are about to happen."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Debauchery and drunkenness are the things of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Also, with these things, there is no question of being worthy or unworthy; one must be delivered from them in any case.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, one must watch and should not be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>C. Miscellaneous evidence: 1 Matthew 24:43 and 1 Thessalonians 5:4 indicate that there must be two raptures.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>2 Men will be raptured to different places; that is, they will go to different places: a Revelation 7:15 mentions standing before the throne of God; b Luke 21:36 speaks of standing before the Son of Man; c 1 Thessalonians 4:17 speaks of being in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, not all will be raptured, and the raptures will not take place all at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>3 Mark 13:32 records that no one knows the day on which Christ is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet we know that His coming will be after the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The reason for this difference is that the former refers to the first rapture, while the latter refers to the rapture after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FROM THOSE WHO OPPOSE SEPARATE RAPTURES</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A. The argument is that the church's rapture cannot be divided because Christ's Body cannot be fragmented.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, the Body is a figure of speech and refers to the fact that we have the same life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church is the Lord's bride.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Suppose we interpret the Body according to the letter; then today the Body is already divided.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord is in the heavens, Paul is dead, we still remain on the earth, and some are not yet born.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>B. Another argument is that the rapture is a part of redemption, and if redemption is by grace, then the rapture cannot be based on whether or not one is counted worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our escaping from the judgment is already according to grace; transfiguration the act of changing 1 Cor 15:51-52 and the rapture the act of taking are according to behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>C. These ask: "Is it not cruel to take away the church's hope?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There was never such a hope anyway; it was a false hope.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to be reminded of this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>D. These argue that 1 Corinthians 15:23 talks only about belonging to Christ; it does not speak of behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our answer is that one cannot disregard all the other verses just because of this one verse.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Moreover, this verse does not speak concerning the rapture but concerning resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They read the rapture into it, not out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>E. These ask, "How about the dead? If this is the case, they will not have to pass through the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This seems too easy for them."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We do not need to worry for God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Can the righteous God do something unrighteous?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>During the millennium, these people will suffer loss 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>F. These argue: "First Corinthians 15:50-52 says that we will all be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The word all' refers to the whole Body."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It indeed refers to all, but it does not refer to all at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For example, we will all die, but not on the same day.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>G. These contend that although there is a difference between the wheat and the tares, between wheat and wheat there is no differentiation; hence, all will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But the time of ripening is different.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There is a difference between the firstfruits and the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>H. First Thessalonians 4:15 says that those who remain "shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep." These argue that the dead will be resurrected at the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hence, the resurrection will occur after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If there is a first rapture, it must take place before the dead are resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But here it says "shall by no means."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>How then can the rapture be divided into two parts?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Verses 15 and 17 say, "We who are living, who are left remaining."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is most important and most precious.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Some say that to be living and to be left remaining mean the same thing, which is to be on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But there is no reason for such a repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The words "left remaining" indicate that there is a group that has gone first.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>These would then argue: "Since Paul said we,' would Paul consider himself among the second group, who are living, who are left remaining'?"</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Here "we" is merely a means of expression; it is like using the term "we" in our daily conversation, without actually including ourselves as one of the group.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>At any rate, Paul did not continue to live, nor did he remain.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Hence, our conclusion is that the third school is right.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Some believers will be raptured before the tribulation, and another group of believers will remain until after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The latter will suffer the trial of the tribulation.</S>
