   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE NOT A MATTER OF SIN BUT A MATTER OF "I" Scripture Reading: John 6:57; Gal 2:20; 1 Cor 15:10; Phil 1:20b-21a</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The title of this message is Not a Matter of Sin but a Matter of "I."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This statement does not sound Chinese, nor does it sound like a word from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, according to my personal experience, if you want to abide in the Lord and enjoy His life, you must understand that this is not a matter of whether you sin but of whether it is you who live.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If it is you who live, then even if you do not sin, you are still abiding in yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When it is not you who live, you are blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>ABIDING IN THE LORD NOT BEING A MATTER OF SINNING</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even if I do not sin and I am a "saint" today, I am still "I" without any change.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then this "I" will be the root of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as "I" am here, there will be trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we see this point clearly, we will abide in the Lord even when we would not like to.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If it is that you merely do not sin, it is highly possible that you are still one hundred percent in yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, while you may not sin, it is still possible that you are one hundred percent not abiding in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To abide in the Lord is not a matter of whether or not one commits sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, when one abides in the Lord, he cannot sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, not committing sin is not equal to abiding in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Confucius never heard about Christ or knew the Lord, yet he could say, "One cannot pray when he sins against heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not know anything regarding the Lord, but his ethical speech and ways were commendable.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was truly a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the age of seventy he was able to do the desires of his heart yet not transgress what was right; that is, he did not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Notwithstanding, he did not abide in the Lord and had nothing to do with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is strong proof that abiding in the Lord is altogether not a matter of sinning or not sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>REPENTANCE BEING A CHANGE OF MIND</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As natural beings we have our natural concepts from birth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, when we hear the Lord's word and the gospel of God, we remember our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Of course, this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With regard to the gospel of God, our sins certainly are a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, all those who preach the gospel always ask people to repent, and also the people themselves realize that they are sinful and consequently need to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, this kind of realization is too natural.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the light of the gospel truth, a so-called sinless person also needs repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Greek, the meaning of repent is not mainly on repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not that you have sinned and made mistakes, so you regret and correct yourself by making a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, it is that you have done something which may not have had anything to do with sinning, but afterward you still regret and correct yourself by making a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, sometimes the sisters repent after going to a store to do some shopping, even though shopping itself is something apart from sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Greek word for repent is composed of two parts: one part implies "change" and the other part means "mind."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The combination of the two means "a change of mind."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, to repent is to have a change of mind, issuing in regret.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is to have a turn in purpose.</S>
