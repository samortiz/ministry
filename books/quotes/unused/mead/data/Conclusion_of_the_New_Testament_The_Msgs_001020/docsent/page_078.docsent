   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sending the Resurrected Christ to His Chosen People</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After God poured out the consummated Spirit upon the Body of Christ, He sent the resurrected Christ back to His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Acts 3:26 speaks of this: "To you first, God, having raised up His Servant, has sent Him to bless you in turning away each one of you from your wickedness."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has sent back the resurrected and ascended Christ to the Jews first by pouring out His Spirit on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, the very consummated Spirit God poured out is the Christ God raised and exalted to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the apostles preached and ministered this Christ, the consummated Spirit was ministered to people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the time Peter spoke the word recorded in Acts 3:26, Christ as God's Servant had ascended to the heavens and was still there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nevertheless, Peter told the people that God had sent Christ to bless them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, God has received Christ into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But here Peter says that God has sent this ascended One to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In what way did God send the ascended Christ to the Jews?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God sent Him by pouring out the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That was God's way of sending the ascended Christ to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This implies that the outpoured Spirit is actually the ascended Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the outpoured Spirit came to the people, that was Christ, the ascended One, sent by God to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From this we see that the poured-out Spirit is identical to the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In God's economy for the experience of His people, the ascended Christ and the poured-out Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In God's economy Christ and the Spirit are one for the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us and for our enjoyment of this dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have heard much that God will send Christ back in the future, at the time of the second advent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But according to Acts 3:26, God has already sent back the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First He was sent to the Jews and then to Gentiles throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first time Christ was sent by God He was sent in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After His ascension He was sent back by God as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ today is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the all-inclusive Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost, that was God's sending of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The outpouring of the Spirit was the descension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In chapter two of Acts the Spirit was poured out, and Peter received this outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then in chapter three Peter says that God has sent Christ back to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God honored Christ, glorified Christ, and sent Him back.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even while Peter was speaking to the people, Christ was there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was present not as the Christ in the flesh but as the pneumatic Christ, who is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, as part of His work, God has sent the resurrected Christ to His chosen people as the Spirit.</S>
