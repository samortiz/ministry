   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a Sphere</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This matter of dominion includes a sphere or a realm.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are three points related to this sphere:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 Over All Things in the Seas</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man must have dominion over the seas.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The seas are the lodging place of the demons Matt 8:32; 12:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the sphere of God's dominion must include the seas.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2 Over All Things in the Air</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man must have dominion over all things in the air, which is the place where Satan and his angels are Eph 2:2; 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are evil powers in the air with Satan as their head.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ephesians 2:2 describes Satan as the prince of the power of the air.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3 Over All Things on the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man must have dominion over all things on the earth, the field of Satan's activities.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Satan is very active on the earth Luke 4:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>So, here in Genesis 1:26 it especially says that man may have the dominion "over all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The earth has been usurped by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, it needs to be ruled over by man, God's representative.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Remember that the sphere of God's dominion which He committed to man includes three sections: the seas, the dwelling place of the demons; the air, the place where Satan and his angels are; the earth, the field of Satan's activities.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, He had to deal with Satan, fallen angels, or demons wherever He went.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That was why the Lord Jesus rebuked the wind and the waves during a storm.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The wind came from the fallen angels in the air and the waves came from the demons in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord told the wind, "Stop" and the waves, "Be calm."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Immediately the wind ceased and the waves were calm.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fallen angels and the demons were subdued and overruled by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we know how to read the Bible, we will see in the four Gospels that the Lord Jesus exercised God's authority over the seas, the air, and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the sphere of God's dominion which He committed to man.</S>
