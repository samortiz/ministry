<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: 1 Tim. 2:6</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The condition of &ldquo;all&rdquo;
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This &ldquo;all&rdquo; refers to all men on this earth.</li>
	<li>All men have sinned, and have been condemned by God&rsquo;s righteous laws. So the condition of men is that they are under the condemnation of the law.</li>
	<li>Since men are under the condemnation of the law, men are sentenced to perdition.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;A ransom for all&rdquo;
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jesus Christ is the ransom for all. He gave Himself to become the ransom for all.</li>
	<li>Jesus is God-become-man coming to be man&rsquo;s Savior.</li>
	<li>As man&rsquo;s Savior, Jesus has redeemed man from the condemnation of the law and delivered him out of perdition.</li>
	<li>Jesus redeemed man by giving Himself, that is His soul-life, as a ransom.</li>
	<li>The blood Jesus shed on the cross is the ransom for all so that man may be freed from the condemnation of the law and from perdition.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to partake of Jesus&rsquo; ransom<br />
