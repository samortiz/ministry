   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the Lord's talk with the disciples recorded in John 14 16 and His prayer in John 17, He went to Gethsemane and was arrested there in the same night.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was then judged and sentenced to death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was crucified and buried and after three days He resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In His glorification, that is, in His resurrection, Jesus as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit of God in creation was the Spirit of Jehovah in His contact with man, and the Spirit of Jehovah in God's contact with man was the Holy Spirit in Jesus' conception and birth.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No doubt, the divine element was in the Spirit of God, but there was no humanity, no human living, and nothing of His all-inclusive death and powerful resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After Jesus' resurrection, after He was glorified, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the glorified Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now in this Spirit there is divinity, God's divine element, and also humanity, the human element.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first four books of the New Testament are on the Son with the Father by the Spirit, but the next twenty-two books are on the Spirit, who is the compound of the Triune God, of the proper man, of the proper human living, of the death of Christ, and of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
