   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNOWING CHRIST ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some regret that they were born too late.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They think that it would be wonderful if they had been born two thousand years ago because they could have seen Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But I tell such ones that I would not exchange places with Peter even if I could.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although I am quite insignificant, I can say humbly that I know much more than Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Peter only knew a Christ in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But I know the Lord who lives within me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was in Europe, I passed through the Mediterranean Sea and was approaching Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A friend invited me to visit the holy land, but I declined the invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I asked myself, "Can a man increase his knowledge of Christ by visiting Golgotha, the garden of Gethsemane, or Sychar?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Absolutely not!"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That was why I declined to go.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul said, "Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer" 2 Cor 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today we do not know Christ according to the flesh or outward appearance, but according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 8 tells us clearly that those who do not have the Spirit of Christ have nothing to do with Christ v. 9 . Who are the sons of God? They are those who have become God's many sons through His unique begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has neither female nor male offspring.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can be His sons today because we are in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We become the many sons in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All of God's children in the Bible are male.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second Corinthians 6:18 does say that God is our Father and that we are His sons and daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But this verse does not speak of our position in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why it says "sons and daughters," not "sons."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Christ there is no male or female.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Christ we are all sons of God, and we have all received the life of God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The life of God's Son within us has made us His many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The life within the sisters is the same as the life within the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 1:12 says, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Receiving refers specifically to receiving God's life; it does not refer to sinners receiving Christ as Savior for their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, it refers to sinners receiving God's life to become His children.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This verse has been borrowed by many for a long time and has been misused for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Tonight we have to claim it back.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let us summarize what we have covered tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The blood and the cross deal with man as a sinner, whereas the flesh deals with man as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord's blood deals with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is before God and it is a vicarious work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is objective, and it is for cleansing, forgiveness, and justification.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It deals with the negative things, and we receive it through believing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The cross deals with the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is something done within man, and it is the Lord's identification work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is subjective, and it is for removing and cutting off the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It also deals with negative things, and it is accomplished through our believing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These two items remove all the barriers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Finally, the Lord's flesh deals with the person; it is for the dispensing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is something done within man, through which the Lord releases His life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is subjective, and it is for liberation, supply, sustenance, and reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is on the positive side, and we receive it also through believing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is for the accomplishing of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must learn to thank and praise the Lord even more, because all of God's works have been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Tomorrow night we will talk about the way to receive Christ's life in a subjective way.</S>
