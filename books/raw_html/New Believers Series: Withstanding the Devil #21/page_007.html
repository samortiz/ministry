<P>An even clearer example can be seen in Matthew 8, when the Lord Jesus ordered the disciples to depart to the other side of the sea. He knew that powerful demons had to be cast out on the other side of the sea. After He and the disciples stepped into the boat, suddenly a great tempest arose in the sea so that the boat was covered by the waves. The Lord was asleep. The disciples came near and roused Him, saying, "Lord, save us; we are perishing!" (v. 25). A few of the disciples were fishermen; they were very experienced sailors. However, they realized that the waves were more than they could handle. The Lord Jesus rebuked their little faith; then He rose and rebuked the winds and the sea. The winds and the sea have no personality of their own, yet the Lord rebuked them because the devil was behind them. Satan had stirred up the winds and the waves.</P><P>In conclusion, Satan not only attacks our body, our conscience, and our mind, but also attacks us through our environment.</P><P>How should we react to Satan's attack in the environment?</P><P>First, we must humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God. Both James 4 and 1 Peter 5 tell us to withstand Satan. These two portions also tell us to humble ourselves before God. When Satan attacks us in the environment, our first reaction should be to submit to God. We cannot withstand the devil if we do not submit to God. Our conscience will condemn us if we withstand the devil without submitting to God. Therefore, our first reaction should be to submit to God.</P><P>Second, we should withstand the devil. When God's children encounter unreasonable and inexplicable things in the environment and have the clear sense within that these are attacks from Satan, they should withstand him. Once they withstand, the attacks will be behind them. On the one hand, they need to humble themselves under the hand of God. On the other hand, they must withstand Satan's work in the environment. When they humble themselves, and their attitude before God is firm, God will show them that it is not Him but Satan who is doing the work. Thus, they will be able to differentiate God's arrangement from Satan's attack. Once they are clear and once they withstand the devil, the attacks will go away.</P><P>Third, we must reject all forms of fear. Satan has to find a lodging ground before he can work on God's children. He cannot work where he has no ground to work. Therefore, his first attack is to gain a beachhead. He then attacks us from this beachhead. We should not give any ground to him. This is the way to victory. There is one area which can become Satan's greatest stronghold&#151;fear. When Satan tries to put us through trials, the first thing he does is to put fear into us. An experienced sister once said, "Fear is Satan's calling card." Once you accept fear, Satan steps in. If you reject fear, he will not be able to come in.</P><P>All thoughts of fear are attacks from Satan. Whatever you are afraid of, you will surely experience. Job said, "For I dread something, and it comes upon me;/And what I fear comes to me" (Job 3:25). Job experienced everything that he feared. Satan's attack in the environment comes mostly in the form of fear. If you withstand the fear, the things that you fear will not come. But if you allow the fear to remain, you will give Satan the opportunity to do the very things that you fear.</P><P>Therefore, in order for God's children to withstand the work of Satan, the first thing they have to reject is fear. When Satan puts a fear in you for this or that thing, you must not give in to this fear. You should say, "I will never accept what the Lord has not measured to me!" Once a person is delivered from fear, he is delivered from Satan's realm. This is what Paul meant when he said, "Neither give place to the devil" (Eph. 4:27).</P><P>Why do we not need to fear? We do not fear "because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world" (1 John 4:4). If we are fearful, it is because we are ignorant of this fact.</P>
