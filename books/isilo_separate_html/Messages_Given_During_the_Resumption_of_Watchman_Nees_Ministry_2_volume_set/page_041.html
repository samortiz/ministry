I hope that everyone sitting here can listen carefully to this. Why did God create the universe? Why did He create man? Why did He create you? What is God trying to accomplish? This is an important question. If God wants to do something, and you do not know about it, your Christian life is meaningless. You may think that God's intention is for you to have joy and peace. It is true that God wants you to have joy and peace, but these things are not God's center. God is not merely giving you peace, blessings, forgiveness, eternal life, and so forth; His central thought is to work Himself into man. What is the ultimate goal of God in the old creation as well as in the new? It is to work Himself into man. This is God's goal. God's redemption is for this goal. He created the universe in order to put man in it, and the purpose for Him to have man is to work Himself into him. I cannot tell you why God wants to do this. But I do know that this is His desire; He wants to work Himself into man.</P><P>A light bulb is very good to look at. But if you ask the designer who designed it, he will tell you that the bulb is not made just to be good to look at. It has one specific goal, and that is to transmit electricity. If electricity is not transmitted into it, all the electric wires and electric poles will be useless. What is the function of the electric wires and poles? They are there to transmit electricity to the light bulb. Everyone, whether male or female, young or old, honorable or lowly, exists for his three meals a day only. He eats so that he can work, and he works so that he can eat. Some say that they live for society or for their country. These are lies; they are but beautiful words. The best liars are the social reformers and the politicians. This world is a chaos; it has been put into disarray by the great politicians and by the so-called reformers. For a person to be a high officer or the head of a state will not necessarily bring blessing to humanity. Even if a man gains the whole world, what he ultimately gets is but a coffin. None of these are the meaning of human existence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PURPOSE OF MAN&#151;TO BE GOD'S VESSEL,<br>CONTAINING GOD AND EXPRESSING HIM</H2><P>Man is God's vessel. He is God's "bulb." God wants to put His life and light into man. He wants to live inside of man. What is the meaning of your existence? Is it for your family, children, or business? You have attended school for many years, and you have filled your mind with knowledge, but is this the meaning of your human life? Some people hope to have good children. But as their sons are growing up, the fathers themselves are dwindling down.</P><P>Other people say that they want to serve God and to keep His will; they want to please God, to work for Him, and to zealously do His will. Are these thoughts correct? Again there are those who hope to receive answers to prayers, to receive blessings, and to witness for God. Christianity today has been degraded by man to a pitiful level. To have blessings and peace is not the purpose of man. What then is the purpose of man?</P><P>Romans 9:20 and 21 say that man is a piece of clay. This piece of clay is not made to be God's servant or His maid. It is made to be a vessel. Any vessel, whether it is a cup or a bowl, exists for the purpose of containing something. A vessel is different from a tool. God has no intention to make you into a tool. It would be terrible if God were to make you into a tool. He has no intention to make you into a hammer and use you to hit others. He only wants to put Himself into you, so that His life can flow out of you.</P><P>The real way to serve God, glorify Him, and keep His will is to put yourself in the hand of God and to allow Him to fill you up. In this way, God will shine out and flow out from within you. This is to serve God. It is not a matter of your working for the Lord, but of God's working Himself into you. It is a great blasphemy to think that a man can do anything for the Lord. God is the Creator. He does not need you to work for Him; He only needs you to allow Him to work in you. Ephesians 2 says that we are God's workmanship. We are not His workers. If the whole of Swatow would rise up to work, I can predict that soon these ones will argue one with another. But if here is a small group of people who would tell the Lord that they are not here to work for Him, but to be worked on by Him, God will have a way here. God does not need you to be His tool. He wants you to be His vessel to contain Him.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
