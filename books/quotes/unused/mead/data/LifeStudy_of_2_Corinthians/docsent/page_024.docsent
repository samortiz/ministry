   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TEN THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT 3 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:7-15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapters three and four of 2 Corinthians are the most crucial chapters of both 1 and 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No other chapters in these Epistles are so related to the constitution of Christ for the deeper experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two chapters are very deep in the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, these chapters reveal how the apostles, as ministers of the new covenant, were constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They were reorganized, rearranged, having been made ministers of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul considered himself the chief among the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How could such a rebel against God become a minister of the new covenant, a minister of Christ for the carrying out of God s economy?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is certainly a great matter to convert a rebel against God into a minister of Christ for the accomplishing of God s administration in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order for Paul to become a minister of Christ, he was first reborn and then reconstituted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rebirth is not sufficient to make someone a minister of the new covenant; it is also necessary for that one to be reorganized, rearranged, reconstituted.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A new constitution, however, requires a new element.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without the element as the essence of the constitution, it is not possible for us to be constituted of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The redemption of Christ brings us back to God, but it does not do the work of constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This work requires some element in addition to the redeeming blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This element is not only life, or the Spirit; it is the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I would call your attention to the steps of the process through which God has passed: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These four major steps of God s process are also the ingredients of the processed God as the element with which we are constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These ingredients are typified by the four spices compounded with olive oil to make the ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The olive oil was the basic element, and the four spices were the ingredients compounded with this element.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The compound produced as a result of this process was the ointment with its ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is the Spirit, the olive oil, the basic element.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The four spices are related to incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Incarnation brought divinity into humanity and made them one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But neither divinity nor humanity was changed in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No, divinity remains divinity, and humanity remains humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is illustrated by the mingling of oil with fine flour in the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The oil and the flour are mingled together to form one entity with two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, each nature remains separate and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The oil does not lose its nature, and the flour does not change its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, the oil and the flour are mingled together to produce one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But this entity is not a third nature, something that is neither oil nor flour.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, it is a complete entity with two natures, the nature of oil and the nature of flour.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is an illustration of incarnation bringing divinity into humanity, making them one and causing them to live as one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus, a wonderful Person with two natures, divinity and humanity, lived in the home of a carpenter in Nazareth for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After completing His ministry, He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His human living implies that He passed through everything in humanity related to the first creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When He was crucified, He brought the entire old creation to the cross and terminated it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the old creation has been terminated, we should not be bothered by our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the sight of God, all these problems have been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God sitting on the throne can say to Satan, Little Satan, what are you trying to do?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Are you still causing trouble?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I ll give you a little more time to play.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, you must realize that I have already terminated you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You, along with the old creation, have been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Satan and the old creation have been terminated, and we also were terminated by the death of Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This termination is the true significance of the crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Through His resurrection Christ brought God s chosen and redeemed people into God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Incarnation brought God into man; resurrection brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today we, the redeemed people of God, not only have God in us; we also are in God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is wonderful to have God in us, but it is even more wonderful to be in God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Perhaps you are not very conscious of the fact that you are in God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By the Lord s mercy I can testify that I definitely have the sense, the consciousness, that I am a man in God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Apparently, I am a man living on earth; actually, I am a man in God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God is in me, and I am in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God has been brought into us through incarnation, and we have been brought into God through Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the Triune God, the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The processed Triune God is the very element with which we have been constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some may say, I do not feel as if I have been constituted with the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You may not feel this, but you need to believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As Christians, we need to live by faith and walk by faith, not by sight 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are believers, not those who walk by sight.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Are you a believer or one who walks by sight?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A believer is one who does not trust in things that can be seen, but he takes certain unseen things, confesses them, and realizes them by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To be one who walks according to feelings is even worse than being one who walks by sight.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You may not feel that you are living in a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Actually you are living there.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Feelings are not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You may feel that you are wonderful, but your condition may be pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do not believe in your feelings believe in the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is a fact that we all have been brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The processed Triune God is the very element with which we have been constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You may not feel constituted, or that there has been any change within you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Again I say, be a believer, one who walks by faith, not one who walks according to his feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When God says a certain thing, you should also speak that thing simply because the Bible tells you so.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Bible reveals that God has been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Now in resurrection, He is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit as the constituting element.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Bible says this, and we must believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Brother Nee often said that first we have fact, then faith, then experience.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The sequence is not experience, faith, and fact.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The facts are always first.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But how do we know about the facts?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The facts are recorded in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This testament is a will, something stronger and better than a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A covenant is an agreement similar to a contract.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But a testament, a will, refers to something already accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Suppose a will declares that a person has been given a million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The evidence, the proof, of this is the will.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The New Testament is a will.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This will says that the processed God is now in us, that He is our portion, and that He is the element with which we have been constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Yes, we have been constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We need to believe this fact, just as we believe that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Sometimes the Devil says, Look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Are you a son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>How can you say you are a son of God when you lost your temper this morning?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Even when we lose our temper, we must insist on believing that we are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Thus, we should say, Satan, even though I have lost my temper many times, I am still a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Losing my temper does not change the fact that I am a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Satan, with my declaration of this fact, I chase you away.</S>
