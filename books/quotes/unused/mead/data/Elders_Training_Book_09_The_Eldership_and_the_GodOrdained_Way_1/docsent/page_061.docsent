   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRACTICE OF PERFECTING THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the book of Ephesians, Paul tells us that the gifts the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are for the perfecting of the saints 4:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then Acts 20 shows us how the writer of Ephesians, the Apostle Paul, perfected the saints in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The book of Ephesians presents the teaching given to the saints in Ephesus, while Acts 20 presents the practice of the writer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The teaching in Ephesians 4 and the practice in Acts 20 are by the same apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul taught the perfecting of the saints and he practiced it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The record of Paul's practice in Acts 20 opens a window for us to see how to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Acts 20 Paul said that he did not shrink from declaring to the saints in Ephesus all the counsel of God v. 27 . According to his word in Acts 20, Paul surely taught prophesying to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If Paul had not taught the Ephesians to prophesy, how could he have said that he declared all the counsel of God to them?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to 1 Corinthians 14, prophecy is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Prophecy is the excelling gift, the gift above all gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Surely Paul taught the Ephesians concerning the excelling gift of prophecy as a part of the entire counsel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, Paul wrote his first Epistle to the Corinthians from Ephesus 1 Cor 16:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>While Paul was in Ephesus writing to the Corinthians concerning the excelling gift of prophecy, he was surely teaching the Ephesians the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Acts 20 he told the elders of the church in Ephesus, "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time" v. 18 . Paul was with the saints in Ephesus for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He not only taught them publicly in meetings but also taught them from house to house v. 20 . Night and day, he did not cease admonishing each one of the saints with tears v. 31 . This teaches us how to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Paul was teaching the saints publicly and from house to house in Ephesus, he surely instructed them how to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you ask me how to perfect the saints, I will tell you to read Acts 20.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The way is there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, we need to be with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If I have the burden to perfect the saints in a certain locality, I need to go there, following Paul's pattern to stay there for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul even went to Ephesus and stayed there without being asked or invited by the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He volunteered to stay with the Ephesians for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Second, we have to teach the saints everything we know concerning the counsel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to be like Paul, who did not shrink from declaring to the saints all the counsel of God v. 27 . While we are staying with the saints, we have to open up all the things concerning God's New Testament economy, His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We would share how, according to His economy, He became a man, acquiring humanity in addition to His divinity, and how He died on the cross in a sevenfold way to solve all the problems in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We would also teach many other things concerning His economy.</S>
