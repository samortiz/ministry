 <h2 class="head2">Not Making Decisions for Others</h2>
<p>We should never make decisions for others. This is to consider that we are superior to them. We should not play politics. We need to be honest with the ones who are under our care, but we must still be restricted by the Lord not to make their decisions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Never Arguing with People</h2>
<p>We also should never argue with people, regardless of whether they are right or wrong. Every conversation is a temptation to adjust others, convince them, or &ldquo;sell&rdquo; our good opinions and concepts. We must avoid all these things. There is no need to do this. If we do, it will not help them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Passing On Vain Knowledge</h2>
<p>We must never pass on vain knowledge to people. People may ask us about many matters, but we must learn to exercise our spirit to discern the purpose of the questions. If we discern properly, we may realize that the questions are in vain. People often like to gain knowledge, asking about the elders, the brothers and sisters, and many other matters. We must learn to be wise, not be involved with questionings, and not pass on vain knowledge. This also is a difficult lesson for us all.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being Involved in Any Negative Talk</h2>
<p>We should not be involved in any negative talk. In other words, we should not be a &ldquo;trash can.&rdquo; Flies like to find a dirty place, but we must be clean and sterilized. If we do not visit people in a clean way, but rather take germs to them, they may be incited to open up in a wrong way. They will open their &ldquo;tombs,&rdquo; and death will come out. We should not get into any negative talk or answer any questions about negative matters. We must be in another realm, another kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Honest and Not Political</h2>
<p>We must learn to be honest, never pretending and never playing politics. We should not be political in order to make the situation easier. We must be honest persons, answering honestly yes or no. If the situation does not allow us to answer yes or no, then we should not say anything. If we learn all these lessons, we will be able to care for others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ministering Life to Others</h2>
<p>Most importantly, we must learn to minister life to others. In order to do this, we ourselves must have life. We may illustrate this with money. If we desire to give money to someone, we must first have some ourselves. If our pocket is empty, we have nothing to give. We must have something before we can minister it to others. Therefore, we must learn the lessons of life. Then we will know how to minister to others. In fact, if we have life, there is no need to purposely minister life to others. Life will already be ministered to them. When visiting others to take care of them, the proper principle is to minister life to them. All the foregoing points are a preparation for ministering life. If we do not have this preparation, whatever we do will only diminish our ministry and supply. If we are careless about any of these matters, our ministry of life will be annulled and swallowed up. If we are careful about all these items, we will remain in a pure condition to minister to others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking the Lead to Bring Others<br />
into a Prayer Life</h2>
<p>We need to pray with others and help them to pray. We should not try to wrongly impress people that we have the way to do things, that we are smart, or that we know everything. Rather, we should simply help people to put their trust in the Lord and depend on Him for everything. To this end, we should bring with us a spirit and atmosphere of prayer to help others to come into a prayer life. We need to create an atmosphere so that whatever happens to people, they will pray, look to the Lord, and rely on Him for His presence and clear leading. We need to build up those under our care with a prayer life. If we ourselves are not persons with a prayer life, we will not be able to build up others as this kind of person. We ourselves need to take the lead.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Contacting People with Patience</h2>
<p>In order to care for others, we need patience. We should not expect that someone who is newly saved or recovered will immediately be in a proper condition. We need patience to care for the weaker ones. A weaker one may require our patience to contact him again and again. This kind of continual, patient contact will shepherd people. This takes time, but there is nothing else we can do. The church grows through shepherding. If we have gospel preaching without shepherding to take care of the new ones, many of the newly saved ones will fall away. This will spoil and damage our appetite for gospel preaching. Many will say, &ldquo;We brought so many to the Lord, but most of them are not here anymore.&rdquo; We will be like a family that has lost its children. Therefore, we need the proper shepherding for the proper child raising. It is impossible for only the leading brothers in a church to take care of the shepherding. Everyone must pick up the burden to take care of others. This requires our patience.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Trusting Those Who Are under Our Care</h2>
<p>We must learn to trust and rely upon the ones who are under our care. This is to have a proper fellowship. In one sense, we are the parents nourishing our children, but in another sense, we are all brothers and sisters. Therefore, we should show others that not only do they rely on us, but we also rely on them. This mutual reliance creates much profit. It causes others to be open to us, trust us, and have confidence in us. This is to &ldquo;open our veins for the blood to circulate.&rdquo; All the members must be open to one another. Then the circulation will do its proper work. We have seen that some of the ones who are under our care do not open to us, regardless of how much time we spend with them. This means that they have no confidence in us. We need to behave in a way to build up a mutual confidence; this will cause them to open to us. This requires us to depend on them, rely on them, and show them that we need their help.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Never Forcing Anyone to Do Anything</h2>
<p>We should never give anyone under our care the sense that we are forcing them to do anything. We must all learn the attributes of God. From the beginning, God never forced people. Rather, He gave them a free choice. We should not even try to overly influence people. Not to force or coerce people is contrary to our natural concept. In shepherding, however, we should stay away from every kind of forcing, coercing, and convincing. We should allow people to have a free choice.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fellowshipping with Others<br />
according to Our Own Experience</h2>
<p>Whatever we fellowship with the dear ones must be according to our own experience. Paul told the Thessalonians, &ldquo;Just as you know how we were to each one of you, as a father to his own children, exhorting you and consoling you and testifying&rdquo; (1 Thes. 2:11). No doubt, Paul testified many things to the saints, but a great part of his testimony must have been his own experiences. We need personal experiences to be able to testify to the younger ones. In the proper sense, whatever we render to them as a help should be from our own testimony. How much we can testify in this way depends on how much we have experienced. We must have a certain amount of experience of all of the foregoing detailed items. The more we pick up the burden to shepherd others, the more things we will need to learn.</p>
