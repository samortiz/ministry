This chapter reveals the principle that everything depends on God's mercy. The apostle applied this principle to the Israelites. He showed us that everything that happened to the Israelites was of God's mercy. Today, not only do we need to pay attention to the application, but we need to pay attention also to the principle behind the application.</P><P>Here it says that "it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy" (Rom. 9:16). Zeal and pursuit are of no use. Neither will the absence of zeal and pursuit be of any use. To wait too long, not to wait long enough, to be too quick, or to be too slow&#151;none of these is of any use. To be in one place or another, to hear much or to hear little&#151;none of these is of any use either. Everything depends on the mercy of God. Only the Holy Spirit is able to lead men to a proper standing. There must be at least one time that a person sees God's mercy. Concerning this matter, your eyes must be opened at least once. Of course, it is good if your eyes can be opened more than once. But there must at least be one time when you see that everything depends on God's mercy. Whether you see this matter all at once, or you realize it through a process, the minute you touch this matter, you touch a fact&#151;not a feeling, but a fact. This fact is that everything depends on God's mercy.</P><P>God's mercy is a fact. A fact is not dependent on feeling. Take the matter of regeneration as an example. We often tell sinners that they must have a one-time definite experience of repentance and believing in the Lord. To the believers, we say that they must have a one-time definite consecration of themselves to the Lord. In principle, it is the same with regard to man's understanding of God's mercy. There must be at least one time when a person definitely touches God's mercy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED TO DEAL WITH<br>THE MIND, THE EMOTION, AND THE WILL&#151;<br>BEING TEMPERED UNDER<br>THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Three kinds of people need God's dealings: those who are strong in their will, those who are strong in their emotion, and those who are strong in their mind. Many people are controlled by these three kinds of conditions. These three things must experience God's breaking. God deals with man's strong points more than He deals with his weak points. Many times, man's strong points hinder him from spiritual progress, more so than his weak points. Unless a man is dealt with in these three areas, he cannot know God's mercy.</P><P>After a man has been dealt with by God, he will be tempered in his spiritual life. In many things, it is inappropriate either to be too much or to be too little. Some people wait for too long, while others do not wait long enough. All these require tempering. Some people are not strong enough in their inner man; their outer man is too strong. This is like a man's head taking up one-fourth of his body or one-sixteenth of his body; neither is proportionate. The right proportion should be one-seventh of the body. Some people are too strong in their mind. Others are too strong in their emotion or their will. Their inner man is not strong enough. These conditions require tempering.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
