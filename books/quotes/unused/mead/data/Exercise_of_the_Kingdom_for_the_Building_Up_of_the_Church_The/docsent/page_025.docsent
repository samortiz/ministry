   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Take the example of washing dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes I wash the dishes for my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But many times I have had the thought that I would like the young people to know what I am doing and to realize what a good example I am setting for them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the magnified self.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I know that this is the attitude among many in the brothers houses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As you are washing dishes, you may say, Lord, You know that the others are not willing to do the dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But I am doing them, Lord, for Your sake.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the ugly self expressed in the washing of dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When you wash the dishes and have no thought or feeling about it, that is an indication that the self is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It reveals that you are nothing in the matter of washing the dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But as long as we have some thought concerning ourselves in this matter, it is a clear sign that self is present.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only is self present, it is nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After some have washed the dishes in such a way, they go into their room and pray, Lord, thank You that I was the only one to wash the dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This kind of giving thanks comes from the magnified self.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you wash the dishes in this way for several days, you will eventually become angry with those you are living with and no longer wash any dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is an indication of how much we need the exercise of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE GRACE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is sown in the Gospels grows in the Epistles and is harvested in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Epistles we have the excellent example of the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said, But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was by the grace of God that Paul was what he was, and by this grace he labored more than others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Grace is God as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we put 1 Corinthians 15:10 together with certain verses from the book of Philippians, we see that grace is nothing less than the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, in Philippians 1:19 Paul says, For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>. This is the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The grace of God is the bountiful, exhaustless, unending supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today this Spirit is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, Paul could say, I can do all things in him who empowers me Phil 4:13, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>. Here Paul seemed to be saying, I cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But I can do all things through Him who empowers me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The One who empowers me is not in the heavens; He is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Him, I can do all things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>WORKING OUT OUR SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Philippians 2:12 Paul said, Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not eternal salvation, but the salvation of the soul, the salvation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is the salvation to receive the reward and to enter into the joy of the Lord in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This salvation needs to be worked out by us, whereas the eternal salvation does not require our work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Regarding eternal salvation, we simply receive it and have it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But we need to work something out in order to have the salvation of the soul, the salvation that qualifies us to receive the reward of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In ourselves we are not able to work out this salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we have One in us who can work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This One is God Himself who is working within us both the willing and the working of His good pleasure Phil 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God works in, and we work out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His inward working requires our willing cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are willing to cooperate with Him, He will have the ground and the way to work within us so that we may work out our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no need for us to strive or use our own effort to accomplish such a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>PREACHING THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As we all know, we must eat in order to have strength.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The problem is not with the food, for the food has been prepared and is now in front of us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>People may do many things for you, but no one can eat for you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In God s New Testament economy He firstly saved us and then put us into the exercise of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For this exercise, we need Christ and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although this Spirit is present within all real believers, millions of Christians are not hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, we who are hungry and who are eating Christ must preach the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to tell the saints that although they have been saved for eternity, they may nevertheless have a problem with the Lord at the time of His coming back to settle accounts.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord will examine our living, behavior, and work since our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The gospel of the kingdom has been completely buried by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today we must sound the trumpet of this gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the Lord comes back, He will establish His kingdom of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At that time He will give us either a positive reward or a negative reward according to our doings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These doings are related to three matters: the denying of the self, the taking up of the cross, and the losing of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The way we deal with these three things will be the basis on which the Lord will settle accounts with us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then He will decide whether we shall receive a positive reward or a negative one.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As those who believe the Bible, we must recognize that such a judgment is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The gospel of the kingdom is for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many Christians today, including some of us in the Lord s recovery, may be ignorant or negligent of this.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is not sufficient to talk about spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The question is whether or not we are taking Christ as our supply to deny the self, bear the cross, and lose our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The reward of the kingdom in the future is an incentive for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is also a warning regarding the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we do not live a life that is crucified, resurrected, and overcoming, a life that denies the self, takes up the cross, and loses the soul, we must be warned of the danger of being disapproved.</S>
