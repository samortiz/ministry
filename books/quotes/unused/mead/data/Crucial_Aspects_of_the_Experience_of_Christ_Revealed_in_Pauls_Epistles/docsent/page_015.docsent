   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>RECEIVING THE WORD BY MEANS OF ALL PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The prayer mentioned in verse 18 is not for blessing, peace, or healing but to receive the word of God, which, according to verse 17, is not a book of letters but the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 18 says that we can receive the word of God by means of all prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Prayer is general, and petition is specific.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to pray in a general way and also in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If someone gives us a glass of water, the unique means by which we can receive the water is to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord has given us His word in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We receive the word, which is the Spirit, not by means of reading or understanding but by means of all prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason, we need to pray-read the Bible, turning the words of the Bible into the words of our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many saints in the past centuries have practiced to mingle prayer with their reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>George Whitefield, a contemporary of John Wesley, was a powerful evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whitefield wrote that it was his daily practice to kneel and pray as he read the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He found that the best means to receive the word of God was not merely by reading and understanding but by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whitefield prayed through the entire New Testament in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we practice to pray-read the word, we will be filled with Christ and with power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we will live Christ, minister Christ, and express Christ in a powerful way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all need to pray to receive the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not pray in a pitiful way, complaining to the Lord about our weak condition or difficult situations, begging for mercy, or merely asking for blessing, health, and peace for ourselves or others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we pray, we need to pray first to receive the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to build up a habit to pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first thing that we do each day should be to pray to receive the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we receive the word of God by prayer, the word nourishes, waters, refreshes, empowers, strengthens, saturates, washes, enlightens, corrects, and rebukes us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The result of our receiving the word of God by prayer is that we are inwardly cleared up and filled with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we are in such a condition, nothing will be a problem to us.</S>
