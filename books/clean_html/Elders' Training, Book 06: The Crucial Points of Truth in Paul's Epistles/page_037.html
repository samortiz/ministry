<h2 class="head2">The Human Spirit and the Divine Grace</h2>
<p>The last point is in 4:22: &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.&rdquo; You have to join, or combine this point with fanning the teaching spirit into flame (1:6) and being empowered in the grace (2:1). This verse combines those two verses. In each of these verses the main items are our spirit and grace.</p>
<p>Second Timothy, which gives instruction on how to confront the degradation of the church, strongly stresses our spirit. In the beginning it emphasizes that a strong, loving, and sound spirit has been given to us by which we can fan the gift of God into flame and suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God and the Lord&rsquo;s life-imparting grace (1:6-10). In the conclusion it blesses us with the emphasis of the Lord being with our spirit that we may enjoy Him as grace to stand against the down current of the church&rsquo;s decline and to carry out God&rsquo;s economy through His indwelling Spirit (1:14) and equipping Word (3:16-17).</p>
<p>In the grievous days during the worsening degradation of the church, what is needed is the eternal grace of God, which was given to us in eternity (1:9) and is appropriated by us in this age. This grace, which is in the indestructible life, is nothing less than Christ the Son of God, who is the very embodiment of the divine life, dwelling and living in our spirit. We need to exercise this spirit to enjoy the riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8) as the sufficient grace (2 Cor. 12:9). Thus we may live Him as our godliness (1 Tim. 4:7-8) for the building up of the church as a testimony of Christ, bearing all the divine realities according to God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TITUS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Washing of Regeneration<br />
and the Renewing of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Titus is actually a continuation of 1 and 2 Timothy. In Titus, for our present need, I would only cover one crucial point in 3:4-7&mdash;&ldquo;But when the kindness and love to man of our Savior God appeared, not by works in righteousness which we have done but according to His mercy, He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, that, having been justified by the grace of that One, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&rdquo; The washing of regeneration, the renewing of the Holy Spirit, the grace, the heirs, and the hope of eternal life all comprise a crucial point.</p>
<p>Verse 5 says God saved us. Whenever we talk about God&rsquo;s salvation, we generally would not think of the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit. We do not have this kind of idea or concept. The basic concept of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to make us a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17), and the way God makes us a new creation is to work Himself into our being by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Regeneration in Titus 3:5 is not the same Greek word as in 1 Peter 1:23. John 3 tells us the fact of regeneration, but the word regeneration is not used there. The word regeneration is used in the real sense of being born of God by Peter in his first Epistle. He tells us that we have been regenerated through the incorruptible seed, which is the living word of God. The word translated &ldquo;having been regenerated&rdquo; in 1 Peter 1:23 means having been born again. This second birth is not merely to have an outward change, but a change by life, with life, and in life. Regeneration is altogether a matter of life and always brings in a kind of washing.</p>
<p>Then this washing does some kind of restoring work, but this restoring work does not transpire in the physical part of our being. When we were regenerated, something divine was imparted into our spirit to make our spirit alive. This is surely a kind of restoration, but this restoration is altogether unrelated to our physical body. It is altogether a matter that transpires in our spirit to make our dead spirit alive by the divine life imparted into it. The very imparted divine life was the factor to enliven our dead spirit. The regeneration in our spirit brought in a washing by the divine life as the washing water. The divine life coming into our spirit to make our dead spirit alive washes away the dead things, the dead elements. This restores our dead spirit, but has nothing to do with our physical being.</p>
<p>After this washing, something continues to go on&mdash;the renewing of the Holy Spirit. The renewing of the Holy Spirit is the continuation of the washing of the restoration in our spirit. This is the way through which God saved us. God has saved us, yet this saving is still going on because it is a saving through the washing, which is continued by the renewing. The washing is the restoration in our spirit, and the renewing is by the Holy Spirit continuously.</p>
<p>Verse 7 tells us &ldquo;that, having been justified by the grace of that One, we might become heirs.&rdquo; Thus far, we have not become heirs yet. At the most, we have become children of God. In ancient Rome, a child had to grow up to a certain age, probably twenty-one, so that he would be qualified and equipped to be the heir. In Romans 8 we are told that we are children, then heirs (v. 17). At our regeneration we became God&rsquo;s children, but we have not become heirs yet. We are on the renewing way to becoming heirs.</p>
<p>We become heirs according to the hope of eternal life, which we have gained and by which we became children of God. This eternal life we are enjoying brings in a hope to inherit the divine inheritance. When you are enrolled in graduate school, your being enrolled brings you a hope to graduate from graduate school. In like manner, when you were regenerated you received eternal life, and this eternal life brings you a hope that you may become an heir.</p>
<p>Your enrolling in graduate school brings you a hope to graduate. Your graduation is not a certainty and you may fail. The hope of your enrolling is graduation. Enrolling is not the hope, but enrolling brings in the hope. Our spiritual graduation is our maturity in life, and our maturity in life is our glorification. This is fully mentioned and defined in Romans 8 (vv. 17, 30). Glorification will be our graduation, and this means that we have to be renewed, which is another term for being transformed. The renewing of the Holy Spirit is the transforming work of the Spirit to transform us into His image, from glory to glory (2 Cor. 3:18). Transformation is the way to enter into glorification. Although many Christians love the world and are indulging in worldly pleasures, they think they will be glorified automatically. When the Lord returns, however, many Christians will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10) and assigned by the Lord with a certain amount of discipline or dispensational punishment (Matt. 25:30).</p>
<p>When we were regenerated, we were restored in our spirit, and God put Himself within us as the renewing Spirit. This Spirit continues or follows the washing of regeneration to renew us bit by bit every day, every morning, every evening, and minute by minute in every aspect of our daily life. In everything, everywhere, and at every time He is renewing us. By this renewing we are being gradually brought from one degree of glory to another into glorification. Glorification, which is like the blossom of a carnation, is our graduation. In that graduation we will surely be heirs. We have been born sons, but we will be heirs through the long procedure of being renewed unto glorification. When we are completely renewed unto glorification, that will be our graduation. By that time, we will have become heirs to inherit what God promised as a reward in the coming kingdom. This is the right understanding of the Bible concerning our salvation. God saved us and yet His saving is still going on by the renewing, the transforming work of the Spirit. God&rsquo;s saving will be completed by the last step of glorification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PHILEMON</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Believers&rsquo; Equal Status<br />
in the New Man</h2>
<p>Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty in the arrangement of the New Testament canon, the book of Philemon was placed as a conclusion of the three foregoing books, 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus. In this book the major point, which is more than crucial, is the believers&rsquo; equal status in the new man. This short Epistle serves the special purpose of showing us the equality in eternal life and divine love of all the members in the Body of Christ. In the semisavage age of Paul the life of Christ had annulled, among the believers, the strong institution of slavery. Since the sentiment of the love of the Christian fellowship was so powerful and prevailing that the evil social order among fallen mankind was spontaneously ignored, any need for institutional emancipation was obviated. Because of the divine birth and living by the divine life, all the believers in Christ had equal status in the church, which was the new man in Christ, with no discrimination between free and bond (Col. 3:10-11). This is based upon three facts: 1) Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross has abolished the ordinances of the different ways of life for the creation of the one new man (Eph. 2:15); 2) we all have been baptized into Christ and made one in Him without any difference (Gal. 3:27-28); and 3) in the new man Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:11). Such a life with such a love in equal fellowship is well able to maintain good order in the church (in Titus), carry out God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church (in 1 Timothy), and stand against the tide of the church&rsquo;s decline (in 2 Timothy). It is of the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty that this Epistle was positioned after the three preceding books in the arrangement of the New Testament.</p>
