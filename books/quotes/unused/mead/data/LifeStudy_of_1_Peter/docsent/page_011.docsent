   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIVING HOPE AND THE INHERITANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1:3 and 4 Peter goes on to say, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead, unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For many years, I have been trying to understand the words living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I could not understand how this living hope could be the inheritance, as indicated by the fact that, according to grammar, the inheritance in verse 4 is in apposition to the living hope in verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the living hope is the inheritance and that the inheritance is the living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A living hope is a hope of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In particular it is a hope of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Life is the source of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, a little child has human life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because he has life, his parents are full of hope that he will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At birth he weighed several pounds, but his mother is expecting him to grow to maturity as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Her hope is the hope of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We could not have such a hope in relation to something that is not living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, we would not have hope in relation to a chair.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No one would look at a chair and say, This chair is small and ugly, but I am full of hope that one day this chair will become larger and beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That kind of hope is altogether vain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But it is not vain for parents to hope that their child will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By this illustration we can see that hope depends on life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The living hope is a hope of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may also use a carnation seed to illustrate what Peter means by a living hope, a hope of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you were to sow a carnation seed in your yard, you would sow it with hope.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You would have the expectation that the seed would eventually sprout.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After a period of time, you would expect to have a full-grown carnation plant with blossoms on it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is an illustration of the hope of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A dead person has no hope.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, if life could be imparted into a dead person, he would have the hope that every member of his physical body would be enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In principle, the same applies to our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before we were regenerated, we were dead and without hope.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the eternal life that has been sown into us is full of hope, full of the hope of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The hope of life is the enjoyment of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This enjoyment is not only for the future; it is for us to experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when I was young, I was taught that the living hope in 1:4 was only for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I was taught that, sometime in the future, I would have a mansion in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was explained to me that believers have such a wonderful hope.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This hope seems to be good, but it is for something far removed from us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We cannot participate in it today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From the time I began to know eternal life, I also began to enjoy the living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To enjoy this living hope is to enjoy eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This eternal life enables us to change.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, the enjoyment of eternal life is the fulfillment of the hope of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, the full enjoyment of eternal life will be in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But today we may have a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then in the future we shall enjoy the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But both the foretaste and the full taste are the fulfillment of the hope of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, this hope is actually the enjoyment of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we need to ask how this living hope can also be our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When a child is born, he receives human life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the future this child will enjoy many things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the things which he will enjoy in the future are counted as an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every human being receives as an inheritance many things related to human life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Birth gives the right to this inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I was young, I was told that the inheritance described in 1:4 will be ours to enjoy in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I was taught that we must wait until the Lord Jesus comes back to experience this inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eventually I learned that the salvation in 1:5, the full salvation, is ready to be revealed at the last time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But we are not told that we must wait for the future to enjoy our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Peter does not say that the inheritance is kept in the heavens until the unveiling of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, he says only that the inheritance is kept for us in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The heavens can be compared to a bank, and in this bank we have a deposit the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can make withdrawals from this heavenly deposit today; we need not wait for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At any time we can write a check to make a withdrawal from our heavenly checking account.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Eternal life is our enjoyment and also our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All the riches of God s being are involved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These riches have become our inheritance in the heavenly bank.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our daily experience of eternal life is also an experience and enjoyment of the inheritance kept for us in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This means that the living hope and the inheritance are one.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In 1:4 Peter gives a threefold description of our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He says that this inheritance is incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I believe that this threefold description points to the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The word incorruptible refers to the nature of this inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is God s nature, signified by gold.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Undefiled describes the condition of the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This condition is related to the sanctifying Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Unfading refers to the expression of this inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This inheritance has unfading glory.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In chapter five Peter speaks of an unfading crown of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The everlasting expression indicated by the word unfading is the Son as the expression of the Father s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, here we have the Father s incorruptible nature, the Spirit s sanctifying power to maintain the inheritance in an undefiled condition, to keep it holy, clean, and pure, and also the Son as the expression of the unfading glory.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore, the description of our inheritance is also a description of the Triune God.</S>
