<h2 class="head1">THE NATURE OF GOD&mdash;HOLY</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You shall be holy because I am holy&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:16; see also Lev. 11:44-45; 20:7; Heb. 12:14).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s nature is not only holy; it is holiness itself. In chapter 8 we saw that to be holy is to be separated from everything. To say God&rsquo;s nature is holy is to say God&rsquo;s nature&mdash;God&rsquo;s essence&mdash;is separated from everything else. Because God&rsquo;s nature, His essence, is holy, He wants us to be holy, to be separated from everything other than Him. If we are not holy as He is holy, we cannot see Him or come near to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPRESSION OF GOD&mdash;GLORY</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The glory of Jehovah settled on Mount Sinai&rdquo;</strong> (Exo. 24:16; see also Ezek. 1:28; 3:23).</p>
<p>God Himself is glory. There is always an appearance of glory when God manifests Himself to man. The glory of God is equal to the God of glory. Moses and the children of Israel saw the glory of God settling on Mount Sinai, and Ezekiel saw the glory of God. When they saw the glory of God, they saw God Himself. When they were before the glory of God, they were before God Himself.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;They exchanged their glory / For an image of an ox that eats grass&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 106:20; see also Jer. 2:11; Rom. 1:23; John 12:41; Acts 7:55; Heb. 1:3).</p>
<p>Jeremiah 2 says that the God of Israel was the glory of Israel. Man replaced God with idols, but Psalm 106:20 and Romans 1:23 both say that man replaced God&rsquo;s glory with idols. Therefore, these few portions show that the glory of God is God Himself. The glory of God is God Himself, especially when He appears to man (John 12:41; Acts 7:55). The Lord Jesus is the expression of God, so He is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory (Heb. 1:3). Every person, event, or object that manifests God expresses God&rsquo;s glory. The phrase <em>give glory to God</em> means to express God.</p>

God</em> emphasizes His power, especially in creation, and <em>Jehovah</em> emphasizes His relationship with man. <em>Jehovah</em> is first used in Genesis 2:4 where it speaks of God in relation to man. The compound names based on Jehovah show further aspects of His relationship with man. The simple meaning of this name is &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; He is everything to man. Whatever man needs, He is. In His name, it is as if there is a blank after &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; which can be filled in by faith with whatever man needs. If a man needs healing, Jehovah can be his healing. If man needs peace, Jehovah can be his peace. Whatever man needs, Jehovah can provide. He is like a blank check that can be filled in with whatever man needs. This name is so precious and sweet to us!</p>
