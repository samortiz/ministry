<p>Some people say that it is not easy to read the Word because they often forget what they have read. They also say that if they have to read the life-study messages, it will be even more difficult. What they say is not wrong; to be constituted with the truth surely requires that we pay a price. One person&rsquo;s way of studying, however, may be different from another&rsquo;s. In order to be constituted with the truth, we need to learn some secrets. Consider learning English as an example. Although I studied English for only two to three years in my youth, I had a proper method of study. As a result, I gained a great advantage in learning English. Thus, I was able to understand the English Bible. Now I can understand every English book. If there are some unfamiliar words, I only need to look them up in the dictionary. This is all because of my proper learning in my youth. It is the same with studying the truth. Every book of the Bible contains the spirit of its writer. On the one hand, we have to study the meaning of the words thoroughly; on the other hand, we have to touch the spirit of the writer.</p>
<p>Second, in studying the truth you cannot be isolated from others. You have to go out to visit and fellowship with the churches. There is a Chinese saying that says, &ldquo;Traveling ten thousand miles is better than reading ten thousand books.&rdquo; Fellowship widens our horizons. For instance, if we are studying Romans, and the church in Taipei is also pursuing Romans, then we should go to visit them and receive help from them through fellowship.</p>
<p>Third, we have to learn to use the appropriate reference books and concordances. For example, <em>Strong&rsquo;s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible</em> has numbered and identified more than 5,600 Greek words which are used in the New Testament. At present, almost all the Bible expositors and those who pursue the truth use this book. The <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament</em> written by Gerhard Kittel and the New Testament word study of Henry Alford both contain deep analysis on the meaning and usage of every significant word in the New Testament. We have to know how to use these reference books. Fourth, if possible, it is best to learn Greek, which is the language in which the New Testament was written. If we can understand it, it will be very helpful in our study of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRUTH ENABLING MAN<br />
TO RECEIVE LIGHT AND FREEDOM</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus said that the truth shall set us free (John 8:32). There is light in the truth, and once we receive the light, we are set free. During the time of the Lord Jesus, the Pharisees and lawyers also read the Old Testament, but they studied only the letter without the light of the truth. However, once the Lord Jesus gave the explanation, the truth was revealed. For example, there was a group of Sadducees who did not believe that there was such a thing as resurrection, so they went to question the Lord. The Lord Jesus said to them that in Exodus 3:6, the section concerning the burning bush, Moses clearly pointed out that God is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. The Lord also told them that God is not the God of the dead but of the living (Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-38). Since God called Himself the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, this proves that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who had died, will be resurrected. This example shows us that the Lord Jesus&rsquo; knowledge of the truth and the light of the Scriptures was very thorough, and that the way He expounded the Scriptures was not only according to letter, but also according to the life and power implied within them. This is also the focus of the life-studies. Thus, we must make an effort to read the Bible and study the life-studies in order to know the truth.</p>
<p>We do not need to worry about the shortage of material or about the way for us to pursue the truth. The only need is for us to be willing to spend the time and effort on this matter. If we all rise up to study the truth and to know and pursue the Lord, this will bring in a big, long-lasting, and genuine revival of the church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth, Life, the Church, and the Gospel-The Four Great Pillars in the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 29</div><br></body></html>
