   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Twelve Taking Christ as Our Expectation Scripture Reading: Phil 3:20-21 The life which Paul lived in the experience of Christ was one that awaited the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who would transfigure his body of humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory; thus, he took the Christ whom he experienced as his expectation 3:20-21.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For our commonwealth exists in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ v. 20: Our national life is not in any earthly country; our real citizenship, our true commonwealth, is in the heavens Eph 2:6, 19.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because our citizenship is in the heavens, we should not be occupied with earthly things, the physical things needed for our existence 1 Tim 6:6-10.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In dealing with our body, we should take care of our physical need but should not indulge in excessive physical enjoyment Phil 3:17-19; 1 Cor 9:27.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we await and love the Lord s glorious appearing, we should live a God-expressing and flesh-restricting life Titus 2:12-13; Luke 21:34-36; 2 Tim 4:8.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself Phil 3:21: We are waiting for Christ to come back so that we may be brought into the ultimate consummation of God s salvation the transfiguration of our body: In His salvation God first regenerated our spirit John 3:6 , now is transforming our soul Rom 12:2 , and consummately will transfigure our body for our glorification, making us the same as Christ in all three parts of our being 1 John 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The body of our humiliation is our natural body, made of worthless dust Gen 2:7 and damaged by sin, weakness, sickness, and death Rom 6:6; 7:24; 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The body of His glory is Christ s resurrected body, saturated with God s glory Luke 24:26 and transcendent over corruption and death Rom 6:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The transfiguring of our body is accomplished by the Lord s great power, which subjects all things to Himself Eph 1:19-22 ; this is the almighty power in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The transfiguration of our body is the redemption of our body for the full sonship of God Rom 8:23: Although we have the divine Spirit as the firstfruits in our spirit, our body has not yet been saturated with the divine life; our body is still the flesh, linked to the old creation, and it is still a body of sin and death that is impotent in the things of God 6:6; 7:24; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2 Cor 5:4.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, we groan together with the creation and eagerly await the glorious day when we will obtain the full sonship, the redemption and transfiguration of our body Rom 8:19-23.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The transfiguration of our body will be the glorification of our entire being Rom 8:30, 17; 1 Pet 5:10a; 2 Tim 2:10: Objectively, glorification is that the redeemed believers will be brought into the glory of God to participate in the glory of God Heb 2:10a; 1 Pet 5:10a.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Subjectively, glorification is that the matured believers will manifest from within them, by their maturity in life, the glory of God as the element of their maturity in life Rom 8:17-18, 21; 2 Cor 4:17: The Lord is in us as the hope of glory to bring us into glory Col 1:27; Heb 2:10a.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At His coming back, on the one hand, He will come from the heavens with glory Rev 10:1; Matt 25:31 , and on the other hand, He will be glorified in His saints 2 Thes 1:10: 1 His glory will be manifested from within His members, causing their body of humiliation to be transfigured into His glory, conforming it to the body of His glory Phil 3:21.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The believers being transformed in the divine life today is God s being expressed in the believers as glory; hence, this daily transformation is from glory to glory 2 Cor 3:18; 4:17.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The believers arriving at glorification is the climax of their maturity in the life of God and the climax of God s salvation in life Heb 6:1a; Rom 5:10a.</S>
