<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Living a Rejoicing Life</H2><P>Leviticus reveals that we need to live a rejoicing life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Weekly Sabbath</H2><P>The weekly Sabbath (Lev. 23:1-3) was the principal denotation of all the annual feasts. All the annual feasts were a Sabbath, which was for God's redeemed people to rest with God and with one another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Monthly New Moon Feast</H2><P>The monthly new moon feast (Num. 10:10; 28:11-15) signifies that we can experience a new beginning in Christ as our joy and enjoyment with light in darkness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Annual Feasts</H2><P>There were not only weekly and monthly feasts but also annual feasts (Lev. 23:2, 4-44). In our Christian life, we need a weekly, monthly, and annual enjoyment of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Feast of the Passover</H2><P>The Feast of the Passover (Lev. 23:4-5; Exo. 12:2-14) typifies Christ as our Passover (1 Cor. 5:7) for our initial and foundational salvation. This feast signifies the beginning of our regenerated life (Exo. 12:2). Our initial salvation was a time of rejoicing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Feast of Unleavened Bread</H2><P>After the Passover, we are keeping the Feast of Unleavened bread without sin (Lev. 23:6-8; Exo. 12:15-20). This feast lasted for seven days, typifying the entire course of our Christian life as a feast without sin. We cannot rejoice with sin. Christ is our strength to live a life without sin in our entire Christian life for our enjoyment and rest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Feast of the Firstfruits</H2><P>The Feast of the Firstfruits (Lev. 23:9-14) typifies the resurrected Christ (1 Cor. 15:20) for our enjoyment as a feast in His resurrection. Very few are enjoying Christ in this way because they do not know His resurrection power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Feast of Pentecost&#151;of the Fiftieth Day</H2><P>The Feast of Pentecost (Lev. 23:15-21) typifies the enjoyment of the outpouring of the Spirit for the formation of the church in two sections, the Jewish and the Gentile, typified by the two loaves offered to God on that day (v. 17).</P>
