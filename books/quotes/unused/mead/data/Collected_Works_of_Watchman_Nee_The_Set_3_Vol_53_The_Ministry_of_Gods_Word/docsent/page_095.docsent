   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRESSURE AND THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are underlying principles to the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The amount of spirit that is released by a person depends on two things: the amount of his willingness and the amount of pressure that he sustains.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we come to the meeting, God may give us a certain amount of pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the pressure is heavy and abiding, we can be certain that God wants our spirit to burst forth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the pressure builds up, our words are squeezed out.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are pressed, and our spirit has to be released in a particular way in order to relieve this pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, pressure brings about exceptional release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether or not our spirit is released in an exceptional way depends on the amount of pressure we are under.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we talk to a brother, we may find that he is in ignorance and darkness, even boasting in his darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He dwells in darkness, yet he considers himself very highly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God will give us a certain oppressed feeling as we talk to this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We will feel extremely agitated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God's pressure increases within us, we will be provoked and irritated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This cannot go on for long; soon we will have to open our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we speak, we will not speak in an ordinary way; our words will come out in a burst.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This bursting forth is an intensified release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether or not the spirit is released in a strong way depends on the amount of pressure we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose this arrogant and self-assured brother is sitting in front of us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The pressure within us will build up and swell as we listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we are feeling sorry for this brother, our spirit breaks forth in a burst.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The question today is whether or not inwardly we have the willingness to speak the word that is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are willing and the pressure within us is strong enough, the word will burst forth in the form of a rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the release is strong enough, others' arrogance will be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of course, if we do not have a willingness, nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I wish all the brothers would see that our spirit is empowered whenever we exercise it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever we exercise our spirit, it becomes stronger yet again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more we exercise, the more our spirit will become useful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As our spirit is empowered again and again, the Lord will have a way with us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is what happened to Paul when he cast out the evil spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The slave girl cried out for many days, "These men are slaves of the Most High God" Acts 16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One day, Paul became fed up, and he said to the spirit, "I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her," and the spirit came out v. 18 . Many people can only lift their voices; they cannot lift their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is fruitless.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The principle of miracles is the same as the principle of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul was provoked within; the pressure was too much.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When he commanded the spirit to come out, it had to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When there is enough of a build-up of the burden in the spirit, words will burst forth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the light is strong, the release will be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must be pressed by the power of the spirit to the point of being fed up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When this happens, the release of our word will change others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the same principle, a man can only rebuke others when he experiences pressure in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Lord came out of Bethany, He saw a fig tree that was barren, and He said to it, "May no one eat fruit from you forever!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Mark 11:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This came out of the pressure in His spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The word was released under spiritual pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a result, the tree withered from the roots.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should note, however, that a minister of the word is not free to release this kind of word everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can speak such a word only when we are provoked, angered, disturbed, irritated, and agitated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the principle of works of miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is also the principle of words of rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When our inner being breaks out and our spirit is released, others will be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Ministry of the word is the ministry of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A man receives the word when he touches the released spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When a man touches this spirit, he will fall on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the spirit is released, power is released from within, light is released from within, and life is released from within; the Holy Spirit is released from within, and the pressure is relieved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The only thing that works is the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everything else is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our mind, words, memory, and feelings all help us in the release of our message, but it is our spirit that is the necessary ingredient.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can only speak as our spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we have all these things, we have the ministry of the word.</S>
