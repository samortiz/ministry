   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To keep a pleasant, good, and beautiful order in the recovery, we need to be subject to one another in the fear of Christ Eph 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not only should the younger ones be subject to the older ones, but also the older ones should be subject to the younger ones 1 Pet 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The elders should not be a special class in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Peter charges them not to lord it over the church v. 3 . On the other hand, the saints should respect the elders.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The wives should respect the husbands, and the husbands should also respect the wives.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our subjection with respect is a mutual thing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not being subject to one another offends Christ as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, not being subject to one another is rebellion against the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that we have no fear of Christ in His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul tells us that we need to be subject to one another in the fear of Christ, who is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only the Head is superior.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only the Head should be unique and different from the Body.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being subject to one another is the way to keep the one accord Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; 5:12; 15:25; Rom 15:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even if your way is better, you should still take the other brother's way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Otherwise, there will be no one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you are going to a place which has previously been under the work of some other co-workers, you should find out what has been taught by them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then you should go along with them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you do not care for what they have taught or done in the past and teach according to your preference, you will make trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should always try to maintain a good, beautiful, nice, and pleasant order among us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In February 1986 when I spoke concerning the one accord, I said that if some did not choose to take the God-ordained way, they should not criticize or oppose it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Otherwise, they would cause division.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thank the Lord that the church in Taipei has been fully turned to the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This turn was made after seven years of labor and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I returned to Taipei in 1984, we did not change the way to have the church meetings until more than three years later.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we realized that the time was right to change from the way of one man speaking and the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We began to have a prophesying meeting, in which every attendant has equal opportunity to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thank the Lord that the majority of the saints in Taipei accepted this God-ordained way.</S>
