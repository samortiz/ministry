   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Preventing the Saints' Prayers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>from Being Answered</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Daniel 10:12-13</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Daniel,...at the beginning of your supplications the command went forth" Dan 9:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before Daniel had finished his prayer, the answer had already been sent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"For from the first day that you set your heart to understand this matter,...your words were heard...But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me for twenty-one days" 10:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From this we can see how Satan prevents the saints' prayers from being answered.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Daniel prayed and fasted for twenty-one days before he was answered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Was not that too burdensome for him?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today, Satan is doing the same thing in order to prevent the believers' prayers from being answered and to cause them to be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can overcome him with the words in Luke 18:1: "They ought always to pray and not lose heart."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we insist on what we have asked until the end, we will overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some think that if we have faith in our prayer, one prayer is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, this is right, but a persistent prayer requires great faith also.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should know that while we pray the answer is already coming from God's throne.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At such times, a great spiritual battle is aroused, and we should all the more not lose heart in the matter of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, we should ask God to destroy the works of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do this, our prayer will hit the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we persist in our prayer, refusing to give up until we are answered, even if the enemy tries to stop us, the messengers in heaven will fight for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>HOW TO OVERCOME THE TEMPTER</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"He who overcomes will inherit these things" Rev 21:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. Knowing That It Is Not We Who</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Are Fighting against the Devil, but God</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The devil is in the supernatural realm, while we are in the natural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, we are not warring against flesh and blood but against him who holds the authorities of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For a person in the natural realm to war against spiritual forces in the supernatural realm means certain defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, our warfare must be one in which we ask God to fight for us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must take God's almighty strength as our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every time there is a battle, we must acknowledge that this is a battle between God and the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are merely choosing with our will God's victory and opposing Satan's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do this, God's supernatural, almighty strength will storm Satan, and Satan's defeat will be sure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Romans 16:20 says, "Now the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Satan is under the Lord Jesus' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are joined to the Lord, Satan will be under our feet also.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not we who are crushing Satan under our feet; it is the God of peace who will crush Satan under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>B. Always Hiding</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>under the Precious Blood of Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>to Be Saved from Condemnation</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What the devil is afraid of the most is the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By shedding His blood, the Lord crushed the head of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The word "crushed" is the proper meaning of the word "bruised" in Genesis 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the saints continually trust in the precious blood of the Lord and take the stand of Romans 6:11, the devil will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"And they overcame him Satan because of the blood of the Lamb" Rev 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All of our victories come because of the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Believers are often attacked and accused by Satan because they have given ground to sin, and this has afforded the enemy the opportunity to accuse them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The basis of Satan's attack on us is our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should always take the attitude that sin has no dominion over us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But this alone will not stop the enemy's accusations nor his attacks after the accusations, for subconsciously we continue to leave ground for him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must continuously hide under the precious blood so that we will not be attacked.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is true that we have sinned, but the blood has redeemed us from sins!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thank the Lord; His blood not only saves us but enables us to be forever victorious in our Christian life.</S>
