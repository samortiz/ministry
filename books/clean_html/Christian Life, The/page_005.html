<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Christ Being the Eternal Life</H2><P>Christ is the eternal life, eternal in time, quality, perfection, and completion, indestructible and incorruptible (John 3:36; Heb. 7:16b; 2 Tim. 1:10b). Everyone who believes into the Son, Christ, has eternal life. The life which Christ is, is eternal. Christ is perfect, not temporarily but eternally. Christ is also eternally and entirely complete. With us human beings, nothing is eternal or entirely complete.</P><P>Many immigrants who come to the United States try to get permanent residence here, but who is permanent? Very few have lived in the United States for over a hundred years. Everyone eventually departs because human life is temporary. To God one thousand years equals one day (2 Pet. 3:8). Thus, one hundred years is only one-tenth of a day in God's sight. To remain somewhere for only one-tenth of a day is not permanent. God, however, lives from eternity to eternity. Psalm 90 speaks of this. This psalm actually was the first psalm written because it was written by Moses. In Psalm 90:1 Moses said, "Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations." Then he said, "From eternity to eternity You are God" (v. 2). This means that Moses realized that God was his eternal dwelling place. From eternity to eternity, He is God and He is our dwelling place. He is eternally perfect and complete. Even though we are not able to reside on this earth permanently, we already have a permanent residence in God, the eternal One.</P><P>The eternal life, Christ, is also eternal in quality. In quality this life is eternally good. The quality of our human life, using Jeremiah's word, is like broken cisterns (Jer. 2:13). Our qualities are all broken qualities. We may be clever, but our cleverness has been broken into pieces. Our human life, unlike the divine life, is not eternal in quality.</P><P>The eternal life is also indestructible and incorruptible. We human beings can be destroyed by anything, and we are corruptible in ourselves. I have some old books written by Brother Nee. As time goes on, they are corrupting. Today I dare not touch some of these books, for fear that they will fall apart. Time wasted these books because they are corruptible. We also become old and pass away because we are corruptible. Our nature is corruptible. But Christ, the One who is our life, is incorruptible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Christ Being Life to His Believers<br>in Resurrection</H2><P>Christ is life to His believers in resurrection (Col. 3:4a; John 11:25). Resurrection means that this life has gone through death. People put this life into death, and this life came out of death. Today He is a life in resurrection.</P>
