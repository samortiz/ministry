   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE GOD BECOMING MAN 1 SPOKEN LANGUAGE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A BETTER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God desires to reveal Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He does so through means that are comprehensible to man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These are namely written and spoken language.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen how God reveals Himself through writing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we want to take a look at His revelation through speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose that you have had correspondence with a person for many years; however, you have never seen him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Naturally, you would want to know him more by having some direct acquaintance with him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Full understanding of someone cannot be achieved merely through writing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Direct contact gives a better chance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It seems as if communication through speech is of a more intimate and thorough nature than writing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When spoken language is added to written language, communication becomes enhanced.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you take away either of the two, you have a gap.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, if you take away both, communication is completely voided.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Effective communication is always carried out by these two means.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If God's intention is to reveal Himself to us, He must of necessity do so through speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But how does God speak?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Does He trumpet from the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If so, we would all be frightened to death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We would all run away.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one would dare to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a chasm between Him and us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He, being so high and great, would drive us away from His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How then does He speak?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE WINTER ON THE MOUNTAIN</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let me relate to you a story.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One winter I was staying on the mountain Lu-shan, recovering from an illness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was immediately after the war, and there was practically no one living on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the vicinity of my dwelling, one could hardly see anyone all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am a quiet person by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This kind of environment was very appealing to me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only was it quiet there, but the weather was cold as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From morning till dusk, all I saw was a boy who came three times to deliver my meals.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the beginning I was quite at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But after a while, even a person like me began to feel lonely.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One day after lunch I went to take a nap.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There was a balcony outside my bedroom window.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I woke up I saw some little creatures gathering around the balcony.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Bits of my meal had been dropped there, and the birds were busily chirping around them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As they hopped around, they chirped and made many cheerful noises.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I said to myself, "All right.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since I cannot find any human beings, I will try to make friends with these little birds."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I rose up and went out to greet them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But in an instant they all flew away.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>An idea came to me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I took some of the leftover rice and began to arrange it in rows, with only a few grains in the first row and gradually increased them towards the entrance of the doorway.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I hid behind the door and watched them coming.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Soon they gathered around again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I said to myself, "This is my chance."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I walked out and began to make friends with them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the minute they saw me, they all scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some perched on the branches of the tree across the balcony and stared at me, as if trying to determine what my intention was.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every time I approached them, they flew away, and every time I walked away, they came back.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This went on a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>REFUSING TO COME</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I wanted to preach to the birds.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I wanted to tell them, "Little birds, I have no special intention in doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is winter on the mountain, and food is scarce.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have enough food with me, and I just want to share it with you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Please be at peace and come down.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I only ask that as you eat, I can sit among you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I want to listen to your songs and watch you playing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Come.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Let us be friends..."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But the birds would not come.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They did not understand me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I had to give up.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Later I had a certain realization within.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I began to preach to myself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I said, "This body of mine is too big.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If I could shrink from five feet eleven inches to the size of a bird, and even change myself into a bird, they would not be alarmed by my presence.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I could then tell them my heart's intention, and we could spend the winter on the mountain Lu-shan together."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>GOD MUST BECOME THE SAME AS WE ARE</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have a similar problem today.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If God remained God, we could never understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If He talked to us in His language, we would be altogether lost.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If God wants to reveal Himself through speaking and have fellowship with man, He must shrink Himself to such a degree that He and we are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Only then would He be able to speak to us and tell us of Himself and of the mysteries of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Only then would we be able to understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Has God become a man to reveal Himself through His speaking?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Let us again use the method of supposition.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What if God revealed Himself through the human language?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>What if He became a man and fellowshipped with man?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The implication is tremendous here!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It would mean that in this world, among all the human beings throughout history, one person was not merely a man, but God as well!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If it is granted that God became a man, there must be a mortal who was also divine.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We need to find out about this One.</S>
