   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Everyone Functioning,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Everyone Submitting to Authority</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The principle of service in the church is that all the one-talented ones have to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But as soon as they rise up, the flesh rises up also.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, in order for the church to become the church, on the one hand, all the one-talented ones have to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the other hand, in order to deal with the flesh, there must be the exercise of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here the only solution is for man to listen and obey.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you think that something is right, you should obey.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you think that something is not right, you should nevertheless obey.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everyone should rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the other hand, everyone should learn obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After a church has its authority established, there is still the need for the one-talented ones to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without the one-talented ones, there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the same time, without authority there will be confusion in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The problem with the Catholic church is that the one-talented ones have not risen up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, most of the people in the church are one-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today, the church falls into desolation because the one-talented ones are buried.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If all the one talents are dug out, and everyone is a submissive one, the authority in the church will be able to deal with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There was a brother in Foochow who could be considered the very "incarnation of opinion."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was very zealous toward the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was right that his one talent be put to use, but the church could not let him do whatever he liked.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the same time, the church must give him the opportunity to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At any rate, a person must learn to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may not see the result today, but in eight or ten years you will see the result.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To have authority alone is empty; to have the one-talented ones alone is disorderly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But when the one talents are added to authority, we have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Under such circumstances, what could only be accomplished in ten years can now be accomplished overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That brother that I mentioned was later dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He responded by saying that he would quit and would move back to his hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I told him, "Brother, you cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You still have to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, you must serve according to the way the church tells you."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For one to submit to authority is for him to inherit the riches that lie in the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a man truly learns to drop the self, he will have no problem with the matter of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Service in the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>and God's Light Being Found in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The kind of service that is of the Holy Spirit is found only in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1 and 2 Timothy and in Acts as well, we see the matter of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul told Titus to remain in Crete Titus 1:5 and told Timothy to come to him before winter 2 Tim 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul did not ask them to go and pray; he only told them directly where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today, God's move is carried out through the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our service is also under the direction of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the beginning God created a garden, and He went to the garden to look for man Gen 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After man sinned, God did not have a place of rest any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Noah's dove was not able to find a resting place over the entire condemned earth Gen 8:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God could not have a place of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why He later built the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The tabernacle is God's resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The tabernacle brought in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Later the temple was judged, and not one stone was found on top of another.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After this, the church was brought in. Ephesians 2 says that the church is the habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today, God dwells in the church 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Old Testament, the light was in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There was no lamp or sunlight in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet there was light there, because God was there.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the same principle, if you want to receive light today, you have to come to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is a strange thing for a person to be able to come to the church, yet not receive any light.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a man is outside the church, he can remain in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But once he comes into the church, he will see light.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Let me ask the co-workers a question: Do you receive more light when you read the Bible by yourselves, or when you meet in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do you understand the Scriptures more by staying in your room, or when you speak on the platform?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What one person cannot see clearly by himself, he will see clearly when he is with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You may think that what you have received comes from your own mind.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But have you ever given more thought to the matter?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All revelations come from the light.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Only when there is the light can there be the revelations Psa 36:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today there is abundant light in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is why we have to see that it is impossible for us to be an individual Christian.</S>
