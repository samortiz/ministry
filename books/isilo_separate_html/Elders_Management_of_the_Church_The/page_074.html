It is the knowledge concerning boundaries. Perhaps you have never realized that the knowledge of boundaries would have much to do with the administration of the elders. You may not even understand what the word boundaries means. But I believe after you have read through this chapter you will become very clear.</P><P>First, let us consider the matter from the angle of God's work. Whether it is in God's creation or in God's redemption, there are always clear boundaries. For example, Genesis 1 speaks of God's creation. There the phrase "after their kind" is often repeated. Although there are many kinds of plant life, yet each is after its kind. Although there are many kinds of animal life, each is also after its kind. Although all of them are all life, they are after their own kind. Whether it is the plant life or the animal life, each of them has its boundary. Whenever these boundaries are exceeded, confusion immediately follows. Therefore, when we come to Leviticus and Deuteronomy, in God's commandments to His people there are many references to the question of boundaries. It is forbidden that two kinds of lives be mixed together. For example, God prohibited two kinds of seeds to be planted together in the same field. He also would not allow both an ox and an ass to bear the same yoke. He would not permit the wearing of clothing with two different fibers woven together. Also God forbade men to wear women's clothing, and women to wear men's clothing. In the New Testament, and especially in the Epistles, you can also find many teachings related to the matter of boundaries. Today, we do not have the time to look into them. What we are doing here is only to bring out an issue, which is that in God's work He has set up all kinds of boundaries. Whenever these boundaries are broken down, there will be confusion, and God's work will be destroyed.</P><P>The administration of the church also has many boundaries. If such were not the case, there would be no need for administration, and there would be no need for men to take up responsibility. The Bible shows us that in the church there are elders, deacons, and many other gifted persons. All the services must be in proper order and according to the proper principles, and everything should have its definite boundary. In order for us to administrate the church, we must have a very clear knowledge concerning the matter of boundaries. Now we will consider twelve different kinds of boundaries.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_073.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_075.html">Next</a> </body></html>
