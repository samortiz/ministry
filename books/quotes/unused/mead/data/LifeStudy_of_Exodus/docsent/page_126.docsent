   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Fine</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another characteristic of manna is its fineness 16:14a .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Manna was very fine and even.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By nature, we are coarse and unbalanced.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even in virtues such as kindness or humility, we may be rough and unbalanced.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rarely do we find a person who is fine, even, and balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, when we take the Lord Jesus as our food, enjoying His word as our life supply, we are balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We become fine and even.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>F. Round</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 16:14 we see that manna was round.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is difficult to determine whether the manna was round like a flake or round like a ball.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The roundness of a flake is circular, whereas the roundness of a ball is spherical.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Hebrew word seems to indicate that the manna was like a flake.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But elsewhere we are told that manna was like coriander seed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This implies that manna was like a ball.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The roundness of manna signifies that Christ is eternal, without beginning or ending.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is eternal food with an eternal nature for eternal nourishment without limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whoever eats Him will have eternal life with the eternal nature and will receive eternal nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By eating Christ, we become eternal people, those who are beyond time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The eating of Jesus brings us out of time and into eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The life we received in regeneration is an eternal life with an eternal nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because we have received such a life, we have become eternal people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In a sense, we are eternal already, although, of course, we are still in time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we eat the Lord Jesus, the more eternal we become.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The roundness of manna indicates that Christ is eternal, perfect, and full.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With the manna there is no shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus and His word are perfect and full.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By eating Him we are transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more we eat the Lord Jesus and His word, the more eternal, perfect, and full we become.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this diet of heavenly manna there is no defect or shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>G. White</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Exodus 16:31 indicates that manna was white.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was clean and pure, without any kind of mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No earthly food is like this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everything we feed on apart from Christ and His word is a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only Christ and His word are pure.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more we feast on Christ and eat His word, the more we are purified and saved from every kind of mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we come daily to the Lord Jesus and take Him into us and feed on His word, we shall undergo a process of purification that makes us more and more pure.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who feed on Christ eventually become simple and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Most people are complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How can these complicated people be simplified?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The only way to be simplified is to eat the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we eat Him and receive His word, the more we are simplified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way we become single and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As we partake of Christ as our manna, we are not only purified and simplified, but we also become white.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To be white means to be without stain.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As we feed on Christ, the stains within us are eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although we may be good in certain respects, we may not be white.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, our love and humility may have a certain natural color.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Actually, none of our human virtues is white.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the more we take in Christ as our life supply, the more our natural color is eliminated, and the whiter we become.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>H. As Frost</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The manna was also like frost 16:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Frost is something between dew and snow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Both dew and frost are refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But although dew refreshes, it does not kill germs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Frost, however, does kill germs.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As manna, not only does Christ refresh us; He also kills the negative things within us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whenever we experience Christ as the life supply, we are watered and refreshed, and the negative things within us, such as our negative attitudes, are put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We experience both the refreshing of the frost and its killing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As the best kind of air conditioning, frost also cools us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All the worldly people are too hot in their pursuit of sinful pleasures and worldly amusements.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many of today s Christians are also too hot, too feverish; they need to be cooled down.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is especially true of those in Pentecostalism or in the charismatic movement.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those who are involved in the charismatic movement need to eat manna and experience the frost.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Actually, we all need the experience of frost.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Because we are so hot in certain matters, we need to become cool and sober.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We all need to be cooled down in order to be refreshed in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As we partake of Christ and His word, we are cooled down and refreshed by the frost.</S>
