   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE WHAT IS THE BIBLE?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This series of lessons is intended to help a person learn to read the Bible, that is, to help him know how to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Perhaps some brothers and sisters may think that during each lesson we will be studying the Bible itself; but this is not what we will do.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead, we will help the brothers and sisters learn how to read the Bible and how to know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE SPIRIT WITHIN AND THE BIBLE WITHOUT MUST BE BALANCED</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To edify a person spiritually, we must help him to know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the past two thousand years, Christians all acknowledge that no one can truly know the Lord without knowing the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We human beings are not merely a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although we have a spirit, we are not merely a spirit, but a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we were a spirit only, then God would need to give us only His Spirit and not the Bible; however, since we are not a spirit only, He must also give us the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The spiritual inheritances God has given us are the Spirit which cannot be seen and the Bible which can be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Inside of us is the Spirit, and outside of us is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christians throughout the ages can testify by experience that a proper Christian must be fully balanced in both respects the Bible without and the Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These two aspects must be absolutely balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Any bias towards one side will result in serious problems.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Among Christians throughout the ages, some have leaned toward the Spirit within which has resulted in great errors.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Still more lean toward the Bible without.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Seemingly they have not erred as much, yet among them there is a very serious condition of death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, if there were only the Spirit within and not the Bible without, man would easily commit errors.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Conversely, if there were only the Bible without while lacking the Spirit within, man would become extremely dead, altogether lifeless, and without any vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christians can be likened to a train.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There needs to be the fuel inside as its energizing power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But a train needs to have tracks outside as well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there is fuel within but no tracks without, the train would not be able to run.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if it runs, problems will arise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, if there are only the tracks without, but not the fuel within, the train may be on the right track, but it cannot move.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, for a train to run, and to do so smoothly, there must be the coordination of two aspects: the inner aspect and the outer aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Outwardly, there must be the regulation of the tracks; inwardly, there must be the energizing of the fuel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is the same with us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have the Spirit within and the Bible without.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Unfortunately, throughout the ages, Christians lean either toward the Spirit within or toward the Bible without.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even today, many people are doing the same.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those leaning toward the Spirit within very much condemn those leaning toward the Bible without, saying to them: "What you are reading is but dead letters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every day you are just using your mind to study the dead teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only we are living in the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those tending toward the Bible without would likewise condemn those who stress the Spirit within, saying to them: "What you have is just emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is only excitement and stirring up, but no stability.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Please consider all the people you claimed have been stirred up by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Where are they today?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many things that were claimed to be initiated by the Spirit actually resulted in total disaster."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Years ago, we saw much of this kind of condemnation in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the so-called Pentecostal movement or the charismatic movement was in full force there, those involved in it very much opposed the outward interpretation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They thought that it was sufficient enough to be filled with the Holy Spirit and to have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, among them, not only were there many errors, but even funny stories.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those errors and funny stories really brought shame to the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not only did these things happen in China, they happened in western Christianity as well.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even to this day, there are still these two tendencies and these two errors.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These things show us that a proper Christian should be balanced; he should be full of the Spirit within and should know the Bible without.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When one is full of the Spirit within, he will be like the train with the energizing fuel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When he knows the Bible without, he will be like the train on the track.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way, he will be a Christian who is both living and stable, both moving and on the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He will be a living, stable, moving one who is also on the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, we must put equal emphasis on the Spirit and the Bible; we must not neglect either matter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must not overlook the Spirit within, neither can we despise the Bible without.</S>
