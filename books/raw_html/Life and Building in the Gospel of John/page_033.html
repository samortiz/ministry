        <h2 class="head1">THE DECLARATION OF THE ONLY BEGOTTEN<br />
IN THE BOSOM OF THE FATHER</h2>
<p>As the only Begotten of the Father, the Son is the unique One who has declared God: &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&rdquo; (John 1:18). There is only one declaration, because the Son is the only Begotten. The Son&rsquo;s status as the only Begotten makes His declaration unique. There is only one Son; there is not another Son. Hence, God&rsquo;s declaration is also one. No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son has declared God. When the Son was incarnated, God was manifested among men.</p>
<p>The word <em>bosom</em> in verse 18 implies nearness. When a mother embraces her own child in her bosom, it speaks of her nearness, dearness, and love for the child. What a person places in his bosom is something that is dearly loved. Hence, <em>the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father</em> means that the Lord is the One who is most dear, most loved, and most delightful to the Father. In the universe there is not one who is more dear and lovable to the Father than the Son. The only begotten Son in the bosom of the Father is the One who is most dear, lovely, delightful, and near to the Father.</p>
<p>Because the Son is so dear, lovely, delightful, and near to the Father, when He comes forth to declare the Father, His declaration is complete. The only begotten Son in the bosom of the Father is the One most dear, most loved, and most delightful to the Father; He cannot be any closer to the Father. The Son understands and comprehends all that the Father is and has, including the Father&rsquo;s intention. Therefore, the Son is the expression, the declaration, of God. He declares God in the fullest way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXAMPLES IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2>
<p>The first verse in the introduction to the Gospel of John says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1), and the last verse in the introduction says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&rdquo; (v. 18). Following verse 18 John begins to present case after case to show the Son&rsquo;s declaration of the Father. The entire Gospel of John is a further explanation of this matter.</p>
<p>When a person first reads the Gospel of John, he may think that it is merely the record of a Jewish man. This response is like the reaction of the Samaritan woman in chapter 4. When the Lord Jesus asked her for water, her first thought was related to her realization that a Jewish man was asking a Samaritan woman for water (v. 9). When we first read the Gospel of John, our first thought concerning the Lord Jesus may have been that He was a man. However, when we read it again, we had a deeper sense that the Lord Jesus was different from other men. When we read it a third time, we had a sense that this difference was rather pronounced, and when we read it a fourth time, we had a sense that He was different because God was being expressed through Him.</p>
<p>We often praise the Lord at the table meeting, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, there is love in Your heart, there is grace on Your lips, and Your words are full of grace.&rdquo; Although this utterance is not bad, it is based on our natural concepts. In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus did not always speak sweet words. Sometimes He spoke harsh words. For example, He said, &ldquo;You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father&rdquo; (8:44). Such a word would not cause people to feel that there was love in His heart and grace on His lips. However, even when the Lord spoke harsh words, God was coming forth from Him. His rejoicing was of God, and His weeping was of God. His meekness was of God, and His wrath was of God.</p>
<p>The more we read the Gospel of John, the more we have a sense that all His words and actions were an expression of God. Today many Christians view the Lord Jesus in a limited way. They see only His goodness, sacrifice, and love as a man. These descriptions are not wrong, but they are not complete, because the Lord Jesus was not living according to His human goodness or human love; rather, He was living out God.</p>
<p>In chapter 4 the Lord was tired, hungry, and thirsty, so He went to the well at Sychar. When a woman came to draw water, He conversed with her in words that expressed more than just goodness or mercy. He expressed the omniscient God, the One who knows the secrets of man&rsquo;s heart, but who is also willing to contact sinners! Some may say, &ldquo;His contact with people surely shows His goodness and mercy.&rdquo; I agree that it does. However, if we think that only goodness and love were revealed, we are lacking a full appreciation of Him. We must recognize that His goodness and mercy were declarations of God Himself.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus fed five thousand people with five loaves and two fish, God was certainly expressed. However, those who were around the Lord still spoke foolishly, saying, &ldquo;This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world&rdquo; (6:14). Some may view this case as simply showing the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and compassion for the hungry crowd. Surely the crowd must have thought of Him as being good and merciful. They even came the next day because they had this thought. When they came, however, the Lord did not give them any bread; instead, He said to them, &ldquo;You seek Me not because you have seen signs, but because you ate of the bread and were filled. Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life&rdquo; (vv. 26-27). This word was more than a display of mercy; it was an expression of the God who wanted to be received by man. He wanted people to receive Him.</p>
<p>In chapter 8 the Pharisees brought a sinful woman before the Lord and asked if she should be stoned. The Lord did not reply, because He could say neither yes nor no. In fact, He was not there to declare what was right and what was wrong; He was declaring God. When He finally answered, He said, &ldquo;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her&rdquo; (v. 7). His speaking manifested God. Who is without sin? Only God is without sin. The Pharisees were interested in right and wrong, but the Lord&rsquo;s reply expressed God. After His reply, they all went out one by one, beginning with the older ones. When only the Lord and the woman were left, He asked, &ldquo;Has no one condemned you?&rdquo; (v. 10). She said, &ldquo;No one, Lord.&rdquo; Then the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more&rdquo; (v. 11). Is this merely goodness and mercy? No, this is God being expressed. Even though He was a genuine man, He lived out, expressed, and declared God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DECLARING THE FATHER<br />
BY LIVING ACCORDING TO THE FATHER</h2>
<p>The Lord lived out God because He spoke and worked by the Father. Although He was a Jewish man from Nazareth, He lived a life of denial and rejection. The Lord was rejected and denied not only by others, but even more, He rejected Himself. He said, &ldquo;The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner&rdquo; (5:19). He also said, &ldquo;The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works&rdquo; (14:10). The Lord knew that the Father was in Him; hence, He lived out the Father.</p>
<p>This is the key point of the Gospel of John: in the living and person of a genuine man from Nazareth, only God was declared. No one has ever seen God, but the Son declared Him. The Son could declare God because God lived in Him and was His life, but even more, He could declare God because He did not live by His genuine and perfect human life. The Lord Jesus could have lived by His human life or by the divine life, and of these two possibilities, He chose to live by God. If He had lived by His human life, He would have been independent from God, and He would have failed to express God just as Adam failed. However, the Lord Jesus chose to live by the Father. He was a man who lived by God with the divine life, not by Himself with His human life. Hence, He expressed and declared God.</p>
<p>As we live on the earth, we also face these two possibilities: we can live by ourselves, or we can live by the indwelling God. With the first possibility we can only live out ourselves, but with the second possibility we can live out God. Before the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the only begotten Son was the unique One who declared God. Today there is the need for many sons to declare God. God dwells in us as our life; this is a fact. The only issue that we face is whether or not we will allow the cross to work deeply in us. Through the work of the cross, will we allow our words and actions to be terminated so that He can speak and act in us? May we deny and forsake ourselves, learn to put ourselves under the cross, and not live by ourselves but rather by Him. May we speak by Him and act by Him. If this is our case, God will be declared in us. God&rsquo;s declaration was once possible only through His only begotten Son. Today God can be declared through His many sons. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may learn the lesson of declaring God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
