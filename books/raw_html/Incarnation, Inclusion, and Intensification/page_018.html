<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Bride</H2><P>As such a mystical and organic constitution, the New Jerusalem is the bride&#151;the wife&#151;of the Lamb (Rev. 21:2, 9). This means that the New Jerusalem will be the counterpart of Christ, the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God. On the one-thousand-year wedding day (19:7-9) the New Jerusalem will be only the bride of the Lamb, but in eternity the New Jerusalem will be the Lamb's wife.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Tabernacle</H2><P>The New Jerusalem is also the tabernacle to be the eternal dwelling place of God. Revelation 21:3 says clearly that the New Jerusalem, the holy city, is the tabernacle of God. This indicates that the New Jerusalem is God's dwelling place. God's dwelling place is for His rest in expression. In the New Jerusalem God will have the utmost rest in expression for eternity.</P><P>The tabernacle made by Moses was a type of the New Jerusalem as God's eternal tabernacle (Exo. 25:8-9; Lev. 26:11). This type was first fulfilled in Christ as God's tabernacle among men (John 1:14). He Himself was God's tabernacle. Eventually, the type of the tabernacle will be fulfilled in the fullest way in the New Jerusalem, which will be the enlargement of Christ as God's dwelling place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Temple</H2><P>The New Jerusalem is the temple to be the eternal dwelling place of the glorified saints. Revelation 21:22b says, "The Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple." Since God and the Lamb are the temple, They cannot dwell in it, and it cannot be Their dwelling place. Rather, it is the dwelling place of the glorified saints, who serve the Triune God by dwelling in Him.</P><P>On the one hand, the New Jerusalem, which is composed of all the glorified saints, as the dwelling place of God, is the tabernacle. On the other hand, the New Jerusalem, which is constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God, as the dwelling place of the glorified saints, is the temple. Therefore, the New Jerusalem, being both the tabernacle and the temple, is the mutual dwelling place of the Triune God and the glorified saints.</P>
