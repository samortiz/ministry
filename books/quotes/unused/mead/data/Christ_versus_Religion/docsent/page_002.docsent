   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE CHRIST THE BRIDEGROOM Scripture Reading: Matt 9:14-15; Luke 5:29-30, 33-35</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From the record of Matthew we see that all things related to Christ took place outside of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In that day, Judaism was the genuine religion, the religion founded according to God's Holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But everything concerning Christ took place outside of that.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In other words, Christ had nothing to do with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>CHRIST'S BIRTH OUTSIDE OF RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The record of Matthew chapter 1 tells how the birth of Christ was accomplished outside of Jerusalem, away from the temple, having nothing to do with the holy priests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God did not send the angel Gabriel to the family of the priests; God did not send Gabriel to someone praying in the temple in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God sent His angel to a little town in a despised country, Nazareth of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He sent him to a girl, a virgin, in a poor family.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Practically everything related to this girl and her situation was outside of Jerusalem, the temple, the holy priesthood, the typical and genuine religion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The birth of Christ has nothing to do with religion; it is absolutely accomplished outside of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You may say that Jesus was conceived in Nazareth, but born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if we look into the record carefully with the light of the Holy Spirit, we see that this was accomplished in a hidden way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may even say that He was born there "sneakily," just to fulfill the prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was suddenly brought to Bethlehem to be born, and then, just as suddenly, He was brought away.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The birth of Christ has nothing to do with anything religious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>CHRIST FOUND OUTSIDE OF RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Matthew chapter 2 then proceeds to tell us how people found this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was not found in religion, neither was He found by any religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was not found in Jerusalem, He was not found in the temple, neither was He found by any priest or any holy people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are all familiar with the account of the heavenly star appearing in a pagan country to people with no Bible and no genuine religion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We know also how those heathen wise men exercised their natural mind, concluding that the King of the Jews should be born in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In so doing, they caused many young lives to be taken.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But eventually they found Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They found Him mainly not according to Biblical knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You remember that when they came to Jerusalem, King Herod called the scribes and the Pharisees, those who had the knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They all gave Herod the proper and exact quotation, Micah chapter 5, verse 2, telling that Christ would be born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They had the knowledge, they had the exact scriptural references, but none of them went to see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were for the Scriptures, they were for the Bible, but they were not for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They paid attention to Micah 5:2, foretelling the coming of Christ and even the birthplace of Christ; yet, when the news came of Christ's birth, none of them went to behold it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Christian religion today is exactly the same in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>People talk about the Bible and have the knowledge concerning Christ, but rarely do you find one who really cares for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They care for the Bible, they care for the prophecies, but they do not care for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Praise the Lord, there were some pagans from a pagan land who did care for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The record of Matthew tells us that after they departed from Jerusalem, the star appeared to them again.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I tell you, when you leave the denominations, when you leave the Christian religion, the star is there.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hallelujah, the star is there!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When you get into religion, you miss the star, you miss the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When you go to the religious people, when you attempt to follow the dead letter of the Scripture, you miss the heavenly star and can never find Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the wise men departed from Jerusalem, lo, the star appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How good it is to have a heavenly star!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then they found Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The finding of Jesus is absolutely outside of religion.</S>
