   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AVOIDING INVOLVEMENT IN PROBLEMS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY TURNING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Throughout all the years in the past and in all the places I have been, I have learned this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all have a heart for the Lord, we have seen the vision of the church, and we desire to practice the genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, in our real situation there are still troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The unique source of all the troubles is that often we are not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we are in the spirit, even when there are problems in the church, we are not bothered and we do not get involved with them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we are not in the spirit, though, we only add more fuel to the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I believe that this is what was in the spirit of Paul as he wrote the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As he wrote this Epistle, he was clear that the church life can be realized only in spirit and in love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we have seen, the phrase in spirit is mentioned several times in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul also uses another phrase, in love 3:17; 4:2, 15-16; 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should bring all the problems to the Lord and turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then we will view the problems from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not that the situation will change.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The situation will be the same, but our view will be different, because we will look at it from another angle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, we will be kept from involvement in the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will not need others to rescue us from the problems, but we will be in the position to rescue others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we see a problem between brothers or sisters, we may have the good intention to help the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, we need to realize that if we are in the soul and not in the spirit, there is the danger that we may get involved with the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Originally the problem may have involved only two persons, but if we get involved in our soul, more people will be added to the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will only add more fuel to the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As long as we are in our soul, we will only get involved negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is in this way that Satan, the subtle one, takes the ground to increase and enlarge the problems in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, we should be quiet and cool down our mind and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we must go to the Lord in the spirit to wait on Him in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not exercise the mind or the emotion; we should simply contact the Lord in the spirit for a certain amount of time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we will see the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The situation may not change, but our view will change, and with this view we will be kept away from negative involvement.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We will be in a position to help and even rescue the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This comes by our not being in the soul but being in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we look at matters with our mind, we will have a certain point of view, but if we look at them with a spirit of wisdom and revelation, we will have a different view.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We always need to turn to the spirit, and we need to have a spirit that is full of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In addition, we need our spirit to be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must be stronger in the spirit than in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We also need our mind to be subdued under the control of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For our spirit to be the spirit of our mind is genuine transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we consider a certain brother with our mind, we may be disgusted with him and think he is hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must learn the lesson to realize that our poor, troublesome mind needs to be subdued by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to turn to the spirit, look to the Lord, and have our mind subdued by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do this, then we will look at the same brother from our spirit and be full of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The brother may still be the same, and his situation may not have changed, but our view will change because we will look at him from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not a mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is something we can put into practice in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sometimes after exercising my mind I have asked the Lord, Be merciful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do not want to be in the outer court or even in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I want to be in the Holiest Place in Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By being in the presence of the Lord in this way, my view was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Ephesians 1 our spirit is enlightened and filled with wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In chapter 3 our spirit is strengthened, and in chapter 4 our spirit subdues and takes over our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then in chapter 5 our spirit is filled with Christ, who is the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are filled not with something for the body, but even the more we are filled with God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Finally in chapter 6 we pray at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are in the mind it is impossible to pray at every time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The more a brother considers his wife with his mind, the more he is unable to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This kind of exercise of the mind keeps him from praying.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, if he turns back to the spirit and considers things from the spirit, he will pray at every time in spirit with all prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am so grateful for the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Ephesians presents a proper order, a sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>First, our spirit is enlightened to be a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then it is strengthened, and it brings the mind under its control.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Following this it is filled with Christ as the fullness of God, and it becomes a praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If this is our condition, we will have no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The real building up of the church can be realized only in this kind of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Eventually, we will be the habitation of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How much we always need to turn to our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should not receive this merely as a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We need to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whenever there is a problem in the church with the brothers and sisters, we must practice to turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should never try to reason.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Reasoning gets us nowhere.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Likewise, we should not try to debate, for debating only brings in more confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Rather, we must learn to quiet our mind, cool down our emotion, and turn to our spirit to stay in the presence of the Lord for a certain time concerning all the problems before us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then to be sure, we will have another view of the situation, and we will be kept from negative involvements.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We will be in a position to rescue those who are involved and be a real help to the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>BEING RESTRICTED BY OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>TO HAVE A BALANCED RELATEDNESS IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>On the positive side, we will be very related to all the others who are also in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Our real relatedness is in the spirit, and this relatedness in the spirit is the true building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Sometimes we see in the church that certain ones are too related to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is not the genuine relatedness but something natural.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It simply indicates that the persons involved are not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we are in the spirit, we will not be overly related.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Rather, we will be related to a proper extent, because whenever we are in the spirit, there is always the proper restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We will realize that we can love and deal with a brother only to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In our spirit there is both a release and a restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In this way we are kept from being overly related with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we do not have this balance in the spirit, we will eventually have divided and divisive parties among the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>One group of brothers will be overly related; another group will be related among themselves but not to the first group.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We all must reject both being unrelated and being overly related.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We must have a balanced relatedness.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Whether or not we like a certain brother, we need to have the proper relatedness in our spirit, and at the same time this relatedness must be restricted by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Then we will have the proper and genuine relatedness with all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Whether or not we like someone, we still need to keep the balanced relatedness in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Then whether we are happy with the brothers or not happy, there will be no parties.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Rather, the relatedness among us will always be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Through this kind of balanced relatedness we will have the genuine building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
