   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR ONE IN SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the first message we saw that Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chapter one reveals that the way to experience Christ is through keeping ourselves in the fellowship in the gospel by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we would remain in the fellowship in the gospel by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, we need to be in one spirit with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Philippians the special point regarding the experience of Christ is this matter of being with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Being one in soul is not only for the experience of Christ, but even the more for the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our experience of Christ should also be an enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, children may eat food under the threat of being disciplined if they do not eat, but they may not enjoy what they are eating.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise, if we are merely in one spirit, we may experience Christ and yet not enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To experience Christ with enjoyment we need to be in one spirit with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A PROPER SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the Bible, the soul is for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To have enjoyment, we need desires, emotions, and feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more emotional we are, the more we shall long for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Enjoyment is mainly related to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to enjoy Christ, we need to have a proper soul, a soul that is one with the souls of other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to ask ourselves whether we are many souls or just one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every soul has an opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If in one place there are five hundred souls, then there will be five hundred opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if we all have different opinions, we shall lose our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If everyone in a family, for example, has the same opinion, that family will have a wonderful time of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if the father, the mother, and the children have different opinions, there will be no enjoyment in that family.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we all have one opinion, the situation among us will be heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not have any opinions, we are not human.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be human is to be opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Opinion, however, is not a bad word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Bible, a human being is not called a spirit or a body, but a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, the Bible says that seventy souls of the family of Jacob went down to Egypt Gen 46:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, the New Testament says that three thousand souls were added Acts 2:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, a person is a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The basic element of the soul is opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, if you had no opinions, you would not be a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The strongest person is the one who has the strongest opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By a person's opinions you can know how strong he is psychologically.</S>
