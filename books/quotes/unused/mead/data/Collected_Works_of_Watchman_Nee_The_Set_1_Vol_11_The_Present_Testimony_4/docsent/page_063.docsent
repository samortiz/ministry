   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WAY THE WORKERS HANDLE THEIR FINANCES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, workers should not make others feel that they are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A worker lives by faith, not by alms giving.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is a shame to let others know that you are poor with the hope of receiving support.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a worker receives a supply from the brothers, he should have the proper attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a worker receives money from the brothers, he is receiving this money on God's behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He stands on God's side and represents God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, he should not have a beggarly attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Paul mentioned the matter of money, he gave others an honorable and respectable impression.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the proper attitude for every worker.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second, whenever any worker receives more than other workers, he should distribute the excess to the other workers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not be afraid that by doing this, others will misunderstand and think that you are rich or have struck a fortune.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, for personal family needs, there is sometimes the necessity of short-term savings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Proverbs teaches this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Third, there must be some planning in the way one uses his money.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many people buy useless things when they have money.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kind of behavior will stop God's supply.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One has to plan the way he uses his money.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One must have a budget and carefully consider before God what he should and should not buy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He should not buy carelessly and waste money.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fourth, workers must never borrow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A worker of God should prefer to die than borrow from others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If he does not have the faith that his living will be cared for, he should look for some work to sustain his living.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If he has the faith that God will sustain him, he should not stretch out his hand to others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE PRINCIPLE OF MANNA</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today, God desires that we walk according to the principle of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The principle of manna is: "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack" 2 Cor 8:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is not just the record in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The New Testament tells us the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Being in excess and being in want are both wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a brother in a locality cannot get by and has no means to support his living, either the church or individual believers should help him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church cannot sit there and do nothing for the brothers who are unemployed; it must do its best to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Of course, this does not include those who will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We cannot help those who are not willing to work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can only help those who are willing to work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moreover, if the earning of a brother is not enough to support his living, the church must again come in to help.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The same is true with those whose income is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was this kind of work that the apostles did in the early church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The order for helping is to care for the brothers and sisters in your locality first, and then to help the poor people outside.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If believers have close family members who have needs, they should care for the needs of their own relatives first, before caring for the needs of other people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No one should give offerings without first having some careful consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A naturally loose person will not receive the Lord's blessing through excessive giving, because a person who is loose with his finances will surely be loose in the things of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to learn to be a consecrated person before the Lord, not a loose person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For a believer, giving is not a matter of simply offering money.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One must have a proper living before God before his giving can receive God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The third Epistle of John mentions that the saints who support the workers need to have a living worthy of God and one that is in a godly manner.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A person who gives must live a life that is worthy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thank the Lord that everyone is not a Lazarus, and everyone is not a rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God does not need Lazarus, nor does He need the rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He only needs the offerings of those whose living is worthy of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although Lazarus did not have money, he could be saved; he could receive grace and live a life worthy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The flesh has two sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One is the severe treatment of the body mentioned in Colossians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The other is to indulge oneself in comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God has no intention for us to treat our body severely, but neither does He want us to live too comfortably.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He wants us to live a life that is worthy of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All excess money should be given away as quickly as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>X. THE LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The last thing to mention is the letter of recommendation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul mentioned this to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is something found in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When an ordinary believer goes to a new locality, he should have a letter of recommendation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Paul mentioned in his Epistle that he himself did not need a letter of recommendation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is because Paul had already built up a relationship with the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is why he was an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As to the other brothers and sisters, a letter of recommendation was still necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The function of the letter is twofold.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>First, it allows others to know you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Second, it prevents false brothers from coming in. Every letter of recommendation should be witnessed by two or three persons before it can be validated.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Usually a letter of recommendation is written by the local elders or the responsible persons.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There are three kinds of letters:</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>1 Those that recommend a brother to the Lord's table, attesting that he is a brother in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is mainly for the brothers who are still in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>2 Those that recommend that a brother has left the denominations and is taking the way we take.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>3 In addition to those taking this way, there are those who have special gifts and can be invited to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After receiving a letter of recommendation, the local responsible ones should send a letter of reply to the sending locality, verifying that the letter of recommendation was received.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Such letters of recommendation and replies should be prepared ahead of time and printed according to a standard form, so that they can be used easily.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Every time a brother comes from another locality, he needs to give us a letter of recommendation before we can receive him at the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We will likewise furnish those who go out from us with a letter of recommendation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I hope that we all will pay attention to this matter in the future.</S>
