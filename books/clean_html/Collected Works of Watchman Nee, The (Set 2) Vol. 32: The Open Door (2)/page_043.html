<h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Thank the Lord! I went out with Brother Chai Tze-chung and worked for about two months and learned many lessons. Presently, Brother Tsai is still working in Ping-Tan and Fu-Ching. May the Lord fill him and use him and gain more glory and men through him, amen. Since the meeting in Fu-Ching moved back to its original location, work has become easier, and the spiritual condition of the saints has improved. Thank the Lord. Glory to Him, amen. Thank Him that the brothers and sisters in Dong-Jang have been baptized and are breaking bread. They are all advancing well. Glory to the Lord, amen. Satan has been doing all kinds of work here and has used some sons of disturbance to falsely accuse Brother Liang (a responsible brother) through an anonymous person (who does not exist), with the intention of destroying the Lord's work. Lord, forgive us and deliver us from the enemy, destroy the counsel of Ahithophel, and turn Balaam's curse into blessing, amen. The brothers and sisters in Yu-Si are very diligent in their pursuit of the Lord. Thank the Lord that the result of the work is good. Although the force of darkness is strong, we can break through it by trusting in our victorious Lord.</p><p>Brother Chen Jai-seng, August 10</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Dear Brother Nee in the Lord:</p><p>During the Overcomer Conference in Chuenchow four years ago, I received much help and have never forgotten it. It is God's leading to put me on the pathway of victory. Since our departure I have visited brothers and testified in Pu-Tien and Han River. I also went to preach the gospel in Yu-Si and Fu-Ching. Later, I worked in Lia River and then returned to Fu-Ching to do some pioneering work. The Lord attracted many to Him through miracles, works of wonders, healings, and the casting out of demons. Some co-workers also went to these places to conduct revival meetings, and many brothers and sisters have turned to obey the Lord, remember Him, build up the churches, and glorify His name. I also did some pioneering work in Dong-Jang, and the Lord came forth in casting out demons and healing the sick and led some to Himself. I was in Tung-An and Kulangsu and in other places. Thank the Lord. Although I cannot do much, the Lord has been gracious! Later, Brother Yeh Shi-jien invited me to do pioneering work in Chang-Pu. The Lord has given me peace in traveling over land and water. Lately I have been continuing my work in Sister Chen Hwang Ren-ai's house in Dun-Bing. There are seven places in Chang-Pu ready for the establishing of churches. Please pray much for this, and please give me instruction as to how to go on. Peace to you in the Lord. Please give my regards to your parents.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Bing-hsi, August 14</p><h2 class="head2">Letter from Chen Chin-fa, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Is the Gospel Book Room in Hankow still in operation? How are the brothers and sisters? I have been thinking of them much. The churches in Yung-Jia, Ping-Yang, Rue-An, and Foo-Ding have been preserved by the Lord and are at peace. But the brothers and sisters are not as spiritually living as before. It seems as if a cold and dry atmosphere has pervaded us. Under this condition, we feel that we are so inadequate in the work and realize that we cannot move anything forward! Perhaps God is testing us and showing us that the result of the work does not depend on activity but on the satisfaction of God's will. As long as it is from God, it is good. Although the internal work with the believers has been somewhat cold, the external work of preaching the gospel has been very blessed. From July 5 to 18, Brothers Chou Da-ching, Lin Chu-chien, Lee Shu-ren, Hwang Deh-en, and a few brothers from Hu-Shan preached the gospel in Chao-Yang-Shan. The result was good. A house has been rented, and meetings have begun. Over twenty people have received the Lord and are coming every Lord's Day to meetings. Presently, the brothers from Hu-Shan are still going there to help them. Hopefully, a proper local church will be established in the near future.</p><p>On July 27 Brother Lee Shu-ren and a few other brothers began preaching the gospel in Tah-Gang and in Bei-Gang. The opportunity was great and many were moved by the word. Many also received the Lord. But we have not started any meetings. May the Lord raise up more workers to go there to reap the ripened harvest. Brothers Chou Da-ching, Lin Zen-wu, Yang Li-ren, Su Ti-shen, and Jin Tze-fang will soon preach the gospel in Fen-Shui-Kwan, Yueh-Hu-Yang. May the Lord be with them in their work. I intend to visit the brothers and sisters in Tai-Shun with Brother Hwang Li-chuan. Then we will go through Tai-Shun to Rue-An, Da-Xue, and Shin-Teng to do some work there. Please pray for this work. Brother Lee Shu-ren intends to bring another brother to preach the gospel in Die-Shi and Wu-Li-Pai, the border region between Ping-Yang and Tai-Shun. Then they will come to work in Ping-Yang, Wenchow, and Wu-Yi through Fu-Ting. Brothers Hsu Dah-wei and Chou Shing-yi will come to Ping-Yang from Shanghai and will stay at the meeting place in Shia-Kwan in Pu-Men-Jen. Brother Chai Chi's health is the same as before. Brother Chuang Kwang-po is very weak. Brother Pan Huo-ling has gone to the Lord.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Chin-fa, August 24</p>
