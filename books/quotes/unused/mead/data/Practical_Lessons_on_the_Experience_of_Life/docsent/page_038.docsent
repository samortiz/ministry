   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ANOINTING TEACHING US CONCERNING ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christians today often speak of doing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thirty-five years ago I also spoke in this way, but now I say that to speak of God's will in this way is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may illustrate God's will in this way: If someone comes to me and asks me what my will is, I may reply, "Do you really mean business about doing my will?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If so, here is my will," and I will begin to paint him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My will is to make him a painted person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Similarly, if a brother asks me, "What color do you want me to have?", I will indicate what color I want by painting it on him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By my painting, he knows what color I want.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the same way, if we ask the Lord what His will is about getting married, He will paint us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By this painting we will know His will about marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First John 2:27 says, "And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What does it mean that the anointing teaches us?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It means that the painting teaches us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are such foolish people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We always think that God is in the heavens, far from us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may foolishly pray, "Should I go to college in San Francisco or in Los Angeles?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>O Lord, tell me and prove it to me by the outward environment."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I prayed in this way when I was young.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever I prayed to seek the Lord's will, I prostrated myself on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was so humble and said, "Lord, You are so high, and I am so low."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the natural way to pray without any revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today when I seek the Lord's will, there is no need to bow down, kneel, or prostrate myself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever I say, "Lord, what must I do?", He paints me, that is, He anoints me with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A brother may ask, "Tell me whether or not I should get married.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Tell me in plain English words."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, the Lord will answer this prayer neither in English nor in Chinese, but with "paint"; He will simply paint him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By this anointing he knows what the Lord wants him to do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The next day he may ask, "Should I eat Chinese food or American food?" or "Should I buy a suit and shoes?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Again the answer will come by painting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord's teaching and His speaking are the painting, the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Read 1 John 2:27 again; it says that His anointing teaches us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After a month's time the brother will be full of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He will be a "painted" person, full of "paint."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is exactly the meaning of this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we ask the Lord what to do, He simply says, "Let Me anoint you."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After this kind of painting, knowing what to do is secondary; the primary thing is that we have more paint.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>GOD'S INTENTION BEING TO ANOINT US WITH HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many times when I was young, I was bothered that we are not very obedient to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many times we know the Lord's will, but we are not willing to obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Later though, I was happy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I said, "Lord, whether I obey or disobey, as long as You anoint me, I have the ointment."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we ask about the Lord's will concerning marriage, He will paint us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After this painting, whether or not we agree with Him, we have been painted.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we obey, we are painted, and if we do not obey, we are still painted.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our aim is to do something, but His aim is the painting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our aim and intention are to know God's will, but His intention is to anoint us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may disobey His will, but as long as He anoints us, He is happy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's intention is not for us to obey His will and do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God's intention is to anoint us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I know many real stories along this line.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A young man was saved and began to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then one day he wanted to go to the movies again.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He prayed, "Lord, is it right for me to go to the movies?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We cannot find the word movie in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In a peculiar way, we may dream about whether or not to go to the movies, but God may never tell us His will concerning movies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, since we seek the Lord's will, He may say, "Do you wish to know My will about movies?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All right, I will simply paint you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I will anoint you within."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This young man had a certain anointing within him, and this anointing, this moving within, gave him the understanding that it was not right to go to the movies.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, he eventually went.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He disobeyed, so he became sorrowful, and he came and confessed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I told him, "Praise the Lord, brother, I am so happy that you disobeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>That you disobeyed means that you knew God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How did you know God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Did you find movie in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Rather, you sensed it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As long as you sensed it, that is good.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This means God anointed you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Regardless of whether you obeyed or disobeyed, the painting was accomplished."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What is the painting?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is the imparting, the applying, of God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, I told the young brother, "Brother, I am very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I believe that after this you will have more of God in you.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Before yesterday you may have had only a little of the element of God within you, but this morning I realize that there is more of God's element within you.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I don't care whether you obeyed or disobeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I just care whether or not God has been painted in you."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The brother asked, "Then what about the next time?"</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I said, "Brother, do not worry about next time; just go on."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God's intention is to paint us with Himself as the paint.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is rather hard for God to speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Sometimes we say that God speaks to us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>That is right, but we all know that this kind of speaking is not in clear words, neither in Chinese nor English, nor in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In what way does God speak to us?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is by painting us with Himself by moving, acting, working, and operating within us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In this sense, the Lord does not care whether or not we obey His word.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As long as we come to Him and seek His will, He will paint us; that is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He cares not for our marriage or schooling but for this painting.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He wants to make us painted persons, full of paint.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Whether or not we marry is not what matters.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>One day in the New Jerusalem the Lord will not see our wife or our BA, MA, or Ph.D.; He will see only His painting.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He cares about this one thing, that is, that He paints us with Himself.</S>
