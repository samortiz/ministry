[Address omitted]</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chai Tse-chung<br />October 29</p><h2 class="head2">Chung-Shan, Kwangtung Province</h2><p>To my respected Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I trust that you received the last letter. Presently, Sister Roh-chen is still in Chung-Shan. Since Mr. Kaung and Mrs. Nee went to Hong Kong, we continue to have meetings every night at my home. I use Bible Studies for Beginners to teach the attendants. Mr. Kaung sent this book to me from Hong Kong. There are now thirteen people who are clearly saved. One of the brothers named Wu is working at my uncle's shop. After he received the Lord, he was filled with joy. Although others scolded and mocked him, he did not fight back; rather, he sang hymns.</p><p>Those in Sha-Yung Village, like my sister-in-law, her mother, and the two Mrs. Mas, cannot come to our meetings in the evening. For their sake, we have meetings every Tuesday and Friday afternoon from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. at the house of my sister-in-law's mother. Bible Studies for Beginners is also used for these meetings. Village folks cannot read too well, but God has blessed this book. They have received much help from this book. May the Lord bless His own work and do great things here in this locality. Please pray for us. Thank and praise the Lord that He has been merciful to my family. All of Satan's work in my family has failed. My father's illness has gone, and my responsibility at home has been reduced. I have received much of God's grace during the past year. I am most unworthy, but God has placed me here to learn the lessons that I should learn. I have not learned them well, and I have often failed and faltered. I have failed Him. I am wicked, yet His love towards me has never changed. I cannot help but thank and praise Him! There are many things that I do not understand, and there are many things that I have to learn. Please instruct me as to what my future should be. I have very little experience in spiritual things, and I hope that you will give me much help and instruction. In Chung-Shan many people like to listen to Mr. Kaung's preaching. If he comes again, I am sure that many more will turn to the Lord. May the Lord lead him to come again so that many will receive God's salvation. Peace to you in the Lord! Greet Sister Phoebe Chang!</p><p>Sister Kuo Hai-jen<br />December 1<br /> [Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Ping-Du, Shantung Province</h2><p>Dear X, God's faithful worker:</p><p>Peace to you in the Lord! I have not been able to talk to you face to face for two years, but spiritually I have always been with you. Last spring I was sent by the Lord to preach the gospel to over twenty counties in Shantung province. Since the military invasion in northern China in July of this year, soldiers have been everywhere. It has become difficult to preach the gospel in these places. Fifty to sixty percent of the businesses and residents in Yien-Jie have moved to other places. Most of the schools have suspended their classes. I took my family and moved to Ping-Du. I intend to go to the south and thought about starting a milk store. If there is a suitable place and if the almighty God permits it, I will move there for a few years. I hope that you can reply to my letter. Peace to your whole family. Please give my greetings to the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Tsou Sing-wu<br />[Address omitted]</p>
