   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Recovering the Authority of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Deal with the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In serving the Lord, on the one hand, the brothers and sisters have to learn to be obedient and to take the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once the Holy Spirit operates, the cross will function within a person's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the other hand, the authority of the church needs to be recovered; this deals with the flesh and deals with those who will not take the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order for the work of the church to be recovered, there is first the need for the recovery of the one-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to recover the work of the church, there must also be the recovery of the authority of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not enough to recover the one-talented ones alone, and it is not enough to recover the authority of the church alone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If all the one-talented ones will rise up, in a short time we will be able to take over China.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Who can withstand the mobilization of all the one-talented ones?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If God will do this work among us, we will see an unprecedented work of salvation among us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the same time, the brothers and sisters have to learn to listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If they do not listen, the church will fall into confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Naturally, the young and the new believers have many things that they do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more advanced and mature brothers and sisters should exhort them to listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are people with a very small capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to our disposition, we do things when we feel like doing them, and we go home and sleep when we do not feel like doing them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, in the Body today, whether you like it or not, you have to do what you should do.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if you have to cry with tears or sacrifice yourself, you still have to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Co-workers, brothers, we have to receive something from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We cannot let anyone slip by.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We cannot be so foolish in our work as to be unable even to tell the real believers from the false ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot leave a person alone for three to five months after baptism without rendering the proper care to him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are our brothers' keepers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who do not act as their brothers' keepers are those who murder their brothers Gen 4:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>C. Everyone Handing Over Himself, Everyone Working, and Everyone Submitting to Authority</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do these things, a church according to Pentecost will soon appear.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If everyone hands himself over, if everyone is learning and working, and if everyone offers up his material riches and is obedient, we will have the proper coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I hope to see this situation not only in one or two places, but throughout the entire nation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During the war, we had over four hundred co-workers among us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the material supply had been adequate, we could have increased the number to a thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whether in the east or in the west, most of the ones who are actually doing some kind of works are our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Chekiang, there are over ninety co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the one province of Fukien alone, we see God's blessings everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The foolish ones only see what they have in their hands; they do not have eyes for the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today we have to enlarge our view.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In China today, there are close to a thousand churches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But what is that to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need tens of thousands of churches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>D. Everyone Needing the Training</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the brothers and sisters in the church have to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What we need today is not theology, but education in the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When a local church is young, there is no way for the brothers and sisters to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But when a church is strong and rich, there will be much work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By that time, even if all the young saints put themselves into the work, there will still be a shortage of manpower.</S>
