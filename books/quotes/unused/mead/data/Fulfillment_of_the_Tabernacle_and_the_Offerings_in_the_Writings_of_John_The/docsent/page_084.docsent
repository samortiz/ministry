   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE THE SIGNS IN JOHN EIGHT 2 Scripture Reading: John 8 A REVIEW OF THE SIGNS IN CHAPTERS ONE THROUGH SEVEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter one of the Gospel of John there are six signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From 1:1 and 14 we see that the eternal God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This took place in time, not in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This incarnated God, God in the flesh, is the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This One is also the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both the tabernacle and the Lamb of God are signs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to 1:32, John the Baptist testified of Christ, saying, "I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here we see that the Dove is upon the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later, when Simon was brought to the Lord Jesus, the Lord said to him, "You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas which translated means a stone " 1:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This stone is also a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1:51 the Lord said to Nathaniel that he would see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we see that the Son of Man is the heavenly ladder, and this ladder is related to Bethel, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In chapter one we have the incarnated God as the tabernacle and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through the Lamb we have the Dove, the Spirit, by whom we become stones for the building of God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, chapter one begins with the eternal Word and issues in Bethel, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the extract of chapter one of John.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In chapter two we have the sign of changing water into wine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we have pointed out, this signifies changing death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this chapter we also have the sign of the raising up of the destroyed temple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This sign indicates that in resurrection God's dwelling place is enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In chapter three an elderly, respected, learned gentleman comes to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord indicated that even such a person has a serpentine nature and needs Christ, the incarnated One, to die on the cross as his substitute for his redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, the Lord indicated in this chapter that this gentleman needed to be regenerated in order to become part of the bride as Christ's universal increase.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In chapter four we have the case of an immoral Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although she was not satisfied in her human life, she pretended to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But her worship was not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus told her that He is the fountain of living water to satisfy her and also the reality for her to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In chapter five the impotent man, who had been ill for thirty-eight years, was enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this chapter we see that the Lord Jesus annulled all religious things, such as the holy city and the pool of Bethesda.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the revelation in this chapter, nothing and no one should replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only He avails to enliven us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not even the Scriptures can convey life to us apart from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we need to come to Him for life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the Lord annulled the religious things in chapter five, He presented Himself as the bread of life to the hungry ones in chapter six.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the bread of life, the living and true bread of God that came down from heaven, He can nourish us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In chapter seven we see that the Lord Jesus is the living water to quench our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 7:37 He cried out and said, "If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink."</S>
