   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Exercising Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We also need to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A loving heart is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In addition to a loving heart, we need a renewed, receiving spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We had a human spirit before we were saved, but it was deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Ephesians 2:1 Paul says that we were dead in offenses and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This surely means that we were dead not in our body or in our soul but in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While we were living in our body, we were deadened in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we were saved, the Lord Jesus enlivened our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, we now have an enlivened and renewed spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You may feel that it is difficult to discern the difference between your spirit and your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead of trying to analyze the difference, we can recognize the difference according to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we consider how sweet and precious the Lord Jesus is and how much He has done for us, we may become stirred in our emotion and say, Lord Jesus, I love You!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is an expression of our loving heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we can sense that deep within something other than our heart has been exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just as we know that we have two feet by using them to walk, we know that we have a spirit by exercising our spirit to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One of the best ways to use our spirit to contact the Lord is to call, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we exercise our spirit in this way, we have the sense of something moving deep within our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That something is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In his subtlety, Satan has hidden this matter of the human spirit from most Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When many believers read the Bible, they do not exercise their spirit but exercise only their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we read the Bible, we need to exercise our spirit as well as our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should never neglect our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not exercise our spirit, we cannot be proper Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is tragic that Christians are taught to take care of the mind but not to care for the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many care either for fundamental teachings or for Pentecostal gifts, but according to history teachings and gifts have not been effective in building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of course, teachings and gifts have some value, but the main thing we need today is the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the most crucial, vital, and prevailing thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Corinthians speaks not only of gifts but also of many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, in chapter three Paul talks about food and growth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 2 says, I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But neither yet now are you able.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 6 he goes on to say, I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not a word concerning gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 12:13 Paul says, For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this verse Paul says that we have been positioned to drink of one Spirit, but he says nothing about gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another crucial verse in 1 Corinthians is 15:45b: The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many readers of 1 Corinthians appreciate the word in chapters twelve and fourteen about speaking in tongues and prophecy but neglect 15:45b.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Which do you prefer speaking in tongues or Christ as the life-giving Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we compare the life-giving Spirit to speaking in tongues, we can say that the life-giving Spirit is like gold and that speaking in tongues is like brass.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 13:1 Paul says, If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates a sound without life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we speak in the tongues of men and of angels and yet have no life in our spirit, this speaking is like sounding brass.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul s word here indicates that speaking in tongues is not a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Speaking in tongues is not an expression of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At this juncture, we need to consider Paul s way of speaking in 1 Corinthians 7.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In contrast to many in today s Pentecostalism, Paul did not say, Thus saith the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, in verse 25 he said, I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who has been shown mercy by the Lord to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The expression Thus saith the Lord is taken from the Old Testament, but it is not used by the New Testament writers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Peter, Paul, and John did not use this expression.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead of following Pentecostalism to adopt Old Testament expressions, we should learn to exercise our spirit to be one spirit with the Lord 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that we need to realize that, in His inward recovery by life, He has given us a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Putting His Spirit into Their Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Ezekiel 36:27 says, I will put My Spirit within you NASB .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here we see that the Lord said not only that He will give us a new heart and a new spirit but that He will put His Spirit in us, putting His Spirit into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not neglect our spirit, because our spirit is the vessel which contains the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When believers hear the word spirit , they usually think of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They seldom consider that they have a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yes, we need the Holy Spirit, but we need to realize that the Holy Spirit is in our regenerated human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Praise the Lord that we have a new heart and a new spirit and that we have the Holy Spirit within our spirit strengthening us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This enables us to keep God s commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God s commandments are according to His nature, and we have the nature of God within us because we have His Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now there is something within us that corresponds to God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God s Spirit within us contains God s nature, and God s nature corresponds to God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Because we have God s nature within us, it is easy for us to keep His law.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Formerly it was difficult for us to love others, but now it is easy to love others and difficult to hate them because we have a new nature, God s nature, within us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>THE LAND BECOMING LIKE THE GARDEN OF EDEN</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In 36:34-36 the Lord promised that the desolate and waste places would become like the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There the plant of renown 34:29 , Christ as the tree of life, would be their rich supply.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The local churches need to reach such a high condition that they are like the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even today, often in the church meetings we have the sense that we are in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>INCREASING THEM WITH MEN LIKE A FLOCK</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Ezekiel 36:37-38 says, Thus saith the Lord God; I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Here the Lord promised that He would bring in flocks of people.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although He has promised to do this, we still need to inquire of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This means that we need to pray for the increase, saying, O Lord, flock people in. You promised this to us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the past, whenever we prayed for an increase of number, the Lord answered.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I feel that we need to pray more.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord promised, yet He needs our inquiring.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He promised that He will increase our number by flocks of men, but we need to pray for this and ask Him to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I hope that the saints in all the local churches will pray definitely and specifically for the increase of numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should never be content with our present number.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Rather, we should all aspire to be doubled within a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Thus, we need to pray, Lord, flock people in.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In 1963 in Los Angeles, we had only twenty to thirty people, but after we prayed for six months, the number was greatly increased.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In Elden Hall we also prayed that the Lord would flock people in. We prayed, Lord, bring flocks of men to us, and the Lord heard this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I feel that today we need to pray even more, standing upon and claiming Ezekiel 36:37-38 concerning the increase of numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We should not say that numbers do not mean anything and that we do not care for numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We should not comfort ourselves with any failure in the matter of increase.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We surely need the increase in numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We need to pray for the increase, claiming the Lord s promise in Ezekiel 36.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When some hear this, they may say that they care not for quantity but for quality.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, quality comes out of quantity.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Therefore, we need to pray that the Lord will give us the increase and that He will bring in flocks of men.</S>
