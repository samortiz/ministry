<p class="bold">WEEK 18 — DAY 3</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 25:14-18</h2><p class="bold">14 &nbsp;For the kingdom of the heavens is just like a <sup>1</sup>man about to go <sup>1</sup>abroad, who called his own <sup>2</sup>slaves and delivered to them <sup>3</sup>his possessions.</p><p>15 &nbsp;To one he gave five <sup>1</sup>talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his <sup>2</sup>own ability. And he went abroad.</p><p class="bold">16 &nbsp;Immediately he who had received the five talents went and <sup>1</sup>traded with them and <sup>2</sup>gained another five.</p> <p class="bold">17 &nbsp;Similarly, he who had received the two gained another two.</p> <p class="bold">18 &nbsp;But he who had received the <sup>1</sup>one went off and <sup>2</sup>dug in the earth and <sup>3</sup>hid his master’s money.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>14<sup>1</sup> The man here signifies Christ, who was about to go abroad, into the heavens.</p><p>14<sup>2</sup> Slaves signify believers viewed from the aspect of service (1 Cor. 7:22-23; 2 Pet. 1:1; James 1:1; Rom. 1:1). The believers’ status in relation to Christ is of two aspects: in life they are virgins living for Him; in service, in work, they are His purchased slaves serving Him.</p><p>14<sup>3</sup> His possessions signifies the church (Eph. 1:18) with all the believers, who constitute God’s household (24:45).</p><p>15<sup>1</sup> A talent, the largest unit of weight, was worth 6,000 denarii (see note 7<sup>1</sup> in John 6). In the parable of the virgins, oil signifies the Spirit of God (vv. 3-4), whereas in this parable, talents signify spiritual gifts (Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 12:4; 1 Pet. 4:10; 2 Tim. 1:6). For life we need oil, the Spirit of God, even His filling, that we may be enabled to live the virgin life for the Lord’s testimony; for service, for work, we need the talent, the spiritual gift, that we may be equipped as a good slave to accomplish what the Lord intends to accomplish. The filling of the Spirit in life enables us to use the spiritual gift in service (work), and the spiritual gift in service matches the filling of the Spirit in life, that we may be a perfect member of Christ.</p><p>15<sup>2</sup> Own ability signifies our natural ability, which is constituted of God’s creation and our learning.</p><p>16<sup>1</sup> Traded with them (talents) signifies our using of the gift that the Lord has given us.</p><p>16<sup>2</sup> Gained another five (talents) signifies that the gift we received from the Lord has been used to the fullest extent, without any loss or waste.</p><p>18<sup>1</sup> The main emphasis in this parable is on the one-talented one, who received the smallest gift. It is very easy for the least gifted to mistreat or ignore their gift.</p><p>18<sup>2</sup> The earth signifies the world; thus, dug in the earth signifies becoming involved in the world. Any association, any involvement, with the world, even a little worldly talk, will bury the gift we have received from the Lord.</p><p>18<sup>3</sup> Hid his master’s money signifies rendering the Lord’s gift useless, letting it lie waste under the cloak of certain earthly excuses. To make any excuse for not using the Lord’s gift is to hide the gift. This is always the danger with the one-talented ones, those who consider their gift to be the smallest.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Verse 14 says that the man gave his slaves his possessions, but verse 15 says that he gave them talents. This indicates that the talents in verse 15 are the possessions in verse 14. [When the Lord’s possessions are in His hand, they remain His possessions. But when they are delivered to us, they become our talents.]…Today the Lord’s possessions primarily are the gospel, the truth, the believers, and the church. If you do not care for these things, you will not have any talents.</p><p>We should not wait in an indifferent way for the Lord to give us something. No, we must diligently seek the gospel and the truth.…We need to experience the truth concerning the church.…Furthermore, we need to pray, “Lord, I want to take care of the saints and bear their burdens. My heart is for them.” (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 760-762)</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 757-764; Hymns: #909</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
