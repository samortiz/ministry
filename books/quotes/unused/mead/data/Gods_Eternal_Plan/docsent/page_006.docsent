   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is something unknown to man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s eternal will is that all things in the heavens and on earth be headed up in Christ v. 10 . In other words, Christ is to be the Head over all things.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s mystery was kept in silence in the times of the ages Rom 16:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This mystery was hidden in God s heart and was not revealed to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the past generations, God did not tell anyone the reason He created all things Eph 3:5a, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE REVELATION OF THE MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, this mystery has been manifested Rom 16:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God revealed this mystery to Paul.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>GOD S MYSTERY BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is God s mystery?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Colossians 2:2 says that God s mystery is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the mystery of God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s will is for Christ to be the centrality of all things and for all things to be subject to Christ so that He may be Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Colossians 3:11 says, Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Colossians 1:18 says, That He Himself might have the first place in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Concerning this mystery Ephesians 3:6 says, That in Christ Jesus the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the Body and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is always working towards this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the fullness of the times 1:10 , He will head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word times in the original Greek means ages.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that all things will be gathered together in one place and will be crowned with the name of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The book of Ephesians tells us what the Lord has obtained and will obtain from the time of His resurrection until the time of the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why it speaks of the Lord being the Head over all things in the heavens and on the earth; it does not speak of Him being the Head of all things under the earth, because by then there will no longer be anything under the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The book of Philippians tells us what He has obtained from the time of His resurrection until His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why it says that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today there are many things under the earth that are still unsettled.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God s goal is twofold: First, it is for all things to manifest Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In other words, it is for Christ to be Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Second, it is for man to be like Christ, to have His life and His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today many believers on earth are lacking in Christ, and many things are manifesting Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But God will eventually reach His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day, all things will manifest Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to pray that we will gain more Christ and manifest Him more so that God s will can be fulfilled soon.</S>
