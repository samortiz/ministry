   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Process of the Church s Spreading The Early Spreading</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Sister Dora Yu went to Foochow to preach the gospel, a group of young believers was raised up in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1923 they held a gospel meeting in the home of one of the brothers and invited Sister Ruth Lee from Nanking to be the speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sister Ruth Lee was still a young person; she wrote very well and was the editor of The Spiritual Light paper in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the time, The Spiritual Light was the best spiritual periodical in China; it had much spiritual essence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many spiritual believers from all over China, such as Kao Shih-chu, Sun Hsi-sheng, Chia Yu-ming, and Cheng Chi-kwei, would submit articles to the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sister Ruth Lee was responsible for collecting their articles and editing them into a bi-monthly publication; this paper gave the believers of that time much help.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After 1930, however, The Spiritual Light did not carry as much spiritual weight as it once did.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sister Ruth Lee s gospel preaching in Foochow caused a revival in the city, and many people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because so many people came to the meetings, each attendee had to bring his own chair.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The brothers and sisters began the practice of wearing gospel vests at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The gospel vests were gospel banners; some people hung them on their front while others hung them on their back.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They shouted gospel slogans on the streets and invited people to come and hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this way, meetings began in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was a new beginning in China as far as meetings were concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Most of those in the meetings were students.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brother Nee had the main responsibility for ministering the word and preaching the gospel in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In addition to Brother Nee, there were two other gifted brothers; one carried on a gospel work outside the meetings, and the other expounded the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Initially, no one paid much attention to these two brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1924 some trouble began because of Mr. Woodbury, a missionary from the Christian and Missionary Alliance and the person in charge of the Truth-Keeping Chapel in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When he heard that there was a revival in Foochow, he suggested that since the brothers had risen up to serve the Lord, they should be ordained as preachers and ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Among the three responsible brothers in Foochow, one decided to accept the ordination; this caused a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brother Nee felt that ordination was wrong and released a message concerning the history of the Ark. Later, as editor of The Christian, I received a written copy of that message.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The main point was that prior to the desolation of Israel, the Ark was in the tabernacle, and the Ark and the tabernacle were one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s testimony depends on the Ark; the tabernacle is the outward expression with the Ark as its content.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Israel was in desolation, the Ark was separated from the tabernacle; the tabernacle was in Gibeon, but the Ark was in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, when Solomon began to serve the Lord, he went first to make offerings at the tabernacle in Gibeon, but after seeing a vision from the Lord, he returned to Jerusalem in order to make his offerings before the Ark 1 Kings 3:4-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Based on this history of the Ark, Brother Nee pointed out that before the church became desolate, it had the proper outward appearance, and its content was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In other words, Christ is the Ark of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because of the desolation of the church, the testimony of Christ and the outward appearance of the church were separated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church became desolate; the outward appearance of the church was separated from its inward content.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During such a time, the believers should pay attention to the Ark, not to the tabernacle; the believers should follow Solomon to pay attention to Christ as the content of the church and not care for its outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After Brother Nee released this message, the brother who wanted to be ordained gathered the rest of the co-workers together and said, Brother Nee does not want the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, when Brother Nee was away on a trip, they took the opportunity to excommunicate him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From then on, the church in Foochow had problems and divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brother Nee was in Nanking when he was excommunicated; therefore, many of the brothers in Foochow felt that this action was not fair to him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They wrote letters and telegrams to Brother Nee, which touched him inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Later, as he went to give conferences and release messages in Nanking, Hangchow, and Shanghai, he felt that he would be affected if he read the letters; therefore, he decided not to read any of the letters and telegrams from Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He waited until he was on the boat returning to Foochow from Shanghai to read the letters one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As he opened letter after letter, he became more and more angry, but the Lord still spoke to him inwardly, saying, Do not argue; arguing is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord calmed him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the boat arrived at Mawei, the brothers from Foochow came in a group to meet him; they spoke only of his excommunication.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As soon as they brought it up, Brother Nee again became angry, but the Lord still required him to be calm.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He felt before the Lord that he could not argue about the excommunication, and he saw that it was a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many brothers were on his side and thought that he had been treated unfairly; he invited everyone to meet that very evening.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brother Nee knew that any discussion of the excommunication would be very explosive; he was clear that they could not discuss it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, when the brothers came, he immediately told them that he would move his luggage to Mawei, leave Foochow to live in Bai-Ya-Tan, and let the brothers in Foochow meet as they pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This resolved the problem related to ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As someone who had been excommunicated, Brother Nee felt that he should not argue; he had a deep burden to labor solely on the publication work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 1923 Brother Nee began to publish a magazine entitled The Present Testimony; in Chinese it is called Fu-shing, which means revival.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then in 1925 he began to publish The Christian from Mawei.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many of the messages in The Christian concerned the matter of the church; some were on the way of the church, and others were on the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These messages were a strong encouragement to the churches at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The greatest encouragement came from Brother Nee s meditations on the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 Meditations on Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Almost all the lovers of the Lord among the Chinese young people had a copy of this publication in their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The spiritual exposition in Meditations on Revelation was a great awakening concerning the condition of the church; it did a foundational work in the young lovers of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before I read that publication, the Holy Spirit had already done much work in me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I was not only saved but also had determined to give up the world.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although as a student I was poor, I was willing to pay the price to buy this kind of spiritual publication.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, through the impact of The Christian, something strong was stirring within me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thus, many meetings were raised up throughout China during that period of time due, on one hand, to the multifaceted work of the Holy Spirit and, on the other hand, to this publication.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The teachings in The Christian were a strong factor in the raising up of meetings throughout China.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Apart from dealing with the matter of the church, The Christian also contained many messages on salvation, such as The Fastest Way to Hell, The Paths to Hell, Why Good Men Go to Hell, The Robber Saved, and others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These messages helped many people to be saved and to be clear regarding salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Brother Tu Chung-chen, who met with us, was not clearly saved until he read The Assurance of Salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because The Christian emphasized spirituality, pursuit of a spiritual life, and spiritual warfare, it was a great help to those pursuing spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thus, the effects of The Christian fall into three categories: First, it gave the believers who loved the Lord a proper concept concerning the church and the raising up of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Second, it made people clear regarding salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Third, it gave people a way to go on in their spiritual pursuit and to obtain a spiritual supply.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Christian had a great influence on the believers in China.</S>
