Chapters 7 through 13 were given in October and November and are Brother Lee's fellowship after his visit to Europe and America
In relation to our disposition, regardless of how much we experience salvation, God does not intend to annul our disposition
Even though there are more than twenty district meetings, the content of these meetings needs to be enriched and strengthened
The elders, the responsible ones in the district meetings, and the full-time serving ones have tried their best, but there is still a lack
Only twenty-five to twenty-nine people attended the meeting in Scotland, which was a meeting of workers from various places
He also said that if we see the way that the Lord is taking and the work that He is doing, the churches and the work will be the same
Brother Sparks hoped that the workers from some places, particularly from India, would pay more attention to the work in Taiwan
She said that Honor Oak 'only gives and does not receive'; that is, they only give to others; they do not receive from others
Any preacher who becomes a speaker at the Keswick Convention is considered to be very good, because this opportunity is not given to many
The most influential mission has been China Inland Mission, which focuses on preaching the gospel in foreign countries
After the political situation changed in China, however, China Inland Mission ceased its work in China and is no longer as influential
Wherever they go, they require all the Christians, regardless of their denomination or sect, to cooperate, work, and pray together
Before they go to an area, they send a team to prepare the atmosphere by advertising their gospel event on billboards and in newspapers
They do not emphasize the truth, the ground of the church, or the way of the church, nor do they discern these matters
A person who is sick with a fever may claim to be healed because he feels better after a preacher lays his hands on him
A brother in Manila had a Christian neighbor who had a stomach disease and therefore went to a 'divine healer'
Some among us may have gone to be healed by these preachers, but they were momentarily healed psychologically rather than physically
In the recent two to three years these believers have strongly opposed Brother Sparks's fellowship in Honor Oak
If the Baptists, the Presbyterians, or the Methodists invite them to give a message or to labor, they are willing
For many years we nullified the ground of organized Christianity in our attitude and our way, because of the light that we received
Whether or not a believer's argument concerning the truth is right, his heart, attitude, and words must be proper
In 1939, after we published messages on the truth concerning the kingdom, someone put out a book to strongly oppose us
The author said that the message was about the believers' accepting the local church's control in their marriage and that Mr
Over the years in Taiwan we have been attacked and severely opposed by other believers because of our attitude and our ground
We can say with a clear conscience, that from the time we began to serve the Lord until today, we had no intention to be in Christianity
The attitude of Christianity toward us merely causes us to focus on the matters that we received from the Lord
If we only preach the gospel with zeal and hold revival meetings, just as Christianity does, we will not be able to meet this need
It is not sufficient for the brothers who labor to merely be zealous for the gospel and have some knowledge of the truth
The chapter entitled 'Entering into the Kingdom of the Heavens' in Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures is on the kingdom
If our eyes are opened to these three matters and we have a thorough understanding of them, our work will begin to meet the need of this age
Neither can we have the reality of the kingdom if we have only the truth concerning the kingdom but do not have life
We will have the content and the testimony of the church, and we will have the reality of the kingdom, which is the authority of the kingdom
For the past two thousand years, no one emphasized the truth of God as man's life or of God's desire to be man's life
We believe that even during the darkest period of Catholicism many believers genuinely experienced being justified by faith
It was not until Luther was raised up that the vision and revelation of justification by faith was as clear as a scientific law
Just as people know that there are numerous kinds of vitamins, believers can know that they are saved and can be assured of their salvation
Before George Cutting wrote the pamphlet Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment, countless believers had the assurance of their salvation
Christians not only experience this truth, but it is also common knowledge, just as vitamins are common knowledge
Today many Christians no longer say that they are going to Sunday service; instead, they say that they are going to a meeting
For the past one hundred years the writings of Andrew Murray are the most popular books published among Christians
According to our natural concept, we think that God wants us to worship and serve Him, that is, to do things for Him
The Bible shows that after God created man, He placed man in front of Himself as the tree of life so that man would take Him as food
Even people in the world have the natural concept that Christians are people who worship God and zealously serve Him
Even though some believers enjoy God as life in a hidden way, most believers do not have the concept that God can be enjoyed
God needs some to stand up in these days and cry out, 'Brothers, God does not intend to ask us to do something for Him
When God became flesh and dwelt among men, the questions people asked Him were mainly concerning what work they should do
At the end of Matthew 21 there is the parable of the vineyard, and in chapter 22 there is the parable of the wedding feast
The parable at the beginning of chapter 22 is about a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son and invited people to the feast
The one parable refers to the Old Testament, which is under the law, and the other parable refers to the New Testament, which is under grace
God's original intention is not for us to do things for Him but for us to enjoy Him by eating and drinking Him
The vision of eating and drinking God begins with the tree of life in Genesis and ends with the tree of life at the end of Revelation
In the middle of the street in the city is a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb
In the city there is no work and no zeal; rather, we take God as the fruit of the tree of life and as the water of life
In the New Jerusalem the believers are not zealously working, nor do they resolve to do good and endeavor to improve themselves
Christians who live according to the concept of revering, serving, and working for God do not live as genuine Christians
When semicolons are used to punctuate verse 12, the three things listed are carried out by the gifted persons referred to in verse 11
Another reason for using commas is in verse 16, which states clearly that every member of the Body operates and functions
According to verse 16 the building up of the church in verse 12 should be directly by the perfected saints and not by the gifted persons
Some may wonder how a local church can be built up if the gifted persons spoken of in Ephesians 4:11 are not present
Someone who opposed the Lord's recovery said, 'Some people claim that they will go and build the church in every place
The facts and the truth further revealed in the Bible prove that the Lord Jesus does not build the church directly
The saints who formerly could not function as elders can function as elders after they are perfected by the gifts
The saints, who formerly did not manifest their ministry, their function, or their gift, manifest their function after they are perfected
Three persons participate in the work of building up the church: the Lord Jesus, the gifts, and the perfected saints
The Lord does not build the church directly; neither does He want the gifts, such as the apostles, to build directly
The church deviated from this practice, and the service of God fell into the hands of a small number of believers known as the clergy
The Protestant churches may be reformed in name, but they have retained the same system of service adopted by the Catholic Church
The Bible says that all believers should serve God as priests, but the church has practiced two kinds of service
If we want to serve according to God's original pattern, the building up of the church must involve all the saints
As we pay attention to the building up of the church, we must understand that no worker can build up the church directly
The saints who could not supply others in the meetings are able to function and supply others after they are perfected
Of course there is a portion of the building up that we do directly according to our function but our primary work is to perfect the saints
If we, the workers, build up the church directly, we are replacing the saints in the building up of the church
The fact that we perfect the saints to build the church does not mean that we absolutely do not build up the church directly
We may think that we are very clear about this principle, but we may be clear only while we listen to a message
The apostles, prophets, and even the saints responsible for the meetings must work according to this principle
The saints who are raised up to share the responsibilities tend to do everything themselves because few saints are perfected to serve
After the responsible saints serve for a few months, they should bring other saints into bearing responsibilities
In addition, when the number of saints in a meeting increases to a hundred saints, the meeting should split into two meetings
In the building up of the church it is crucial for the saints who know how to build to perfect the other saints to build
Leading others to be spiritual does not mean that we are building up the church, because to be spiritual is not the same as to be useful
The problem is not the quality of the material; it is whether we can make useful vessels out of the material that we have
Even after we formed twenty smaller meetings, the saints were still not built up, because few saints know how to perfect others
Even if the stones are polished and look nice, they are of no use because they are not built; they are a pile of stones
When the table is built, the pieces of wood are no longer in a pile; they are arranged in an orderly manner and have a function
In order for the church to advance, we must not be stubborn and think that it is good enough to help the saints to be spiritual
The church has increased to two thousand saints; therefore, we need three to four hundred saints on the visitation service
If every one of the one hundred saints perfects three or four saints, we will have three to four hundred saints who can serve
Even if we know how to do certain things, we must admit that there are other things that we do not know how to do
We can do certain things because we have been shown mercy, but have we perfected others to do the same things?
A problem with the ushering indicates that the ushers in the large meetings did not perfect other saints to usher
If the initial ushers perfected other saints to usher, there would be saints in the district meetings to take care of the ushering
When there are few perfected saints, everyone is content to merely have a meeting, even if there is not much supply in the meeting
Suppose that we have material to make some benches, but instead of building the benches, we leave the material scattered in a room
If we labor in a city without perfecting any saints, we are not building up the church in that city, and the church will remain desolate
We must see that the first step of the building up of the church, the primary step, is that we learn to perfect others
We need to learn, and to endeavor, not only to do things ourselves but also lead, teach, and perfect others to do the things that we do
If there are few perfected saints and we continue to split into smaller meetings, the church will eventually be desolate
In order to perfect the saints, we do not work by ourselves; instead, we work with the saints to teach them to do what we do
Initially, we work by ourselves, but after a while the saints are able to work with us and are even better than we are
When we came to Taiwan, we took the way of a worker serving in a locality for a long time to take care of the church
On the one hand, there may be some loss when a worker travels frequently, but on the other hand, there is much benefit
When a co-worker stays in one place, the local saints have less of an opportunity to receive fellowship from other gifts
When the supply in a locality always comes from one gift, it is not easy for the saints to receive the supply from other gifts
It may be that instead of staying in one place, some of the workers should travel frequently to fellowship with and supply the saints
A worker who stays in one place will bear more responsibility and is more likely to carry out specific burdens in a locality
Some workers might stay in one place for a long period, and others might spend more time to visit different localities
The perfecting that we speak of is not merely to edify the believers; it is more than edification, because it has the element of building
Building, however, does not mean only to make something better and useful but also to build something as part of a house
We stopped using the term edification meeting and started saying building meeting, because we are not merely edifying the saints
Most of the work in Christianity of preaching the gospel and holding revivals and Bible studies merely edifies the believers to improve them
Rather, we want every meeting to have brothers and sisters who are perfected to exercise their function and are built up
We should not understand this to be something organizational and think that we need to learn to arrange and organize the district meetings
We have learned something from the Lord and we know how to work but while we are working we need to perfect others so that they are built up
We once notified the saints that we would hold a conference the next day, and more than two thousand saints attended the conference
In contrast, many Christian organizations may use advertisements but still have only two or three hundred people in a conference
We are blessed, not because we have spiritual giants or famous preachers but because we have the elements of coordination and building
If we remove the elements of coordination and building, our situation will be more desolate than the situation in Christianity
We also spent the past thirty years observing him, and we wonder whether his understanding of the Body of Christ is appropriate
If the ground and the building up of the church are not proper, there will be no result to our work, and the Lord's blessing will not remain
If our intention is to form a separate group in Christianity and thereby become a sect we deserve to be cursed the Lord will never bless us
We have to find a way for the believers who stand on this ground to be built up so that God's blessing will not leak out
Since we desire to follow the Lord live in His presence and be useful to Him we must find a way to retain what we know and have experienced
We need to consider how to bring in the blessing, the proper ground that contains the blessing, and the building that preserves the blessing
If the building up and coordination among us were stronger, there would be at least five thousand saints in the meetings
We have baptized between seven and eight thousand people, but only one-fourth of this number were in the conference
A house cannot consist of only walls with no windows; neither can a house have windows and doors in every wall
Our most obvious need is the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ
There would be only thirty to fifty saints who would be helped to be spiritual, and they would eventually become spiritual antiques
If there were an exhibition, none of the saints would be good enough to display, because our work is not for exhibition
Just like the apostle Paul in Acts 20:27, in our labor we should not shrink from declaring all the counsel of God to the saints
We should work with the saints individually and make them useful vessels so that they may function according to their measure
We are one person, but the issue is a church that comes out of our labor and continual perfecting of the saints
As we perfect the saints, we cause them to know the Son of God and to have the increase of the stature of Christ
The issue of such a work will make the church the Body of Christ and will cause the church to build itself up in love
We should not be satisfied because we are able to deliver good and interesting messages that supply the saints
These things are good according to the concept in Christianity, but we should not be satisfied with these things
Our work is to help the saints to enjoy God, know the Son of God, and grow unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
We may have the concept that the place where we labor is our field, as if the church is our personal enterprise
If we labor in only one place, we become resident pastors, and if we travel to different localities, we will be traveling evangelists
Whether we stay in one place or travel to many places is insignificant if we work God into others and perfect them
May the Lord have mercy on us and show us a clear vision that surpasses the condition of Christianity and meets His need
We will be neither a resident pastor nor a traveling evangelist; rather, we will be ministers appointed by God
If we can grasp these two points, the churches will have a future, and our work will be of value and surpass the situation in Christianity
We should not think that if we have three to five thousand saints, we have materials for the building up of the church
We have many brothers and sisters, but we lack building materials because of a shortage in the ministry of the word
In other words many brothers and sisters cannot become building materials and be built up together because there is a shortage in the supply
In order to have building materials for the church, there is the need for a rich supply in the ministry of the word
A person who does not govern cannot manage; if he does not have the position and the authority to govern, he cannot manage
When we speak of perfecting the saints in these messages, we are emphasizing management, which covers many areas
In a family the parents cannot demand that the children be under their governing but not manage the children's needs for clothing or food
If the ministry of the word is weak, the saints will lack the supply from the word; they will come to the meetings hungry and leave hungry
When there is a shortage of nutrients, the proper growth and development of the body stops, and germs that enter the body can cause diseases
There will be no effect if we repeatedly attempt to solve the problems in a church when there is a shortage in the supply of the word
The problems in the church are not really problems; they are the result of a shortage in the supply of the word
As soon as there is a sufficient supply the problems will spontaneously disappear and there will spontaneously be the growth and building up
When we lack the supply of the word, everything becomes a demand, and the more demands that there are, the less likely that they will be met
When there is a shortage in the word, a church cannot be built up in a good way and materials will not be produced for the building
As soon as there is a rich supply of the word, there will be many vitamins and nutrients supplied to the saints
If we minister the word in a poor way, the church will suffer loss, but if we serve well, the church will benefit
A mother may think that she gives her children sufficient nutrients, but the food she prepares tastes like medicine
Similarly, the speaking brothers may feel that the message they give is rich, but the saints do not receive a supply
The word that we are referring to is the word of ministry spoken from the podium, not the common words spoken in the world
The brothers who serve in the ministry of the word must grasp a basic principle-the word that they minister must be God
Oftentimes when we listen to a message, the word that is spoken is not God and does not have the presence of God
The words released through the ministry of the word should always be the utterance of God, and they should be spirit and life
While most people today dare not speak about themselves, Paul spoke about himself, particularly in the books of 1 and 2 Corinthians
Otherwise, we are those who 'buy and sell goods'; we have not passed through God, and we have no experience that comes out of God
We will have something that is in God and has passed through God; their vision will become our vision, and their experience, our experience
If we do not thoroughly understand the original language, it is difficult to determine the proper translation of some words and phrases
Our use of reference books can be compared to a commanderinchief who consults his advisers for their opinions in order to develop a strategy
We therefore should not wait until we are about to speak on fellowship with God before we consult these reference books
When we are ready to give a message on fellowship with God there will be a foundation within us because we have consulted what others wrote
If we do, our speaking will not be the word of the ministry, because it did not pass through God and does not have the Spirit of God
Whether we give messages or lead others to study the Bible, this is an inappropriate way to use reference books
In Psalm 2 there is another person who lives before God and who, through the Spirit of God, speaks something that is contrary to Psalm 1
If we do not know how to properly use them, we will be led into a forest filled with trees of the knowledge of good and evil
We should never blindly receive what others write; otherwise, we will be led into a forest of trees of the knowledge of good and evil
Most of the expositions of the Bible that were written over the past two thousand years have not been much help to us
Many of the expositions in his book The Numerical Bible are on the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; they focus on knowledge, not life
Some brothers like to use Bible handbooks, which give information related to history or geography, but they are not of much value
What we can give the brothers and sisters from these books is worse than the carob pods that the prodigal son in Luke 15 ate; it is useless
We can also say that God is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us
The brothers who minister the word must speak a word that is spirit and life, has passed through God, and is in God
Since we minister the word to supply the saints, we must always hold the central line revealed in the Bible, which is God as life to man
No matter how many messages we give, how logical our messages are, or how many topics we cover, we should always focus on God as life
God is now working in man to make man His counterpart, His dwelling place, His Body, as a vessel to express His glory
Throughout the history of Christianity countless believers have been harmed and misdirected by winds of teaching
When the Lord said to His disciples that His words are spirit and life , many disciples left Him and no longer walked with Him
We also need to see the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne and the tree of life growing on both sides of the river
Anything that is not the issue of God being our life is man-made and belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
It is easy for believers to speak about the portions in Ephesians concerning human conduct, because it is easy to understand these portions
He also says that the power of God operates in us and that we should walk worthily of the calling with which we were called
Our understanding of Ephesians is that God is good to us, but if we are not proper in our walk, we will not be worthy of His calling
The proper understanding is that since we are called by God and God indwells us, we should enjoy God so that we may match Him in our walk
A brother said that prophets also exhort people to leave evil and cling to good, that is, to do good instead of evil
The author gave a logical presentation to prove that the Lord Jesus is the Savior not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles
A message that merely repeats everything from this book, however, is from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
It also explained from the Old Testament and the New Testament that the Lord is the Savior of the Jews and the Gentiles
According to my observation many of the brothers' preaching is similar to the situation described in 2 Kings 4
The story of the Canaanite woman does not focus on the Lord being the Savior of the Jews or the Savior of the Gentiles
The Canaanite woman stood on the Lord's word concerning being a dog; therefore, the Lord had to save her and heal her daughter
Some may feel that they are unique in their expounding of the Bible, that their way of expounding cannot even be found in our books
Chapter 8 shows the Spirit of life in verse 2, and it says that those who are 'led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God'
The tree of life must be our controlling factor, whether we speak concerning prayer, our daily walk, or working zealously for the Lord
Because we do not see this vision, we do not speak concerning this in our messages, nor do we help the saints to see this
Those who minister the word must see that the church needs the supply of life, words of life, not the interpretation of doctrines
We may consider that we would speak on something that is deep, because others have spoken on regeneration already
We can give a simple message on regeneration even if others speak about abiding in the Lord or about regeneration in a deep way
Instead of stressing logic, we should focus on whether the saints can touch God and life and whether the message is living
The brothers who minister the word should not quote from too many sources, because this does not help the saints
Quoting from many sources inevitably leads to messages that merely contain knowledge in a way of Bible exposition
There are many words recorded in the Bible, but some of them are branches and leaves that support the things which supply us
According to my observation, the brothers who minister the word quote too many sources when they give a message
Just as fish bones are to support the fish and are not for us to eat, some words in the Bible support the words that give life
These words were needed to write the Bible, but we do not eat these words, nor do we give them to the saints to eat
We must learn to contact God and fellowship with Him so that our words are God's utterance, and we represent God
There are over thirty saints in the bread-breaking meeting in Tokyo, and there are one and a half households in Osaka
If five or six workers go to Japan and labor with the saints who are already there, we should be able to gain many people rather quickly
The core of the group in San Francisco is mainly made up of students who study at the University of California
We then visited the Northwest and learned that there is a group of Chinese brothers who meet on a university campus
These two families meet together every Lord's Day and listen to a message that was given either in Hong Kong or New York City
During the period when their meetings stopped, the Chinese saints continued to meet because they had a Chinese-speaking meeting
Since that time onward, the number of Americans who attend Sunday service has increased to more than sixty percent of the population
Over the past ten years, especially after the truce in Korea, several evangelists have emerged from the Assembly of God
Even though people are being saved, on the spiritual side there is a lack of spiritual depth among Christian groups in America
The saints who go can focus their labor among the Chinese people, and after three to five years the language issue will be resolved
Even though many countries in South America are Catholic, they cooperate with Protestant countries who send missionaries to them
There are seven to eight hundred thousand Japanese immigrants there, and their number is increasing by thirty to forty thousand every year
The meetings in the afternoon emphasized God in Christ as life for the building of His house, His temple, and the Body of Christ
After the conference the leading brothers requested that we stay for two more days to fellowship with several leading brothers and sisters
The Holy Spirit was working in many of the saints before the conference; therefore, after we arrived, they spoke about only the practice
The young saints do not have their own meeting, but they want to begin a meeting, and they also want to learn to coordinate in service
We met many promising brothers who requested that we send them The Ministry of the Word so that they can translate it into their language
Everything that Catholicism embraces and promotes belongs to the physical realm and is therefore superstitious
Since the city of Corinth was close by and we have read the Epistles to the Corinthians, we stopped for a brief visit
According to the Bible the good land is a land flowing with milk and honey, but the land that we saw is desolate and barren
The Muslims occupy that place and will not return it to the Israelis, but the Israelis regard it as their own place of worship
In His wisdom God destroyed many Jewish and Christian archeological sites so that people would not worship these sites
From Israel we bypassed Iraq, which has the city of Babylon, and Iran, previously Persia, and arrived in Pakistan
We held a conference there, and on the last day of the conference the meeting hall was filled to capacity and overflowed into the courtyard
Every place needs to know Christ as life and to have the building up of God's dwelling place so that the believers can have a home
Otherwise, why can we not find a similar situation in church history and why is there not another group to confirm this way?
They also need to see that the result of Christ being our life is that God's house is built up for His children to have a home
We believe that it is of the Lord that the churches in Taiwan, especially the church in Taipei, are highly regarded by other believers
If we are faithful to the Lord, He will give us a strong and definite leading and some of us will go to other places
As more saints rise up to meet this need, there will be a steady flow of saints who leave their jobs and serve full time
In view of the overall situation, it is profitable for the brothers and sisters to consider migrating to other places
The few publications that we put out are of three categories The Ministry of the Word magazine booklets such as Enjoying God and Church News
We need to strengthen the literature work in order to propagate overseas, and we need to increase the circulation of Church News
Workers need to go and labor, brothers and sisters need to migrate, and the literature work needs to be increased and spread
Over the years we never advertised ourselves; nevertheless, during this trip, the Lord opened many doors for us
We did not fellowship with all God's children in the West, but in the past we contacted Christianity in the West through their publications
Even though we did not contact every Christian group, we feel that we have a clear understanding of the situation in the West
Even though the needs and problems in every place differ, the answer to these needs and problems is found in this way
If the believers could know, see, and receive this way, spontaneously their needs would be met and their problems would be solved
What we saw in the different places gives us a strong confirmation that this way is truly according to God's leading
The saints can testify that they see the building up the local church as the house of God, and they fellowship concerning this
Even though Japan has a large population and two to three thousand missionaries, God does not have a house there
No matter what our children do or where they go to play, at a certain time they say that it is time to go home and eat
Many saints cannot say that they have a place where they can eat when they are hungry or can rest when they are tired
When we were in New York, we did not announce our meetings, but believers, especially the Chinese believers, wanted to attend our meetings
We did not contact many people in Canada, but we made a special visit to a well-known group founded by Oswald J
It took us only a few hours to drive five hundred miles, because someone had opened the way and paved it with tar
My overall impression is that there is a need in every place to build up God's house so that the wandering believers can have a home
There is still a great need for the gospel, but if we study the situation, we will see that the gospel is not the primary need
It is not that there are shepherds with no sheep but that there are many sheep with no shepherds; there are many homeless believers
We are not merely helping individual believers to be spiritual or helping a group of believers to grow in life
While China was still under the Ching Dynasty, Hudson Taylor said that he would use the Lord's gospel to evangelize imperial China
Every believer who is limited by what he has learned is under the influence of the mystics, who were not productive in relation to the work
Some workers are useful but restricted by what they have learned and by what they are doing because they are not broken
In contrast to workers who seek opportunities to work, the Lord does not require us to seek opportunities to work for Him
If we compare our condition with that of other places, we see that we are able to meet the needs in some places
They focused on their relationship with God, on learning to fellowship with God, and on living in God's presence
He also translated A Short and Easy Method of Prayer and a book by Brother Lawrence entitled The Practice of the Presence of God
Only a mother who does not care about her children would say that she must maintain her cleanliness at the expense of her children
If we spoke concerning spirituality to Paul, he might say that he knows only a few things and that he does not understand us
He knows to save sinners, to build up the church, to labor for the Lord, to learn to live in the Lord's presence, and to enjoy the Lord
Every person who wants to be useful to the Lord must learn not to trust in what he has learned but to go beyond it
In contrast, if we pursue spirituality but do not have a burden from God, the more we pursue, the less spiritual we will be
When the book Fragrant Myrrh was first published, there was a group of brothers and sisters in northern China who imitated Madame Guyon
The saints who paid attention to their own spirituality and desired to improve their spirituality did not have a good ending
He must be delivered from his capability, from what he has learned, from what he can do, and from what he has done
A person may say that he can serve in coordination because he is capable, spiritual, has a supply of life, and is eloquent
It is an offense to the Lord to say that we cannot solve the problems in a place if we do not know what they are
In order to receive a commission from the Lord, we must have faith in the spiritual supply, not only in material offerings
Over the past five years my view of the building has become clearer, my burden heavier, and my understanding richer
A casual believer who is indifferent to God's desire or a believer who lives in the world is not interested in a home
At the same time, we have to see that God has raised up many believers to work for Him, but not many can meet the need of His building
Brother Sparks saw that the children of God are hungry, and he wants Honor Oak to be a place that supplies food
He wants to be like Joseph, and he wants Honor Oak to be a place that gives people food, just as Egypt did in the years of famine
If we focus on our spirituality and learning instead of receiving a vision, burden, and revelation from God, we will eventually fall
If he had been zealous for the gospel, like Billy Graham or John Sung, it would not be strange that he received a burden to evangelize China
The brothers have expressed a desire to lead the church into the practical building and to send workers to propagate overseas
The closed Brethren continue to be closed, and the open Brethren are so open that they want their young people to study in seminaries
The testimony here is not to make a display of ourselves but to have a place with a strong testimony so that we can render help to others
We can also call a large meeting for saints from different places to come and participate, and we can have a time of training
The church here also needs to serve as a 'factory' where believers can come to learn and to do an 'internship'
If the brothers have the burden to learn some lessons and to receive a burden to labor in these places, we will receive the Lord's blessing
We will need to learn the lesson of faith to take risks, to meet different needs, and to deal with different problems
Because the procedure for entry into Taiwan is complicated, a large number of people cannot come at the same time
In the past most of the co-workers in Taiwan stayed in one place for a long time and bore the responsibility there
We did not work like the apostle Paul, who traveled from place to place without staying for long in any one place
According to the fellowship from the brothers, some workers cannot leave immediately to supply the churches, but other workers can
When a co-worker goes out from his respective locality, the saints in his locality have an opportunity to serve and supply the church
Some of the co-workers who travel can labor in the gospel, but they should not preach the gospel outside the fellowship of the church
The workers can hold conferences related to the building work, helping the saints in the matter of life or in reading the Word of God
When the local saints are able to bear more responsibility, the workers can go to places that are farther away
In this way there will be a mutual supply, and the capacity of life and service in the local churches will be enlarged
Just as Paul returned to Antioch, the locality that sent him out, the workers should return to the locality that sent them
Paul continued to care for the church in Antioch while he cared for the churches that were raised up among the Gentiles
The brothers need a proper understanding of this matter, but we do not need rules related to how the workers travel
The brothers should always be ready to receive the Lord's leading to visit and to render practical help to the churches
They take over everything and assign the saints to sweep the floor, move tables, set up chairs, and do other services
A worker should never insist on holding a conference because he was sent by the workers to care for the church and to supply their need
They want to coordinate with saints in other places, even though they cannot coordinate with the saints in their own locality
When we cannot coordinate with the saints, we should consider whether we should change the way that we coordinate
In the same principle, we should never say that we cannot get through because the saints do not accept our work
We should never condemn the saints and say that they are too busy, their hearts are hardened, or they do not have a heart for the Lord
Neither would there be a need for us to supply the saints if every brother and sister were like the apostle Paul
The saints need us to work with them and serve them because they are busy and have a less than fervent heart for the Lord
If we cannot get through in one way, we should find another way, and if the second way does not work, we should try a third way
It is easy to find a person who can cut glass or metal, but it is difficult to find a person who can cut a diamond
We should never say that we cannot work in a place because the saints are not good and because they reject our work
In addition to learning to coordinate and learning skills, the workers must learn to be flexible in their work
We should not say, for example, that we cannot do anything because the saints do not want our help in a particular matter
We should not require others to accommodate us, neither should we demand that the environment cooperate with us
Even if the local saints do not seem like suitable material and are barely alive, we need to supply them and enable them to rise up
A worker who wants to coordinate with the local brothers must learn to be strict with himself and not blame the brothers
He must not, for example, say that he cannot work in a place because the local saints do not accept his fellowship concerning the cross
Neither should he say that he cannot work in a place because he wants to preach the gospel, but the local saints do not have a gospel spirit
We should consider the reason that it is difficult to coordinate with the saints, and the reason that the saints do not respond to our work
When we learn the lessons, we will not have opinions about the brothers and sisters living in the workers' home or about the church service
If we cannot coordinate with the local brothers or the local saints, we cannot coordinate with our fellow workers
Over the years many brothers and sisters have learned these lessons, and as a result, they have genuine spiritual growth
It may seem that the work done in the editorial room is insignificant, but it is greater than the work of speaking from the podium
, there was a Chinese sister who met with us, and she asked where she could find messages that were similar to the ones that she had heard
Only a limited number of people, maybe not more than two thousand, were able to attend the meetings that we held in the different places
One book-The Normal Christian Church Life-is composed of messages given by Brother Nee in London twenty years ago
The other-The Normal Christian Life-stirred up a strong response when it was released, and it has rendered much help to many believers
There are also a few articles written by a sister in the West and published in Brother Sparks' magazine, A Witness and a Testimony
There is a market for these books in seminaries and Christian libraries, and believers who seek the Lord are collecting these books
Books concerning church history and books written by the church fathers are also being reprinted in large sizes and in sets
The reprinting of spiritual classics indicates that not many books with content have been printed in recent years
The saints who are preparing the messages to be printed in Chinese are laboring to put out the spiritual supply in a solid way
In other words, we have not been as useful as we could have been, because there are problems that hinder our usefulness
The smaller a person's heart is, the prouder he tends to be, and the larger a person's heart is, the humbler he tends to be
Most believers know that God gave Solomon wisdom , but they do not know that God also gave Solomon a large heart
As those who serve the Lord, we must learn to let God enlarge our heart so that we are considerate of God's heart
When we are concerned with what is on God's heart, our concern will match God's concern, and our intention will match God's intention
These believers dream of the day when they are able to lead a multitude of sinners to salvation and perfect many saints
He would have serious problems in the future if he were to begin his medical training by specializing in one area
If after seven years we know only how to read the Bible or how to enter our private room and pray, we will not be useful in the Lord's hand
According to his biography, he was not good at preaching the gospel, but he received the burden to preach the gospel
The messages he preached were mostly related to living in the Lord's presence and fellowshipping with the Lord
Either we are trapped in what we know, or we are enthusiastic and attempt to work in an unrestrained way without the necessary learning
He formed the China Inland Mission with the particular burden of spreading the gospel to the interior of China
The burden that Hudson Taylor received from the Lord, however, was truly a spiritual matter that touched God's intention
When our heart is enlarged, we will not care only for the work that we are doing; neither will we care only for the church in our locality
If God gives us a few workers to coordinate with, we might say that there are too many and that they are bothersome
We should be able to handle the situation, and whether or not the workers are useful, they should be able to work in coordination with us
The main reason we cannot coordinate with the brothers in the different places is that we have a small, narrow heart
If we allow God to work in us and enlarge our heart, it will be easy for us to have faith that grows and is living
If we have a small heart and no faith, the vision with the burden that comes from the Lord will simply vanish like a fleeting cloud
It is not that God does not give us a vision but that we do not receive it, because our heart is small and we lack faith
God's vision and burden are great, but if our heart is too small to receive them, our usefulness will be limited
Some believers are opposed to Billy Graham and his crusades because even people from heretical groups attend the crusades
Some workers do not have the skill to preach the gospel, give a message, lead the saints, or fellowship with the saints
Brother Sparks has a portion from the Lord and renders much help to others, but he does not give others the opportunity to learn to serve
Brother Sparks was the moderator, and he encouraged the brothers and sisters to grasp the opportunity to ask questions
My intention was to show that we would be limited in our work if we focused only on life and ignored practical training
Even though we know that the church is out of Christ and is in Christ, we may not know how to take care of the church
We should not say that we are not as talented as Brother Soandso or Sister Soandso and that we will give up because we lack spiritual gifts
Many elementary school students study until eleven o'clock at night and get up in the morning earlier than their parents
By seven o'clock in the morning they are ready for school, and they do not return home until six in the evening
Some workers could be very useful, but they do not have a heart to learn, to persevere, and to make an effort to be useful
Our inner being is still not up to the standard, because we are not in harmony with others, and we cannot coordinate
On the one hand, we must learn lessons to have a large heart, to have living faith, and to receive the Lord's commission
We will fellowship concerning the practice of the church preaching the gospel and the way that we have learned to preach the gospel
In the gospel meeting we showed people that Satan, the devil, is an evil power in the universe, who has usurped man and put man in bondage
Since that time we have emphasized the whole church preaching the gospel, particularly during the New Year celebration
The New Year is a time when people in the world, who are under the usurpation of Satan, indulge in all kinds of pleasures and lusts
The church should rise up during this time and fight for men's souls and for God's name, His gospel, and His kingdom
We did not celebrate the New Year according to the custom of the world, because we do not accept the custom of celebrating New Year
The Lord has enlightened us to see that in order to fight against the authority of darkness we cannot follow the customs of the world
If we celebrate the New Year as the people in the world do, we will fall into the hand of Satan and will not be able to fight against him
In order to fight against Satans authority of darkness we must not be contaminated by worldly ways such as the celebration of the New Year
For the past ten years we have seen the special blessing by God and His presence whenever the church practiced this
Even though unbelievers realize that there are benefits to believing in Jesus, they still oppose the gospel and reject the Lord
The Lord charges us to go and preach the gospel to all the people in the nations so that they may become the Lord's disciples
Being cleansed means that we should go to the Lord and receive His shining, confess our sins, and ask for cleansing
In order to preach the gospel, we must go to the Lord and consecrate ourselves to Him so that He can shine on us
We can deal with our sins and empty our entire being to clear out everything of the world inside and outside of us
Any connection with the world is a link to Satan and if we are in communication and collaboration with the enemy we cannot fight against him
If we want to preach the gospel in a prevailing way, we should not remember other people's souls but neglect our own soul
When we pray, we must be cleansed by allowing the Lord to enlighten us, deal with us, and cleanse us from our sins
On the night that the Lord Jesus was betrayed, Peter publicly denied the Lord with an oath and said, 'I do not know the man'!
Fifty days later Peter could stand in the same city of Jerusalem, preach to the Jews, and say to them that they had denied Jesus
If Peter did not receive the Lord's forgiveness and have a clear conscience, he could not have spoken to the Jews in this way
Formerly we were sinners, but if we still live in our sins and do not deal with them, we will not be able to speak
In order to have a good conscience so that we can speak with boldness, we must be cleansed in the precious blood of the Lord
After a person is saved, he should make a list of his friends, relatives, and acquaintances who are not saved and have not heard the gospel
When the church preaches the gospel, the saints have an excellent opportunity to lead their friends and relatives to salvation
Before we serve as an usher, we should pray and deal with the Lord so that we are filled with the spirit of the gospel
All the sales clerks in the shops on Heng-Yang Street in Taipei warmly welcome the customers who enter their store
The people who see an usher with a gospel face are touched and moved inwardly, before they even hear the gospel or sing a hymn
When people see a cold and stern face, however, they feel cold within and do not want to hear the gospel or sing
The ushers need to learn to have a spirit of the gospel through thorough prayer so that they can be proper ushers
It can cause people to lose their concentration, and they will be unable to follow the message at a crucial point
Even if some in the meeting were touched by the message, the violent shaking caused them to lose their concentration
A brother or sister who is consistently looking around can disrupt the speaker and cause him to lose his train of thought
Suppose a gospel friend is subdued by God, and it is clear that he has no problem with the existence of God or the matter of sin
They assume that if the Holy Spirit operates, the gospel friends will respond, but if the Holy Spirit is not working, they will not respond
If, at the appropriate time, we need to nod our head and help someone to stand up, we need to do it with grace
Some people do not believe that God exists, and others believe that God exists but do not believe that Jesus Christ is God
We should lead people to believe into the Lord, confess their sins, and receive the Lord Jesus as their Savior
When we follow these five steps, the gospel friend is ready to believe, and we can lead him to have a short prayer
If the gospel friend wants to kneel down, we can kneel down with him, but if he has no such sense, he can pray while sitting
We must help him with at least one verse in the Bible so that he knows that his sins are forgiven and that he has eternal life
When a person is put in a position of denying his sin out of a guilty conscience, there is no way to continue the conversation
No matter how perfect a person is, if he considers how he has treated his parents, he will realize that he is not without blame
At this time we may use an illustration and say that it is not enough to prepare a meal and admire it, we still need to eat it
We should lead him to read a few verses in the Bible to show him that when a person believes in the Lord Jesus, his sins are forgiven
We should be prepared with verses like this so that when the time is right, we can open the Bible and read the verses
We can also explain that since God is faithful and righteous, as soon as we confess our sins, God will forgive and cleanse us
We should all believe the words of God in the Bible, and we must learn to lead people to receive the word in the Bible
When we are with our gospel friend, we should let the brother or sister who accompanies us speak, and we can assist
If he is ready to be baptized, we can give his name to the deacons, and the church will prepare him for baptism
He will then be a believer who is in the Triune God and in the church, and our gospel labor on him will be concluded
We should not depend on our zeal to invite people to usher to sit with others to have a gospel conversation or to visit the gospel friends
The apostle Paul in the New Testament not only spent money and energy for the sake of others' souls; he also spent himself
