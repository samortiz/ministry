   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The central line in the entire Bible is God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Genesis there is the record of nine great men who are landmarks in the human history: Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Adam was first, and he became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Abel came back to God taking God's way of redemption and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Following him was Enosh, who realized that fallen man is so weak, fragile, and good for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So he had no trust in himself, but he called on the name of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To call on the name of Jehovah means that you put your trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You realize that you are fallen and sinful and weak and poisoned and corrupted and fragile in doing anything for God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So what shall you do?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You have to forget about yourself, and call upon the name of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not just to call on the name of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jehovah is Jesus in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>So Enosh became a landmark in human history because he began to call upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For me to call upon the name of the Lord indicates that I realize I am nothing, that I can do nothing, and that I am good for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because I have no trust in myself, I trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I call upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fourth landmark in human history was Enoch, who walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates a little improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is not just to call upon the name of the Lord, but to walk with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fifth landmark in Genesis is Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Noah not only walked with the Lord, but he also worked with the Lord and worked for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He built the ark with the Lord and for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Abraham, the sixth landmark, was called out of the idolatrous land.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His son, Isaac, and his grandson, Jacob, continued after him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With Jacob something happened as a further development of God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When he was escaping from his brother he slept in the wilderness using a stone for a pillow Gen 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During the night he had a dream in which he saw a ladder reaching into the heavens with the angels descending and ascending upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jacob called that place the gate of heaven and the house of God, Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That was God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The next morning he anointed his stone pillow with oil and called it Bethel, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God gave this wanderer a dream showing him that God desired to have Bethel, a house on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Humanly speaking nothing can express you so much as your house.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When you look at people's dwelling places, right away you can realize what kind of people they are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God wants a dwelling place on this earth to express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The ninth landmark in Genesis was Joseph who ruled on the earth for God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually all of Jacob's descendants fell into Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After four hundred years, God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt to Mount Sinai where He revealed the tabernacle to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God wanted them to be His dwelling place that God might be expressed among them and through them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Later, that tabernacle was enlarged into a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The tabernacle was a traveling house of God, but the temple became a settled house upon this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This covers the entire Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First of all God had nine men from Adam to Joseph who expressed Him in a limited way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then in the second book of the Bible, Exodus, God got a collective people who became His expression in a full way.</S>
