<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Releasing the Divine Life for the Producing<br>of the Believers to Constitute the Body of Christ</H2><P>In the above aspects of Christ's death, He dealt with all of the negative things. On the positive side, He released the divine life through His death for the producing of the believers to constitute the Body of Christ (John 12:24; 1 Cor. 10:17). All these things were accomplished by one death, the death of Christ in His crucifixion. God participated in that death, so God moved in that death in man.</P><P>The crucifixion was not only Christ's work but also God's move in man, so it is God's history. God was merely God in eternity. Then one day He came out of eternity and entered into time, and He entered into humanity with His divinity. He was embodied in Christ, who died an all-inclusive death in His crucifixion. Actually, all of world history is God's history. All of the world affairs are not only the history of man but also the history of God. It depends on the vision you have. If you have only physical sight, you see the world situation, the human history. If you have the spiritual sight, the spiritual view, you can see someone working behind the world situation. When we look at human history with the world situation, we must have another view, the biblical view with the spiritual insight.</P><P>The crucifixion of Christ was a part of human history. According to human history, Jesus, a Jew and a Nazarene, was nailed on the cross by the Roman soldiers. But behind this visible scene there was an invisible scene. Who was there on the cross? God was there to bear the sin and sins of man. God was there to die for fallen mankind. God was there to crucify the old man, to destroy Satan, the power of death, to judge and crucify the world, and to taste death for all things. Everything in the old creation is dying. Everything is decaying. Therefore, God tasted death for all things, so all things could be redeemed and reconciled to God. Also, on the cross the shell of His humanity was broken, and God released the divine life. God was working in the crucifixion of Christ.</P><P>No secular historian on earth can touch these things. They do not have this view. Even many Christians do not have a view to see that God accomplished seven items on the negative side plus one item on the positive side. In the positive aspect of the cross, God released Himself as the divine life. The cross was God's move and has become God's history.</P>
