   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: Concerning full-time service, there is a brother who is about thirty-five years old.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is very energetic, and his spiritual condition is good, but he does not have sufficient education.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What should we do in this situation?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Answer: Education is related to function.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If this brother s spiritual function clearly manifests that he should serve the Lord full time, then he should become a full-time serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is an important point when we are approving the saints to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must look at their function to see whether it is necessary for them to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We encourage the young people who have completed a technical college education to continue their studies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some university graduates also need to continue their studies for their service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The young people must learn to speak and write in both Chinese and English, because English is an international language.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not know English, our function will be reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, the young people surely must study these two languages.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The young people should also study Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This does not mean that they should obtain a degree in it, but they should study enough Greek to be able to understand the basics of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then they will be able to use reference books and the Bible in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is related to our ability to understand the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Question: In the localities where there are many full-time brothers and sisters, should the full-timers have corporate times to study, pray, fellowship, and discuss matters related to their service?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are many saints who are not full-time but who bear an important burden in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In what way should they coordinate with the full-timers?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Answer: These matters require us to go before the Lord and then make decisions according to the situation in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I can give you only general principles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, I can tell you to eat three meals a day, but you have to determine the time of your meals and whether you should eat with a fork and knife, chopsticks, or your fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Question: What does it mean to be a part-time serving one?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Answer: To be a part-time serving one means that a person is unable to give all his time, but he is able to give more time than a saint with normal working hours.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In other words, some saints give all their time to serve the Lord, and other saints cannot give all their time, but they are able to give some of the time that they would normally use at a job.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead of serving in their spare time, these saints are part time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Question: What should we do about a saint who is individualistic and has a peculiar disposition, yet he wants to serve the Lord full time?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Answer: Today s education emphasizes four aspects: moral education, intellectual education, physical education, and education in social interaction.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Concerning social interaction, a person who serves the Lord must be able to get along with others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If he is unable to get along with others, he cannot be useful no matter how capable he is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christians should be like honeybees, not butterflies.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When honeybees come together, it is difficult to tell which one is the first and which is the last.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we lose our peculiar characteristics, we are like honeybees.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we keep our peculiar characteristics, we are like butterflies.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Saints who are like butterflies are not good for church service.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, such saints should not serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Full-time serving ones must be like honeybees.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They must be able to get along with others, that is, to work as a team.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let me illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When a brother goes to Los Angeles, he should be a brother in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He should not be perceived as a brother from Taiwan; otherwise, he will be like a butterfly instead of a honeybee.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A brother from Taipei who goes to Kaohsiung should immediately become a brother from Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He should not give others the sense that he is a butterfly from Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Lord s recovery, especially in our training, we are all honeybees, despite the fact that we are of different nationalities.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our training is like a beehive in which all the honeybees live.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The entrance to a beehive is too small to allow a butterfly to enter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this reason, the responsible brothers in every locality must spend time and effort to labor on brothers who are individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must let them know that their past actions in the meetings and in the church life were individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even though they love the Lord and want to serve Him full time, they must first learn some lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, they should wait and not serve full time yet.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Question: I have two children, and I want to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>My family approves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Answer: We should not have the concept that full-time serving ones should never get married.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the full-time sisters should get married.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Serving full time should not interrupt a marriage, nor should it affect a sister s place as a wife and a mother.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In other words, it is possible to have a husband and children and serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A sister is blessed when her family, parents, and in-laws approve of her serving full time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>With their approval comes their help.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is proper for her to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not a matter of whether she should serve full time but of how she should use her time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She must first make some arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>She should ask her mother to do the things that her mother can do, and she should ask her mother-in-law to do the things that her mother-in-law can do.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If her mother and mother-in-law cannot help her children with their homework, then this sister must help her children.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>She must not say that she has to help her children with their homework and therefore has no time to pursue the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>She still must pursue the Lord, but she must do it according to her measure.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No saint is truly full time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We all have personal matters that require our time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If serving full time was according to our concept, we would not have time to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Serving full time is a matter of our condition before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must care for our husbands, wives, and children.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When I get up in the morning, I spend the time to comb my hair and wash up.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is wrong to be so zealous that we care for nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>For the sake of coordinating with the brothers and sisters, we should take care of their feelings and do things properly.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>No matter how much we love the Lord or how spiritual we are, we are still people in the flesh, and our living is in the physical realm.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Since we must live in our physical bodies, we must be normal humans so that we can coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>On the one hand, we need to do our best to give our strength, time, and everything for the service; on the other hand, we still must have a normal living.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is what it means to serve full time.</S>
