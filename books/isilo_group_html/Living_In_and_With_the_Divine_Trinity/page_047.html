Verse 62 says, "What then if you should see the Son of Man ascending where He was before?" Verses 63 through 65 show us Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit. The Lord was talking about Himself in the flesh, but in verse 63 He said, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing." At this point, the Spirit who gives life is brought in. After resurrection and through resurrection, the Lord Jesus, who had become flesh, became the Spirit who gives life, as is clearly mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:45. In the next section of verses, verses 66 through 71, Christ embodied in the word of life is revealed.</P><P>It is wonderful to see such a sequence in John 6. In this chapter we see Christ as the food abiding to eternal life incarnated, slain, resurrected to indwell, ascended, becoming the life-giving Spirit, and embodied in the word of life. After being slain, the very Christ entered into His resurrection to be our eatable food. We are now eating a resurrected One.</P><P>John 14:19-20 shows the very Christ as the resurrected One. These verses say, "Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you shall live also. In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you." For a little while, while He was buried, the world would behold Him no longer because He was slain. For Him to live is for Him to be resurrected. First Peter 1:3 says that we all were regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. John 14:19 corresponds with 1 Peter 1:3. When Christ lives, we also live. When Christ became living in His resurrection, we all were resurrected with Him. He, including us, came out of death. He lives and we also live because of Him.</P><P>The Lord went on in verse 20 to tell the disciples that in the day of resurrection, they would know that He is in His Father, that they are in Him, and that He is in them. We are now in the One who is in resurrection, and the One who is in resurrection, the pneumatic Christ as the life-giving Spirit, is in us. When the Lord was in the flesh, He was only among the disciples and outside of them, but He was not in them. On the evening of the day of His resurrection, He came back to His disciples as the pneumatic Christ and breathed Himself into them. When He breathed into them, He told them to receive the holy breath, the Holy Spirit, the holy pneuma, which was just Himself (John 20:22). After breathing Himself into them, He remained within them as the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit.</P><P>All of these divine secrets have been written down in the Bible, but very few throughout the centuries have seen them. We are greatly blessed to see Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, becoming a life-giving Spirit, and embodiment in the word of life as revealed in John 6. Christ as the bread of life became a life-giving Spirit, and this life-giving Spirit has been embodied in the Word. Christ as the bread of life is the Spirit and the Word. The Spirit and the Word are life to us. The Spirit is within and the Word is without. As we enjoy the Spirit and the Word, we enjoy the real essence of the life-giving bread. The life-giving bread is the Spirit with the Word, and the Spirit with the Word is the very Christ in resurrection, the pneumatic Christ.</P><P>We are now living in this Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God. When we live in Him, we abide in Him. When we abide in Him, we abide in the embodiment, the organism, of the Divine Trinity. We are not merely remaining in Him or staying in Him; we are living in Him and having our being in Him in the way that we live in a home. To live in a home is to have everything concerning your life in that home. This is what it means to live in the Divine Trinity. We are living in such a One who has gone through incarnation, crucifixion, and is now in resurrection. With Him there is nothing dead. With Him everything is living and organic. As we live in this living, organic One, His living Body is built up to express God and to fulfill God's eternal purpose.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Living In and With the Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 47</div><br></body></html>
