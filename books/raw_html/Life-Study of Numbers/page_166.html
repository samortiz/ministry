<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FIGHTING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(14)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Num. 32:1-42</H1><P>In this message we will begin to consider the prearrangement of the distribution of the good land (32:1-42; 33:50&#151;36:13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. THE PREARRANGEMENT<br>OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE GOOD LAND</H2><P>The last five chapters of Numbers, the best portion of the book, cover the prearrangement of the good land. This prearrangement typifies the sharing of the enjoyment of the rich Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Concerning the Land East of the Jordan</H2><P>The good land was on both sides of the river Jordan, on the east and on the west. The land west of the Jordan is better than the land east of the Jordan. Numbers 32:1-42 concerns the land east of the Jordan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Request of the Two Tribes, Reuben and Gad</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. A Desire to Receive What God Had Promised</H2><P>The request of the two tribes, Reuben and Gad (vv. 1-5), was not wrong, but neither was it right. Their desire was to receive what God had promised, according to their choice as the best, not according to God's choice as the best. The desire to receive what God had promised was not wrong. However, they were not right in wanting to receive this according to their choice as the best. Eventually, their land was the first part of the land of Israel to be taken over by the Gentile invaders from the east. The tribes of Reuben and Gad suffered, and this suffering was related to their having their own choice.</P><P>In spiritual matters it is terrible to do things according to our choice. Whatever is according to our choice will not turn out to be profitable. We may think that our choice is the best, but it is actually the worst. Therefore, in spiritual matters we should try not to act according to our choice. It is much better for us to leave matters in the hand of the Lord and let Him do according to His choice.</P>
