   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ACCUSATION FROM SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, sometimes after you confess and apply the blood you may continue to have some bad feeling within.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Does this indicate that your sin is not forgiven?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Or that the blood of Christ does not work?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Or that something further is needed?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You must answer, Absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Where, then, do these bad feelings come from after you have confessed and applied the blood?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Their source is God s enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To understand this we must see who Satan is and what he does.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan is the devil, which in the original language of the Bible means accuser.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So Revelation 12:10 refers to him as the accuser of our brothers,...who accuses them before our God day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Satan, God s enemy, spends most of his time day and night accusing God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is his job.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, God did not ask him to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, he has taken it upon himself to accuse God s people incessantly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is revealed in the story of Job Job was a righteous man, and feared God Job 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet it is recorded that Satan appeared before God to accuse Job before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He said, Does Job fear God without cause?...You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions are spread throughout the land.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But stretch forth Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face Job 1:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, Satan accused Job of only fearing God because God had blessed him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Satan claimed that God bribed Job and that if God took away all Job s riches, Job would curse God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This illustrates Satan s accusing in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the book of Zechariah, the high priest, Joshua, stood before God and Satan stood at his right hand to be his adversary 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Joshua was clothed with filthy garments v. 3 . This speaks of his poor, sinful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How often your poor condition gives Satan the opportunity to accuse you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This implies that Satan is not only God s enemy, but he is your enemy as well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever you come to God, Satan resists your coming by accusing you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nothing cripples a Christian spiritually more than accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever you listen to Satan s accusation, you are powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is as if all the strength is drained from your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A Christian under accusation finds it hard to fellowship with others and even harder to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He feels as though he cannot approach God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the enemy s subtlety.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He never appears in a red suit with a pitchfork crying, I am the devil!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now I am going to condemn you!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is more clever than that.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He accuses you inwardly and even tricks you into thinking that his accusations are God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How can you distinguish between God s true enlightening in your conscience and Satan s accusation?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes it is difficult, but there are three ways:</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, God s light supplies you, whereas Satan s accusation drains you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When God speaks concerning your sins, you may feel very exposed and wounded.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nevertheless, you are also supplied and encouraged to draw close to God and apply the precious blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Satan s accusations, on the other hand, are totally negative.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more you listen, the harder it is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You feel empty and discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Second, God s speaking is always specific, whereas Satan s condemnation is quite often though not always general.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes you may be tricked into thinking that you are just tired, or that you have had a rough day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Other times, you may just have a general impression that you are not right with God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But when you search your conscience, you find no specific sin that would cause you to be separated from God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Or you may wake up with a general feeling of depression or a feeling of uneasiness toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All these general feelings of condemnation that have no apparent source in sin are of Satan and should be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When God speaks, He is specific and positive.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But when Satan speaks, he is often general and negative.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Third, any uneasy feeling which remains after you confess and claim the blood is of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is never a need to confess and claim the blood again.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God s demand is at once satisfied by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But Satan is never satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He would like to see you confess again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Proverbs 27:15 says, A continual dripping on a very rainy day / And a contentious woman are alike.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Satan s accusations are like that like a dripping faucet, or like a nagging wife they will not let you go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But God s speaking is different.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When you confess and claim the cleansing of the blood, God is instantly satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Any further voice is Satan s.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you confess your sin and claim the precious blood, yet some uneasiness continues to tug at you within, you should stop praying immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not confess anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Rather, turn to the source of the accusation and say something like this: Satan, I have confessed my sin to God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He has forgiven my sin, and the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed me from it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This uneasiness that I sense right now is not from God; it is from you, and I reject it!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Satan, now you must look at the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>That blood answers every one of your accusations.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Try speaking to Satan in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When you use the blood in this way, Satan is defeated and he knows it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Revelation 12:10-11 says, The accuser of our brothers has been cast down....And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The word of your testimony is just your declaration that the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed you from every sin and that this blood has defeated Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When you speak boldly in this way, Satan s accusations are overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Christian life is a kind of warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Satan, your adversary...as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking someone to devour 1 Pet 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>For this warfare, you need the proper weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>One important weapon which you must utilize is the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>A DAILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>FULL OF GOD S PRESENCE</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>By the power of the precious blood of Christ, it is possible for a Christian to live moment by moment in God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Whenever any little sin would come to frustrate your fellowship with God, you may instantly confess and claim the Lord s prevailing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Immediately the fellowship is restored.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Why should you waste time?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The blood of Christ is available moment by moment, day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You can never exhaust the cleansing power of the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>His blood is not only able to cleanse every past sin, but also every sin that you could ever commit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>By the power of the precious blood of Christ, you may enjoy a conscience free from the stain of guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Because of this, you can come boldly to God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Let us come forward...with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience Heb 10:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>By the blood of Christ, your conscience can be free from guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Like a freshly washed window, it can be clear, bright, and full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Finally, by the power of the precious blood of Christ, you can overcome every accusation of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Though his accusations may be strong, the blood of Christ is stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It answers them, every one.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This blood is your weapon.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>With this weapon you could never be defeated by Satan; rather, he will be defeated by you.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>How dear and how precious is the blood of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>By this blood you can live in God s presence day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>1 John 1:7</S>
