<p>A separating veil was located between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies is within the veil (26:33-34; Heb. 9:3, 8). The veil typifies the man of flesh, which the Lord Jesus put on. Only when a man is broken can he enter into the spirit. The bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar in the Holy Place typify Christ as our bread of life, our light of life, and our acceptance before God. It can be said that the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar refer to aspects of Christ. However, the Ark in the Holy of Holies refers to Christ Himself, to God Himself. The three items that are displayed openly in the Holy Place are related to items hidden within the Ark in the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies the hidden manna within the Ark is related to the bread of the Presence. This is the hidden manna referred to in Revelation 2:17, the manna that was placed before Jehovah (Exo. 16:32-33), not the manna which fell from heaven for the children of Israel to eat (vv. 4-5, 14-16). In the Holy of Holies the tablets of the law within the Ark are related to the lampstand. The law is light. Psalm 119 tells us that the shining forth of the law is light (v. 105). The light of life is the shining forth of the law of life. Even though the law is hidden inwardly, the light shines forth outwardly. The budding rod within the Ark is related to the golden incense altar.</p>
<p>The incense altar was the basis and proof of man&rsquo;s acceptance by God, and the budding rod was the basis and proof that Aaron&rsquo;s house was accepted by God. Both the incense altar and the budding rod are items in resurrection, and both are related to acceptance and recognition. A man can be accepted by God in resurrection only when he rejects himself. The company of Korah was able to stand up and speak, but God did not accept or recognize them. God accepted and recognized the budding rod (Num. 16:1&mdash;17:13). Men may do many things before God, but God may not accept or recognize them. God&rsquo;s acceptance and recognition are at the incense altar. Hence, the incense altar and the budding rod are actually one in the matter of God&rsquo;s acceptance and recognition.</p>
<p>Moreover, both the incense altar and the budding rod are items related to resurrection. God&rsquo;s acceptance and recognition are only in resurrection. If we live in ourselves, we will be as those of the company of Korah and will provoke God&rsquo;s hatred and rejection. On the other hand, if we are like Moses and Aaron, rejecting ourselves and living in resurrection, we will surely be accepted and recognized by God. Resurrection is Christ. The budding rod of Aaron in the Ark indicates that acceptance is related to the Ark.</p>
<p>The three items in the Holy Place have been encapsulated within the Ark, that is, within Christ, in the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies, Christ is everything and He is hidden. We, to a limited degree, have experienced Christ within the Holy of Holies. Some experience Christ&rsquo;s life as the bread of the Presence, whereas others experience Christ&rsquo;s life as the hidden manna. Some are led by Christ through enjoying the shining of the lampstand, whereas others are led by Christ through experiencing the hidden law. Some experience Christ as the incense altar for their acceptance by God, whereas others experience Christ as the budding rod for their acceptance by God. Everything in the Holy Place is manifest, whereas everything in the Holy of Holies is hidden. These experiences indicate that the cross, the washing of the Holy Spirit, the manifest Christ, and the hidden Christ are all in the church. Because of the differences among the saints in their knowledge and experience of the various aspects of Christ, there is a corresponding difference in their degree and level of spirituality.</p>
<p>In the church, some are experiencing the redemption of the cross and the washing of the Holy Spirit. These saints are living in the outer court. Other saints are experiencing Christ as their life, light, power, and acceptance. They are excited, living, shining, and fresh and have sweet fellowship with God. When we touch them, we can tell that they are Christians in the Holy Place. There is also a small number of saints who are deeper in their experience, knowledge, and gaining of Christ than those in the Holy Place. Christ is their hidden manna, their hidden law, and their hidden acceptance. When we contact them, we cannot see the bread of the Presence, the shining light, or the ascending incense. However, we can sense that they have the hidden manna and the inward law. They have a deeper knowledge of God, and they have the authority, the resurrection life, and God&rsquo;s acceptance in them. They are not merely influenced by Christ but are living in Christ. They have advanced further and are Christians living in the Holy of Holies. These conditions are the content of the church.</p>
<p>If we read the New Testament without reading the Old Testament, we can never gain such a clear understanding regarding the content of the church. The types related to the furniture in the tabernacle show that there are saints in the church who have these different experiences. The fourth book of Psalms can be said to be concerning the Holy of Holies. Experience indicates that the Holy of Holies is God Himself. Psalm 90:1 says, &ldquo;O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations.&rdquo; God has been our dwelling place in all generations. He is our Holy of Holies. On the other hand, the Holy of Holies is our spirit, the place where God mingles with man. When we live in Him, He also lives in us. Our mingling with God is a spiritual Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>When we are mingled with God, Christ is richly hidden within us. The Holy of Holies is nothing less than Christ Himself. To God, the Holy of Holies is our regenerated spirit; to us, it is the God whom we experience. God lives in our human spirit, and we live in God. We are in union with one another. Christ is the center of this union, just as the Ark was the center of the Holy of Holies. In Christ as the center are the hidden life, the hidden light, and the hidden authority. Everything that enables us to live before God, walk before God, and reign for God is hidden in Christ as the center. Everything that causes us to be joined to God and to live before God is through Christ the center. Now that we have been united with God, we should fully take this One as our center. Christ is the real content of the church.</p>
<p>The three items in the Holy Place are particularly related to the three parts of our soul, and the three items in the Holy of Holies are related to the three parts of our spirit. The lampstand in the Holy Place is related to our mind, the incense altar is related to our emotion, and the bread of the Presence is related to our will. Whether a person&rsquo;s thoughts are clear before God depends upon the light he receives from God. Whether a person&rsquo;s feelings and emotions are stable depends upon his being accepted by God. Likewise, whether a person is strong in his will depends upon the supply of Christ he receives inwardly. Thus, the three items in the Holy Place have a special relationship with the three parts of our soul.</p>
<p>The three items within the Ark in the Holy of Holies are related to the three parts of our spirit. The function of the intuition in our spirit is similar to the function of the mind in our soul; it enables us to understand and sense spiritual matters. The function of our conscience in our spirit is similar to the function of the emotion in our soul. Whether or not we have peace and sense God&rsquo;s acceptance are matters of the conscience. The function of the fellowship in our spirit depends upon the supply of life and is thus related to the will in our soul. The hidden manna is related to the fellowship in our spirit, because fellowship is out of life and of life. The budding rod is related to the conscience in our spirit, because the conscience enables us to obtain peace before God. And the inner law is related to the intuition in our spirit, because the intuition enables us to know God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>The three items in the Holy Place are clearly related to the three parts of our soul, and the three items in the Holy of Holies are clearly related to the three parts of our spirit. In other words, when our spiritual condition corresponds to the Holy Place, our mind is enlightened by Christ as the light of life, our will is strengthened by Christ&rsquo;s life, and our emotion is joyful and peaceful because of Christ&rsquo;s acceptance. When we progress to live in our spirit, the inner law enables our intuition to touch God&rsquo;s will, the acceptance of Christ in resurrection enables us to have peace in our conscience, and the hidden life supply enables us to have fellowship within.</p>
<p>From our perspective, our experience begins at the altar, but as far as God is concerned, it begins from the Ark. All the experiences related to the tabernacle have their basis in the altar. The altar is the cross. Regardless of the starting point, the arrangement of the furniture in the tabernacle forms the shape of the cross. The cross is the basis for all spiritual experiences and includes all spiritual experience. All experiences issue from the cross. The experience of the cross is not for the sake of experiencing the cross; rather, the cross enables man to experience Christ. The ultimate goal of the cross is for man to enter into God and be in complete union with God. In this way, man and God become the universal Holy of Holies with Christ as the center. This is confirmed by experience.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> </body></html>
