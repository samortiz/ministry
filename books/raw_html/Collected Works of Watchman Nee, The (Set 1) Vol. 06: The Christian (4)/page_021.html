<H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ROBBER SAVED</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 11</H2><P>We will first read two sections of the Bible. Mark 15:27-32 tells about the Lord Jesus being crucified on the cross. "And with Him they [those who nailed the Lord Jesus] crucified two robbers, one on His right and one on His left....And those who were passing by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, Save Yourself and come down from the cross! Likewise also the chief priests with the scribes mocked Him with one another and said, He saved others; Himself He cannot save. Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe. Those who were crucified with Him also reproached Him."</P><P>"And one of the criminals who were hanged there blasphemed Him, saying, Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us! But the other, answering, rebuked him and said, Do you not even fear God, since you are in the same judgment? And we justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for what we did, but this Man has done nothing amiss. And he said, Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom. And He said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" (Luke 23:39-43).</P><P>These two sections of the Bible tell us the story of a robber who was saved shortly before his death. This is a strange story! A robber was saved! We think that the robber should be punished, that the death-defying prisoner should descend to the deepest part of hell to receive the gravest punishment, and that salvation should belong to the good people in the world. Can robbers be saved? Yes, robbers can be saved because in these verses a robber was saved. This robber was saved before his death! We often think that if a man does good all his life, he will gradually obtain salvation. We often think that salvation can be accomplished by our efforts through months and years of accumulated hard work. Is it possible that someone who committed robbery all his life, someone who had criminal offenses, was suddenly saved in the moment just before his death? Very much so. Someone who has done evil all his life, who has never done anything good, can be saved immediately upon believing in the Lord Jesus. Man can be saved in a brief moment, within the shortest time, when he believes in the Lord Jesus. What an amazing story! What a wonderful salvation!</P><P>The Lord Jesus said to the robber, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise." Where the Lord would be, he would be also. He was saved, no more to perish. Now we would like to see what type of person this saved man was.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE CONDUCT OF THIS SAVED PERSON</H2><P>He was a robber. For someone to become a robber, his character must be completely bankrupt. No position for man can be lower than that of a robber. As a robber, he had fallen to the lowest state that a man can ever sink to. A robber is lawless, without any regard for the law in his eyes, lazy, unwilling to work to feed himself; greedy, coveting other people's possessions; cruel, usurping others' possessions and killing, causing havoc to human lives. How reckless and unrestrained is he! He steals other people's belongings and loots other people's possessions. From man's viewpoint, it is absolutely hopeless to save this type of person.</P><P>As a robber, he trespassed against the law and was captured by the Roman government. He went through the judicial procedure of the Roman court. Being condemned as a criminal of gross sin, he was given the most severe punishment—crucifixion. Compared with man's law, God's law is stricter and more refined. In many instances man's law does not or cannot condemn certain things as sin, but God's law shuts them all up in the realm of sin so that man can have nothing more to say. Man's law condemns the conduct of man. It cannot touch the intent of the heart. If a manifested conduct is condemned by man's law, how much more is it condemned before the stricter and more refined law of God? He was a robber. Under Roman law he was declared guilty and sentenced to death. Can such a person obtain God's grace? If he was condemned by men, who can only see outward conduct without seeing the heart, God, who searches man's inward parts and examines man's conduct, should condemn him much more. Does not the soul of such a man deserve to perish?</P><P>He was not only branded as a robber by man and sentenced to death by the Roman government, he even deserved unpardoned death in his own eyes. He told the other robber who was nailed with him, "And we justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for what we did" (Luke 23:41). At this juncture between life and death, he had forgotten how the government had condemned him and how the people had mocked him. As he recalled his lifelong behavior, he could not help but confess that he deserved his death sentence because his deeds befitted the punishment of the cross. At this moment the sorrow and pain of his conscience was far more unbearable than the pain he suffered in his flesh. Having been enlightened by God, he knew his own sin; therefore, he could confess it as sin. In man's view and according to man's decision, can a man convicted by his conscience have the hope of salvation? It seemed that he deserved more than perdition!</P><P>When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, according to the verses in Mark, there were three groups of people who mocked Him: (1) those who passed by, (2) the chief priest and the scribes, and (3) the thieves who were nailed next to him. On the cross, the two saw and heard many people mocking the Lord Jesus, so they also joined with the others to mock Him. This robber was a man with no backbone. He saw how other people wronged Christ and opposed Christ; and without even knowing the reason for it, he just turned with the tide. Seeing everyone mocking in this way, he also joined in with the crowd. He should not have had any deep hatred or enmity towards Christ. However, when he saw the majority of the people doing wrong to Christ, he also joined the crowd, following blindly to blaspheme Him. Those who do wrong to Christ ought to perish; many have thought this.</P><P>Yet, one robber was saved. A robber was saved! A criminal was saved! A thief was saved! One condemned to die was saved! One who wronged Christ was saved! One who committed sin to the uttermost so that even he could not deny his guilt was saved! Therefore, who cannot be saved? Who is not qualified to be saved? O sinners of the world, this is the gospel! This is grace! He who can be viewed as having no possibility of being saved, God, in His mighty grace, saves, giving him eternal life that he may enjoy the bliss of Paradise. You may be a great sinner; you may think that you do not deserve to be saved but rather should perish, but God has decided to grant you grace and give you salvation. Do not be mistaken by thinking that salvation is reserved only for deserving ones and that you are not deserving of it. According to fact, no one in the world deserves salvation. But no one in the world is unqualified for salvation according to God's mercy. If God does not bestow grace and He deals with us according to our sins, even the most noble sages in the world will perish. Who is not a sinner before God? But if He bestows grace, who will not be saved? If a robber can be saved, you too can be saved. If a man will humble himself and will wait on God's grace, God will give grace to him, because God gives grace to the humble.</P><P>The wonderful thing about the gospel is that God sent His Son to save sinners—not the righteous. "Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners" (1 Tim. 1:15). This is contrary to the mind of the world. Nevertheless, this is a glorious fact. No matter how much you have sinned, Christ can save you. He saved the robber; He also saved the harlot. He saves sinners. He does not forsake you because of your sins, but rather, He came to save you because of your sins. No matter what kind of person you are, if only you are willing to come to Him, He is willing to save you. I remember a story. Once a man came to see Mr. Moody, and he said, "You don't have to persuade me to be a Christian or persuade me to believe in the Lord Jesus." Moody asked him, "Why is this?" He answered, "You don't know how hard my heart is!" Moody said with a smile, "Aha! So that's why. Don't worry; Christ did not say only the soft-hearted ones may come and that the hard-hearted ones need not come. Rather, He said that one can come whatever his heart is like. So it does not matter whether your heart is hard or soft, black or white. Every kind of heart can come." Indeed, Christ receives sinners; He comforts them and saves them. Since He was willing to save this robber, He is also willing to save you and me. In the eyes of the robber himself, he was a sinner. According to the world's classification, he was a sinner. According to the judgment of the Roman government, he was a sinner. Nevertheless, Christ saves sinners. What grace this is! What is this? This is salvation. This is Christ saving sinners in grace.</P>
