   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE NINETY-THREE BEING MATURED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PROCESS OF MATURITY 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we consider further Jacob's dealings at Hebron, we need to point out the difference between transformation and maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The last stage of transformation is maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Maturity means the fullness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When one is mature, he has no shortage of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The more life we have, the more mature we are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>An infant is obviously not mature, but a grown man is mature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For a human being to be mature means that his life has come into fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Transformation is a metabolic change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, transformation is not a matter of fullness; it is a matter of change.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Plants do not require transformation, because they are simply plants.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we, the children of God, need transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only through transformation can we reach maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have a natural life, but this life is not good for God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although our natural life does not need to be replaced, it does need to be metabolically changed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must not only have an outward change in appearance, but also an inward change in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although our human life is necessary for God's economy, it should not remain a natural human life; it should be a human life that has been transformed in nature so that the divine life may be mingled with the transformed human life to become one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a deep matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At least two verses in the New Testament unveil the matter of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Romans 12:2 says, "Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Greek word translated "transformed" in this verse also appears in 2 Corinthians 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the Greek, this verse should be rendered, "And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word "transformed" in these verses indicates that in our Christian life we need a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not need outward correction and alteration; rather, we need an inward change in nature and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This metabolic change begins with regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we were saved, we were not only justified and our sins forgiven; we were also regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At regeneration a new life, the divine life, was put into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From the time of our regeneration, this life has been transforming our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As the divine life changes our natural life, it imparts more and more of the divine life into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, transformation is the change of our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When this change reaches the point of fullness, the time of maturity has come.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To repeat, the last stage of transformation is maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Maturity is not a matter of our being changed; it is a matter of having the divine life imparted to us again and again until we have the fullness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us now apply this matter to Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although Jacob underwent many changes between chapters twenty-five and thirty-seven, we do not see any further change in him after chapter thirty-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In chapter twenty-five Jacob was a supplanter, a heel-holder.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we read from chapter twenty-six to thirty-six, which covers a period of approximately twenty-five years, we see how Jacob changed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everything that happened to him during these years was for his transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When in chapter thirty-seven Jacob lost his beloved son, Joseph, he was absolutely different from the person he was in chapter twenty-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In a spiritual sense, the Jacob in chapter twenty-seven had several hands to use in grasping whatever he wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He grasped what belonged to his father, to Esau, and, later on, to Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, in chapter thirty-seven Jacob did not even use his own two hands.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Jacob in this chapter seems to have no skill or ability; instead, it seems that he is not able to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This indicates that he has absolutely changed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From chapter thirty-seven until the end of this book, we do not see any further change in this man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In these chapters we see a person who has not only been changed; we see a person who is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In chapter thirty-seven we see neither change nor the fullness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The change took place before this chapter, and the fullness of life was reached after it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I would ask you to read chapters twenty-seven, thirtyseven, and forty-seven once again.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In chapter twenty-seven we see a supplanter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He had many hands, he was able to do everything, and no one could defeat him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whoever came in contact with Jacob his father, his brother, or his uncle was the loser.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Jacob, on the contrary, always came out ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He made a gain from his brother, from his father, and from his uncle.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He even made a gain from Rachel, Leah, and their two maids.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, at the time of Rachel's death, Jacob began to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But even this loss produced a gain, and that gain was Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In chapter thirty-seven Jacob underwent another loss, the loss of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this chapter Jacob did not gain anything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From this point onward, Jacob lost one thing after another.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Eventually, in chapter forty-seven, he gained the fullness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The fullness of life is blessing, which is the overflow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When you are filled past the brim with life, this life will overflow into others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This overflow is the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, in chapter twenty-seven we see a supplanter; in chapter thirty-seven, a transformed man; and in chapter forty-seven, a mature person.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Jacob's transformation began at the time God came in to touch him 32:25 , and it continued until chapter thirty-seven, when the process of transformation was relatively complete.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, in this chapter Jacob did not yet have maturity, the fullness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In order to gain this, he had to experience the dealings in the last stage, the dealings at Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now we must consider how Jacob, a transformed person, could be filled with life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Human beings are vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, unlike jars and bottles, we are not vessels without feeling, sense, or will.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you want to fill a bottle with a certain liquid, the bottle has no opinion or feeling about it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is no need to have the consent of the bottle before we fill it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But it is difficult to put something in us living vessels because we are filled with opinions, desires, and intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Parents know how difficult it is to put medicine into their children.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Likewise, it is not an easy matter for God to put His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Now I want to point out a hidden matter in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Jacob's first dealing in the last stage was the loss of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Joseph was seventeen years old when he was sold 37:2 , and he was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh 41:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Following this, there were the seven plenteous years.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It was probably one or two years later that Jacob sent his sons to Egypt to buy grain.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Therefore, from the selling of Joseph to the sending of Jacob's sons to Egypt was a period of at least twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Bible does not afford us any record of what Jacob did during these years.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It only gives us an account of what Joseph experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As far as the record of Jacob is concerned, this period of twenty years was a time of silence.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>What do you think Jacob was doing during this time?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If you had been Jacob, what would you have done?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I have considered this matter very much, and I think I have discovered something.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>During these years Jacob had nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He had no lack and he had no ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Jacob had cared only for Rachel, not for Leah and the two maids.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>After Rachel died, Jacob's heart was set on Joseph, who was taken away from him about a year later.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>After Joseph was taken away, Jacob had virtually nothing left.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Therefore, during these silent years he was a person without any ambitions, interests, or things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This must have been the time God imparted Himself into Jacob more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>How different were these twenty years from the twenty years with Laban!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>During the twenty years with Laban 31:41 , Jacob had struggled against Laban and had been concerned about dealing with Rachel, Leah, the maids, and all his children.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But in these twenty years at Hebron Jacob was released from any bondage or occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He was not only retired he was free.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The only thing that could not be taken away from Jacob was God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>At Hebron Jacob constantly lived in fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Through the loss of Joseph, Jacob became a jar that was absolutely open to God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Joseph's presence might have been a hindrance to Jacob's openness to God.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But now, after the loss of Joseph, Jacob was free from every frustration and was completely open to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Undoubtedly, Jacob thought about Joseph day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He had concluded that Joseph had been devoured by an evil beast, but this had not been confirmed.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Hence, Jacob might have thought that perhaps he would see Joseph again.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This pressed Jacob to God and opened him up to God.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The more he thought about Joseph, the more open he was.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>During all these years, Jacob was a jar open to the heavens, and the heavenly rain was continuously falling into him.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In this period of time Jacob was daily in the presence of God, being filled with the divine life.</S>
