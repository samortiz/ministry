   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After reading these verses, we should know how much God pays attention to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is because the body is particularly the sphere of the activities of "sin."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The reason man is the slave of "sin" is that man's body is the puppet of "sin."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever the body becomes unemployed to "sin," man becomes the slave of "sin" no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we see that a man is freed from "sin" when his body is delivered from the power and might of "sin."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because of this we see "our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The crucifixion of the old man is to cause the body to be delivered from the dominion of "sin."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The old man, which is the co-worker of "sin," has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now the new man occupies the position formerly occupied by the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now the Spirit of God lives within.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although sin still exists, its power over the body has been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because of the crucifixion of the old man, "sin" can no longer use the body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without the old man as its co-worker, "sin" cannot use the body directly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we must remember that our deliverance from "sin" is only to have our body delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, we still have to wait until the future for the full redemption, to be freed from the presence of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The natural life the soul-life by which we live has not been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we consider the living of overcoming sin as the highest living, then we merely consider the "paralysis" of the body as the highest living and have forgotten that besides our body of sin, there is still a natural soul, the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This soul-life, just like the body, needs to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a believer only knows the "annulling" of the body of course, this is already very marvelous , yet he does not know how to deny his soul-life, his spiritual experience is rather shallow and cannot be very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have mentioned previously how "self" soul is still very active in the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, although the body has become paralyzed, the whole life of the soul is still very active at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This life is sheltered in the self, yet this life has very different expressions outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The soul-life is comprised of at least three main parts the will, the mind, and the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, when the believers live according to the soul-life, some incline toward the will, some incline toward the mind, and some incline toward the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Or sometimes they incline toward one part and at other times toward another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although the outward manifestations may differ significantly due to the differences between the will, the mind, and the emotion, they are the same in that they belong to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For those who incline toward the will, the focus of their living is their own preference, and they are not willing to obey God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who incline toward the mind chart the course of their way by their own wisdom instead of following the guidance of the Holy Spirit in their intuition in a calm and undisturbed manner.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who incline toward the emotion seek pleasures in their feelings, considering this to be the supreme living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, if believers walk according to their soul-life, regardless of what their inclination is, one thing is common to all of them, that is, that they live by the power of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This power of the self is all the believer's natural power which he had before he believed in the Lord, whether talent, ability, eloquence, cleverness, charisma, enthusiasm, or whatever.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With regard to the believers who walk according to the soul-life, we must know that first, in principle, the soul-life is the natural power of the self, and second, in manifestation, the soul-life has three different livings stubbornly unsubmissive, self-conceited, or sensuously pleasure-seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a believer lives by his soul-life, exhausting his own energy for everything, inevitably he will outwardly have these three different expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At this time, if he does not go on and put his soul-life to death, he will nurture his "self-life" which causes God to be displeased and causes him to lose the fruit of the Holy Spirit.</S>
