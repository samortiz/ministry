   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 Jacob Being Robbed of the Treasure of His Heart</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>under God's Sovereign Hand</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to become mature, Jacob firstly had to suffer the loss of Joseph, the treasure of his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It seems impossible that Joseph could have been lost.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He could easily have died of a certain illness, but how could Jacob have lost him?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although he was not to die, because he was still very useful, he had to be taken away from Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we need to consider by what way Jacob's loss of Joseph took place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>a Joseph Bringing His Father Evil Reports of His Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 2 says that Joseph brought to his father evil reports regarding his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of all the twelve sons of Jacob, only two were good Joseph, who was seventeen years of age, and his younger brother, Benjamin, who was still a small child.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The other ten brothers were dirty and evil, and Joseph constantly brought to his father evil reports about them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first of these ten brothers, Reuben, committed adultery with his father's concubine 35:22 ; and the fourth, Judah, committed fornication with his daughter-in-law, who was disguised as a harlot 38:12-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Levi and Simeon were cruel, having avenged the defilement of their sister, Dinah, by slaying Hamor and Shechem and plundering their city 34:25-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fact that these brothers conspired to slay their own brother in the flesh indicates how sinful they were.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is difficult to believe that they were the sons of a chosen, holy family and that they were to become the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel chosen of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, had his brothers been good instead of evil, Joseph would never have been lost.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>b Israel Loving Joseph More Than All His Sons</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we have seen, "Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors" v. 3, Heb . Because of the partiality of Jacob's love for Joseph, he had to lose him in order to mature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The loss of Joseph was mainly due to Jacob's partial love for him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>c Joseph's Brothers Hating Him</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 4 says, "And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jacob's partial love for Joseph caused his other sons to hate Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because a partial love for a child creates hatred among the other children, parents should avoid it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our love must be equal and impartial.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Joseph's brothers also hated him because he was good and because he gave evil reports about them to their father.</S>
