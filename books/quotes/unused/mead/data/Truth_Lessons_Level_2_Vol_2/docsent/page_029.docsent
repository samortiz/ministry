   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>G. Having No Maturity in Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As a historical figure in the Bible, Isaac, like Abraham, does not represent a complete, spiritually mature man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He represents only a part of the experience and life of a spiritually mature person, which includes the inheriting of grace, not using one s own effort, and the restful enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When he was old, he blessed Jacob blindly Gen 27:1-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This proves that he was not sufficiently mature in his spiritual life and that he was not a complete, spiritually mature person, but can be considered only a part of such a person, just as we saw previously concerning Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ishmael was born of Abraham according to the flesh, through his concubine, Hagar, unto slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When Isaac grew and was weaned, Ishmael mocked him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Consequently, Ishmael and Hagar were cast out by Sarah, and Ishmael was not allowed to be heir along with Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, Ishmael signifies those who keep the law by their self-effort, those who are under slavery and are born according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They will be cast out from the inheritance of grace and will not be able to inherit and restfully enjoy God s grace as an inheritance with those who are born of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Isaac was born of Abraham according to promise, through Abraham s wife, Sarah, and he became the unique seed who inherited all the riches of his father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He also inherited the promise given to Abraham concerning Christ, in whom all the nations of the earth would be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Isaac had grown up and was weaned, Ishmael began to mock him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, Isaac was offered as a burnt offering and thus experienced death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, Isaac represents the New Testament believers, who are born to be sons of God according to the Holy Spirit by God s grace and who become God s heirs, inheriting and restfully enjoying God s possessions; who suffer persecution from those who are born according to flesh; and who are offered to God as a burnt offering, thereby experiencing death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Isaac was old, he blessed Jacob blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This proves that he was not sufficiently mature in his spiritual life and that he was not a complete, spiritually mature person, but can be considered only a part of such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>QUESTIONS Briefly state the spiritual significance of Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Briefly state the spiritual significance of Isaac s birth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Briefly state the characteristics of Isaac s entire life, and their significances.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Briefly state the promise of God inherited by Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Briefly state the spiritual significance of Isaac s being persecuted by Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Briefly state the spiritual significance of Isaac s being offered as a burnt offering and thereby experiencing death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Give some examples to prove that Isaac did not have the maturity in the spiritual life.</S>
