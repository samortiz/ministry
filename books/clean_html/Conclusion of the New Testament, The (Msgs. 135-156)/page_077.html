<h2 class=head4>(5) Participating in the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity</h2><p>John 16:13-15 say, “When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come. He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; therefore I said that He receives of Mine and shall disclose it to you.” These verses reveal that the believers participate in the dispensing of the divine Trinity. The Father has given all that He has to the Son, and the Spirit receives what is the Son’s and discloses it to the believers. Because the Father has given everything He has to the Son, the Son is His embodiment. Now whatever the Son is has been passed on to the Spirit. Hence, the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son. By this we see that the Son is the embodiment of the Father and the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son. This means that when we have the Spirit, we have the Son, and when we have the Son, we have the Father. We have all three: the Father as the source, the Son as the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit as the transfiguration of the Son.<h2 class=head5>(a) All That the Father Has Has Been Given to the Son</h2><p>In John 16:15a the Lord Jesus says, “All that the Father has is Mine.” All that the Father is and has is the Son’s. The Son is the embodiment of the Father. Hence, all that the Father is and has is embodied in Him (Col. 2:9). All that the Father is, all the fullness of the Godhead, dwells in Christ. Therefore, the Father’s fullness is the Son’s fullness, and the Father’s life and nature are also the Son’s life and nature.<h2 class=head5>(b) All That the Son Is, Has, and Does Has Been Received by the Spirit</h2><p>In John 16:14b the Lord Jesus, speaking of the Spirit of reality, says, “He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you.” The Lord repeats this word in verse 15b. All that the Father is and has is the Son’s, and all that the Son is and has obtained has been received by the Spirit. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ, and the Spirit receives this from Christ.<h2 class=head5>(c) The Spirit Discloses What He Has Received of the Son to the Believers, Testifying for Him and Glorifying Him</h2><p>What the Spirit receives of the Lord He discloses to us (John 16:14c, 15c, 13; 14:26b). Furthermore, the Spirit of reality guides us into all the reality. Furthermore, according to John 15:26, the Spirit of reality testifies concerning Christ, and according to 16:14a, He will glorify Christ. All that the Son is and has is revealed as reality to the believers through the Spirit. This is to glorify the Son with the Father. The Spirit glorifies the Son by revealing Him with all the fullness of the Father. This means that the Spirit glorifies the Son by revealing Him to us.<p>The Spirit discloses the Son with the Father to the believers. He makes all that Christ is and has real to us. The following stanza from one of our hymns speaks of this:<p class=hbody>All things of the Father are Thine;<br>All Thou art in Spirit is mine;<br>The Spirit makes Thee real to me,<br>That Thou experienced might be.</p><p>These words were written according to John 16:14-15.<p>John 16:14 and 15 unveil the transmission of the divine Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, into the believers. The Father as the source, the origin, has an abundance of riches. All that the Father has becomes the Son’s. Now the Son has not only what the Father has but also all the riches in His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. All these riches contained in the Son are received by the Spirit, and the Spirit discloses them to us. This disclosing is a transmission of the riches of what the processed Triune God is and has into our being. The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reaching of the divine Trinity to us. Therefore, all the riches of the Triune God reach us in the Spirit.<p>All that the Triune God is and has is disclosed, conveyed, transmitted into us. Because we are organically united to the Spirit, that is, organically one with the processed Triune God, whatever He is and has is now our portion. This means that whatever the processed Triune God is and has will become our element, our essence, our being, making the processed Triune God the very essence of our being.
