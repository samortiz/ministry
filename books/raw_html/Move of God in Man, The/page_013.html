<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Emmanuel&#151;God with Us</H2><P>We may say that the second issue of the incarnation is Emmanuel&#151;God with us (Matt. 1:23). Jesus was the name given by God, whereas Emmanuel, meaning God with us, was the name by which man called Him. This was a fulfillment of a prophecy by Isaiah in 7:14. God told Mary that she would bear a child whose name should be called Jesus. When Jesus came, people called Him Emmanuel, meaning God with us.</P><P>The issue of the incarnation should be that God is with us. Today we have to say that God is with us not only outwardly but also and even more inwardly. The incarnation should be a process in our Christian life. Every day we should have the experience and realization that God is with us. When we are with people, do we cause people to feel that God is with us? As long as we are walking according to the spirit, others will have the sensation that God is with us. Our life should be the issue of incarnation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The God-man&#151;the Complete God<br>and the Perfect Man</H2><P>The incarnation also issued in Jesus as the God-man, the complete God and the perfect man. Jesus was the God-man, living and walking on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. He is the complete God. This means that He is not merely God the Son but the Triune God&#151;God the Father (Isa. 9:6), God the Son (Matt. 3:17), and God the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). Colossians 2:9 says that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily. He is the complete God, the entire God, the whole God, and the perfect man, the real man. This is the issue, the result, of God's incarnation.</P><P>When we believed in Jesus, we received this God-man. Jesus Christ is the God-man, and we Christians are Christ-men. A Christian is a Christ-man, one who is one with Christ, having His life and nature in an organic union with Him, and who is living by Him, even living Him, in his daily life. A Christ-man is a God-man. As a man at work in an office, the people around you should have the realization that you are a man plus something&#151;a man plus God! Our life should be such an issue of the incarnation. If it is not, the incarnation to us is merely a doctrine, a part of theology. The incarnation of the Triune God should not be just a doctrine as a part of theology to us. Our life must be a life of God's incarnation. God today is incarnated in us.</P>
