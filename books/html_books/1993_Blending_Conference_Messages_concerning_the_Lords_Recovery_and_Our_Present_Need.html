For such a blending, we need You. We need Your Spirit, we need Your mercy, we need Your blessing, and we need Your presence. Lord, be with us to the uttermost. Bless us with Your presence. Visit each one of us and touch us. Touch our spirit that You may gain us, that we may gain You. Lord, thank You for this blending. We want to learn how to be blended in You, with You, and through You. Blend us all together that You may have a way to go on for Your recovery. Cover us with Your prevailing blood. We can never forget Your enemy, the subtle one, the evil one, the devil, Satan. Lord, put him to the corner throughout this conference. We look to You for the victory over all the enemies. Give us the liberty, give us the freedom, and give us the boldness. Anoint us; this is what we need. Thank You, Lord. Amen.</P><P>The four banners for this conference are very simple, yet they are all-inclusive. I hope that in this blending conference we will all be anointed and deeply impressed with these four banners:</P><ol class="decimal"><li>The all-inclusive Christ is the God-allotted portion to the saints&#151;Col. 1:12</li><li>He is the Firstborn both in creation and in resurrection that He might have the preeminence in all things&#151;Col. 1:15-18</li><li>In Him all the fullness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell bodily&#151;Col. 1:19; 2:9</li><li>In the new man, He as our life is all the members and in all the members&#151;Col. 3:4, 10-11</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. WE NEED TO BE VITAL FOR THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>Our being blended is for us to be vitalized, to be made living and active. In these days our need is to be vitalized, that is, to be made vital for the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. WE SHOULD CONDEMN THE CONDITION IN SARDIS</H2><P>We all need to have some inward realization concerning our present situation. The first aspect of our condition may be deadness. If we are not vital, we will surely drift into this kind of condition and this kind of situation. We need to condemn the condition in Sardis: having a name that we are living and yet being dead, and having nothing completed but having all things dying (Rev. 3:1-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. WE SHOULD ABHOR THE SITUATION IN LAODICEA</H2><P>The second aspect of our condition may be lukewarmness. We also need to abhor the situation in Laodicea: being neither cold nor hot but lukewarm, and being about to be spewed out of the Lord's mouth (vv. 14-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. HENCE, WE SHOULD HATE DEADNESS AND LUKEWARMNESS THAT WE MAY BE VITALIZED</H2><P>We all need to be vitalized by the Lord. We should hate the deadness characterized by the church in Sardis and the lukewarmness characterized by the church in Laodicea.</P><P>In order to be vitalized, we need to be blended with one another, not only as individuals but also as the churches. We need to learn the lesson of how to be enriched, how to be vitalized, to be living and active, by being blended together.</P><P>In this blending conference we are burdened to cover seven messages. I will speak in four of these messages; the remainder of the speaking in all seven messages will be done by various brothers selected from among the clusters of churches in Southern California. After each message a number of saints from the churches will share to confirm the striking points in the messages.</P><P>W.L.</P></td></tr></table></div><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The Lord's recovery being the recovery of the divine truths as revealed in the holy Scriptures&#151;the holy Word of God&#151;2 Tim. 3:16.</li><li>The Lord's recovery of the truths being of two categories:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The category of the major items for the eternal economy of God.</li>	<li>The category of the minor items for the practices of the believers and the church.</li>	</ol><li>The crucial points of the major items in the Lord's recovery:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The all-inclusive Christ having the preeminence in all things, filling all in all, being the centrality and the universality of God's economy, allotted to the saints as their redemption, life, life-supply, and everything for them to participate in His riches for their enjoyment and be constituted with His divine element that they may become His members to live Him and express Him.</li>	<li>The consummated Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power, to be the life-giving and indwelling Spirit as the reality, the realization, of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ and the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</li>	<li>The eternal life, the uncreated life, the divine life, incorruptible and indestructible, the very Triune God&#151;the Father in the Son as the Spirit&#151;to be life to His redeemed children with which they are regenerated, renewed, transformed, conformed to His glorious image, and glorified with Himself as the glory.</li>	<li>The church, the called-out assembly, as the house of God composed of all His children and expressed in many localities on the earth as the local churches; and as the universal Body of Christ constituted with Christ as its divine element and composed of all the believers of Christ as its human members in the organic union with Christ in His divine life.</li>	<li>The oneness of the Body of Christ, the oneness of the one Spirit as the unique essence of the Body, with the one Lord as the unique element of the Body and with the one Father as the unique source of the Body.

From that time until the present a little more than thirty years have passed. From the first conference I emphasized the term "the Lord's recovery." I told the dear saints that the Lord sent me to this country for nothing but His recovery.</P><P>Although the ministry has continued to stress the matter of the Lord's recovery throughout these years, according to my observation, even some dear saints who have been with us for many years are still not clear concerning what the Lord's recovery is. Because there are many new ones and young ones in the recovery, I feel very burdened concerning this matter. We need to speak about the Lord's recovery, to fellowship about the recovery, and to make transactions among ourselves concerning the Lord's recovery. We are here for the recovery. The purpose of the seven messages in this book is to make the Lord's recovery clear to all the saints.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE LORD'S RECOVERY BEING THE RECOVERY<br>OF THE DIVINE TRUTHS AS REVEALED IN<br>THE HOLY SCRIPTURES&#151;THE HOLY WORD OF GOD</H2><P>First, the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine truths as revealed in the holy Scriptures, the holy Word of God (2 Tim. 3:16). The divine truths are not according to what anyone thinks or imagines; they are revealed in the holy Scriptures, that is, the holy Word. The Bible is a great blessing that God, the Lord, has given to mankind on this earth. If there had not been such a book as the Bible, the holy Scriptures, on the earth, what a pity and what a devastation there would have been among the human race! The Bible is justifiably called "the Book" because the Bible is "the Book" among all books. The Bible is the book of books because it is in this book that we can see all the divine truths.</P><P>All the holy Scriptures, as the holy Word of God, are God-breathed (2 Tim. 3:16). Although there are many doctrines and teachings in the Bible, we should not think that the Bible is merely a book of doctrines or teachings in letters. The entire Bible is God's breathing, God's breath. It is not merely doctrines in empty or dead letters, but it is God's breathing in life. Because of this, many Bible readers can testify that when they come to the Bible, they receive light and life.</P><P>The content of the Scriptures is very deep. Some sentences of the Bible are very simple. For example, in John 8:12 the Lord Jesus said, "I am the light of the world." This is a simple word, but the significance is deep, profound, and all-inclusive. The truths as revealed in the Scriptures have been lost, missed, misunderstood, misinterpreted, and wrongly taught throughout the ages. Hence, there is the need of the Lord's recovery. In the age of the early apostles, in the age of the church fathers, in the age of the church councils, in the age of Catholicism with the papal system, and in the age of the Protestant practice, the Lord has always recovered some of the lost, missed, misunderstood, misinterpreted, and wrongly taught truths through some of His saints who loved Him and His holy Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE LORD'S RECOVERY OF THE TRUTHS<br>BEING OF TWO CATEGORIES</H2><P>The Lord's recovery of the divine truths is of two categories.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Category of the Major Items<br>for the Eternal Economy of God</H2><P>The first category is the category of the major items for God's eternal economy, that is, God's eternal plan, God's eternal purpose, God's divine will. The first of the major items in the Lord's recovery is the accurate understanding and the proper definition of the Divine Trinity. Throughout the centuries much has been spoken and written concerning the Divine Trinity, but most of this speaking and writing is not accurate and does not present a proper definition of the Triune God. However, in the Lord's recovery this has been recovered. This is a major recovery. Additional major items that have been recovered are the all-inclusive Christ, the consummated Spirit, the eternal life, the church as the Body of Christ, the oneness of the Body of Christ, and the ground of the church. All these major items are for the eternal economy of God.</P><P>If you were to tell many Christians the accurate understanding and the proper definition of the Divine Trinity, the all-inclusive Christ, the consummated Spirit, the eternal life, the church as the Body of Christ, the oneness of the Body of Christ, and the ground of the church, they would be greatly surprised because they are not familiar with these items. However, in the Lord's recovery, these items have been our "regular meals." We do know the accurate understanding and the proper definition of the Divine Trinity, and we also know the all-inclusive Christ, the consummated Spirit, the eternal life, the church as the Body of Christ, the oneness of the Body, and the ground of the church. These are major items of the Lord's recovery. In addition to these seven items, there are a number of other important items related to God's eternal economy that are not mentioned here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Category of the Minor Items<br>for the Practices of the Believers and the Church</H2><P>The second category of the divine truths recovered by the Lord is the category of the minor items for the practices of the believers and the church. The minor items in the Lord's recovery include the proper teaching concerning the Old Testament dispensational diet (Lev. 11), which was adjusted by the apostle Paul in his Epistles (1 Cor. 6:12-13a; 10:25-27); the proper teaching concerning the dispensational keeping of the Sabbath (Exo. 20:8-11) in the Old Testament age, which is over in the New Testament age; head covering (1 Cor. 11:2-15); foot-washing (John 13:3-10); and other items for the personal practices of the believers. The minor items of the Lord's recovery also include baptism by immersion, the presbytery for the administration of the church, the proper way to have the Lord's table, the proper way for the gifted persons to function in the church, the relationship between the elders and the gifted persons, and other items for the official practices of the church. These items for the practices of the believers and the church are minor items and should not be considered major items of the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE MAJOR ITEMS<br>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>Among the major items in the Lord's recovery, some points are more crucial than others. In this message we have selected only six crucial points, as follows, as an illustration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The All-inclusive Christ</H2><P>The Christ revealed in both the Old Testament and the New Testament is all-inclusive and all-extensive. Ephesians 1:23 says that Christ is the One who fills all in all, and 3:18 says that His dimensions are immeasurable, the dimensions of the universe. Christ is not only all-inclusive; He is also all-extensive. He is the God-man through the divine incarnation to be the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9) and the centrality and the universality of the eternal economy of God. Throughout all the ages of the past nineteen centuries, He has been missed, misunderstood, wrongly taught, and subtly twisted and interpreted by the heresiarchs (the founders of heresies), who include Cerinthus (see note 221 in 1 John 2 and note 91 in 2 John), the Gnostics (see note 142, paragraph 2, in John 1), and the Docetists (see note 31 in 1 John 4) in the first century, the Nestorians in the fifth century, the demonic Catholicism in the past thirteen centuries, the so-called higher critics in the past two and a half centuries, and the present modernists. All these denied different aspects of Christ's person and work. The Cerinthians denied Christ's divinity, and the Docetists denied Christ's humanity. Others denied Christ's redemptive death and His resurrection. According to their heresies, Christ is nothing. Although Protestantism teaches Christ fundamentally, their teaching concerning Christ is inadequate, full of defects, not perfect, and not complete. Under all the devastating heresies and the incomplete fundamentalism, the truth concerning the all-inclusive Christ of God needs a drastic recovery in many aspects as listed in the outline of this chapter. All these items are exceedingly crucial for all the believers in Christ to partake of for their enjoyment and to be constituted with so that they may become His organic members to live and express Him in this age and for eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Consummated Spirit</H2><P>The term the consummated Spirit implies that the Spirit has been processed and thus has become the consummated Spirit. According to the revelation in the Old Testament and in the New Testament, the Spirit of God eventually became the consummated, all-inclusive, and compound Spirit. In this matter the negligence, ignorance, deficiency, misunderstanding, and misinterpretation on the part of Christian teachers has reached the climax.</P><P>Concerning the consummated Spirit, there are three major and crucial points. First, the Spirit of God has been compounded to become the compound ointment, as revealed in Exodus 30:23-25. Second, the Spirit was not yet before Jesus' glorification in resurrection, as strongly referred to in John 7:39. Third, the Spirit is considered to be the seven Spirits of God to function as the seven lamps before the throne of God and the seven eyes of the Lamb, as particularly revealed in Revelation 1:4; 4:5; and 5:6. These three crucial points have been neglected by nearly all the students and teachers of the Bible.</P><P>In addition to this, the Spirit of God was considered, by those who translated the New Testament into English, to be the power of God, an instrument for God's work, not a person who is ranked with the other two persons of the Divine Trinity. This is in contrast to what was emphatically mentioned by the Lord in Matthew 28:19. In that verse the Lord said, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." According to this verse, the three of the Divine Trinity are distinct persons. Therefore, the Holy Spirit of God is not only the power, the instrument, of God but also a person. Even up to the time of the publication of the King James Version in the seventeenth century, the pronoun "itself" was used in reference to the Spirit. For example, Romans 8:16 was rendered "the Spirit itself" by the King James translators. This is a wrong rendering. Since the Spirit is a person, the proper rendering in this verse should be "the Spirit Himself." All the negligence, ignorance, misunderstanding, and misinterpretation concerning the Spirit have been corrected and the truth concerning the Spirit has been completed in the Lord's recovery. Beginning in the nineteenth century the wrong use of itself in reference to the Spirit was corrected and adjusted, Himself being used in the American Standard Version, the New American Standard Bible, the Amplified Bible, and other modern versions. In the previous few decades the Lord has shown us the following points concerning His consummated, all-inclusive, and compound Spirit.</P><P>Exodus 30:23-25 reveals that the Spirit of God has been compounded with Christ's divinity (signified by the hin of oil), Christ's humanity (signified by the four kinds of spices), Christ's death with its effectiveness (signified by myrrh and cinnamon), Christ's resurrection with its power (signified by calamus and cassia), and the Divine Trinity (signified by the three units of five hundred shekels, with the middle unit being split into two halves of two hundred fifty shekels, specifying the quantities of the four kinds of spices). Thus, the Spirit of God has become the compound Spirit as an ointment of several elements, not only of oil.</P><P>John 7:39 and 1 Corinthians 15:45b reveal that the Spirit of God had not been processed to become the life-giving Spirit before Christ's glorification in His resurrection. It was in His resurrection that Christ as the last Adam in the flesh became the life-giving Spirit through the process of His crucifixion and resurrection. Later, this life-giving Spirit is called the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7), the Spirit of Christ&#151;the pneumatic Christ (Rom. 8:9)&#151;the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19), and the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). In Revelation 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 the Spirit of God eventually became the seven Spirits, that is, the sevenfold intensified Spirit, to deal with the degradation of the church in its dark age. After being compounded, transfigured, and intensified, the Spirit of God became "the Spirit" as the processed and consummated Spirit of God and even as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God (Rev. 22:17a).</P><P>We all need to pay our utmost attention to pick up this point, for the consummated Spirit is one of the crucial points of the major items in the Lord's recovery. Christ today is all-inclusive, and the Spirit of God today is the consummated Spirit. All the above points that the Lord has shown us in the last few decades are great and crucial items in the Lord's recovery today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Eternal Life</H2><P>In general, among Christians the eternal life, which is called "everlasting life," has been understood not as a kind of life but as a kind of blissful environment for the believers of Christ to enjoy for eternity in heaven after they die. Even today the teaching in Christianity concerning the matter of "going to heaven" is very strong. Christian teachers do not teach people the proper understanding of the eternal life, but they interpret the eternal life to be a kind of blissful environment in which the believers will enjoy certain good things for eternity in heaven after they die. They say that this is everlasting life. What a blunder this is! But thank the Lord that in the last seventy years He has recovered among us the scriptural view and the proper realization of the eternal life of God, which we have received of God through our believing in the Son of God, Jesus Christ. It is a life on the highest plane, being the divine life of God and even the complete Triune God Himself, uncreated, incorruptible, indestructible, and also eternal. To be eternal means to be perfect and complete in quality, quantity, time, space, and existence. The eternal life that we received through our believing in Christ is perfect and complete in its quality, in its quantity, in time, in space, and in its existence. It is eternally perfect and complete. It exists eternally in time and in space. It is not transient but everlasting in all aspects. It is with this eternal and everlasting, perfect and complete, incorruptible and indestructible, wonderful and marvelous life that we have been regenerated, that we are being transformed, and that we will be glorified with the consummated Triune God Himself as our eternal glory. This is eternal life!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Church</H2><P>According to the revelation and pattern of the New Testament, the church is the gathering of the believers in Christ who have been called out from the world by God. Such a gathering is considered, on the one hand, the house of the living God (1 Tim. 3:15) for Him to dwell in and to carry out His will according to His desire and for His pleasure, and, on the other hand, the organic Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23) for Him to have a counterpart in the organic union with Him for His expression. This church is the new man as God's new creation (Col. 3:10; Gal. 6:15). Such a church, as both the house of God and the Body of Christ, is universally one to appear and be expressed on the earth in many localities as many local churches. The fellowship in life of this church is uniquely one, both universally and locally.</P><P>Such a church remained in such a genuine condition only for a short time. Near the end of the first century, at the time of the early apostles, divisions, sects, crept in to damage the genuine church and created the degradation of the church (1 Cor. 1:10-13; Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10). Such divisions grew worse and worse in the succeeding centuries, including the time of the church fathers, and the church attempted to solve the problem of divisions by holding councils with the leading teachers in the leading cities, such as Nicaea, Ephesus, etc. This did not work out as well as expected. Such a confused situation remained until the end of the sixth century, when the papal system was established to deform the church by forming the universal Catholic Church under the pope to keep a false unity throughout the world.</P><P>In the Reformation that took place in the sixteenth century, through Martin Luther's teaching, many gave up the Catholic Church under the pope, but they did not receive the proper revelation and the enlightening help to recover the genuine practice of the church according to the New Testament revelation and pattern. They were sidetracked first to form the state churches, such as the state church of Germany  and the Church of England, and then to invent the private churches, the private denominations, such as the Baptist church and the Presbyterian church. In the meantime, in the eighteenth century Zinzendorf recovered the practice of the church to some extent, but not in full. Then, in the nineteenth century the British brothers recovered the practice of the church very much, even to the extent of having the local assemblies as the church in Philadelphia (Rev. 3:7-13). However, regrettably, that glorious situation did not remain very long. The British brothers were divided, even in their first generation, into the so-called closed brethren and open brethren, with an addition, the Newton brethren. Up to the beginning of the twentieth century, after they had existed for only a little over half a century, they were divided into hundreds of divisive assemblies, even having several assemblies in the same city. Under that kind of situation the Lord was forced to raise up a recovery as a new beginning in the pagan and conservative China as the virgin soil for the church practice from the third decade of this century. In this fresh action the Lord has recovered among us in the last seven decades the proper understanding and definition of the eternal life, the genuine understanding of the church of God, the boundary of the local church, the genuine ground of the church, Christ as the overcoming life, Christ as the all-inclusive One who has the preeminence in all things both in God's old creation and in His new creation and who is the centrality and universality of God's eternal economy, the church as the Body of Christ, the all-inclusive, compounded, and life-giving Spirit, God's eternal economy concerning Christ and the church, the Triune God's dispensing Himself into the tripartite man, the ultimate issue of God's chosen people as the New Jerusalem, the full view and the full definition of the New Jerusalem as God's ultimate manifestation and expression in His mingling with all His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified elect for eternity, etc. In such a recovery we practice the genuine church, caring for the all-inclusive Christ, the consummated Spirit, the eternal life, and all the divine truths of reality, not of vain letters, and endeavoring to escape from organization, dogmatic regulations, rituals, the clerical system, and traditions, that we may practice the universal priesthood, the universal function of all the members of Christ in the church life for the building up of the Body of Christ in God's eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Oneness of the Body of Christ</H2><P>The oneness of the Body of Christ is the oneness of the Spirit (Eph. 4:3) and the oneness of the divine constitution by the Divine Trinity (John 17:21-23). This is the constitutional aspect of the unique oneness for the church ground. This divine oneness separates all the believers in Christ from the unbelievers and unites all the believers together to be the one Body of Christ.</P><P>There is also the practical aspect of the oneness of the church for the church ground. All the believers in Christ are the components of the Body of Christ. Practically, they are scattered in many cities on this earth. Spontaneously, they are separated into many units in each city, respectively, according to their dwelling. According to the New Testament pattern set up and ordained by God and according to the principle of the New Testament revelation concerning God's economy of the church, in each city in which the believers dwell, it is not allowed to have more than one unit as a local expression of the unique Body of Christ, nor is it permitted to have a local church in a certain city without the proper fellowship in the Body of Christ with the other local churches. All these limitations of the church ground in its oneness are the safeguard in the church life to avoid any kind of division in the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Local Ground of the Church</H2><P>The local ground of the church is basically the unique oneness of the Body of Christ practiced in the local churches. Both the universal Body of Christ and the local churches are uniquely one. There is one unique Body of Christ in the whole universe, and there is one unique local church in each locality, respectively. This unique oneness is the basic element of the church life. Since the oneness of the Body of Christ is the oneness of the Spirit (Eph. 4:3), the oneness practiced in a local church must be in the move of the Spirit and under the government of the Spirit. Hence, this Spirit is also a basic element of the church ground. In addition to this, since a local church is very much involved with its locality, the locality of the local church is also a crucial element of the church ground. So, the church ground on which a local church is built must be constituted with and prevail in the oneness executed by the Spirit and the oneness safeguarded by the locality.</P><P>In addition to the oneness of the Spirit and the oneness practiced in the locality of a local church as mentioned above, there is another aspect of the oneness, which is "the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God," as revealed in Ephesians 4:13. Concerning this, note 132 in Ephesians 4, Recovery Version, says, "In v. 3 the oneness of the Spirit is the oneness of the divine life in reality; in this verse the oneness is the oneness of our living in practicality. We already have the oneness of the divine life in reality. We need only to keep it. But we need to go on until we arrive at the oneness of our living in practicality. This aspect of oneness is of two things: the faith and the full knowledge of the Son of God. As revealed in Jude 3, 2 Tim. 4:7, and 1 Tim. 6:21, the faith does not refer to the act of our believing but to the things in which we believe, such as the divine person of Christ and His redemptive work accomplished for our salvation. The full knowledge of the Son of God is the apprehension of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience. The more we grow in life, the more we will cleave to the faith and to the apprehension of Christ, and the more we will drop all the minor and meaner doctrinal concepts that cause divisions. Then we will arrive at, or attain to, the practical oneness; that is, we will arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." To keep this aspect of the oneness we need to endeavor to "drop all the minor and meaner doctrinal concepts [the winds of teaching] that cause divisions. Then we will arrive at, or attain to, the practical oneness; that is, we will arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."</P><P>W.L.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SPEAKING BY VARIOUS BROTHERS<br>CONCERNING THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF<br>THE MAJOR ITEMS IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The All-inclusive Christ</H2><P>Now we come to the crucial points of the major items in the Lord's recovery. The first crucial point is the all-inclusive Christ. Our Christ is all-inclusive. In John 14:6 He said, "I am..the reality." He is the reality of every positive thing in the universe. He is the real life, the real air, the real heavens, and the real earth. He is even the real chair that you are sitting on, and the real glasses which you are wearing. He is whatever we need. He is the all-inclusive One as the all-inclusive reality.</P><P>All the banners for this conference speak about the all-inclusive Christ, who has the preeminence, the first place, in all things (Col. 1:18b). We desire to give our wonderful, all-inclusive Christ the preeminence. We want to give Him the first place in big things and in small things.</P><P>First, He has the preeminence in the Triune Godhead. In the Godhead the preeminence goes to the Son. The Father always exalts the Son (Phil. 2:9), and the Spirit always testifies concerning the Son (John 15:26), so even in the Triune Godhead, Christ has the preeminence. Furthermore, all the fullness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell in Him bodily (Col. 2:9; 1:19). Outside of Christ there is no God, because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit dwell in Him in a bodily way. Before He was incarnated, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word. But once He became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, began to dwell in Him in a bodily way, and this fullness dwells in His glorified body (Phil. 3:21) now and forever.</P><P>Christ also has the preeminence in God's creation because He is the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15b). He is the preeminent One in the entire created universe. Colossians shows us that all things were created in Him, in the power of His person, through Him as the active instrument through which the creation was processed, and unto Him for His possession (1:16). Christ as God is the Creator, but also in God's eyes, when Christ was born as a man, He was the first item of all the creatures. He has the first place in the created universe.</P><P>In God's eyes to be the first is to be everything. There is no second in God's eyes. This is like the first Adam (1 Cor. 15:45). All created men are included in the first Adam, so to be the first is to be everything. This means in the created universe, Christ is the reality of every positive thing. He is the real sunshine, the real tree, the real grass, the real light, air, water, and food. He is everything we need to supply us and sustain us to carry out God's New Testament economy.</P><P>Christ is the Firstborn not only in the old creation but also in resurrection in God's new creation (Col. 1:18). That means He has the preeminence in the new creation. Because He is the first in the new creation, He is everything in the new creation. That means He is every man in the new man. In the new man, He as our life is all the members and is in all the members (Col. 3:4, 10-11). We all are the regenerated members of the new man, where Christ is all and in all.</P><P>Christ also has the preeminence in God's exaltation. God exalted Him to His right hand (Acts 2:33; 5:31). He has the highest place in the universe because He is seated at the right hand of God. He is Head over all things (Eph. 1:22b), and He has the name above every name (Phil. 2:9). Even the calendar that people use today is the calendar of Christ. History tells us that if you are under the calendar of a certain king, you are under the rule and reign of that king. The year is 1993. The earth has not been in existence for only nineteen hundred ninety-three years, but it has been in the status of the all-inclusive Christ for only nineteen hundred ninety-three years. That means that everyone on this earth unconsciously admits that Jesus Christ is the King of kings, the Lord of lords, and the preeminent Ruler of the entire earth.</P><P>He also has the preeminence in the church, which is His Body, because He is the Head of the Body, the church (Col. 1:18a). Christ has the preeminence in the created universe and in the new creation, the church. If we are going to be vital, living and active, overcomers to carry out the Lord's recovery, we have to give Him the preeminence. We have to give Him the place He deserves. The degradation of the church always comes in when we do not give Christ the first place. We have to give Him the first place in our family life, in our church life, in our business life, in our social life, and in all the meetings of the church. He must have the first place in everything.</P><P>To give Him the first place is to love Him with the first love, the best love (Rev. 2:4). To have the first love for the Lord is to give Him the preeminence in all things, in great things and in small things. When we buy a tie, when we get our hair cut, when we do everything, we have to give Him the preeminence, the first place. Those who give Christ the preeminence are the overcomers to carry out the Lord's recovery to rescue the church from its degradation.</P><P>The all-inclusive Christ is also the One who fills all in all. He fills the entire universe. He is not only all-inclusive but also all-extensive. He fills all things in all things. Ephesians 4:10 shows us how He fills all in all. He had a universal traffic. He descended and He ascended that He might fill all things. This descending and ascending describes the entire process through which He passed. He descended from the heavens to the earth in incarnation. He descended further in His death to the lower parts of the earth in Hades. Then He resurrected to ascend from Hades to the earth. Then He ascended further from the earth to the third heaven. By His universal traffic from His incarnation through His ascension, in His descension and His ascension, He filled the entire universe. The Christ we have living in us is the One who fills the entire universe.</P><P>In Ephesians 3:18 Paul said that we might know what the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth are. How broad is the breadth, how long is the length, how high is the height, and how deep is the depth? These are the universal dimensions of Christ. His dimensions are the dimensions of the universe. This means that Christ is our universe. He is the all-inclusive One and the all-extensive One in God's New Testament economy. All these points just make you want to say, "Lord Jesus, I love You. I want to give You the preeminence."</P><P>Not only does Christ fill all in all, but also He is the centrality and universality of God's economy. God's New Testament economy is like a great wheel with a hub, with spokes, and with a rim. Ezekiel 1:15 speaks of this great wheel. Christ is the hub of this wheel, the spokes of this wheel, and the rim of this wheel. Thus, we can enjoy Him as our wheel to move in Him, with Him, by Him, and through Him in oneness with Him to carry out His move for His eternal economy.</P><P>Colossians 1:17 says that all things subsist together in Christ. All things cohere in Him. That means He is the holding center, the hub, of the entire universe. Scientists know there is some power that holds the universe together, but they do not know what it is. But we know more than all the scientists. Our Christ is the holding center that holds the entire universe together. Furthermore, He is the holding center that holds us together. Take Christ away from us and we fall apart. Take Christ away from the churches, and the churches fall apart. He is the hub, the spokes, and the rim&#151;the centrality and universality&#151;of God's economy.</P><P>The all-inclusive Christ is also the God-allotted portion to the saints (Col. 1:12). He has been allotted to us as our God-given portion. This allotted portion refers to the type in the Old Testament with the allotment of the good land to the children of Israel. Each of the tribes was given an allotted portion of the good land. This was their inheritance. Our good land is the all-inclusive Christ. He is our allotted portion, our designated inheritance.</P><P>The good land meant everything to the children of Israel. It was a land of milk, honey, water, cattle, grain, and minerals. Everything they needed for their existence came out of this land, and the temple was the result of the enjoyment of this land. This shows that when we enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as our God-allotted portion to be everything to us, the built-up church is the result. He is the all-inclusive land to us for the building up of the church.</P><P>He has been allotted to us as our redemption (Rom. 3:24; Eph. 1:7). He is our Redeemer. There were many requirements laid on us because we became lost, so Christ repossessed us at a great cost. He became our Redeemer to take away our sin and our sins (John 1:29) and to bring us back to God so that we can accomplish His New Testament economy.</P><P>Finally, He is our life, our life-supply, and everything for us to participate in His riches for our enjoyment. Not only so, as we are enjoying Him as all these riches, we are constituted with His divine element. By eating Him and by participating in His riches, we become Him. What you eat is what you become (John 6:57). As you eat Christ, you become Christ. We are constituted with His divine element to become His members to live Him and express Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Consummated Spirit</H2><P>Now we come to the second crucial point of the major items in the Lord's recovery, which is the consummated Spirit. This all-inclusive Christ today is the consummated Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). He is not just a doctrine to us but He is consummated as the Spirit who can be applied to us. A watermelon may be used as an illustration. The big watermelon cannot get into us unless it is processed. When it is cut into slices and consummated as melon juice, we can take it in. Today our all-inclusive Christ with all His riches has been consummated as the Spirit to get into us for our enjoyment.</P><P>This consummated Spirit was originally the Spirit of God. In Genesis 1:2 He is the Spirit of God in God's creation. But there is a progression, and this progression runs through the sixty-six books of the Bible. It goes on from the Spirit of God to the Spirit of Jehovah (Judg. 6:34). He is the Spirit of Jehovah in His relationship with man. In the New Testament, we see the Holy Spirit in the incarnation of Jesus (Matt. 1:20). Then this man Jesus passed through thirty-three and a half years of human living with all of the human sufferings. He passed through death and resurrection. In resurrection, which was His glorification (Luke 24:26), He became the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7), the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9), and the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19). Today He is not just the Spirit of God with merely the element of divinity, but He is the all-inclusive and bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ, the consummated Spirit, with all of the elements of Christ's person and work, including His divinity, humanity, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. What a rich consummated Spirit we have!</P><P>In Exodus 30 there is the anointing ointment, which is a type of the compound Spirit. This type shows that there are many elements, ingredients, and riches in the consummated Spirit. In the Lord's recovery we have this unique term&#151;the compound Spirit. This is because the Spirit has been compounded with all kinds of ingredients. Exodus 30 says that there is one hin of oil that is compounded with four kinds of spices. There is myrrh which signifies His death, cinnamon which signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of His death, and calamus which is a reed that rises up, shoots up, from a muddy place. This calamus signifies Christ's resurrection. Finally, there is cassia which in ancient times was used as a snake and insect repellent. This signifies the repelling power of Christ's resurrection to repel the demons and all negative things. All these riches have been compounded into the consummated Spirit. According to 1 John, this Spirit is now the anointing Spirit, who applies all that Christ is and has done into our being (2:20, 27).</P><P>Thus, we can see that the Spirit has been compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power to be the life-giving Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45b says that Christ has become the life-giving Spirit. This One is now the life-giving Spirit and dwells in us as the indwelling Spirit. This anointing Spirit abides in us and never leaves us.</P><P>Christ promised before His death and resurrection that He would give us the Spirit of reality, who would be in us (John 14:17). This Spirit today is both the life-giving Spirit and the indwelling Spirit, and the indwelling Spirit is the Spirit of reality, who makes everything of God in Christ real to us. Everything of the all-inclusive Christ is made real to us in the Spirit of reality.</P><P>The Spirit of reality is the realization of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ as the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. Just as the electric current is the realization of the power in the electric plant, the Spirit today is the realization of all that Christ and the Triune God are. What a rich Christ we have who is realized as the consummated Spirit!</P><P>In the book of Revelation, we see the seven Spirits (1:4; 4:5; 5:6) and "the Spirit" (22:17). In the last book of the New Testament, Revelation, there is the ultimate consummation of every divine truth in the Bible. It shows us the ultimate consummation of the church. It shows us the ultimate consummation of the world. In the same way, it shows us the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, who is the ultimate, consummated Spirit. Revelation shows us first the sevenfold intensified Spirit for the overcomers in the degradation of the church. Eventually, Revelation concludes with "the Spirit." The Spirit today is the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</P><P>Thus, in the beginning of the Bible, we have the Spirit of God, and at the end of the Bible we have "the Spirit." "The Spirit and the bride say, Come!" (Rev. 22:17a). This Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. We love this truth of the Spirit in the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Eternal Life</H2><P>We need to see what life is and what life does. The divine life, the eternal life, can be considered as the first and the basic attribute of God. This life is the eternal life. This is not just everlasting life added to your life to make it last forever. Eternal denotes not only duration of time, which is everlasting, without end, but also quality, which is absolutely perfect and complete, without any shortage or defect. The quality of this life is complete. It is perfect in everything. This life is also the uncreated life. God presented this uncreated life to man when He created him. Many lives were created by God, but He Himself is the uncreated life. He is life eternal, without beginning and without ending.</P><P>This life is also the divine life, the very life of God. Ephesians 4:18 is the unique verse that speaks of the life of God. It speaks of being estranged, alienated, from the life of God. We do not ever want to be alienated from the life of God. We like to be those who are daily participating in, enjoying, and living the very life of God. This life is in us, and it is a divine life, so it is making us divine.</P><P>This life is incorruptible. The Lord Himself as the King of the ages is incorruptible (1 Tim. 1:17). Nothing can damage Him. This life is also indestructible. God's enemy made every effort to destroy this life, but this life could never be destroyed.</P><P>This life is a person, the very Triune God&#151;the Father in the Son as the Spirit. The Father is life, because the Bible says the Father has life in Himself (John 5:26). The Son is life, because He said, "I am..the life" (John 14:6). The Spirit is life, because according to Romans 8:2 He is the Spirit of life. The term the Spirit of life means that the Spirit is life.</P><P>Now that we have seen what this life is, we need to see what this life does. The very Triune God is to be life to His redeemed children with which they are regenerated, renewed, transformed, conformed to His glorious image, and glorified with Himself as the glory. The first real experience of life is His regenerating us (John 1:12-13; 3:5-6). When He put this life within us, that was our initial experience of the life of God. This life also renews us (Titus 3:5). Life is always new (Rom. 6:4b); it never grows old. This life is also transforming us (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2). It is not improving us in an outward way but is metabolically transforming us from within by operating in us all the time. Eventually, this life will conform us to His glorious image (Rom. 8:29; Phil. 3:21). Finally, we will be glorified with Himself as the glory (Rom. 8:30c; Heb. 2:10a). All of this is accomplished by this marvelous life. The truth concerning the eternal life is a great and crucial point of the major items in the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church</H2><P>All of these crucial points are part of the completed divine revelation in the holy Scriptures, but through the centuries, they became lost, twisted, and misused. Praise the Lord that we are in the Lord's recovery where all these items are being recovered in truth and in practice.</P><P>Now we come to the church as the fourth crucial point of the major items in the Lord's recovery. The Greek word for church, ekklesia, means the called-out assembly. This is the basic meaning of the church. The church is composed of those who have been called out of the world by God to Himself for the fulfillment of His purpose. God needs the church to fulfill His purpose.</P><P>The church is shown in two aspects. It is the house of God and the Body of Christ. God needs a house, and Christ needs a Body. God needs a house, and this house is not a physical, material thing. He needs an organic house made of living stones (1 Pet. 2:5). The church as the house of God is His household (Eph. 2:19) because this house is composed of all His children, who are His family. We have a physical house and our family lives in that house. But God's house is His family, His household. This household is the very dwelling place of God (v. 22). God needs a dwelling place, the house of God, the church of the living God, in which He can dwell, and this is a dwelling place of God in spirit. Ephesians 2:19 says that we are members of the household of God.</P><P>We are the house of the living God (1 Tim. 3:15). This house of God is expressed in many localities on earth as the local churches (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:11). On the one hand, it is one house; on the other hand, it is expressed in many localities so that God can carry out His purpose all over the earth.</P><P>The church is also the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). God needs a house, and Christ needs a Body. This Body is constituted with Christ as its very divine element. Christ came in incarnation as the divine Sower (Matt. 13:3, 37) to sow the divine seed into the human heart (v. 19b) so that the divine element could grow up and be mingled with the human element. He as the life seed has a certain kind of element, and we as the growing earth also have a certain kind of element, and the two mingle together and grow together to be one plant. This is the Body of Christ constituted with the divine life mingled with humanity.</P><P>The Lord Himself was the grain of wheat who fell into the ground to die so that He could be multiplied, so that He could have an increase and a multiplication for His expression (John 12:24; 1 Cor. 10:17). The house is for God's dwelling, and the Body is for Christ's expression so that Christ can be expressed on the earth.</P><P>This Body is composed of all the believers of Christ as its human members (Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:27). The divine element is Christ, but it has to be mingled with the human members, and this is what forms the Body of Christ. "So we who are many are one body in Christ" (Rom. 12:5). In 1 Corinthians 12:27 Paul says, "Now you are the body of Christ." The you here is not just the church of God which is in Corinth but the church of God which is in Corinth with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place (1:2). This shows that there is only one Body in the whole universe.</P><P>The many members in this one Body are in the organic union with Christ in His divine life. "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit" (1 Cor. 6:17). We are joined to Him, so we now need to participate in all the riches of this all-inclusive Christ for us to be constituted with Christ as the divine element so that Christ can have a counterpart for His expression on the earth today. Praise the Lord for the church as the house of God for the carrying out of His purpose and the church as the universal Body of Christ for His expression!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness of the Body of Christ</H2><P>I am so happy that I am in the Lord's recovery and that the Lord has the way to recover all the deep and precious things in the divine revelation. All of these crucial points are our heritage. They are our treasure. They are our capital to go on with the Lord.</P><P>The fifth point of the crucial points of the major items in the Lord's recovery is the oneness of the Body of Christ. The oneness of the Body of Christ is the oneness in the Divine Trinity Himself. In the Lord's recovery, we have seen that the Divine Trinity is dispensing Himself into the tripartite man. We are the tripartite men, His believers, and He is dispensing Himself into us. When He dispenses Himself into us, He mingles Himself with us so that we become mingled people, people who are mingled with the Triune God. When He gets mingled with His people, what He is gets mingled with them.</P><P>The Triune God is three, but these Three are in a unique and special oneness. The Father and the Son are one (John 17:11, 21), and this oneness includes the Spirit. Because He has mingled Himself with the believers, we believers enjoy the same oneness. We enjoy the oneness of the Divine Trinity. Thus, the oneness of the Body of Christ is the enlarged oneness of the Divine Trinity. I want to be in this kind of recovery, a high recovery, a deep recovery, that includes the Triune God Himself.</P><P>In this oneness the Spirit is the unique essence. The essence is the thing that identifies what something is. If you take an orange and cut it open, and touch it to someone's tongue, they can tell you it is an orange by the taste, even though they may not be able to see it or feel it. This is because there is the essence of the orange. The orange itself is the element, and the juice is the essence of the orange. Once the juice of the orange touches your tongue, you touch the essence, and the essence makes clear what it is. Similarly, the one Spirit is the unique essence of the Body of Christ. Ephesians 4:4 says, "One Body and one Spirit." That means there is one Spirit in the Body of Christ, and that one Spirit is the very essence of the Body of Christ.</P><P>In this one Body there is also an element. The essence is what identifies something, what constitutes it, permeates it, and makes it what it is. But the element is the thing itself. There is the essence of the orange, and then there is the orange itself. The Body is the Body of Christ. This means that Christ is the element! Ephesians 4:5 says, "One Lord, one faith, one baptism." We believe into Christ, and we are baptized into Christ as the unique element of the Body. He is preeminent in everything because He is the element.</P><P>This essence and this element come out of a very wonderful source, who is the Father Himself. So our oneness in the Body of Christ is a oneness that is based on the Spirit as the essence, the Lord as the element, and the Father as the very source. These three things actually are the very Triune God Himself and are the basis of our oneness in the Body of Christ. The Spirit is the essence of our oneness, the Lord is the element of our oneness, and the Father is the source of our oneness.</P><P>You cannot divide the Triune God, so do not try to divide the Body of Christ. When you divide the Body of Christ, you are implicitly trying to divide the Triune God Himself, and He will never allow it. The oneness of the Body of Christ is the oneness of the Divine Trinity&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, undivided and indivisible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Ground of the Church</H2><P>The sixth crucial point of the major items in the Lord's recovery is the ground of the church. The ground of the church is the oneness of the universal Body of Christ expressed on the ground of each locality of the local churches in which they are located respectively.</P><P>The ground is different from the foundation. The ground denotes the site on which the foundation is laid and on which the building is built. According to the divine revelation of the New Testament, the church ground is constituted of three crucial elements&#151;the unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ, the unique ground of locality of a local church, and the reality of the Spirit of oneness.</P><P>The first element of the constitution of the church ground is the unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ, which is called the oneness of the Spirit. Ephesians 4:3 says, "Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit." We need to be diligent to keep this oneness. This oneness is what the Lord prayed for in John 17. It is a oneness of the mingling of the processed Triune God with all the believers in Christ. The oneness of the Triune God is in the name of the Father (John 17:6, 11), denoting the Father's person in which is the Father's life. In John 17:2 the Lord said He gave the eternal life to all the believers. The Father is the source not only of life but also of this oneness. The oneness of the believers originates from the Father Himself. Man is not the source of this oneness. The Father is the source.</P><P>This oneness in the Triune God is also through the sanctification of the holy word (John 17:14-21). In John 17:17 the Lord prayed, "Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth." The Father's word brings the reality of the Father to us to separate us, to sanctify us, from the world to God that we might be one in the Triune God. This oneness is ultimately in the divine glory for the expression of the Triune God (vv. 22-23). Such a oneness of the Triune God in the Father's name with the life of the Father through the sanctifying word and in the divine glory has been imparted into the spirit of all the believers in Christ in their regeneration by the Spirit of life. This oneness is called the oneness of the Spirit. It is our inheritance and possession. We do not need to strive for it. All we need to do is to keep this oneness. This oneness has become the basic element of the ground of the church.</P><P>The second element of the ground is the unique ground of locality in which a local church is established and exists. The New Testament presents a clear picture that all the local churches as the expression of the universal church, the Body of Christ, are located in respective cities. Hence, we see the church in Jerusalem in Acts 8:1, the church in Antioch in Acts 13:1, and the church in Corinth in 1 Corinthians 1:2. Revelation 1:11 shows us the seven churches in Asia in seven respective cities. The city is the ground on which the church is built.</P><P>Actually, the many churches are simply the one universal church appearing in many cities. We may use the illustration of the moon. There is one moon but it appears in different localities. When we are in San Diego, it is the moon in San Diego, and when we are in Taipei, it is the moon in Taipei. It is the same moon appearing in many localities. It is the same with the church. There is one church appearing in many localities.</P><P>The unique ground of locality preserves the church from being divided. Christians today are divided because of different grounds other than this unique ground of locality, the genuine ground of oneness. In one city there should be only one church. The ground of locality protects and insures that a church in a particular locality will always be preserved in oneness. This is the second element of the ground of the church.</P><P>The third element of the church ground is the reality of the Spirit of oneness, expressing the unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ on the unique ground of locality of a local church. The Spirit is the living reality of the Divine Trinity (1 John 5:6; John 16:13). It is by this Spirit that the oneness of the Body of Christ becomes real and living. It is also through this Spirit that the ground of the locality is applied in life and not in legality. And it is by this Spirit that the genuine ground of the church is linked with the Triune God (Eph. 4:3-6). These three elements&#151;the oneness of the Spirit, the ground of locality, and the reality of the Spirit&#151;keep the genuine oneness of the church.</P><P>6 brothers</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LOCAL CHURCHES</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>A local church is the God-called-out people gathered together in a locality&#151;a city, a town, or a village.</li><li>All the local churches are the one Body of Christ separated by the localities of their existence, but still expressing the same one Body, not respectively but corporately.</li><li>The local churches are autonomous in business affairs but not in the testimony for Christ and in the fellowship of the Spirit. The testimony for Christ and the fellowship of the Spirit should be not only local but also universal. In such matters all the local churches are identical in nature and in function, as illustrated by the seven golden lampstands.</li><li>Hence, the neighboring local churches should be clustered as much as possible in the blending way for the spiritual benefits in the mutual building up of the Body of Christ, as the Lord Jesus clustered the seven neighboring churches in Asia.</li><li>Such clustering stirs up the neighboring churches in mutual love, mutual care, mutual intercession, and mutual shepherding.</li><li>Such clustering renders a stronger testimony for Christ by the churches in the eyes of the unbelievers, thus speeding up their salvation.</li><li>A local church should be under the leadership of the elders and should be ministered to by all the gifted saints, such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints that they may participate in the building up of the Body of Christ. Thus, all kinds of the members of Christ can be useful in the building up of His Body, and not one will be rejected or left idle in the house of God and in the Body of Christ.</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SPEAKING BY VARIOUS BROTHERS<br>CONCERNING THE LOCAL CHURCHES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Local Church Being the God-called-out People Gathered Together in a Locality</H2><P>How wonderful it is that we are in the local churches! The Lord desires to have many local churches, and this conference is a gathering of many churches. When the Lord gains a lampstand in a city, it is a real victory to the Lord and a real shame to the enemy; and when a number of the churches in different cities come together and are in one accord, it is a glory to the Lord.</P><P>The Lord's recovery is a matter of the local churches. For us to experience the Lord's recovery, we must be in the local churches. However, a single local church, a single lampstand, in a single city is not adequate to express the testimony of Christ, nor is it adequate for the fellowship. The testimony and fellowship of the church are something of the Body. These matters need all the churches. For this the churches need to be able to come together; they need to be clustered. Some may like to be alone and isolated, but this is wrong. The churches should be clustered, and the saints should be blended together. In the blending there is a great spiritual benefit and a mutual building up. This is something that belongs to the Body, to all the churches. The clustering of the churches also stirs up our mutuality. All the churches should be the same in fellowship, in the Lord's testimony, and in the building up. Also, when the churches are clustered together, there is a stronger testimony, and there are the impact and the encouragement. This is good for the impact of the gospel.</P><P>A local church is the God-called-out people gathered together in a locality&#151;a city, a town, or a village. The Body of Christ is one. According to Ephesians 4:4, there is one Body and one Spirit. Because both the Body and the Spirit are only one, there should be only one local church in every city. It is very simple: one city, one church. The New Testament is absolutely consistent on this point; there is no deviation (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rom. 16:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Cor. 8:1; Gal. 1:2; Rev. 1:4, 11). In a given city, there should be only one church. This is similar to the divine principle that for one husband there should be only one wife.</P><P>However, the situation among Christians today is altogether different. In a small city of only fifty thousand people, there may be over one hundred different "churches," that is, different denominations. All these denominations are divisions. God ordained that in one city all the called-out ones should gather together as the one church, as the unique expression of the one Body of Christ in that locality. Some say that in a city where there are many thousands of believers, it would be impossible to have only one church. However, in Jerusalem there were myriads (ten thousands) of believers (Acts 21:20), but there was only one church (8:1). In Jerusalem three thousand were saved, baptized, and added to the church on the day of Pentecost (2:41), and shortly thereafter at least five thousand more were added (4:4). Still, there was only one church in Jerusalem.</P><P>In Romans 16:3-5a the apostle Paul greeted Prisca and Aquila and the church, which was in their house. The fact that the believers in Rome met in the home of Prisca and Aquila indicates that the number was small. However, although the number was small, they were still the one local church in Rome. The principle of "one city, one church" is God's way, to which we say Amen. The oneness of the Body should be expressed locally in every city. It is wrong to have divisions (1 Cor. 1:10). It is wrong to have the denominations. There should be just one church in a city.</P><P>Not only so, all the local churches should not be independent or isolated. They should not be locally a local sect. They should be blended. They should come together. We should not think that it is good enough merely to be in the local church in our city. We need to be in the churches, that is, in the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>All the Local Churches<br>Being the One Body of Christ<br>Separated by the Localities of Their Existence, but Still Expressing the Same One Body,<br>Not Respectively but Corporately</H2><P>It is a wonderful thing to be saved, to have the divine life. When we received the divine life, that was marvelous. But that divine life in us brought us to the local church. It brought us to meet with the Christians in our locality to stand there as a testimony for God in that locality. But still, there is more than just the local churches. The local churches individually do not express the Body of Christ. But when the local churches come together to be coordinated and knit together, there is the expression of the Body; there is the expression of the one new man on the earth. We are not merely for our locality. We are not individual Christians, and we are not even individual churches; we are the Body of Christ. We are the one new man.</P><P>We need to see that all the local churches are the one Body of Christ separated by the localities of their existence but still expressing the same one Body, not respectively but corporately. All the local churches are the one Body of Christ, and they are separated from one another only by the localities in which they exist. Otherwise, there is no separation in the Body of Christ. In our human body there is no separation of our hand from our foot, except that they are located in different places in the body. Likewise, the local churches are separated from one another only because they exist in different geographical locations. However, all the churches have the same life, the same nature, the same essence, the same element, the same source, and the same Triune God. Just as the Triune God cannot be divided, so the local churches as the Body of Christ cannot be divided.</P><P>The local churches are separated by the localities of their existence, but they express the same one Body; and they do this not respectively but corporately. Collectively, corporately, the churches express the Body of Christ. In each locality there is some expression of the Body, but each local church, respectively, is still only a part of the Body. God desires to have the whole Body expressed. For this we need to come together to be blended together, to be knit together, and to be coordinated so that God can have His unique expression. When God has His expression, both He and we are satisfied.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Local Churches Being Autonomous<br>in Business Affairs but Not in the Testimony<br>for Christ and in the Fellowship of the Spirit</H2><P>The local churches are autonomous in business affairs, but not in the testimony for Christ and in the fellowship of the Spirit. The testimony for Christ and the fellowship of the Spirit should be not only local but also universal. In such matters all the local churches are identical in nature and in function, as illustrated by the seven golden lampstands.</P><P>The local churches are autonomous in business affairs. However, the local churches are not for business affairs; business affairs are necessary so that the local churches can be the testimony of Christ. Concerning business affairs, it is obvious that each local church has its own needs and its own situation. Some churches may have a large number of young people. That creates a particular situation. Other churches may have many older saints. This creates a different kind of situation. The different situations among the churches may affect the way they conduct their business affairs. In many practical matters decisions can be made at a local level. Thus, each church can be considered autonomous in business affairs.</P><P>However, the fact that the local churches are autonomous in business affairs does not give them the license to become independent in their testimony or in their fellowship. The local churches are autonomous in business affairs, but not in the testimony for Christ and not in the fellowship of the Spirit. If a local church stresses its autonomy in order to isolate itself from the other churches and to have its own particular testimony and fellowship, this is altogether wrong. We need to be clear that autonomy does not apply to the church's testimony or to the church's fellowship. In these matters the churches are identical. The churches may differ in business affairs, but this does not mean that their testimony and fellowship are different. The testimony and the fellowship of all the local churches are one, for all the churches are in one Body.</P><P>The churches' testimony for Christ and the fellowship of the Spirit should not only be local but also universal. In such matters all the local churches are identical in nature and in function, as illustrated by the seven golden lampstands. In Revelation 1, when John turned to see the voice that spoke with him, he saw seven golden lampstands (v. 12). This shows that regardless of its particular condition, as developed in chapters two and three of Revelation, and regardless of the diversity in the churches' negative situations, each local church was represented before the Lord as a golden lampstand. All the lampstands were golden, signifying that in nature all the churches are divine. In reading Revelation 2 and 3 we can see many things related to the churches that were not divine. Nevertheless, all the churches stood before the Lord as golden lampstands, meaning that in His eyes, in His view, each local church is divine in nature. This is a wonderful fact. The church in each locality is divine in nature and is represented by a golden lampstand.</P><P>The local churches are not only identical in nature but also identical in function. The function of a golden lampstand is to stand and to shine with light, to shine by the burning oil. This shining is the expression of Christ. The function of every local church is to stand and to shine as an expression of Christ in this dark age. Each local church has the same identical nature and the same identical function.</P><P>The diversity among the seven local churches in Revelation 2 and 3 is all in negative things. Some churches were under a situation of suffering. One church had lost its first love. One church was even married to the world. Another was absolutely in a state of apostasy. One had a name that it was living, yet it was dead. Each church was different, but different only in the negative condition and situation. Surely we would not want such negative things to be universal. But what is universal is that in each situation the Spirit was speaking to a particular church, and the Spirit also spoke to all seven churches. It is a wonderful fact that regardless of the condition and situation of the churches, the same one Spirit spoke to them and the same Lord portrayed in Revelation 1 ministered to their situation by coming in to trim the lamps so that the light could shine brighter. Still, the function and nature of each church remained identical with all the other churches. Therefore, regardless of what the local situation and condition of each church may be, each local church is a golden lampstand. In nature the churches are all divine, and in function the churches all express Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Hence, the Neighboring Local Churches<br>Being Clustered as Much as Possible<br>in the Blending Way</H2><P>Hence, the neighboring local churches should be clustered as much as possible in the blending way for the spiritual benefits in the mutual building up of the Body of Christ, as the Lord Jesus clustered the seven neighboring churches in Asia.</P><P>There is only one Body in this universe. This one Body is the one church of God manifested in many localities as many local churches. Although the local churches are many in existence, they are still one universally in element, and they all express that one element.</P><P>The base of the one Body is, first, the Triune God. There is only one God, who is triune. The Triune God is for the Body. The Father is the source of the Body, the Son is the element of the Body, and the Spirit is the essence of the Body (Eph. 4:4-6). This Triune God cannot be divided; therefore, neither can the one Body be divided.</P><P>Second, there is only one incarnation, and there is only one Christ in His incarnation. Third, there is only one crucifixion, and fourth, there is only one resurrection. Finally, there is only one Christ in His ascension. Today all these elements as the base of the one Body are in the one Spirit. First Corinthians 12:13 shows us that we were all baptized in one Spirit into the one Body and were all given to drink the one Spirit.</P><P>If we truly see this, we will not only have the one accord in our own locality, but we will also keep the oneness of the Body, which is the oneness of the Spirit (Eph. 4:3). Before the day of Pentecost one hundred twenty saints could pray together for ten days steadfastly in one accord because they saw the base of the one Body. They saw with their own eyes the Triune God in His incarnation. They also saw Christ's crucifixion, Christ's resurrection, and Christ in His ascension. This is the reason that they could be in one accord. This one accord brought in the outpouring of the Spirit, which resulted in three thousand being saved on the day of Pentecost. What an increase and what a blessing came in through the one accord!</P><P>The secret of the practice of the church life is not only the one accord in the local churches but also the oneness in the universal Body. Today some insist on saying that every local church has its own jurisdiction and administration and that no one else should touch any of its affairs. To say such a thing is to make all the local churches separate from one another. This is separation; this is not oneness.</P><P>If all the local churches are one and every local church is in one accord, we will have the blessing. We all love the Lord and we are in the Lord's recovery, and we all keep the truth and teach the truth; yet the rate of increase among us is too low. Nearly everywhere it is the same. The rate of increase measures where we are. How much we need to consider our ways (Hag. 1:5, 7) and humble ourselves before the Lord! How much we need to come out of our local boundaries, out of our independence, and practice the oneness of the Body by being blended together! The blending through the clustering among the churches, and the fellowship among the churches, should be as much as practicality allows, without boundaries of cities, states, provinces, or nations.</P><P>The clustering of the churches for blending does not mean that we practice the federation of the churches by uniting the churches, like the federation of the fifty states of the United States. We do not practice federation, but we do practice the local churches as the one Body of Christ. In this practice the clustering and moving together of the neighboring churches should be as much as possible without the abolishing of the local administration in business affairs. In Southern California there are fifty-one local churches. Some are very small, with not more than fifteen saints. Others have twenty-five, thirty, or fifty, and a few have one or two hundred. Furthermore, these churches are close to one another geographically; that is, they are in the same neighborhood with one another. Recently, the churches in Southern California have begun to practice to be blended together by clustering on the Lord's Day. The result has been that in this blending the churches are strengthened and the impact is brought in.</P><P>In the book of Revelation the Lord Jesus clustered and blended the seven churches together as one. He wrote seven letters, one letter to each of the seven churches, and yet He put all the seven letters together as the one total Epistle and sent it to all seven churches that they might all receive the same fellowship (Rev. 1:4, 11; 2:1&#151;3:22). In the eyes of the Lord all the seven local churches were just one church because He has only one Body. Furthermore, the apostle Paul also blended the two churches in Laodicea and Colossae together. He wrote a letter to the church in Laodicea and asked the church in Laodicea to let Colossae read it. He also wrote a letter to the church in Colossae and asked Colossae to let Laodicea read it (Col. 4:16).</P><P>The principle of blending is also set forth in the Old Testament. There God blended the twelve tribes together as one, and He commanded them to come together three times a year in Jerusalem on Mount Zion (Deut. 16:16). All the Israelites brought the rich produce of the good land to offer to God and to share with one another for the mutual encouragement and mutual enjoyment. No doubt, whenever the time of these feasts arrived, all the people were full of joy. Even before coming to Mount Zion, while they were ascending they would sing Psalm 133: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell in unity...For there Jehovah commanded the blessing: life forever" (vv. 1, 3b). In this way of blending, the oneness of the people of Israel was preserved and expressed.</P><P>In the blending of the churches we receive nourishment, we receive revelation, and we receive a vision of God's eternal purpose concerning Christ and the church. Such a blending is not only for our own mutual spiritual benefit but is also for the mutual building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Such Clustering Stirring Up the Neighboring Churches in Mutual Love, Mutual Care,<br>Mutual Intercession, and Mutual Shepherding</H2><P>The clustering of the churches stirs up the neighboring churches in mutual love, mutual care, mutual intercession, and mutual shepherding.</P><P>Romans 16 and the end of 1 Corinthians 16 contain greetings to saints in different localities. By considering these greetings we can see that they express the mutual love among the saints in the churches. Then, in Acts 11:27-30; 1 Corinthians 16:1-3; 2 Corinthians 8:1-4; and Romans 15:25-27 we can see examples of mutual care among the churches. Such mutual care was demonstrated in the fellowship of the giving of material things. When the churches are clustered together, this kind of genuine mutual care among the churches is stirred up.</P><P>Also, through the clustering the saints hear of the needs among the churches and receive the burden to pray for them. This is an example of the mutual intercession in the Body of Christ stirred up by the clustering of the churches. When the churches cluster together, there is also the mutual shepherding through the mutual fellowship among the saints and the leading ones, so that the riches of Christ in each individual church are communicated and supplied to all the clustering churches.</P><P>When the churches cluster together, they experience the mutual love, the mutual care, the mutual intercession, and the mutual shepherding. How wonderful that in the church life the Lord is recovering this matter of the clustering for the blending of the churches! This issues in the practical building up of the Body of Christ in these four items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Such Clustering Rendering a Stronger Testimony for Christ in the Eyes of the Unbelievers,<br>Thus Speeding Up Their Salvation</H2><P>The clustering of the churches renders a stronger testimony for Christ by the churches in the eyes of the unbelievers, thus speeding up their salvation. The Lord's prayer in John 17 reveals that there is oneness only in the Triune God (vv. 21-23). The Triune God is truly one: the Father and the Son are one, the Son and the Spirit are one, and the Spirit and the Father are one. We have no oneness in ourselves. The only true oneness is in the Triune God. Today this Triune God lives in us. In the clustering of the churches we enjoy the Triune God as the very source and factor of our oneness. This oneness displays a visible testimony to the world, and especially to the unbelievers. Such a testimony is the expression of Christ and ministers Christ to people. According to the picture of the seven golden lampstands in Revelation 1, each lampstand shines individually as a testimony of Christ. However, when the lampstands are clustered together, the testimony becomes stronger and is intensified. With the seven golden lampstands, the shining testimony was intensified sevenfold.</P><P>Such a stronger testimony for Christ will speed up the salvation of the unbelievers. According to the Lord's prayer in John 17, the testimony of the oneness of the believers will cause the world to believe that the Father sent the Son. This is for the salvation of the unbelievers. Furthermore, according to 1 Corinthians 14:24-25, in a meeting of the church, if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters the meeting, he will be convicted and examined by all, and falling on his face, he will declare that indeed God is among us. In the clustering of the churches, the testimony of the church is intensified. Such an intensified testimony will speed up the salvation of the unbelievers.</P><P>The speeding up of the unbelievers' salvation results in the increase to the Body of Christ. The increase comes through the clustering, as mentioned in Acts 9:31. This verse says, "So then the church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it was multiplied." Here the word church, not churches, was used, denoting the church in the universal aspect. Judea, Galilee, and Samaria were not cities; they were provinces. Within each province there were many cities. There must have been churches in the local sense in a number of the cities in these three provinces (Gal. 1:22). All the local churches throughout the whole of Judea, Galilee, and Samaria were considered here as one church. In Acts 9:31 we may consider that all these churches were clustered. These clustered churches were being built up and were also being multiplied. When the unbelievers see, experience, enter into, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit in the genuine oneness, the prophesying, and the mutual love, mutual care, mutual intercession, and mutual shepherding of the clustered churches, the impact of the stronger testimony for Christ will surely speed up their salvation. This is one of the marvelous results when the churches gather together and cluster in the blending way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Local Church Needing to Be<br>under the Leadership of the Elders<br>and Also Needing to Be Ministered To<br>by All the Gifted Saints<br>for the Perfecting of the Saints</H2><P>A local church should be under the leadership of the elders and should be ministered to by all the gifted saints, such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints that they may participate in the building up of the Body of Christ. Thus, all kinds of members of Christ can be useful in the building up of His Body, and not one will be rejected or left idle in the house of God and in the Body of Christ.</P><P>In order for the local churches to go on, they need the leadership of the elders. The New Testament reveals that the elders are not voted in by their congregations, but they are appointed by the apostles in every city, that is, in every church (Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5), according to their maturity in life. The elders are the overseers in the churches (Acts 20:17, 28; Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:1-2; Titus 1:5, 7). As overseers, the elders should look diligently after the church to be aware of the practical and spiritual situation of the church and the saints. The main responsibility of the elders as overseers is not to rule over but to shepherd, to take all-inclusive, tender care of the flock, the church of God, which He purchased with His own blood (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2). The church as the flock of God is not the elders' possession but God's possession, allotted to the elders as their allotment, their portion, entrusted to them by God for their care. The elders should also take the lead in the church by becoming a pattern in preaching the gospel, in shepherding and perfecting the saints, in growing in life, in laboring in the Word, and in serving and caring for the church, so that all the saints can follow (1 Pet. 5:3).</P><P>In addition to the leadership of the elders, the local churches also need to be ministered to by all the gifted members in the Body for the perfecting of the saints that they may participate in the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-12, 16). In Ephesians 4:11 Paul mentioned that Christ, the Head of the church, gave four kinds of gifted persons to the Body&#151;apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. These four kinds of gifts were given to the Body for the perfecting of the saints, that all the saints may be equipped and furnished with organic functions and thus be able to do the direct work of building up the Body of Christ.</P><P>An apostle is one who is sent out by the Lord with the Lord's authority to preach the gospel of God, to teach the divine truth, and to establish the churches. According to the clear revelation of the New Testament, after the churches are established by the apostles, they need the continual care and ministry of the apostles for the perfecting of the saints and the appointing, instructing, and leading of the elders (Acts 18:1, 11; 20:17-38).</P><P>A prophet is not one who primarily predicts the future, but one who speaks for the Lord and speaks forth the Lord to minister Christ to people. The saints in the churches need to be perfected by the prophets so that all will be able to prophesy for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 14:3-4, 31).</P><P>The evangelists are those who are specially gifted in preaching the gospel of Christ. Philip was such an evangelist (Acts 8:5-40; 21:8). The saints in the churches also need the perfecting of the evangelists so that they may be equipped and stirred up in their spirit to preach prevailingly the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel (Eph. 3:8) by contacting people for the increase of the Body of Christ.</P><P>According to the grammar of Ephesians 4:11, the term shepherds and teachers refers to only one class of gifted persons. A shepherd should know how to teach, and a teacher should be able to shepherd. When we preach the gospel, some will believe and be saved. After being saved, the new ones need to be taken care of. They need to be shepherded, and they need to be taught. The shepherds and teachers perfect the saints by teaching them how to feed and nourish the young saints and the new believers, and also how to teach the growing saints (Acts 11:25-26; 13:1), so that the saints may do the work of the New Testament ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ, as the shepherds and teachers do.</P><P>Today all the saints in the local churches need to be perfected unto the work of the ministry, that is, unto the building up of the Body of Christ. The light concerning Ephesians 4:11-12 and 16 has never been as bright and clear as it is today. The Body of Christ is built up not by the four kinds of gifted persons directly, but by the functioning of all the perfected members of the Body. In the church of God, the Body of Christ, all the members should be living, vital, and functioning members. After being perfected, all the saints become the building members to build up the Body of Christ.</P><P>8 brothers</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE BODY OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:3-14, 19-23; 3:8-11; 4:3-6</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The Body of Christ is an organism of the processed and consummated Triune God.</li><li>It is constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God as its essence, element, and source, mingled with the regenerated and transformed tripartite believers as the counterpart of the constituting Triune God.</li><li>It is the Body of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ as the fullness, the expression, of the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ, who fills all in all.</li><li>Its constitution is through the dispensing of the Father's life and nature, of the Son's element brought forth by His redemption, and of the Spirit's essence through His sealing.</li><li>Its constitution is also by the transfusion of Christ in His ascension.</li><li>Its formation is through the baptism of the Spirit in the economical Trinity.</li><li>Its growth is by the increase of the Triune God within all its members, who grow into the Head, Christ, in everything.</li><li>Its building up is by the bountiful supply out of the Head through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, which causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</li><li>Its growth and building up both are in the realm of the genuine oneness of the Spirit, in which all the members of the Body should attain to the oneness of their common faith in Christ and of their common knowledge of the Son of God.</li><li>As the organism of the Triune God, it is also the fullness, the expression, of the consummated Triune God.</li></ol><P>In this message we want to see what the Body of Christ is. We need to see the Body of Christ from the angle which is revealed in the book of Ephesians. A number of teachers of the Bible have said that the book of Ephesians is a book on the church. But we need to see that Ephesians is not merely on the church but on the church as the Body of Christ. Ephesians 1:22-23 says that Christ was made Head over all things to the church, which is His Body. Ephesians stresses the Body of Christ.</P><P>Today even the non-Christians are familiar with the term church, and they, along with many Christians, think that the church is a physical building with a bell tower. They say that they are going to church or are in church, referring to a physical building. They do not know that the church is not a physical building but the Body of Christ. We need to see what the Body of Christ is. According to Ephesians, the Body of Christ is something so mysterious that we cannot comprehend it with our natural understanding.</P><P>If someone were to ask us what the Body of Christ is, we might only be able to tell them that the Body of Christ is the church. If they went on to ask us what the church is, we might only be able to tell them that the church is the gathering of the people called out by God from the world. Of course, this is true, but this is not the Body of Christ revealed in the book of Ephesians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ISSUE OF:</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the issue of something. First, it is the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God. Second, it is the issue of the transfusing of the ascended Christ.</P><P>Ephesians 1:3-14 reveals that the Body of Christ is the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God in the Father's nature and life, in the Son's redemption and His constituting us into God's inheritance, and in the Spirit's sealing and pledging. This is so mysterious and profound! The Body of Christ is the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God. Something out of the Father, something out of the Son, and something out of the Spirit issue in the Body of Christ.</P><P>The Body of Christ is also the issue of the transfusing of the ascended Christ in His attainment to be the Head over all things (Eph. 1:19-23). Furthermore, the Body of Christ is the consummation of the ministering of the riches of Christ (3:8-11). The totality of the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God, the issue of the transfusing of the ascended Christ, and the consummation of the ministering of the riches of Christ is the Body of Christ. The dispensing is of the Triune God, the transfusing is of the ascended Christ, and the consummation is of the ministering of the riches of Christ. Then we have the Body of Christ.</P><P>Furthermore, the Body of Christ is the divine-human constitution with the Triune God and the transformed humanity. It is a constitution of divinity and humanity. This is in Ephesians 4:3-6. We need to remember these five words: issue, dispensing, transfusing, consummation, and constitution. The Body of Christ is the issue of the dispensing and transfusing and it is a consummation and constitution.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Dispensing of the Triune God</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>In the Father's Nature and Life</H2><P>When we Christians come to spiritual things, we mostly would care only for the terms. We would not dive into the depths to get the intrinsic significance of these terms. For instance, Ephesians 1:4 says that before the foundation of the world, God the Father chose us to be holy. Even a young child may be able to read this, but what is the intrinsic significance here? Some think that God chose us in eternity that we should go to heaven, so we have been chosen unto heaven. But Paul does not say this. He says God chose us to be holy.</P><P>In the entire universe, nothing is holy except God Himself. Holiness is God's divine nature. This indicates strongly that in God's choosing of us He had the intention to dispense His holy nature into us. We were sinners and worldly people. How could we be holy? This is like asking a turtle to fly like a bird. A turtle cannot do this because it does not have the flying nature. The only way we can be holy is for God, the holy One, to dispense Himself into our being so that our whole being may be permeated and saturated with His holy nature.</P><P>The Bible tells us God's salvation is first to regenerate us and then to sanctify us. To sanctify us is to make us holy. Furthermore, God's salvation is to transform us. God's holy nature sanctifies us to transform us by making us holy as God is. Thus, we can see that God's choosing us to be holy in eternity indicates that God is going to dispense Himself as the holy nature into our intrinsic being so that we can be as holy as He is. The Brethren teachers spoke much on Ephesians 1, but they did not see that God's choosing in its intrinsic significance indicates that God is now dispensing Himself as the holy nature into our being.</P><P>Ephesians 1:5 says that God the Father not only chose us but also predestinated us, marked us out beforehand, unto sonship. Now we need to see the intrinsic significance of God's predestinating us unto sonship. Unto sonship means unto the divine life. Surely this indicates that God is going to dispense His divine life into us to make us His sons. What can make you a son of a certain person? Nothing can except that person's life. Your father's life has made you his son, and this is sonship. In the same way, our heavenly Father has dispensed His divine life into us to make us His sons, the sons of God.</P><P>Ephesians 1 first tells us that God in Christ gives us all the spiritual blessings in the heavenlies (v. 3), and the very God here surely is the Divine Trinity, the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father's blessing is His choosing of us and His predestinating of us. In His choosing He intends to impart, or to dispense, His nature into us, and in His predestinating He intends to dispense His life into us. In time He caused us to believe into Christ, and we were regenerated. In our regeneration we received the Father's divine life and divine nature. Second Peter 1:4 says that we are today the partakers of the divine nature of God. Today we have the life of God and the nature of God.</P><P>The first stanza of Hymns, #841 says that the Lord is our life, that He lives in us, and that we are sanctified by His holy nature. God the Father has put His life into us that we might be His sons, and He has put His nature into us that we might be made holy as He is. These are the blessings of the Father revealed in Ephesians 1:3-6. Verse 6 concludes this section of the blessings given to us by the Father by saying, "To the praise of the glory of His grace."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>In the Son's Redemption and<br>His Constituting Us into His Inheritance</H2><P>Verses 7 to 12 of Ephesians 1 is another section, showing that we all have received redemption in the Son. Before we were redeemed, we were fallen sinners who were in the depths of sin and far away from God. That was our condition and position. But one day we believed into the Lord Jesus. God not only regenerated us but also redeemed us in Christ (v. 7). This means that He rescued us out of the depths of sin, brought us back to Christ, and put us into Christ. We were there in sin, but now through the Son's redemption, we are here in Christ. The little word in indicates an organic union. God's redemption has brought us out of sin and into Christ; now we are in an organic union with this wonderful, all-inclusive Christ.</P><P>When we remain in this organic union with Him, day by day He dispenses His divine element of life with all His riches into us to make us a treasure to God. We were sinners in sin condemned by God but today we are in Christ. Day after day by His secreting of His divine life into us, He makes us pearls, treasures, to make us God's inheritance (see Rev. 21:21, note 211, and Matthew 13:46, note 461&#151;Recovery Version).</P><P>There are two major items in the blessings of the Son. One is redemption and the other is our being made the inheritance of God (v. 11). Today we have become God's inheritance, and God is waiting to inherit us. God is not going to inherit sinners. He wants to make us a treasure for Him to inherit. This is why verse 18 speaks of the riches of the glory of God's inheritance in the saints.</P><P>These are the blessings God has given us in Christ. We were in sin, but now we are in Christ. Christ put us into Himself, and He is secreting His life element around us to constitute us pearls, a treasure, for His inheritance. This is the divine dispensing. The dispensing of Christ as life into us day by day makes us more and more a treasure. Then we all become God's inheritance. This section of the Son's blessings closes in verse 12 with the phrase "that we would be to the praise of His glory."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>In the Spirit's Sealing and Pledging</H2><P>Verses 13 and 14 are another section which shows us the blessings in the Spirit. The Spirit's sealing in verse 13 is a great blessing to us. We need to consider why the Spirit comes to seal us. This is because we have become God's inheritance, and He needs to put His seal upon us. We always want to put our name on what we treasure. When we buy a beautiful Bible, we may put our seal with our name upon it to show that it belongs to us. But this sealing implies even more. The ink on the seal saturates the sealed paper, so this sealing is the dispensing.</P><P>Ephesians 4:30 says that this sealing with the Spirit as the divine ink will last until our body is redeemed. The sealing of the Spirit with its permeating and soaking within us is still going on every day. This takes place whether we obey Him or disobey Him. If we obey Him, He seals us. If we do not obey Him, He may seal us even more. The Lord may impress a young person to go to a conference with the saints. Instead, he may go to the theater. In the theater the Lord continues to seal him, and this sealing is a bothering within him, impressing him to leave the theater and go to the conference.</P><P>When I was a young person, I played soccer a great deal. After I was saved by the Lord, no one told me not to play soccer. I still went to play. But one day when I was playing, something touched me within. That was the sealing of the Holy Spirit. When the ball came to me, I could not kick it. I just walked away and could no longer give myself to play soccer again. The whole team was surprised at me. This was the issue of the Spirit's sealing within me. I can never forget that experience.</P><P>The sisters may desire to go shopping, not just to take care of their need but to satisfy their lust for material things. When they are shopping for things on sale, the Spirit will be sealing them, impressing them to go back home. When we were regenerated, we were sealed by the Spirit, and this sealing is still going on every day.</P><P>This sealing eventually becomes the pledging to guarantee that God is our inheritance. The sealing is to confirm that we are God's inheritance. It confirms His ownership of us. This sealing then becomes a pledging to guarantee, to assure us, that God will be our inheritance. The pledging is also the Spirit's dispensing.</P><P>Now we can see the three aspects of the divine dispensing. The Father's nature and life have been dispensed into us; the Son's life element has been dispensed into us; and the Spirit's essence is also dispensed into our being. So we have the essence, the element, and the life and nature of the Triune God all the time dispensed into our being. The issue is that we are constituted the Body of Christ. We are the Body of Christ because we have received the dispensing of the divine life, nature, element, and essence into our being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Transfusing of the Ascended Christ</H2><P>The final part of Ephesians 1 reveals the transfusing of the ascended Christ (vv. 19-23). Christ's power is transcendent. He ascended into the heavens and was made Head over all things to the church. The word to implies a transfusing. Christ is transfusing Himself as the ascended One into our intrinsic being to make us a part of Him, the ascended One. Today we are in ascension because the ascended One has been transfused into us. I have the feeling that I am not in the world or in myself but in the ascended One and in the ascension.</P><P>The issue of the transfusing of the ascended Christ in His attainment to be the Head over all things is the Body of Christ. Christ, the ascended One, has been made the Head over all things to the church, which is the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God and of the transfusing of the ascended Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MINISTERING<br>OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST</H2><P>Ephesians 3:8-11 reveals that the Body of Christ is the consummation of the ministering of the riches of Christ. The apostle Paul ministered the unsearchable riches of Christ into all of the believers, and such a ministry has a consummation. The consummation of this ministry of the riches of Christ into our being is the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIVINE-HUMAN CONSTITUTION</H2><P>Ephesians 4:3-6 shows that the Body of Christ is a divine-human constitution constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God and the regenerated, transformed humanity. The framework of the Body, the composition of the Body, is the uplifted, transformed humanity. Once we were in sin as sinners, but through His regeneration, sanctification, and transformation we have been transformed and uplifted. We all can testify that when we are in the meetings of the church or of the ministry, we are greatly uplifted. The uplifted humanity which is transformed is the framework of the Body of Christ.</P><P>The intrinsic essence of the Body is the Spirit. Ephesians 4:4 says, "One Body and one Spirit." There is one Body, one framework, and one essence, one Spirit. Ephesians 4:4-6 mentions the one Spirit, the one Lord, and the one God and Father of all. The Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence of the one Body. The three in the Godhead are distinct but They are never separated. Instead, according to the New Testament teaching, wherever the Spirit is, the Son and the Father are also there. The Father is over all, through all, and in all (v. 6). The Trinity is implied even here. Over all refers mainly to the Father, through all to the Son, and in all to the Spirit. The Triune God eventually enters into us all by reaching us as the Spirit. This is the mingling, and this mingling is a constitution of the Triune God as the essence, the element, and the source and of the uplifted, transformed humanity as the framework. Such a divine-human constitution is the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE COUNTERPART OF CHRIST AND THE WARRIOR</H2><P>Ephesians 5 tells us that the Body of Christ is the counterpart of Christ, and this counterpart is the bride, the wife. After Adam was created, God said that it was "not good" for Adam to be alone (Gen. 2:18). A bachelor needs a counterpart, a completing part, a complementing part. A young brother who has not yet been married needs to realize that he is not complete. He needs to have a sister to complete him, to be his counterpart. The church as the counterpart of Christ is revealed in Ephesians 5. This counterpart, this bride, becomes the warrior, the fighter, in Ephesians 6.</P><P>Revelation 19 fulfills these two points. The totality of the overcomers becomes the bride to be the counterpart of Christ (vv. 7-9), and this counterpart becomes Christ's army to defeat Antichrist at Armageddon (vv. 11-21). Ephesians 5 and 6 will be fulfilled in Revelation 19. This is the revelation of the Body of Christ in the book of Ephesians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SPEAKING BY VARIOUS BROTHERS<br>CONCERNING THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Body of Christ Being an Organism<br>of the Processed and Consummated Triune God</H2><P>Some people think the church is an organization, but the church, the Body of Christ, is an organism of the processed and consummated Triune God. Our physical body is an organism, but a chair is a mere organization of materials because it has no life in it. The Body of Christ is an organism because it is full of life. The church is not an organization without life, but an organism with life.</P><P>Every aspect of the church must be organic because the church is the issue of the living Divine Trinity. The Bible tells us that the embodiment of God, Christ, is life (John 14:6). Christ is not something organizational. As the embodiment of the Triune God, He is the totality of the divine, eternal life. The totality of life, the living Triune God, issues in one thing&#151;the Body of Christ. Since the Triune God is the totality of life, the Body of Christ is altogether a matter of life. We should put anything that is not life under our feet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Body of Christ Being Constituted<br>with the Processed and Consummated<br>Triune God Mingled with the Regenerated and Transformed Tripartite Believers</H2><P>Furthermore, the Body of Christ is constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God as its essence, element, and source, mingled with the regenerated and transformed tripartite believers as the counterpart of the constituting Triune God. The source is the Father, the element is Christ the Lord, and the essence is the Spirit (Eph. 4:4-6). There is a marvelous essence available to all of us today, and that is the essence of the processed and consummated Triune God, which is the very essence of the Body of Christ. Ultimately, the church is a group of people who are in union with the Triune God and are mingled with the Triune God.</P><P>Ephesians 4:4-6 presents the real scenery of the Body of Christ. This group comprises four persons&#151;the Body, the Spirit as the essence, the Lord as the element, and the Father as the source. The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is mingled with the believers. This mingling is the constitution of the Body of Christ. The divine mingling began at our regeneration. The divine Spirit regenerated our human spirit and is now mingled with our spirit as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). This mingling continues in our being as the divine essence of the processed and consummated Triune God permeates our inward being to transform us metabolically. This wonderful mingling makes us the counterpart of the constituting Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Body of Christ Being the Fullness<br>of the All-inclusive and All-extensive Christ</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the Body of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ as the fullness, the expression, of the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ, who fills all in all (Eph. 1:22-23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Its Constitution Being through the Dispensing<br>of the Father's Life and Nature, of the Son's Element Brought Forth by His Redemption,<br>and of the Spirit's Essence through His Sealing</H2><P>Now that we have seen what the Body of Christ is, we need to see the constitution of the Body of Christ, the organism of the Triune God. The Body of Christ is constituted through the dispensing of the Father's life and nature, of the Son's element brought forth by His redemption, and of the Spirit's essence through His sealing. This is a threefold dispensing involving the substance of the Father, the element of the Son, and the essence of the Spirit.</P><P>Ephesians 1:4 says that the Father chose us in Him, in Christ, before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish. Holiness is the very nature of God. God's constitution is holy. His substance is holy. God charges us to be holy. He said, "You shall be holy because I am holy" (1 Pet. 1:16). His desire is to dispense His very nature into our being. To be holy is not only to be separated from everything common but also to be saturated with the very divine, holy nature of God. In Ephesians 5:27 Paul expressed God's desire to have a glorious church that is holy and without blemish.</P><P>Ephesians 1:5 says that we were predestinated unto sonship. God's predestination has a goal, and that goal is sonship. To be a son of God means that we have God the Father's life. No father can beget a child without imparting his very life into that child. The life of our divine Father is a begetting life. We have been begotten of God with His divine life to be His sons (John 1:12-13).</P><P>The Body of Christ is also constituted through the dispensing of the Son's element brought forth by His redemption. Ephesians 1:7 says that we have redemption in Christ through His blood. In verse 10 God expresses His desire to head up all things in Christ. By means of the marvelous work of redemption in Christ, we were brought out of Adam, out of sin, and out of the world into Christ as our sphere and realm. In Christ as our sphere and realm, we receive the impartation of the life element of Christ. The very life of God embodied in the Son was imparted through Christ's redemption into God's people. In Christ's all-inclusive death many negative things were dealt with, but on the positive side there was the release of the divine life (John 12:24). This life was imparted into us at the time of our regeneration.</P><P>Now we come to the dispensing of the Spirit's essence through His sealing (Eph. 1:13). The essence of the Spirit as the living seal permeates our very being just as the ink of the seal saturates, soaks, and permeates the sealed paper. When we were regenerated, the sealing essence of the Spirit came into our being to soak and saturate us with the very essence of God.</P><P>This sealing designated us as God's inheritance. Ephesians 1:11 says, "In whom also we were designated as an inheritance." We may wonder how God could inherit us men of clay. But we need to see that through the dispensing of God's essence into us, there is the increase of gold and the decrease of clay. This sealing is unto the day of redemption (4:30). It is going on day by day. The very essence of the Spirit is permeating our very being until one day we will be completely transformed to be the precious material which can be inherited by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Its Constitution Being Also by the Transfusion<br>of Christ in His Ascension</H2><P>The constitution of the Body of Christ is also by the transfusion of Christ in His ascension. This relates to the transcending power of Christ mentioned in Ephesians 1:19, which speaks of the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. This power toward us is a fourfold power: resurrection power (v. 20a), ascending power (v. 20b), subjecting power (v. 22a), and heading-up power (v. 22b). This power raised Christ from the dead, seated Him at God's right hand in the heavenlies, subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church. This same power that God caused to operate in Christ is operating in you and in me. We do not have to remain in the dead condition of Sardis with a mere name that we are living. We can apply and appropriate the transcending power of Christ to bring us out of our deadness. This power is toward us.</P><P>We are enjoying the ascended Christ, and we are seated with Him in the heavenlies (Eph. 2:6). All things being subjected under His feet means that they are under our feet because we are His organic Body. God gave Christ to be the Head over all things to the church, which is His Body (1:22-23). Thank the Lord for such a constitution of the Body of Christ through the dispensing of the Triune God and by the transfusion of Christ in His ascension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Its Formation Being through the Baptism<br>of the Spirit in the Economical Trinity</H2><P>We have seen what the Body of Christ is and also how the Body of Christ is constituted with the processed Triune God. Now we need to see how the Body of Christ was formed through the baptism of the Spirit in the economical Trinity. First Corinthians 12:13 says, "In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body." This shows that the Body of Christ was formed through the baptism of the Spirit.</P><P>In order to form the Body of Christ, the Triune God passed through a wonderful process. He was incarnated as a man and passed through crucifixion and resurrection. In resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). In John 20 the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples in resurrection and breathed into them, saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (v. 22). He breathed Himself as the Spirit into them to impart Himself as life into them. Then He told them to stay in Jerusalem until they were clothed with power from on high (Luke 24:49). This is concerning the outpouring of the Spirit as the power from on high and is different from the Spirit of life breathed into the disciples on the day of His resurrection.</P><P>Fifty days after Christ's resurrection, on the day of Pentecost, the economical Spirit of the ascension power was poured out upon the disciples. Acts 2 shows us that on the day of Pentecost, the Jewish believers, the first part of Christ's Body, were baptized (vv. 1-4). In the house of Cornelius the Gentile believers, the second part of His Body, were baptized in the same way (10:44-47). By these two steps both the Jews and the Gentiles were formed into the Body of Christ through the baptism of the Spirit. The Body came into existence, and we are in this one Body. God has given us the Spirit as life but He has also clothed us with the Spirit as power. The Body of Christ is not only constituted with life but also clothed with the transcendent power of Christ to carry out God's work and move on the earth today for His eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Its Growth Being by the Increase<br>of the Triune God within All Its Members,<br>Who Grow into the Head, Christ, in Everything</H2><P>Now that the Body of Christ has been formed, this Body needs to grow. Its growth is by the increase (growth) of the Triune God within all its members, who grow into the Head, Christ, in everything (Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:15). We have seen that 1 Corinthians 12:13 says that we were all baptized in one Spirit into one Body. Then it says that we were all given to drink one Spirit. Now that we have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body, we need to drink the one Spirit so that the Body may grow. The one Spirit is the supply that we need to grow in this Body.</P><P>Peter says that as newborn babes we should long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it we may grow (1 Pet. 2:2). When we pray-read the Word in the morning, we receive the milk of the word. By this milk we can grow. Matthew 4:4 says that man lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. The Lord told us in John 6 that He is the living bread which came down out of heaven and that we need to eat Him so that we can live because of Him (vv. 51, 57). By eating and drinking the Lord, we can grow in the divine life, and the Triune God increases within us. The Lord is the living water and the living bread, so we can drink Him and eat Him to grow up into Him.</P><P>We have seen that the Body of Christ is the counterpart of Christ, the bride. A husband cannot marry a bride who is immature, who is still a babe. His bride must be full-grown, fully mature. This shows that we need to grow unto maturity so that we can be the counterpart of Christ.</P><P>This growth is the increase of the Triune God within us. Colossians 2:19 says that the Body grows with the growth of God, the increase of God. The Body of Christ is growing with the increase of the element of the Triune God. The growth of the Body of Christ is not by the increase of knowledge but by the increase of the very God Himself as life.</P><P>According to Colossians 2:19, God is growing within us. When we grow, that means God is growing within us. Day by day as we eat Him and drink Him, as we pray-read His word and call upon His name, we are taking in the very element of God Himself. Thus, He is dispensing Himself into us, transfusing Himself into us. When His essence is increasing in us, He is growing in us. Thus, the Body grows with the growth of God Himself.</P><P>The Body is an organism, not an organization. As members of this Body, we grow unto maturity until we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Himself (Eph. 4:13). Ephesians 4:15 says that we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ. As Christ is imparting Himself into us, we are growing in Christ. The growth of the Body is by the increase of the Triune God within all its members, who grow into the Head, Christ, in everything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Its Building Up Being by the Bountiful<br>Supply out of the Head through Every Joint<br>of the Rich Supply and through the Operation<br>in the Measure of Each One Part</H2><P>We all need to see the operation and functioning of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God. All of us are part of this organism which needs to be built up. The building up of the Body of Christ is by the bountiful supply out of the Head through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, which causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love (Eph. 4:15-16). The building up of the church is the growth of the Body of Christ. As we grow up into the Head in all things, we have something out from the Head for the building up of the Body.</P><P>Ephesians 4:16 speaks of the joints and the parts of the Body. We are either joints or parts, but we should not be concerned about what we are. We need to grow up into the Head and then we need to function or operate out from the Head so that the Body can be supplied and built up. The Lord will fill us and move within us for us to function according to the measure of our capacity. Our capacity needs to be enlarged so that the Body of Christ can be built up more and more.</P><P>Paul used the human body to show us the reality of the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:4-5). The joints are the articulation of the Body. When a building is being built, the first thing the builders do is to set up the framework. That framing is like the articulation in our physical body. For the joints of the Body of Christ to be joined closely together is for them to be articulated and fitted closely together in harmony.</P><P>In a physical building, the frames of the building need to be joined closely together, whereas the stones of the building need to be put together by being interwoven. This is a picture of the joints and the parts in the Body of Christ. Not only is there the articulation of the joints, but also there is the need for each one part of the Body to be knit together, to be interwoven, to be compacted together solidly, through the growth in life to become one entity.</P><P>The joints dispense the particular, rich supply of Christ, and the knitting and interweaving are through the operation in the measure of each one part. This causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love (Eph. 4:16). This love is the divine love by which we love Christ and the fellow members of His Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Its Growth and Building Up Being in the Realm of the Genuine Oneness of the Spirit</H2><P>We have seen that the church is not an organization, but the Body of Christ, the living organism of the processed and consummated Triune God. As such an organism, the Body of Christ grows and is being built up. Its growth and building up both are in the realm of the genuine oneness of the Spirit.</P><P>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed for this oneness. At that time, the oneness was not in existence among the believers. It was just a model that existed merely among the three of the Divine Trinity, the Father, the Son and the Spirit. The Lord Jesus prayed that the believers might be one, even as the Father was in Him and He in the Father (John 17:21). He was aspiring that this oneness in the Triune God would be realized among the believers.</P><P>This oneness in the Divine Trinity was not realized among the believers until the day of Pentecost when the consummated Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God, was poured out upon the believers. The Spirit is now mingled with all the believers, making all the believers one with the Triune God. Now on the earth there is in existence a reality called the oneness of the Spirit. The oneness of the Triune God is now realized among all the believers because the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God is now mingled with the Body of Christ. Paul specifically charged us that we should be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit (Eph. 4:3).</P><P>According to Ephesians 4, the oneness of the Spirit is composed of four factors, two means, and one goal. The four factors are the one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father of all (vv. 4-6). The one Body is the object. When this one Body, the object, is mingled with the Divine Trinity, that is, the one Spirit, the one Lord, and the one God and Father of all, there is the reality of the oneness of the Spirit. This oneness through the mingling of the consummated Spirit with the redeemed and regenerated ones is our possession.</P><P>This oneness is accomplished by two means: the means of faith and of baptism (v. 5). Through faith we are joined to Christ, who is our Head. Faith is our believing into Christ, bringing us into an organic union with Christ. Baptism is the termination of all the negative things. Baptism separates us from Adam, and faith joins us to Christ.</P><P>This brings us into a unique goal, that is, the one hope of our calling (v. 4). The goal of the oneness of the Spirit is the hope that one day all the believers as the Body of Christ will be brought into the divine glory of the Triune God (Col. 1:27). Our hope is not on the earth, nor is our hope to go to heaven. Our hope is to participate in the divine glory of the Triune God.</P><P>This is the oneness of the Spirit defined by the apostle Paul in Ephesians 4. We need this oneness to be in the realm where the Body of Christ can grow and be built up. Without this realm, the Body of Christ is mere terminology. That is why Paul charged us to keep the oneness of the Spirit with all diligence. We have this oneness in actuality, but we need to keep it in practicality.</P><P>Paul goes on to tell us that just to have the oneness of the Spirit in reality is not sufficient. Eventually, all the members of the Body should attain to the oneness of their common faith in Christ and of their common knowledge of the Son of God (Eph. 4:13). Merely to have the oneness of the Spirit is not sufficient for the building up of the Body of Christ. We need the oneness in practicality, that is, the oneness of our common faith in Christ.</P><P>The faith here refers to the objective faith, which is all the things we believe in for our salvation. The three main items of our faith are God Himself, the person of Christ, and the work of Christ. We believe in what God is, what Christ is, and what Christ has done. This is our faith. We believe in the Triune God Himself who is the unique God in the universe, the Creator of heaven and earth and all the things in them. We also believe in Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, the One who possesses both divinity and humanity. We also believe in all the work that Christ has done. We believe that He was incarnated, crucified, resurrected, ascended, and that one day He is coming back. All these are the items of our faith that cause us to be saved.</P><P>We need to be one in these items of our faith. Unfortunately, many Christians are more concerned with many minor items, such as head covering, how we should be baptized, or the miraculous gifts. But these are not items of our faith which bring us salvation and which cause us to be one. So not only do we have the reality of the oneness of the Spirit; we need to go on and grow up until we arrive at the oneness of our common faith in Christ. We should drop all the minor items that cause dissension. We need to come back to the unique faith that brings us salvation.</P><P>Not only so, Paul said that we need to arrive at the practical oneness of our common knowledge of the Son of God. Jesus Christ as the Son of God is all-inclusive and all-extensive, yet the knowing of this Christ by all the believers varies a great deal. Many Christians know Him only as the Savior, as the Lamb of God. But in the Lord's recovery, we know this Christ not only as the Savior, as the Lamb of God, but also as the all-inclusive One. He is the living bread (John 6:51), the living water (4:10, 14), the light of life (8:12), and the breath of life (20:22). In John 10 He is the door for the sheep to go in and out and the green pasture on which we feed (v. 9). Christ is so much to us, but because of the differences in the knowing of Christ among the believers, there is a lack of oneness. Thus, there is the need to grow, to go on, to arrive at the full knowledge of the Son of God. We want to know Christ in His all-inclusiveness and His all-extensiveness.</P><P>When we arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, we will not merely possess the oneness in reality, but we will be one practically. We need to be in this realm of oneness for the Body of Christ to grow and to be built up. As the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ is constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God through the dispensing of the Triune God and by the transfusing of the ascended Christ. Then after being formed, this Body of Christ is growing and is being built up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>As the Organism of the Triune God,<br>Being Also the Fullness, the Expression,<br>of the Consummated Triune God</H2><P>Eventually this Body of Christ becomes the fullness, the expression, of the consummated Triune God. Ephesians 3:19 says that we are eventually filled unto all the fullness of God. The fullness is the expression and the issue of the dispensing of all the riches of Christ. The husky Americans are the fullness, the expression, of all the riches of America. In the same way, the Body of Christ is the fullness, the expression, of the consummated Triune God as the issue, the result, of the riches of Christ constituted into all the members. Today our God has been consummated to be the all-inclusive Spirit. He is available to us for us to enjoy, for us to participate in. By enjoying His riches in Christ as the Spirit, we may become His fullness to express Him in this universe.</P><P>So at the end of Ephesians 3 Paul said, "To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever. Amen" (v. 21). Through the Body of Christ as the fullness of the processed Triune God, God can have an expression in the whole universe. The Triune God is fully expressed and fully represented through the Body of Christ as His organism.</P><P>5 brothers</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ONENESS VERSUS DIVISION</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Oneness:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The genuine oneness among the believers of Christ is of the Triune God; the real oneness originates from the Triune God; the three of the Divine Trinity are really one among Themselves.</li>	<li>At the last hour of His course on the earth, after He gave the word on the mysterious Divine Trinity dispensing and transfusing Himself into the believers in John 14&#151;16 right before His betrayal, the Lord prayed to the Father for the oneness among all His believers that it may merge with the genuine oneness of the Divine Trinity.</li>	<li>On another occasion the Lord charged us to be in harmony when two of us would pray together for anything.</li>	<li>The one hundred twenty were praying for ten days with one accord, and their prayer was answered in a marvelous way on the day of Pentecost.</li>	<li>At other times the apostles with the disciples praised God with one accord and God's response to them was marvelous, and the heart and soul of the multitude of believers were one.</li>	<li>The apostle charges us to keep the oneness of the Spirit and gives us a clear picture of how the oneness of the Body of Christ is constituted with the Divine Trinity&#151;the Father as the source, the Son as the element, and the Spirit as the essence of this inner constitution&#151;and of how the Body is the outward vessel to contain the reality of this constituted oneness between the processed Triune God and the transformed believers.</li>	<li>At other times the apostle also charges us to stand in one spirit and strive with one soul for the gospel, thinking the same one thing, having the same love, joined in one soul.</li>	<li>In conclusion, both the Lord's presence and God's blessing to the believers in the churches are based upon their oneness in the Spirit, their one accord among themselves, and their harmony in prayer, work, and love.

These verses show that the genuine oneness among the believers of Christ is of the Triune God. The Triune God is one. In John 14:8 Philip asked the Lord Jesus, "Show us the Father and it is sufficient for us." The Lord responded, "Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?" (vv. 9-10a). In these verses the Lord Jesus indicated that the Father and the Son are one (10:30). Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, "And the Lord is the Spirit." According to this verse, the Lord, that is, Christ, is the Spirit. This is confirmed by 1 Corinthians 15:45b: "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." The last Adam, of course, is the Lord Jesus in the flesh, and the life-giving Spirit is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit who gives life (John 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6). This indicates that the Son and the Spirit also are one. Thus, according to the clear revelation of the Scriptures, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;the three of the Divine Trinity&#151;are one.</P><P>In ourselves we do not have the genuine oneness. The genuine oneness is of the Triune God. How, then, can we enter into this oneness? In John 14:20 the Lord Jesus said, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you," and in John 14:23 He said, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him." In Galatians 3:27-28 the apostle Paul said that we were all baptized into Christ and we are all one in Christ Jesus. Therefore, in order to enter into the genuine oneness, we must open ourselves and receive Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, into us and also be baptized into Christ to enter into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19).</P><P>Not only so, the real oneness originates from the Triune God. In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed three times that the believers of Christ would be one even as the Triune God is one (vv. 11, 21, 22). The phrase "even as We are one" in verse 22 indicates that the real oneness originates from the Triune God. So, in order for us, the believers of Christ, to have the real oneness, we need to enter into the Triune God, who is the origin of the genuine oneness. This is indicated by the Lord's word "that they also may be in Us" in verse 21.</P><P>Ephesians 2:15 says that Christ created the Jews and the Gentiles in Himself into one new man, making peace. The Lord Jesus went to the cross to break down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, and create the two in Himself into one new man. It is in Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, that the Jews and the Gentiles can be one new man. This too shows that the real oneness originates from the Triune God.</P><P>The three of the Divine Trinity are really one among Themselves. In addition to the verses cited above, which show that the three of the Divine Trinity are one among Themselves essentially, there are many portions in the New Testament that reveal that the three of the Divine Trinity are one among Themselves economically in their coordination for the divine move and in our experience. For example, in John 14:10 the Lord Jesus said, "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works." According to this verse, the Son speaks the words, but the Father, who abides in the Son, does His works. Thus, whenever the Lord Jesus speaks, the Father works. Ephesians 1:3 tells us that the Father has blessed us with every spiritual blessing [blessing of the Spirit] in Christ [the Son], and verses 4-14 of the same chapter show us the Father's selection and predestination, the Son's redemption, and the Spirit's sealing and pledging for the dispensing of the Divine Trinity into the believers to produce the church, the Body of Christ. Then, in 3:14-19 the Father strengthens the believers through the Spirit into their inner man that Christ, the Son, may make His home in their hearts, that the believers may be filled unto all the fullness of the Divine Trinity. In 4:4-6 we see the one Spirit as the essence, the one Lord [the Son] as the element, and the one Father as the source of the one Body of Christ. Many other verses can be cited to show that the three of the Divine Trinity are really one among Themselves.</P><P>We need to pray that we may have a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see that the genuine oneness among the believers is not of the believers themselves, but is of the Triune God and originates from the Triune God. We also need to see the oneness among the three of the Divine Trinity. If we see this vision, it will control our Christian life. This vision of the genuine oneness will bring us into the reality of the Body of Christ, and there will be no divisions among us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Lord Jesus Praying to the Father<br>for the Oneness among All His Believers<br>That It May Merge with the Genuine<br>Oneness of the Divine Trinity</H2><P>At the last hour of His course on the earth, after He gave the word on the mysterious Divine Trinity dispensing and transfusing Himself into the believers in John 14&#151;16 right before His betrayal, the Lord prayed to the Father for the oneness among all His believers that it may merge with the genuine oneness of the Divine Trinity. In John 14 through 16, right before His betrayal, the Lord Jesus gave a word on the mysterious Divine Trinity dispensing and transfusing Himself into the believers. The Lord's word in chapter fourteen reveals that the Son is the embodiment and expression of the Father (vv. 7-11) and the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son (vv. 17-20). The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son as the Spirit is realized in the believers. When the Spirit enters into the believers, the Triune God&#151;the Father in the Son as the Spirit&#151;dispenses Himself into the believers to be their portion that they may enjoy Him as their everything in His Divine Trinity. The dispensing of the Triune God revealed in John 14 is for the producing of the church as the Body of Christ, which is the Father's house (v. 2), with the believers of Christ as the many members of the Body, the many abodes in the Father's house (v. 23).</P><P>In John 15 the Lord Jesus is the true vine, the Father is the husbandman, and the believers are the branches (vv. 1, 5). The Father as the husbandman is the source, the author, the planner, the planter, the life, the substance, the soil, the water, the air, the sunshine, and everything to the vine. The Son as the vine is the center of God's economy and the embodiment of all the riches of the Father. The Spirit of reality, sent by the Son and proceeding from and with the Father, testifies concerning the Son (v. 26). By abiding in the Son as the vine, the believers as the branches participate in the riches of the Father in the fellowship of the Spirit and love one another with the divine love to express the Father's divine life, that is, to glorify the Father, through fruit-bearing (vv. 4-17). Thus, the vine with its branches is the organism of the Triune God in His divine dispensing.</P><P>In chapter sixteen the Spirit of reality, the Comforter sent by the Son (v. 7), comes to convict the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment (vv. 8-11) and to guide the believers into all the reality, that is, to make all that the Son is and has real to the believers (vv. 13-15). All that the Father is and has is embodied in the Son (v. 15a; Col. 2:9), and all that the Son is and has is received by the Spirit and declared as reality to the believers (v. 14). This is the dispensing and infusing of all the reality of the Triune God into the believers of Christ. Through the dispensing and infusing of the mysterious Divine Trinity, the believers become the members of the Body of Christ and enter into an organic union with the Triune God to participate in the oneness of the Triune God.</P><P>After giving the word in John 14&#151;16, in John 17 the Lord prayed to the Father for the oneness among all His believers, that it may merge with the genuine oneness of the Divine Trinity. In verses 21-23 the Lord prayed, "That they [the believers] all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me." These verses show the merging of the oneness of the believers with the genuine oneness among the three of the Divine Trinity. The oneness among the three of the Divine Trinity is a model of the oneness of the believers in the Body of Christ, and the oneness of the believers in the Body of Christ is actually the enlargement of the oneness of the Divine Trinity. This oneness is first in the Father's name by the Father's divine life (vv. 2, 6, 11), then in the Triune God through sanctification by the reality of the Father's word (vv. 14-21), and ultimately in the divine glory for the expression of the processed Triune God who has mingled Himself with the believers through His divine dispensing (vv. 22-24). The first level of oneness is in the Father's name and life, delivering us from the natural realm. The second level of oneness is in the reality of the Father's sanctifying word, delivering us from the world. The third level of oneness is in the Father's glory, delivering us from ourselves and causing us to become fully one in the Triune God. This oneness, being the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with His redeemed and transformed believers, is the church as the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Lord Charging Us to Be in Harmony<br>When Two of Us Would Pray Together for Anything</H2><P>We all love the oneness, but we must realize that this oneness may be somewhat concealed in our spirit. This oneness must go a step further; it must be expressed. We need to apply the oneness. If we do not have the application, the oneness will be merely a doctrine and will remain hidden in our spirit. The world needs to see our oneness through our being in harmony and in one accord.</P><P>In Matthew 18:19 the Lord charged us to be in harmony when two of us would pray together for anything: "Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens." In this verse the Lord used the word harmony, which is sumphoneo in Greek, meaning "to be in harmony, or accord" and referring to the harmonious sound of musical instruments or voices. In the eyes of the world, the harmony among us should be like an orchestra playing a harmonious melody.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The One Hundred Twenty Were Praying<br>for Ten Days with One Accord</H2><P>In Acts 1:14 the one hundred twenty disciples prayed for ten days with one accord, and their prayer was answered in a marvelous way on the day of Pentecost. In this verse another Greek word, homothumadon, is used for "one accord." This word is from homo, meaning "same," and thumos, meaning "mind, will, purpose (soul, heart)." It denotes a harmony of inward feeling in one's entire being. The one accord is the expression and the application of the oneness. The harmony in Matthew 18:19 is the one accord in Acts 1:14. In Acts 1:14 one hundred twenty saints were praying in one accord. However, before that time they were not in one accord. Before the Lord's death the disciples contended with one another (Luke 22:24) and had no strength to pray (Matt. 26:40-45). But after the Lord's resurrection something happened to them. In the evening of the day of the Lord's resurrection, He came to the disciples and breathed into them the life-giving Spirit (John 20:22). This life-giving Spirit entered into the disciples essentially. This was the very dynamo that began to operate in them to bring them into one accord. Furthermore, the disciples were eyewitnesses of three marvelous things: Christ's crucifixion, Christ's resurrection, and Christ's ascension. This captured them to the uttermost. They forgot about all their own purposes and their own goals and came to pray in one accord to accomplish God's economy. After seeing these three things, they gave themselves for God's economy. How much we need to see these crucial things! That will cause us to lose heart for everything that entangles us and give ourselves to pray in one accord. The prayer in one accord was the base of God's move in the book of Acts. Eventually, God answered their prayer by the outpouring of the Spirit economically (Acts 2:2-4, 17). The Spirit was poured down due to their prayer in one accord. Through the outpouring of the Spirit the Jewish believers were baptized into one Body. This was all due to the prayer in one accord. This should impress us very much that the one accord among the saints is crucial for the carrying out of God's economy. The propagation of Christ in the book of Acts began with the one accord.</P><P>Through this one accord not only was the Spirit poured out, but also the word was given. On the day of Pentecost Peter, who had been cowardly before the Lord's crucifixion (Matt. 26:69-75) and had often spoken wrongly (Matt. 17:24-27; 26:35), boldly gave a clear word in which he explained the economical filling of the Spirit in a proper way (Acts 2:14-21), even quoting Joel 2:28-32. This also was due to the prayer in one accord and the Lord's answer. After his explanation Peter gave a very good message, and three thousand were saved (vv. 22-41). That increase came as a result of the prayer in one accord. According to verses 42-47, all the believers continued steadfastly with one accord in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers. In such a one accord they began to practice having everything in common. They were always together expressing their oneness by being in harmony and by being in one accord.</P><P>Today we may have the oneness, but we need to arrive at the one accord. If we want the blessing, if we want the Spirit to be poured out and the word to be given for the increase of the church, we must pray in one accord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>At Other Times the Apostles with the Disciples Praised God with One Accord</H2><P>At other times the apostles with the disciples praised God with one accord and God's response to them was marvelous, and the heart and soul of the multitude of the believers was one (Acts 4:23-32). After Peter and John were threatened by the Sanhedrin and charged not to speak in the name of Jesus, they returned to their own people and reported to them all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them. When they had heard this, the apostles with the disciples offered a wonderful praise and prayer to God in one accord (vv. 24-30). God's response to their prayer and praise was marvelous: "The place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness. And the heart and soul of the multitude of those who had believed was one" (vv. 31-32a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Apostle Charging Us to Keep<br>the Oneness of the Spirit and<br>Giving Us a Clear Picture of How<br>the Oneness of the Body of Christ<br>Is Constituted with the Divine Trinity</H2><P>In Ephesians 4:3-6 the apostle charged us to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit and gave us a clear picture of how the oneness of the Body of Christ is constituted with the Divine Trinity&#151;the Father as the source, the Son as the element, and the Spirit as the essence of this inner constitution&#151;and of how the Body is the outward vessel to contain the reality of this constituted oneness between the processed Triune God and the transformed believers.</P><P>In verse 3 the apostle charged us to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit. The oneness of the Spirit is actually the Spirit Himself. Without the Spirit, there is no oneness. If we keep the Spirit, we keep the oneness. The oneness of the Spirit is the oneness that is the Spirit. Not only so, the grammar of these verses shows us that this oneness includes the seven big items in verses 4 through 6: the one Body, the one Spirit, the one hope, the one Lord, the one faith, the one baptism, and the one God and Father of all.</P><P>When we consider these seven items we realize that the three of the Divine Trinity are here. They are all included in the oneness of the Spirit. This causes us to realize that the Spirit is not only the Third of the Divine Trinity, but the Spirit is the realization of the entire Divine Trinity. This Divine Trinity is the constitution of the oneness of the Body of Christ. The oneness of the Body has nothing to do with anything natural. This oneness is absolutely of the Triune God. The Spirit is the essence of this oneness.</P><P>In verses 4-6 the Spirit is mentioned first because the Spirit and the Body are intimately identified. Verse 4 says, "One Body and one Spirit." The Spirit is the life and the content of the one Body. Without the Spirit, the Body is empty. But the Body is not empty, because the one Spirit is within the Body. These two go together with the one hope of our calling. This is the hope that our physical body will be transfigured to be like the Lord's glorious body in His resurrection, as mentioned in Philippians 3:21, and also that we will be fully manifested as the sons of God, as covered in Romans 8:19, 23. This transfiguration and manifestation are not individual. They are placed here exactly with the one Body and the one Spirit. The transfiguration of our body and our manifestation as sons of God are not merely by the Spirit's working in us individually; they are the glorious result of the Spirit's working in the Body.</P><P>Verse 5 mentions the one Lord, who is the element of the oneness of the Body. In John's Gospel there is the Son for life. In Acts 2 the Son in ascension was made both Lord and Christ (v. 36). This is for authority. Then in Ephesians 1 this one Christ is given to be the Head over all things to the church, which is His Body (vv. 22-23). With this one Lord there is the one faith, the common faith shared by all Christians concerning Christ's person and work (Titus 1:4; 2 Pet. 1:1; Jude 3). When we receive this faith, we believe into the one Lord. We believe into Him not only for life but also for authority that we may be headed up. After believing into the Lord, we are baptized into Him and into His death (Rom. 6:3; Gal. 3:27). This terminates our connection with Adam. Hence, by faith and baptism we are transferred out of Adam and into Christ, thereby being joined to the Lord and becoming one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). This makes us all one in Him.</P><P>In verse 6 there is the one God and Father, the One who purposed in eternity. He is the Originator, the source, of the constitution of the oneness of the Body. This constitution with the Divine Trinity causes the Body to have three functions. First, the Body is the expansion of the oneness of the Triune God; second, the Body is the vessel to contain the reality of the constituted oneness; and, third, the Body is the expression of the oneness. In His death on the cross Christ was working to create in Himself one new man, which is the one Body (Eph. 2:14-16), and in Christ's resurrection the Father operated to make us all alive in the one regeneration (1 Pet. 1:3). Then, in the outpouring of the Spirit we were all baptized into the one Body (1 Cor. 12:13). By this threefold operation of the Divine Trinity He fully opened Himself up and brought all of us into Himself so that we could be in Him, that is, in His oneness. Thus, we as the Body are the expansion of the oneness of the Divine Trinity. We are also the vessel to contain the oneness. The Body is the place where the believers and the Triune God participate together in the oneness. The Body is also the expression of the genuine oneness. The oneness is divine, spiritual, and therefore mysterious. It is altogether invisible to the natural man. Yet in John 17 the Lord prayed that by our oneness the world would believe and know that the Father sent the Son (vv. 21, 23). This means that the Body is the expression of the oneness to the world.</P><P>It is a wonderful fact that we have the oneness of the Spirit. Yet practically the apostle urged us to be diligent to keep it. This keeping of the oneness of the Spirit is the foremost aspect of our Christian walk. In Ephesians 4:1 the apostle besought us to walk in a manner worthy of God's calling. All serious Christians are concerned about their Christian walk, yet not many realize that the centrality of the Christian walk is to keep the oneness of the Spirit. According to verse 2, we should keep this oneness with all lowliness and meekness. These two virtues are Christ Himself. In Matthew 11:29 the Lord Jesus said, "I am meek and lowly in heart." Through the process of transformation this very Christ who is meek and lowly is infused into our soul. Thus He becomes our meekness and our lowliness. When we have Him as these two virtues, we also are long-suffering. He becomes our ability to suffer long. When we have Him as the three virtues of lowliness, meekness, and long-suffering, the condition of our heart is proper. Then the love that God has already poured out in our heart (Rom. 5:5) is released to all the believers. No matter who they are and no matter what their condition is, the divine love will be released through our heart to bear them in love. This is the keeping of the oneness by the experience of Christ in transformation.</P><P>Not only so, we keep the oneness in the uniting bond of peace. This is the peace that Christ created on the cross (Eph. 2:15). On the cross He crucified the old man and abolished the ordinances brought in because of the fallen condition of the old man. These two, the old man and the ordinances, are the source of all the separating ways of living. They are the source of all the dividing opinions and different loves and thoughts. But they have been crucified, and thus we can keep the oneness of the Spirit by the experience of the cross. In this way we have the peace. The oneness of the Spirit is kept by us in transformation and in the experience of the cross. This oneness of the Spirit is the Divine Trinity processed and mingled with the resurrected humanity. This is the one Body constituted with the Father as the source, the Son as the element, and the Spirit as the essence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Apostle Also Charging Us to Stand<br>in One Spirit and Strive with One Soul<br>for the Gospel, Thinking the Same One Thing, Having the Same Love, Joined in One Soul</H2><P>The Triune God is absolutely one in Himself, that is, in His being. There is no possibility of any problem among the three of the Triune God. Also, spiritually speaking, there is no possibility of any problem in our spirit, because we are those who are regenerated. However, in our day-to-day practical experience in the church life we may have some problems. These problems are not in our spirit, but they are in our soul. Because of this, in Philippians 1:27 the apostle Paul besought the Philippian believers, "Only, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I may hear of the things concerning you, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together along with the faith of the gospel." Although the presence of the apostle may fluctuate, the Lord is with us all the time; His presence is continuous. Therefore, whether the apostle is present or not, our conduct should be the same. We should stand firm in one spirit. When the apostle heard of the believers' conduct, he wanted to hear that they were standing firm in their mingled human spirit.</P><P>In a sense, this is not difficult to do. However, the apostle also charged the believers to strive together with one soul. Many Christians say that they are standing in one spirit, yet they may say this in a way of "shaking hands over the fence." Our firm standing must be in our human spirit, yet we must also strive together with one soul. When we stand firmly in our mingled human spirit, our spirit has a way to control and direct our soul. In such a situation our soul does not govern our being, but our spirit governs our being. When our souls are under the direction of our spirit, we can be one to strive together like a team of athletes. Our being in one soul is an issue of the mingled spirit spreading out to transform our soul so that the oneness that is in our spirit even enters into our mind, emotion, and will. Our whole being is in the oneness because we are saturated with the Triune God. He is absolutely one, and His saturation makes us one in our soul. This produces a harmony that can be seen by men. This oneness and this harmony has a particular taste. It has the taste of God, because it is something that issues out of God's very being, out of God's very nature.</P><P>In 2:2 the apostle again besought the believers, "Make my joy full, that you think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing." The apostle's joy is made full when he sees that all the churches all over the world are practicing this kind of oneness, a oneness in which they are thinking the same thing, even the one thing. The Lord can accomplish His purpose for the satisfaction of His heart's desire only when we are thinking the same thing.</P><P>We also need to have the same love for all the saints. Again this involves our soul. We may feel that some of the saints in our locality are not lovable, but there is One within us who has the ability to love all the saints in the church with the same love, without any discrimination based on nationality, class, culture, personality, or language. Outside of Christ we do not have the ability to love all the saints with the same love. However, when the Christ who is in our spirit saturates our entire being, all the saints are lovely to us, and we can love them all with the same love.</P><P>We also need to be joined in soul, thinking the one thing. According to the context of Philippians, the one thing here must be the subjective knowledge and experience of Christ. In 4:2-3 two sisters, Euodias and Syntyche, were not thinking the same thing in the Lord. This means that they were not joined in soul. But the apostle Paul exhorted them specifically to be one. It is only by our pursuing the subjective experience of Christ and allowing Him to saturate our entire soul with the element of the Triune God that we can think the same thing and be joined in soul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Both the Lord's Presence and God's Blessing<br>to the Believers in the Churches Being<br>Based on Their Oneness in the Spirit,<br>Their One Accord among Themselves, and<br>Their Harmony in Prayer, Work, and Love</H2><P>In conclusion, both the Lord's presence and God's blessing to the believers in the churches are based on their oneness in Spirit, their one accord among themselves, and their harmony in prayer, work, and love. Psalm 133 shows us that God's peoples dwelling in unity is the base of God's anointing and of God's refreshing grace that they may participate in the God-commanded blessing of life forevermore.</P><P>Psalm 133 reads, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is/For brothers to dwell in unity!/It is like the fine oil upon the head/That ran down upon the beard,/Upon Aaron's beard,/That ran down to the hem of his garments;/Like the dew of Hermon/That came down upon the mountains of Zion. /For there Jehovah commanded the blessing:/Life forever." The unity spoken of in verse 1 is a picture of the New Testament oneness. This unity is like the fine oil as the anointing ointment that was put upon the head of the high priest (Exo. 30:23-25, 30). In the Old Testament Aaron is a type of Christ, our High Priest today, and the oil poured on his head is a type of the anointing Spirit in the New Testament (Luke 4:18). In the Old Testament type the anointing oil ran down upon Aaron's beard and eventually reached the hem of his priestly garments. This anointing oil ran down not quickly but slowly, saturating and permeating as it went, all the way to the extremity of his being. This shows that not only the head but also the entire body of the high priest was anointed. This is a marvelous picture of the anointing Spirit upon Christ, the High Priest as the Head, and the church as the Body (2 Cor. 1:21; Heb. 1:9). The base of such an anointing is the oneness of God's people.</P><P>The oneness of God's people is also like the dew of Hermon that came down upon the mountains of Zion. The dew here signifies God's refreshing grace. This refreshing grace is actually the Triune God dispensed into us for our enjoyment. The base for such an enjoyment is the oneness of the church.</P><P>God's anointing and God's refreshing grace bring in the God-commanded blessing of life forevermore. This is the blessing of the Triune God as our eternal life in the church life today, in the kingdom in the coming age, and in the New Jerusalem in eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSUS DIVISION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Divisions (Sects) Being of the Flesh</H2><P>The source of division begins with the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Our forefather Adam was seduced by Satan to eat from that tree (Gen. 3:1-6). As a result, the element of sin was injected into his body. When the element of sin entered into man, man began to live according to his fallen flesh and eventually became flesh (6:3). At Babel the one mankind created by God rebelled against God and became divided into different nations (11:1-9). Adam ate from the tree of knowledge, and the result was that man became flesh. Ultimately, this flesh brought in division among mankind. Galatians 5:20 lists divisions among the works of the flesh. Therefore, divisions are of the flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Divisions Being Not Only of the Flesh<br>but Also according to the Manner of Man</H2><P>Divisions are not only of the flesh but also according to the manner of man. In 1 Corinthians 3:3, in dealing with the problem of divisions among the Corinthians, the apostle Paul told the Corinthian believers that they were still fleshly and were walking according to the manner of man. Since every fallen man is just the flesh (Rom. 3:20; Gal. 2:16), the manner of man is to be according to the flesh. Man's living, man's expression, is just an expression of the flesh. Whatever man lives is just his fallen flesh. To be according to the flesh is to walk not according to God but according to the manner of man. The result of such a walk is division.</P><P>Wherever division exists, the works of the flesh are manifested. According to Galatians 5:19-21 these works include enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, divisions, and sects (schools of opinion). If we are involved with division, we will be visited by all these kinds of things. In the recent turmoil in the Lord's recovery, many of these things were manifested by the divisive ones. Some brothers were filled with anger and hatred toward their fellow members in the Body. This was the living out of the flesh. Ultimately, these manifestations of the flesh issued in division.</P><P>The way to be kept from division is to receive the Triune God as the tree of life. This will preserve us in oneness. We also need to be on guard to reject all kinds of division. We need to see that God has made a great provision for the flesh, and that is the cross. The cross deals with the flesh of man. One of the ingredients in the all-inclusive, compound, and consummated Spirit is the effectiveness of the cross. A picture in the Old Testament of the cross's dealing with the flesh is circumcision. Circumcision is the cutting away of the flesh. The cross is the reality of circumcision (Col. 2:11). In order to experience this reality, we need to exercise to be fully in the mingled spirit so that the flesh will be cut off (Rom. 8:13; Gal. 5:24). When the flesh is dealt with through the cross, all the germs of division are killed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Divisions Damage Christ<br>as the Unique One and His Body</H2><P>Divisions damage Christ as the unique One and His Body. In 1 Corinthians 1:10-13 Paul besought the Corinthians in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that there be no divisions among them. All the believers of Christ have been baptized into the name of Christ (Acts 19:5), that is, into the person of Christ (Rom. 6:3). Hence, Christ's name should be the unique name among all His believers, and Christ Himself should be the unique person in His Body. In verse 13 Paul said that this unique Christ is not divided. Since Christ is unique and is not divided, the church as the Body of Christ also is unique and should not be divided. In making divisions the divisive ones always take a name other than the unique name of Christ. Furthermore, they divide Christ's Body, which is actually to divide Christ Himself, because the Body of Christ is Christ (12:12). Therefore, such division is surely a damage to Christ as the unique One and to the church as His Body. In order to keep the oneness in the Lord and to avoid divisions, we need to uplift and exalt the unique name of our Lord by dropping all names other than this highest name. We also need to take the unique and undivided Christ as our unique center so that all the divisions may be terminated.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Corinthian Believers Being Divided<br>While They Were Still Meeting Together<br>to Take the Lord's Supper</H2><P>The Corinthian believers were divided while they were still meeting together to take the Lord's supper not for the better but for the worse; thus, the apostle would not consider that they came together to eat the Lord's supper (1 Cor. 11:17-20). Although divisions existed among the Corinthians (v. 18), they still met together to have the Lord's supper (v. 20). However, Paul's word in verse 20 indicates that he would not consider that their coming together was to eat the Lord's supper. Furthermore, his word in verse 17 indicates that, because the Corinthians were meeting for the Lord's supper in a situation of division, their meeting was not for the better but for the worse. When divisive ones come together to take the Lord's table, it is not for the better, not for profit, but for the worse, for loss. The divisive Corinthians were eating the bread and drinking the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner (v. 27), not discerning the Lord's body (v. 29), that is, not discerning whether the bread on the table signified the physical body of Christ, which He gave for us on the cross, and also the mystical Body of Christ, which is composed of all the believers in the universe. Because of this, those who participated unworthily in the Lord's supper came under the discipline, the temporary judgment, of the Lord (vv. 30-32). From this we can see that division among the believers is a serious matter, and we should not partake of the bread of the Lord's table in any division or with any divisive spirit. We should not take any divisive bread, but we should take only the bread of oneness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>There Being No Reason and No Excuse for Any Kind of Division and No Justification for It</H2><P>There is no reason, no excuse, and no justification for any kind of division in the Body of Christ. Regardless of what the reason is for division, that is not a legitimate reason in the eyes of God. No division is legitimate, and no division is justified, regardless of how strong our reason is. All problems in the church can and should be solved through proper and adequate fellowship by praying together sincerely and thoroughly (Acts 15:1-31). The proper prayer and fellowship without pride and self-interest, under the light of the pure word of the Scriptures, will solve every problem among us and preserve us in oneness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Apostle Charging Us to Turn Away<br>from Those Who Make Divisions and<br>to Refuse a Sectarian Man</H2><P>In Romans 16:17 the apostle charged us to turn away from those who make divisions, and in Titus 3:10 he charged us to refuse a sectarian man, after a first and second admonition. According to Romans 14:1&#151;15:13, we need to receive all genuine believers, regardless of their different views concerning doctrine and outward practices. However, we cannot tolerate any kind of division, because division is an insult to the person of the Triune God and a violation of the constitution of the Body of Christ and the practice of the Body life. According to the clear and definite word of the apostle Paul in Romans 16:17 and Titus 3:10, we need to turn away from those who purposely make divisions, and we also need to refuse those whose purpose in contacting others is to cause division. This is according to the practice of the quarantining of lepers in the Old Testament typology (Lev. 13:45-46; Num. 12:10-15). Because leprosy is very contagious, a leper was put aside temporarily for the profit of the whole congregation of Israel. If a person is sick with a highly contagious disease, he should be quarantined, separated even from his family members, until he is healed. In like manner, if anyone is spiritually sick of the disease of division, having become a divisive person, he must be quarantined. This will protect the entire church from the contagious germs of division, and the church will be safeguarded in oneness.</P><P>6 brothers</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rev. 1:2, 9;

THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS BEING THE SPIRIT<br>OF THE PROPHECY IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION</H2><P>The testimony of Jesus is the spirit&#151;the reality, the substance, the disposition, and the characteristic&#151;of the prophecy in the book of Revelation (Rev. 19:10b). The entire book of Revelation is a prophecy of Jesus, and the reality of this prophecy is the testimony of Jesus. This reality is the spirit. This is like saying that the orange juice is the spirit of the orange. We may also say that the spirit, the reality, of the entire Bible is the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>Revelation has twenty-two chapters. When I was with the Brethren teachers, they spoke much about the prophecies in this book with the two beasts (13:1, 11), seven heads, and ten horns (17:3). They studied the name of Antichrist and the number six hundred sixty-six (13:18). They thought that this was the spirit of the book of Revelation. These things are in the book of Revelation, but they are not the spirit, the reality, the substance, disposition, and characteristic of this book. The spirit of this book is the testimony of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS<br>BEARS TWO DENOTATIONS</H2><P>The phrase the testimony of Jesus bears two denotations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Subjective Denotation&#151;the Testimony<br>by Jesus concerning God</H2><P>First, the testimony of Jesus bears a subjective denotation. This is the testimony by Jesus concerning God (Rev. 1:2; 22:16, 20a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. As the True and Faithful Witness of God</H2><P>This book of Revelation says Jesus is the true and faithful Witness of God (Rev. 1:5a; 3:14b). In His life, His living, and His person, Jesus was absolutely God's Witness, testifying God. His testifying of God is His testimony concerning God. Who is God? What kind of God is He? Nothing in this whole universe can testify for God except a person by the name of Jesus Christ, the God-man, the embodiment of the Godhead (Col. 2:9). This One, as the unique true and faithful Witness, testifies for God. This testifying is the testimony of Jesus in the subjective sense. As the true and faithful Witness of God, He bears testimony concerning God in what God is, in what God did, and in what God would do (John 5:19; 6:38; 7:16, 18). This is the subjective testimony Jesus bears concerning God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. As the Embodiment of God to Express God</H2><P>As the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9) to express God, Christ manifested God's attributes in His human virtues (1 Tim. 3:16). The four Gospels show us that He was a person always loving people and sympathizing with people. These are His human virtues, yet these human virtues are the expression of the divine attributes of God. Within God they are the divine attributes; but when these divine attributes were expressed through Christ, they became the human virtues of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. An Objective Denotation&#151;the Testimony<br>by the Believers with the Church<br>concerning Christ</H2><P>The objective denotation of the testimony of Jesus is the testimony by the believers with the church concerning Christ (Rev. 1:9; 12:17; 19:10a, b; 20:4). Actually this is one testimony in two sections. In the first section it was the testimony by Jesus for God. In the second section it is the testimony by us, the believers and the churches, for Christ. Jesus testified already, but His testimony did not stop. His testimony is continued by us. We are the continuation of Jesus' testimony. Jesus testified for God and we continue Him to testify for God through our testifying for Him. When we testify for Jesus, this means that we testify for God.</P><P>His testimony and our testimony actually are one. With Him it is subjective; with us testifying for Him, it is objective. These two aspects are one testimony. Jesus bore the testimony for God, and today we bear the testimony for Christ. To testify for Christ is to testify for God. These two denotations, objective and subjective, are expressed by the one phrase the testimony of Jesus. The testimony of Jesus refers to Jesus' testimony for God and our testimony for Jesus unto God. The entire book of Revelation reveals the testimony of Jesus. To testify for Jesus is to testify for God, because Jesus and God are one. Jesus is the embodiment of God. Actually, He is the very God. This indicates that in the whole universe there is only one kind of testimony. This is the testimony for God, first by Jesus and then by us.</P><P>The entire book of Revelation, like the entire Bible, is a book of testimony. The entire Bible testifies concerning God first by Christ and then by us. We are Christ's continuation. Hymns, #203 says that we are Christ's reproduction, multiplication, duplication, and continuation. A person's body is a continuation of his head. The body and the head are not two persons, but one person. Our body is the head's continuation. In the same way, Christ's Body is the continuation of Him as the Head. The Head and the Body both bear the same testimony for God. With the Head it is subjective. With the Body it is objective.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE TESTIMONY OF THE BELIEVERS<br>WITH THE CHURCH BY THEIR LIVING</H2><P>Now we want to see the objective testimony of the believers with the church by their living.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Concerning Jesus' Person&#151;God and Man</H2><P>This living testimony concerns Jesus' person. He is the God-man (Phil. 2:6-7). He is not only God but also man. In the whole universe, the real God is Christ, and the real man is Christ. He is the complete God and the perfect man. In yourself you are a low man. In Christ you are a high man. In ourselves, we are living in the "basement," but in Christ we are living on the "top floor." When we live in Christ, we are uplifted to be the highest men. We need to live in Christ, the God-man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Concerning Jesus' Life&#151;Two Lives Living Together</H2><P>The testimony of the believers with the church by their living is concerning Jesus' life&#151;two lives living together: the divine life as the inward reality and the human life as the outward expression (1 Tim. 3:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Concerning Jesus' Living</H2><P>We have a life within and a living without. Christ had a life, and then He lived that life. That was His living.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Living a Crucified Life in Resurrection</H2><P>Jesus lived a crucified life in resurrection (Phil. 2:8; Acts 2:23-24). Even before He was actually crucified and resurrected, He lived such a life. Today we also need to allow Christ to live a crucified life in resurrection within us and through us. Paul said in Galatians 2:20a, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." To live such a life by ourselves is impossible. We have to live a crucified life in the resurrection of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. With the Divine Attributes Expressed<br>in the Human Virtues</H2><P>Our living a crucified life in resurrection is with the divine attributes expressed in the human virtues (Acts 10:38).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Concerning Jesus' Work</H2><P>The testimony of the believers with the church by their living is concerning Jesus' work through His redeeming and life-releasing death (John 19:34; 12:24) and through His life-imparting and church-producing resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45; 1 Pet. 1:3). It is also through His ascension to be made Lord, Christ, Ruler, and Savior (Acts 2:36; 5:31) to carry out His heavenly, church-building ministry (Heb. 8:1-2; Eph. 2:22). Finally, it is through His second coming to establish the eternal kingdom of God (Dan. 7:13-14; Rev. 11:15) and to reign in the millennial kingdom (Rev. 20:4, 6). All these are the details of Jesus' work. We should be the testimony of such a wonderful person in His work.</P><P>Our living should be a testimony concerning Jesus' person as the God-man, and concerning Jesus' life with two lives living together: the divine and the human. Our living should also be a testimony concerning Jesus' living a life of crucifixion in resurrection and concerning Jesus' work. We have to live a life to testify concerning Jesus. That means we have to live a life just like He did. He lived a life to testify concerning God. Now we live a life to testify concerning Jesus unto God. When we testify concerning Jesus, that means we testify concerning God. Thus, we are the continuation of Jesus. He and we are one great person testifying concerning God. With Him this testimony is subjective. With us this testimony is objective.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. AS THE GOD-REDEEMED-REGENERATED-<br>TRANSFORMED-GLORIFIED PEOPLE,<br>SIGNIFIED BY THE FOLLOWING SIGNS</H2><P>As the God-redeemed-regenerated-transformed-glorified people, we testify for Jesus. This testimony of Jesus is signified by a number of signs in the book of Revelation. The seven lampstands, the man-child, the firstfruits, the bride, and the New Jerusalem are clear signs with spiritual significance. We may also say that the overcomers within the churches and the late overcomers are signs. This is because the book of Revelation is a whole book of signs. </P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Golden Lampstands</H2><P>The golden lampstands, as a sign of the churches, signify that the churches as the counterpart of Christ are a testimony to Jesus for the Triune God (Rev. 1:12-13, 20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. By the Gold</H2><P>The testimony of the lampstands is by the gold, signifying the Father's nature as the divine substance of the churches. All the seven lampstands are of pure gold. Gold in typology signifies God in His nature. This shows that all the churches are of God's nature. They are divine.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. By the Shape</H2><P>The shape of the lampstands signifies the embodied form of Christ the Son as the manifestation of the churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. By the Shining</H2><P>The shining of the seven lamps of the lampstands signifies the Spirit's expression as the bright testimony of the church to Christ for God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Overcomers within the Churches</H2><P>The overcomers within the churches signify the overcoming part of the churches (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). In order to be a proper Christian today, you have to overcome all the distractions and also the degradation of today's Christianity. Furthermore, you have to overcome the satanic world system, spiritual deadness, and spiritual lukewarmness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Man-child Born of the Universal Woman</H2><P>The man-child born of the universal woman is a great sign in the book of Revelation (Rev. 12:1-2, 5). He signifies the resurrected ones of the earlier overcomers, including all those of the Old Testament age. Many of the overcomers of the Old Testament age were martyred. The first overcomer was Abel, who was martyred by his brother Cain. Even Isaiah was martyred. Of course, some were not martyred, but they also died. All of these dead Old Testament overcomers along with the additional overcomers who die before the great tribulation will be a part of the man-child raptured to the throne of God (Rev. 12:5). These overcomers have overcome the devil, Satan, the adversary of God and the accuser of God's children (v. 11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Firstfruits to God and to the Lamb</H2><P>The firstfruits to God and to the Lamb testify concerning Christ for God (Rev. 14:1-5). They signify the living ones of the earlier overcomers in the New Testament age. They follow Christ as the Lamb of God wherever He goes, and they will be raptured before the great tribulation to Mount Zion in the heavens. They are a sign of the living and existing overcomers before the great tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Late Overcomers</H2><P>The late overcomers signify the rest of the believers of all the churches (Rev. 12:17; 15:2). The late overcomers overcome the persecution of Antichrist in the great tribulation, the last three and a half years of the church age. They are martyred for the testimony of Jesus which they bear for God. After the rapture of the dead overcomers with the living overcomers, there will still be many believers left on earth who are not yet matured. They will remain to live in the great tribulation. Many of them will be martyred under the persecution of Antichrist and then resurrected with Christ to reign in the millennium (Rev. 20:4).</P><P>On the one hand, to get matured today is easier. If you wait to pass through the tribulation, you will have to be martyred to be an overcomer. On the other hand, it is often easier to overcome in great and difficult things than it is to overcome in smaller and easier things. Many so-called good, spiritual, heavenly sisters have the habit of looking at the newspaper Saturday morning for sales so that they can go shopping. They may realize within that this is not of the Lord and that they do not need what they are going to buy, but they still go shopping anyway. This is a small thing that is seemingly easy to overcome, but most of the time they are defeated in this matter.</P><P>But when the Antichrist is ruling during the great tribulation, he will threaten people with death if they do not worship him. In a sense, such a great thing could be easier for us to overcome. If you refuse to worship him, you will be martyred immediately. You will not have the time to consider as you do when you are about to go shopping for things on sale. Whatever the case, though, we all have to overcome so that we can be matured.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Bride of the Lamb</H2><P>The bride of the Lamb signifies the totality of all the overcomers throughout the ages (Rev. 19:7-9). All the overcomers will be a corporate wife married to Christ, and they will become His army. They will return with Christ to defeat Antichrist and his army at Armageddon as a close to the wars of the ages before the millennium (vv. 11-21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The New Jerusalem</H2><P>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummated sign in the Scriptures (Rev. 21:1-3). It signifies the dwelling (the tabernacle and the temple) of God and the wife of the Lamb, as the ultimate consummation of all the matured elect of God to manifest and express the consummated Triune God and to show God's infinite grace and wisdom for eternity as an eternal testimony of Jesus for God.</P><P>The testimony of the seven above-mentioned signs is the testimony for Jesus by God's redeemed people. It is in addition to the testimony by Jesus for God. The two aspects of the testimony of Jesus are the total testimony for God by Jesus and by God's chosen and matured people. This total testimony is the spirit of the prophecy not only in the book of Revelation but also in the entire holy Scriptures.</P><P>W.L.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SPEAKING BY VARIOUS BROTHERS<br>CONCERNING THE GOD-REDEEMED-REGENERATED-<br>TRANSFORMED-GLORIFIED PEOPLE,<br>SIGNIFIED BY THE FOLLOWING SIGNS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Golden Lampstands</H2><P>I really appreciate this phrase the testimony of Jesus. In order to really see and be the testimony of Jesus, we need these signs in the book of Revelation. The first sign is that of the golden lampstands, which signify the local churches.</P><P>Revelation 1:9 says that John was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and because of the testimony of Jesus. He was in his spirit in order to see the vision of the testimony of Jesus made known by the signs (v. 10). He heard a voice behind him saying, "What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches" (v. 11). These seven churches were named as seven cities. John then turned to see the voice that spoke with him and being turned he saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the lampstands he saw one like the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to His feet and girded at the breast with a golden girdle (vv. 12-13).</P><P>All the churches in the Lord's recovery in God's eyes are golden lampstands. The lampstands are all identical. They are full of the golden One, which is God Himself whom we love with all of our heart. The lampstands are there to stand and to shine. The Lord wants such a testimony of Jesus. We are in the churches, in the lampstands, living Jesus, testifying of Jesus by our living.</P><P>The golden lampstands express the processed Triune God. This expression of the processed Triune God is first in the Father's substance. The gold as the substance of the stand signifies the Father's divine nature. Thus, every local church must be constituted with the Father's divine nature. For the sake of testifying Jesus unto God, we must be constituted with the Father's divine nature. The testimony of Jesus as the lampstands expressing the processed Triune God is also in the form of the Son, which is the embodied form of Christ as the shape of the stands. Finally, the testimony of Jesus expressing the processed Triune God as the lampstands is in the Spirit's expression. This is for the bright expression and the shining of the lampstands.</P><P>Thus, the lampstands have three very crucial aspects: 1) the gold as the substance; 2) the stand itself with its form; and 3) the lamps with the shining. These three crucial aspects help us to understand what the Lord means when He reveals that the churches are golden lampstands to express the processed Triune God.</P><P>We need to realize that if the Triune God had not been processed, He could not have an expression on this earth. About two thousand years ago, the Triune God became flesh (John 1:14). Hymns, #1017 says, "Christ has put on human nature and become a man like me,/He has died upon the cross that I from Adam might be free,/He has risen and as Spirit He has come to live in me/That He might be my life." After Christ comes into us as life, He begins to spread in us for His expression. Glory is God expressed.</P><P>Christ had to be processed. When He was incarnated as the embodiment of God, He became the first lampstand. Jesus Himself, the living person, was the first lampstand constituted with the Father Himself as the golden One. He was the embodiment of God so He had the form. No man had ever seen God, but the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father declared Him (John 1:18). In Him all the fullness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell bodily (Col. 2:9; 1:19). As the reality of the lampstand, Jesus also lived in the Spirit, by the Spirit, with the Spirit, and through the Spirit to express God in everything of His living. His doing, His speaking, and everything about Him was a testimony to God. This is the subjective testimony of Jesus.</P><P>Thank the Lord that His process did not end with incarnation but continued. He died on the cross to terminate all the negative things, and then He was raised from the dead. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) in order to impart Himself into all of His believers to make them the very enlargement of Himself. The seven golden lampstands as the testimony of Jesus are the reproduction, the duplication, and the continuation of Jesus. They are the multiplication of the embodiment of the Triune God.</P><P>Jesus as the first lampstand was the testimony of God and the embodiment of the Triune God. Now He has been processed through death and resurrection to be the wonderful life-giving Spirit. He is in us as life. This life is everything that we need to be the very expression of the processed Triune God. This wonderful life, this life-giving Spirit, includes the substance of the Father's nature. Christ as the very embodiment of God is now the life-giving Spirit indwelling us to be formed in us. Also, this wonderful Spirit is the shining, enlivening, reviving, life-giving, and enlightening One to make us the bright and shining testimony of Jesus. If the Triune God had never been processed, there could never be such an expression. Hallelujah for Jesus as the first lampstand! Hallelujah for the local churches as the reproduction and multiplication of Jesus!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Overcomers within the Churches</H2><P>Now we need to see the overcomers within the churches (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). If we want to be overcomers within the churches, we need to overcome four "isms": Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Brethrenism (Rev. 2:9, 20; 3:1-2, 15-17). These "isms" are part of a big religious system organized by Satan, out of which the Lord's children need to come (Rev. 18:4).</P><P>During the Lord's time on earth and during the time of the early apostles, Judaism was strongly opposing God's testimony. Those in Judaism opposed the Lord Jesus (Matt. 12:9-14; Luke 4:28-29; John 9:22). They also opposed the apostle Paul (Acts 13:45-46, 50; 14:1-2, 19; 17:1, 5-6). In Revelation 2:9b the Lord refers to "the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan." This verse reveals that Judaism is satanic in opposing the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>We also need to overcome Catholicism. The church in Thyatira signifies this apostate church. Catholicism is portrayed as the woman Jezebel who calls herself a prophetess, teaching and leading the people of God, even with "the deep things of Satan" (Rev. 2:20, 24). Within the Catholic Church are demonic things. This is not according to our word but according to the Lord's word in Revelation. The Lord has made clear to us that there is a system organized by Satan against His testimony.</P><P>Protestantism is seen mainly with the church in Sardis. Those in Sardis have a name that they are living when they are actually dead (Rev. 3:1-2). This shows that Protestantism is devoid of Christ as the living One and is hence Christless. Brethrenism is seen mainly with the church in Laodicea where the Lord is standing outside the door of the degraded church and knocking at her door (v. 20). This situation is characterized by lukewarmness (v. 16). In order to be the testimony of Jesus today, we need to overcome these "isms." We need to overcome the system of Satan which opposes the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>This system causes us to be affected in our love for the Lord. The very first thing that happens to the church in its degradation is the loss of Christ as the first love (Rev. 2:4). All the degradation comes in through the loss of the first love. In Ephesians 6:24 Paul said, "Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility." When we love the Lord in all the incorruptible things, we are saved from corruption. But as soon as we get led away from that love, corruption starts to come in.</P><P>We need to love the Lord. Everything we do in our Christian life should be motivated by our love for the Lord. It is a serious thing to lose that love, because the Lord warned the church in Ephesus, the church which had left the first love, that if they did not repent, He would remove the lampstand (Rev. 2:5). To remove the lampstand means that they have stopped being the testimony of Jesus. We do not want to lose our testimony.</P><P>The next thing we need to overcome is worldliness. The church in Pergamos shows us the church which is married to the world (vv. 12-15). The Lord said that they dwelt where Satan's throne was. Satan's throne is in the world. Through the marriage with the world, Satan's throne came into the church. To get involved with anything of the world is to be under Satan's throne.</P><P>This degraded church had the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans. These teachings are a direct attack against Christ as the Head and against the functioning of the members of Christ's Body, so we want to overcome these teachings. We want to be the overcomers in the churches to overcome worldliness. Antipas was a faithful witness of the Lord among those in Pergamos. His name means against all. He stood against all the worldliness and died as a testimony to the Lord.</P><P>The next thing we need to overcome is deadness (Rev. 3:1-2). Sardis had a name that they were living, but they were dead. In the Old Testament, death is more defiling before God than sin (Lev. 11:24-25; Num. 6:6-7, 9). For us to sit in a meeting and be dead is a major offense to God. Death is a very serious thing in the eyes of God, so we should not tolerate any deadness in the church.</P><P>We also need to overcome lukewarmness (Rev. 3:15-17). We should pray, "O Lord, make us burning." The degraded recovered church thought that they were rich and had need of nothing, because they had so many rich teachings and doctrines. But they did not know that they were wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked. The Lord counseled these ones to buy from Him gold, white garments, and eyesalve (v. 18). This shows that we need to pay the price to overcome lukewarmness so that we can be burning. Eventually, these burning overcomers maintain the testimony of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Man-child Born of the Universal Woman</H2><P>Revelation 12 shows us the sign of the man-child born of the universal woman&#151;the universal church (vv. 1-2, 5). Verse 1 shows a great sign of a woman clothed with the sun, standing on the moon, and having a crown of twelve stars on her head. This woman shows forth all the light sources in the universe: the sun, the moon, and the stars. This is a beautiful, brilliant, shining, marvelous woman, but she is only a part of this picture because she is laboring to bring forth something. She travails in birth to bring forth a man-child. This man-child is the stronger part of the woman.</P><P>That universal woman is composed of the sun, signifying the New Testament believers, the moon, signifying the Old Testament believers, and the twelve stars, signifying the patriarchs before the law was given. This depicts the totality of all God's people throughout all the ages.</P><P>All these people have been struggling and travailing like a woman in pain to bring forth something. Revelation 12:2 says, "And she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth." Verse 2 indicates that this universal woman has a focus and direction to bring forth a man-child. We need to pray, "Lord, we want to be within that focus and direction." It is not enough to be a part of the universal woman. Within her is a stronger part. That stronger part is the part that overcomes to bear the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>Verse 5 says that she brings forth a man-child who is about to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod. This indicates that the man-child consists of the overcomers, as mentioned in 2:26-27. Throughout all the ages, beginning with the patriarchs through the Old Testament age and the New Testament age, there has been a stronger part of God's people bearing the testimony of Jesus and fighting for God's economy. This is the part we must be. We want to be constituted to be the stronger part of this woman for the advancement of God's economy to bear the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>The ones who compose the man-child are those who overcome the great dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the devil, Satan, the accuser of God's children. Immediately after the woman delivered this man-child, he was caught up to God and to His throne. The heavens are waiting for the man-child. The man-child is needed to complete the execution of God's judgment on Satan.</P><P>The ones who compose the man-child have been absolute in fighting for the Lord. Their interest is the Lord's interest. They are the ones who pray, "Lord, You must get through. We are not going to tolerate things the way they are. Lord, if we're dead, we've got to be living. Lord, if we're indifferent, we've got to be desperate." The overcomers do not sit back and wait for something. They take the initiative to carry out the things that God in His economy has appropriated for them. They do not compromise with the devil in any point of their life.</P><P>When they are caught up to the heavens, war breaks out. Verse 7 says that there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels went to war with the dragon and his angels. The presence of the overcomers as the man-child gives Michael the ground to execute the judgment upon Satan accomplished by the Lord on the cross. When we go somewhere, we should be those who give the ground to the Lord to execute His judgment for the furtherance of His economy to carry out His judgment upon Satan. Verses 8 and 9 say that Satan, the great dragon, the ancient serpent, the devil, the accuser of God's children, was cast down out of heaven due to the overcomers as the executors of God's economy.</P><P>Verse 11 says that they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life unto death. These are the principles of the overcomers in the man-child. This is the way they maintain their vitality.</P><P>Any time you stand up for God's eternal economy, the enemy Satan will rise up to accuse you. He wants to drain the spiritual energy in your being by accusations, whether they are founded or not, to put a hole in your conscience. But it is good to see that the overcomers have learned how to use the blood. This is not only the redeeming blood but also the blood that speaks better things for us (Heb. 12:24). We can apply the blood to maintain our vitality. As Satan is accusing us before the Lord, we can apply the blood. We overcome by the blood of Christ because that blood speaks for us and protects us from all Satan's false accusations against us before God.</P><P>The overcomers also have the word of their testimony. We have to learn how to testify according to what the Lord has accomplished. Specifically, we should testify that the devil has been judged by the Lord. When Satan accuses us, we need to testify. We should say, "Satan, you're a liar. You have been dealt with on the cross. Jesus is Lord!" In this way we maintain the vitality and strength in our spiritual being so we can continue to further God's economy.</P><P>Finally, the overcomers of the man-child love not their soul-life even unto death. Because of Adam's fall, Satan joined himself to man's soul-life, man's self (Matt. 16:23-24). Hence, to overcome Satan we must not love our soul-life. The overcomers have learned to hate and deny their soul-life (Luke 14:26; 9:23). We have to deny our soul-life even unto death. With such people God's economy has a way to be carried out. With them there is a way for God to execute judgment upon Satan. Those in the man-child overcome the enemy by the blood of the Lamb, by the word of their testimony, and by not loving their soul-life unto death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Firstfruits to God and to the Lamb</H2><P>The next sign signifying the testimony of Jesus is the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb (Rev. 14:1-5). The Bible shows us that God is like a farmer growing a crop. We as His people are the crop that He is growing. Matthew 13 says that the Lord was a sower who went forth to sow Himself as the word of God into our being (vv. 3, 19-23). In the Epistles we see that all the believers are in a stage of growing. Paul told the Corinthians that they were God's farm, His cultivated land (1 Cor. 3:9). We are here growing on God's farm.</P><P>Eventually, in Revelation 14 there is a reaping of the crop that God has planted. But that reaping is in two stages, two parts. In the first part of Revelation 14, the believers who are the firstfruits are harvested and are standing with the Lamb on Mount Zion (vv. 1-5). Then later in the chapter we see a reaping of the majority of the believers (vv. 14-16). In this way God's whole crop gets harvested.</P><P>The firstfruits are the ones in God's crop who mature earlier. They grow and ripen first. Because they ripen first, God is able to harvest them as the firstfruits for His enjoyment. We surely desire to be harvested for God's enjoyment. The majority of the believers will be harvested at the end of the great tribulation, but the firstfruits are reaped to God's house for His satisfaction before the great tribulation.</P><P>God not only has an enemy that needs to be dealt with by the man-child; He also has a desire to be satisfied. If you ever planted anything and watched it grow, you know there is an anticipation for the day you can harvest it. I have an orange tree in my backyard, and every year I wait for those first oranges. I am so happy to enjoy them when they are ripe. Today God desires to be satisfied with the firstfruits of His crop. We want to be those who give God satisfaction by growing properly in this age.</P><P>The firstfruits are the early overcomers, the first ripe ones in God's field. Hence, they will be reaped before the harvest as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. The harvest will be reaped later. This means that the overcomers will be raptured to the heavens before the harvest, just as the firstfruits of the good land were reaped and brought into the temple of God before the harvest (Lev. 23:10-11; Exo. 23:19).</P><P>How do the firstfruits grow? Revelation 14:4 says that they follow the Lamb wherever He goes. If you want to grow, follow the Lamb. If you do not follow Him, you do not grow. If you are not progressing in life, you are not following the Lamb. The secret to growing, to maturing, is to follow the Lamb wherever He goes. By following Him day by day, we can gain the growth so that we can mature and ripen in this age. We do not do things because of legal requirements or religious observances. We are following the Lamb because we love Him. We want to enjoy Him and be wherever He is. I like to follow Him in this age. Wherever He is going, I want to go with Him. As He is moving in this age, I want to move where He moves. Eventually, the firstfruits, the early overcomers, will be standing on Mount Zion with the Lamb. The firstfruits will not be surprised that they have been raptured to be with the Lamb on the heavenly Mount Zion. They have been following Him wherever He goes, so if He is on Mount Zion, they are there also. We desire and aspire to be those who give God some enjoyment by ripening early in this age. We give ourselves to follow Him wherever He goes and not be touched by anything of this age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Late Overcomers&#151;<br>the Rest of the Seed of the Universal Woman</H2><P>Now we want to see the late overcomers&#151;the rest of the seed of the universal woman (Rev. 12:17). After the rapture of the man-child to the throne of God and after the reaping of the firstfruits for the Father's satisfaction, a period of time on this earth begins called the great tribulation, the darkest and the worst period of time in human history. This is the environment in which the late overcomers are the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>After there has been the rapture of the man-child to the throne and the dragon, Satan, has been cast down to the earth, Revelation 12:17 says that he becomes angry with the woman and goes to make war with the rest of her seed. The devil knows his time is short and he is the more enraged (v. 12). The rest of the woman's seed signifies the people of God that were not in the man-child. The people of God that are not in the man-child are the weaker part of God's people. At this point in time, the devil is not making war with the man-child or with the firstfruits because they have been raptured. He is making war with the weaker part among God's people, so this is a terrible point in time.</P><P>Also, in Revelation 14 after the reaping of the firstfruits, you have a solemn warning that goes out to the whole inhabited earth. An angel says with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also shall drink of the wine of the fury of God..and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb" (vv. 9-10). This is a serious warning to all people on the earth.</P><P>Right after this, there is a promised blessing to anyone who will be martyred during this period of the great tribulation. Verse 13 says, "And I heard a voice out of heaven, saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on." This will be a period of time where people will die in the Lord and receive a big blessing. These are the late overcomers, the ones who have passed through the entire tribulation but have maintained the testimony of Jesus. This shows that in a very dark time the Lord always has a way to maintain the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>Revelation 15:2 says, "And I saw as it were a glassy sea mingled with fire and those who come away victorious from the beast." These are the overcomers who come away from the great tribulation in victory. They are standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God. They come away out of the tribulation victorious, and they do this at the cost of their lives. Because they stand for the Lord and for His testimony, they will be martyred by Antichrist, the beast.</P><P>In Revelation 13 Antichrist is likened to a leopard with feet like a bear and a mouth like a lion (v. 2). This shows us that he has all the characteristics of the evil beasts, the evil powers, that have preceded him in human government. He is the worst of all the beasts, having all their characteristics. Thus, Antichrist is the consummation, the totality, of all the evil powers throughout all of human history. We enjoy the consummated God, but Antichrist is another consummation, the consummation of all the evil powers in human history.</P><P>Revelation 13:2 says that Satan, the dragon, gives his power, his throne, and great authority to Antichrist. Antichrist is slain in the middle of the last seven weeks, the last seven years of this age, and he is resuscitated with the spirit of Caesar Nero that comes out of the abyss (v. 3 and Revelation 17:11, note 111, Recovery Version). This is the beast that will be persecuting the weaker part of the people of God during the great tribulation.</P><P>We can see that this will be the darkest time, yet still the Lord gains a testimony through the weaker part of God's people. During the great tribulation they can no longer lean on those in the man-child or the firstfruits. So they rise up to be the testimony of Jesus. They are seen standing on the glassy sea, which refers to the lake of fire. The warning to those on the earth who worshipped Antichrist and his image was that they would be judged by the lake of fire, but these late overcomers are standing on it. They have nothing to do with the lake of fire, because they have overcome Antichrist, his image, and the number of his name&#151;666&#151;in the great tribulation. It is a glory that in every age, no matter how dark it is, the Lord always gets His testimony.</P><P>We want to be the testimony of Jesus in this age. We are not here to be late overcomers. We want to overcome the easy things in this age that seem so hard to overcome. It will be terrible to be on the earth during the great tribulation, but there will still be the testimony of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Bride of the Lamb<br>as the Aggregate of All the Overcomers</H2><P>The sixth sign of the testimony of Jesus in the book of Revelation is the bride of the Lamb as the aggregate of all the overcomers (19:7-9). In Revelation there are three main categories of overcomers that are included in the bride as the aggregate of the overcomers: the man-child, the firstfruits, and the late overcomers. All of these three categories as an aggregate form the bride of Christ.</P><P>According to Revelation 19:8, the bride is clothed in fine linen, which is the righteousnesses of the saints. The garment with which the bride is clothed is a wonderful garment. In our Christian life we should have two garments: one corresponds with the objective righteousness, which is for our salvation, and the other with the subjective righteousnesses, which are for our victory.</P><P>Our first garment is the garment of salvation that we receive when we first believe in the Lord. This is seen in Luke 15 with the prodigal son. When he came back to the Father, he was clothed with the best robe (v. 22), which typifies Christ as the God-satisfying righteousness to cover the penitent sinner. This is our objective righteousness that we receive when we believe in the Lord as referred to in 1 Corinthians 1:30.</P><P>But there is another garment that we need to experience which will qualify us to inherit the kingdom of the heavens to be in the wedding feast with the Lamb. This second garment is a garment of embroidered work by the Holy Spirit. In Psalm 45 the queen has two garments that each of us needs to have (vv. 13-14). First, she has a garment of wrought gold. This signifies Christ as our righteousness for us to be justified by God. The other garment that the queen wears is one of embroidered clothing. This is equivalent to the wedding garment.</P><P>Day by day we need to experience the embroidering of the Holy Spirit. This is the detailed, fine experience of Christ in our human life. When we cooperate with the Lord to love the Lord, we experience the indwelling Christ being lived out of us in our conduct. This living out of Christ becomes a garment to us that qualifies us to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, into the wedding feast of the Lamb. This garment is the overcoming and surpassing righteousness (Matt. 5:20) of the saints.</P><P>In Matthew 22 there was a man who came to the wedding feast. He was invited to the wedding feast because he was a real Christian. But at the wedding feast this man was approached by the king, who said to him, "Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?" (v. 12). Because he did not have a wedding garment, that man was cast out into the outer darkness (v. 13). This shows that merely to have Christ as our objective righteousness is not sufficient for us to be qualified to enter into the enjoyment of the kingdom of the heavens, to enter into the wedding feast with the Lamb. What we need is the detailed embroidery work of the Holy Spirit by living Christ out as our subjective righteousness (Phil. 3:9).</P><P>Each day when we cooperate with the Lord, saying Amen to the Spirit's moving inside of us, we experience the Spirit's embroidering of Christ into us stitch after stitch. This garment qualifies us to be the overcomers who feast with the Lord at the wedding feast of the Lamb. This aggregate of overcomers is the bride of the Lamb, the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>Eventually, this bride will be the army with Christ to defeat and destroy Antichrist and his army at Armageddon (Rev. 17:14; 19:14, 19-21; 16:14, 16). Christ today is looking for the overcomers not only to be His lovers but also to be His fighters in His army. Today for us to be the testimony of Jesus we need to become fighters because Jesus is a victorious fighter. He is the One today who is fighting for God's interest and purpose on this earth. As His testimony we stand with Him and fight with Him for God's purpose. Today we are a corporate fighter, fighting for God's expression on this earth. If we are going to be fighters, we must be vital. Fighters cannot be dead, old, or lukewarm. They must be living, active, absolute, and desperate to fight for the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>On the last day of the great tribulation, Antichrist and his armies will be gathered at Armageddon. Then the bridegroom, Christ, who has become the victorious general, will come with the overcoming saints as His army to defeat and destroy Antichrist and his army. This closes all the wars in this age. Christ will be the ultimate victorious general. Antichrist and the false prophet will be thrown into the lake of fire, and Satan will be bound and thrown into the abyss. The rebellious armies of Antichrist will be utterly destroyed, and God's kingdom will come to the earth. Then the aggregate of the overcomers as the bride will enjoy Christ as the bridegroom for a thousand years and reign with Christ as His co-kings in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The New Jerusalem, the Tabernacle of God,<br>the Wife of the Lamb, as the Ultimate Consummation of All the Matured Saints</H2><P>The ultimate testimony of Jesus is the New Jerusalem, the tabernacle of God, the wife of the Lamb, as the ultimate consummation of all of God's matured people (Rev. 21:1-3). No matter how stubborn or weak some Christians are today, eventually, all of God's people will be matured. Those who did not do their "homework" in this age, who did not enjoy the processed Triune God in this age, will be matured during the thousand-year kingdom to become the constituents of the New Jerusalem for eternity. But we want to pay the price to be the overcomers in this age who mature earlier to participate in the wedding feast of the Lamb. God in Christ wants us to be overcomers more than we want to be. He is calling us for this so that He can have the wife He desires. This wife is the New Jerusalem.</P><P>The New Jerusalem is not a physical city, a heavenly mansion. The book of Revelation is a book of signs. The Lion-Lamb, the seven lampstands, and the universal woman are all signs, not literal, physical things. Christ is not a physical lamb with four feet and with seven eyes (Rev. 5:6). This is a sign. The New Jerusalem is also a sign, the greatest sign, of the ultimate consummation of all of God's people that have been matured through all the ages.</P><P>All God's people will be the eternal manifestation and expression and the total increase of the processed and consummated Triune God in His mingling with all His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified saints. God has been increasing through His dispensing. He has been processed and consummated to dispense Himself into us to make us His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and eventually glorified people. If God had not been processed and consummated, He could not have gotten into us. First, we were redeemed by His blood (Eph. 1:7). Then He entered into us to regenerate our spirit (John 3:6). Now He is transforming us in our soul (Rom. 12:2), and eventually He will transfigure our body to glorify us (Phil. 3:21). The Triune God will saturate our whole being and we will be fully mingled with the Triune God.</P><P>We need to pay our attention to the words processed, consummated, and mingled. God has been processed. God in Christ as the Spirit has been realized by us in our spirit. This is the entering in of the Triune God, who has been consummated as the Spirit. The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son has been realized as the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God. The New Jerusalem is the total increase of the processed and consummated Triune God mingled with His lovers. We love Him, and He is being mingled with us. He is spreading into our mind, emotion, and will to make us His eternal manifestation and expression.</P><P>The New Jerusalem will be a triumphant show to all the universe, especially to His adversary Satan, of His victory in His infinite grace and wisdom through His redeemed in eternity (Eph. 2:7; 3:10). This is the ultimate and final testimony of Jesus! Hallelujah!</P><P>By that time Satan and all the evil, negative things and persons will be in the lake of fire. In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem as the ultimate mingling of God and man will be a triumphant show. Satan will have to look at this city, this bride. Today he bothers us all the time, but he cannot stop God. Through God's infinite grace and wisdom, God will have a triumphant show.</P><P>Ephesians 2:7 says, "That He might display in the ages to come the surpassing riches of His grace." Chapter two begins with man being dead in offenses and sins (v. 1). After the fall, man became dead in his spirit. Satan and his evil angels were above him (v. 2). He was lost in the world, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts. These fallen men are by nature children of wrath (v. 3). Man is corrupt, full of sin. Satan has brought man down to the bottom. But God was rich in mercy because of His great love with which He loved us (v. 4). He saved us by His grace. Through His dispensing of His rich grace, which is God in Christ as the Spirit flowing into our being, He redeems, regenerates, transforms, and glorifies all of His children. The whole tripartite being of man will be fully one with God. That will be a victorious, triumphant show in the whole universe, and we will be a part of this show. This is the final and ultimate testimony of Jesus. We need to pray, "Lord, make me an overcomer." It is the overcomers who will usher in the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of the matured saints so that the Lord Jesus can have His final and ultimate testimony.</P><P>8 brothers</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:2; Judg. 6:34; Luke 1:15, 35; Matt. 1:20; John 7:39; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; Rom. 8:2; Acts 1:8; Luke 24:49; 2 Kings 2:9, 13-15; Exo. 30:23-29; 2 Cor. 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27; Acts 16:7; Rom. 8:9; Phil. 1:19b-21a; Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; 22:17</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>He was the Spirit of God in God's creation&#151;Gen. 1:2.</li><li>He was the Spirit of Jehovah in God's relationship with man&#151;Judg. 6:34.</li><li>He was the Holy Spirit in the conceptions of John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus in order to sanctify humanity for Christ's incarnation&#151;Luke 1:15, 35; Matt. 1:20.</li><li>The Spirit was not yet before Christ's resurrection, in which He was glorified&#151;John 7:39.</li><li>The last Adam became the life-giving Spirit as the pneumatic Christ in His resurrection&#151;1 Cor. 15:45b.</li><li>The Lord Spirit for transforming the believers into the glorious image of Christ&#151;2 Cor. 3:17-18.</li><li>The Spirit of life, the essential Spirit of God&#151;Rom. 8:2.</li><li>The Spirit of power, the economical Spirit of God, for the believers to put on as their uniform typified by the mantle of Elijah&#151;Acts 1:8; Luke 24:49; 2 Kings 2:9, 13-15.</li><li>As the compound Spirit, He was compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power to be the anointing ointment&#151;Exo. 30:23-31.</li><li>The anointing Spirit&#151;2 Cor. 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27.</li><li>The Spirit of Jesus for the human life of Jesus, especially in His sufferings&#151;Acts 16:7.</li><li>The Spirit of Christ for Christ in resurrection in His divinity and His uplifted humanity&#151;Rom. 8:9.</li><li>The Spirit of Jesus Christ for His bountiful supply in His death and resurrection for the believers to live Christ and to magnify Christ&#151;Phil. 1:19b-21a.</li><li>The seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified Spirit, for the overcomers in the degradation of the church&#151;Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6.</li><li>Eventually, as the consummated Spirit, He becomes the Spirit to be the reality and realization of the pneumatic Christ and the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God to be one with the bride of the Lamb (Christ) to proclaim the coming of Christ&#151;Rev. 22:17.</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SPEAKING BY VARIOUS BROTHERS<br>CONCERNING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</H2><P>In this message we come to the crucial point of the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is the essence of all the messages given in this conference, and He is the means to bring all the realities of God's economy into our being.</P><P>God's redemption cleanses us from all our sins, and the cross eliminates all the negative things, but how can God be dispensed into man? If it is only that we are cleansed and all the negative things are removed, there is nothing for God's testimony. The Triune God has a way through the life-giving Spirit to dispense the all-inclusive Christ into all the members of His Body for the expression of the Triune God.</P><P>Without the life-giving Spirit, there could be no recovery, no local churches, and no Body of Christ. There could be only an organization with a label "the Body of Christ." But through the life-giving Spirit, who brings all the divine elements into us, the Body of Christ is a reality. Without the life-giving Spirit, there is no reality of oneness. But the more we receive the life-giving Spirit in His dispensing of Himself into us, the stronger the oneness of all the local churches will become. Today through the Spirit's dispensing, all the local churches on the whole earth are one not in the isolated way of locality but in the universal way of the Body of Christ. This is not an organizational oneness but a oneness that is the result of our contacting the life-giving Spirit.</P><P>Furthermore, without the life-giving Spirit there could be no testimony of Jesus. Without the Spirit there would be nothing more than religion on the earth today. However, the Lord's recovery is not a religion; it is the testimony of Jesus. As we touch the Spirit, it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us. This is the testimony of Jesus. It is not a representation of Jesus, but it is Jesus Himself living and moving in His Body.</P><P>In today's Christianity it is difficult to hear a message on the life-giving Spirit because there is very little revelation concerning the life-giving Spirit among Christians today. This revelation was not invented in the Lord's recovery. The life-giving Spirit is revealed in 1 Corinthians 15:45: "The last Adam [the Lord Jesus in the flesh] became a life-giving Spirit." Second Corinthians 3:17 also reveals that today the Lord is the Spirit. However, throughout the centuries this truth became lost to the Lord's children. The truth of justification by faith was recovered by Martin Luther, and that truth can never be lost. Through His recovery the Lord has recovered the truth that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, and this truth can never be lost.</P><P>All that the Father is and has is embodied in the Son. If we reject the Son, we lose everything of the Father (1 John 2:23). All that the Son is and has, has been processed to become available to us in the life-giving Spirit. In rejecting and opposing this truth, today's Christianity has lost nearly everything concerning God's economy. Because it does not fit into traditional theology, the truth of Christ being the life-giving Spirit is an offense to many Christians. Yet it is the pure revelation of the Bible. We in the recovery do not care for traditional theology. We care for Christ, and we care for life. We care for the truth that the Lord is now the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself as life to us so that we can be His Body for His testimony on the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN GOD'S CREATION</H2><P>The Spirit was first the Spirit of God in God's creation (Gen. 1:2). In His person He is forever the Spirit. But through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, many ingredients have been added to Him. In Genesis 1:1 God created the heavens and the earth. In verse 2 the earth became waste and empty because of God's judgment on Satan's rebellion. Then God came in as the Spirit of God to move upon the face of the waters. This Spirit is God in the element of His divinity. As the Spirit of God, He is related to the creation of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF JEHOVAH<br>IN GOD'S RELATIONSHIP WITH MAN</H2><P>The Spirit is not merely a power or an influence; He is a wonderful person. In Genesis 1 this wonderful person was the Spirit of God in God's creation. In chapter two the name Jehovah is mentioned for the first time (v. 4). Jehovah is God's name in His relationship with man. God's relationship with man is more intimate than His relationship with creation. After creating man, God remained intimately involved with him. This is why in the Old Testament the Spirit is usually referred to as the Spirit of Jehovah (Judg. 3:10; 6:34; Isa. 61:1; Ezek. 11:5). The Spirit of Jehovah came upon certain people (Judg. 3:10; 6:34; 11:29; 14:6, 19; 15:14; 1 Sam. 16:13). This indicates that the Spirit of Jehovah has to do with God's reaching of man. As the Spirit of Jehovah, He empowered man to carry out His purpose. Therefore, in the Old Testament two wonderful titles of the Spirit are unveiled. The first title is the Spirit of God in God's creation, and the second title is the Spirit of Jehovah in His reaching of man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE CONCEPTIONS<br>OF JOHN THE BAPTIST AND THE LORD JESUS</H2><P>In the New Testament, when the Lord was about to move forward to do something further in His economy, the title the Holy Spirit is used for the first time. (In Psalm 51:11 and Isaiah 63:10-11 the King James Version uses the term Holy Spirit; but the proper translation of this term should be "Spirit of holiness.") He was the Holy Spirit in the conceptions of John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus in order to sanctify humanity for Christ's incarnation (Luke 1:15, 35; Matt. 1:20).</P><P>There is a distinction between the work of the Holy Spirit in the conception of John the Baptist and the work of the Holy Spirit in the conception of Jesus Christ. In the conception of John the Baptist the Holy Spirit came to an overage, elderly person in order to produce a son who was merely human. This was God's miracle. John the Baptist was full of the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb (Luke 1:15), but he had only the human nature and lacked the nature of God. John's being full of the Holy Spirit enabled him to stand against the tide of that evil religious age and initiate a new dispensation for God's economy. This also qualified John to be the one who introduced the Savior to His people.</P><P>In the conception of Jesus the Holy Spirit went further. Luke 1:35 says, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore also the holy thing which is born will be called the Son of God." In the conception of Jesus the divine essence of the Holy Spirit was added to the human essence. According to Matthew 1:20, the Triune God was born into Mary's womb through the Holy Spirit. The result of such a work of the Spirit was a God-man with two natures, divinity and humanity. Jesus is the complete God and the perfect man. He is the God-man.</P><P>Today the Holy Spirit is still working. He is working in us not according to the conception of John the Baptist but according to the conception of the Lord Jesus. According to 1 Corinthians 12:3, whenever we call on the name of Jesus, we are in the Holy Spirit. This Spirit is operating in us to saturate us with God's holy nature, making us holy for God's purpose.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT BEING NOT YET<br>BEFORE CHRIST'S RESURRECTION</H2><P>In the Bible there is a wonderful progression concerning the Spirit. In creation the Spirit is the Spirit of God. Then in His relationship with man He progressed to be the Spirit of Jehovah. Eventually, in the New Testament He is the Holy Spirit to sanctify humanity for Christ's incarnation. Still, this progression has gone even further.</P><P>The Spirit was not yet before Christ's resurrection, in which He was glorified. According to John 7:39, before the Lord's death and resurrection, the Spirit was not yet. There was the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit. The Spirit indicated by these three titles had only the element of divinity. No other elements had yet been added to the Spirit. But on the day of resurrection something new took place in the universe. Jesus was resurrected, and in resurrection He was glorified (Luke 24:26) and was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit. In this Spirit the elements of Christ's incarnation, His human living with all His human virtues, His all-inclusive death with its effectiveness, and His wonderful resurrection with its power are compounded together. This Spirit is the all-inclusive compound Spirit of the processed Triune God.</P><P>What should we do with such a Spirit? According to John 7:37-39 and 1 Corinthians 12:13, we must drink the Spirit. Today the Spirit is drinkable. Isaiah 12:3-4 says, "Therefore you will draw water with rejoicing/From the springs of salvation,/And you will say in that day,/Praise Jehovah; call upon His name!/Make His deeds known among the peoples;/Remind them that His name is exalted." These verses show that the way to drink from the springs of the Lord's salvation is to praise Him and call upon His name. When we drink Him in such a way, rivers of living water flow out of our innermost being (John 7:38). These rivers are the different aspects of the life of Jesus Christ. If we drink the Spirit, rivers of love, joy, peace, holiness, and patience will flow out to those around us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LAST ADAM BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT AS THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST IN HIS RESURRECTION</H2><P>The last Adam became the life-giving Spirit as the pneumatic Christ in His resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45b). When Christ resurrected, He became the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is the pneumatic Christ. On the evening of His resurrection, He breathed into His disciples and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (John 20:22). The Greek word for spirit is pneuma, which means "breath," "wind," or "air." Christ as the life-giving Spirit breathed Himself as the holy pneuma, the holy breath, the Holy Spirit, into His disciples.</P><P>Today this pneumatic Christ dwells in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Every day we can drink Him as a wonderful drink, and moment by moment we can breathe Him in as the heavenly air. On the one hand, He supplies us with all the positive elements of the pneumatic Christ, and on the other hand, He kills all the negative elements in our being, so that we can become the testimony of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD SPIRIT FOR TRANSFORMING THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>The Spirit is also the Lord Spirit for transforming the believers into the glorious image of Christ. Second Corinthians 3:18 says, "But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit." The life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45 is called the Lord Spirit in this verse.</P><P>The title the Lord Spirit is related to the transforming work of the Spirit within us. The verb transform in Greek is metamorphoo, meaning "to change form." Transformation is a metabolic process. Metabolism has at least three aspects. First, a new element comes into our being. Second, this new element replaces our old element. Third, the old element is discharged. Therefore, transformation can be defined as the inward, metabolic process in which God works to spread His divine life and nature throughout every part of our being, bringing Christ and His riches into our being as our new element and causing our old, natural element to be gradually discharged. Through this metabolic process we are transformed into the same image as the resurrected and glorified Christ.</P><P>Transformation is a lifelong process. Therefore, every morning we need to cooperate with this process by opening our entire being to take in the new element of the life, nature, and essence of the processed and consummated Triune God. Our God is not the "raw" God anymore. The Triune God has gone through a process to become the life-giving Spirit. Every morning we need to take a new element into our being to replace the old element. We do not have to be bothered by the natural life, the flesh, the self, and all kinds of negative things any longer. By taking in this new element of the processed Triune God, we will be transformed into the same image as the resurrected and glorified Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF LIFE, THE ESSENTIAL SPIRIT OF GOD</H2><P>The life-giving Spirit is also the Spirit of life, the essential Spirit of God (Rom. 8:2). The title the Spirit of life indicates that life belongs to the Spirit, and the Spirit is of life. The Spirit and life are actually one (John 6:63). Hence, the way for us to experience the divine, eternal, uncreated life is by the Spirit of life. This Spirit works in us inwardly to transform us metabolically day by day. He also works in us inwardly for our life and living essentially, freeing us from the law of sin and death. According to Romans 8, the Spirit of life, who is now mingled with our spirit, gives life to our spirit (v. 10), to our soul, represented by our mind (v. 6), and to our mortal body (v. 11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF POWER,<br>THE ECONOMICAL SPIRIT OF GOD</H2><P>The life-giving Spirit is also the Spirit of power, the economical Spirit of God, for the believers to put on as their uniform typified by the mantle of Elijah (Acts 1:8; Luke 24:49; 2 Kings 2:9, 13-15). We need the daily infilling of the essential Spirit of life as well as the daily experience of the economical Spirit of power. A policeman needs to eat well for his life and living essentially, and he also needs to put on his uniform to carry out his governmental duty economically. In the same way, we Christians need to receive daily the Spirit of life as the element and essence of the processed Triune God that we may have a proper life and living essentially, and we also need to put on the uniform of the Spirit of power economically for our work in carrying out God's economy.</P><P>Today we should be vital; that is, we should be living and active. Our being living with vitality comes from the Spirit of life working in us essentially, whereas our being active with authority comes from the Spirit of power being upon us as our uniform economically.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE COMPOUND SPIRIT, COMPOUNDED<br>WITH CHRIST'S DIVINITY, HUMANITY, DEATH, AND RESURRECTION TO BE THE ANOINTING OINTMENT</H2><P>The life-giving Spirit is also the compound Spirit, compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power to be the anointing ointment (Exo. 30:23-29). The word compound is used as a verb with reference to the mixing of different kinds of ingredients to make medicines and ointments. If a person has an ailment, a pharmacist may form a compound from many different ingredients in order to meet that person's need. In the same way, the Spirit has been compounded to give us just what we need.</P><P>The ingredients of this compound Spirit are clearly shown in the type of the holy anointing oil in Exodus 30:23-31. The holy anointing oil was used for the particular purpose of anointing both the priests and the tabernacle. The base of the holy anointing oil was one hin of olive oil. The olive oil signifies the Spirit of God. In addition, the oil signifies the divinity in the Godhead.</P><P>Four spices were added to this olive oil in three units of five hundred shekels each. These three measures of five hundred shekels signify the Triune God as an element in the compound Spirit. The second of these three measures is divided into two equal portions of two hundred fifty shekels each. This signifies that Christ, the Second of the Divine Trinity, was crucified, "split" on the cross. In the Bible the number four signifies God's creation. Ezekiel 1:5 and Revelation 4:6 speak of the four living creatures. The four spices signify the humanity of the Lord Jesus in God's creation. The four spices blended with the one hin of olive oil signifies that in the compound Spirit humanity is blended, mingled, with divinity.</P><P>The four spices were myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. Myrrh in the Bible was used for burial (John 19:39) and is related to death; hence, it signifies the precious death of Christ. Cinnamon, which can be used to stimulate the heart, signifies the effectiveness of Christ's death. Calamus, a reed that grows in a marsh or a muddy place, signifies the precious resurrection of Christ. Cassia, which was used as a repellent to drive away insects and snakes, signifies the power of Christ's resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ANOINTING SPIRIT</H2><P>First, the Spirit is the compound Spirit, the compound ointment; then He is the anointing Spirit (2 Cor. 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27). The anointing Spirit is simply the application of the compound Spirit. The compound Spirit needs to be applied to us and added to us through the anointing Spirit. The anointing is the moving and working of the indwelling compound Spirit. Second Corinthians 1:21 says, "But the One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God." God anoints us by attaching us to Christ, the anointed One. Christ, the anointed One, is full of ointment. He is not only the compound Spirit, but He is also the means by which we are anointed. He is the ointment and the anointing One. Because we have been attached to Him, the ointment that is on Him flows to us. Through the moving of the anointing Spirit, all the elements of the compound Spirit are added into our inner being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF JESUS FOR THE HUMAN LIFE OF JESUS</H2><P>The Spirit is also the Spirit of Jesus for the human life of Jesus, especially in His sufferings (Acts 16:7). In Acts 16 the apostles, having come to Mysia, were endeavoring to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them. The Spirit of Jesus is a particular expression referring to the Spirit of the incarnated Savior, the One who passed through human living and even death on the cross. The Spirit of Jesus includes not only the divine element of God but also the human element of Jesus with all His experiences of human living and His death on the cross. Such an all-inclusive Spirit was needed by the apostles in their ministry&#151;a suffering ministry among human beings and for human beings in the human life of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST FOR CHRIST IN RESURRECTION</H2><P>The Spirit is also the Spirit of Christ for Christ in resurrection in His divinity and His uplifted humanity (Rom. 8:9). In Acts 16 there is the Spirit of Jesus, but in Romans 8 we see the Spirit of Christ. Romans 8:9 says, "But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him." The title the Spirit of Christ implies that this Spirit is the embodiment and reality of Christ. This Christ accomplished everything necessary for God's plan. He includes not only divinity, which He possessed from eternity, but also humanity, which He obtained through incarnation. Human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension are also included in the Spirit of Christ. This is the Spirit of the One who passed through death and entered into resurrection. His death was an all-inclusive termination, terminating everything of the old creation. His resurrection was the all-inclusive germination that brought forth the new creation. The Spirit of Christ is therefore the totality, the aggregate, of the all-inclusive Christ with His all-inclusive death and resurrection. Because we have this Spirit of Christ in us, we have everything related to this all-inclusive termination and germination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST FOR HIS BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY IN HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION</H2><P>The Spirit of Jesus Christ is for His bountiful supply in His death and resurrection that the believers may live Christ and magnify Christ (Phil. 1:19b-21a). The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit mentioned in John 7. At that time the Spirit was not yet, but at the time Paul wrote Philippians, the Spirit was. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of the glorified Jesus. This Spirit is not merely the Spirit of God before incarnation, but the Spirit of God compounded with the elements of Christ's incarnation, human living under the cross, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</P><P>Paul experienced both the Lord's suffering in His human life and the Lord's life-giving resurrection. Thus, to Paul this Spirit was the Spirit of Jesus Christ. When we enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, we live Christ and magnify Christ. To magnify Christ is to show, declare, exalt, and extol Him without limitation, regardless of the circumstances. Through the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we become one with Christ in our life and living to such an extent that we and He live as one person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SEVEN SPIRITS, THE SEVENFOLD INTENSIFIED SPIRIT, FOR THE OVERCOMERS<br>IN THE DEGRADATION OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>Thus far in this message we have seen the progression and the consummation of the Spirit of God. Initially, the Spirit was of God for creation. This is outward and objective. Next, as He entered into His relationship with man, He was the Spirit of Jehovah. This is subjective and precious. Then He was the Holy Spirit to sanctify humanity for Christ's incarnation. Although He was the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit, He was also the Spirit who was not yet. This indicates that some aspect of the Spirit was not yet. However, in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. The Spirit of God became a life-giving Spirit with a new function&#151;not just to create outwardly, to merely be related to man, or even to sanctify man in the situation for Christ's incarnation. Now the Spirit has become the life-giving Spirit to enter into humanity to give life.</P><P>As the Lord Spirit, He is the Spirit who transforms the believers. As the essential Spirit of God, He is the Spirit of life to be our life. As the economical Spirit of God, He is the Spirit of power to empower us to carry out God's economy. In order to understand how one Spirit could have so many functions and carry out so many things in God's economy, the Old Testament type of the compound ointment is needed to reveal the compound Spirit. This compound Spirit is now the anointing Spirit, anointing us, flowing over us, to bring all the elements of this compound Spirit into us.</P><P>As the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ, He is related to all the believers in the suffering of human life, the power of resurrection, and the bountiful supply, respectively.</P><P>In Revelation 1:4; 4:5; and 5:6 the Spirit is referred to as the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified Spirit, for the overcomers in the degradation of the church. At the time of the writing of the book of Revelation, the churches were degraded. The Spirit needed to be intensified to deal with the degraded situation among God's people on the earth. In Revelation 1:4-5 the seven Spirits are ranked among the three of the Triune God, showing that the seven Spirits are the Spirit of God in the Divine Trinity. In these verses the Spirit is mentioned second, not third, indicating that in the carrying out of God's recovery work in a degraded situation, the Spirit is crucial.</P><P>Today everything of the Triune God has been processed and consummated in the Spirit. Hence, what we need is this all-inclusive Spirit intensified sevenfold. In the Old Testament, this intensified Spirit is typified by the seven lamps of the lampstand (Zech. 4:2-6). The seven lamps before the throne in Revelation 4:5 are for the shining, the enlightening, and the burning in carrying out God's building work. In Exodus 25 with the tabernacle and in Zechariah 4 with the rebuilding of the recovered temple, God needed these seven lamps to burn, to shine, and to expose for His building. Eventually, these seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God (Rev. 4:5), and the seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb (Rev. 5:6).</P><P>In the recovery today we need the seven Spirits to come in to search us, to enlighten us, and to shine into us in order to expose our worldliness, our fleshliness, our deadness, and our lukewarmness. In order to become vital for the practice of the vital groups, we need to exercise to have a thorough confession before the Lord, until vitality is brought in. For such a confession we need the searching and shining of the seven Spirits. We need the shining and burning of these seven Spirits so that the building work can go on.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT</H2><P>Eventually, the Spirit is the consummated Spirit to be the reality and the realization of the pneumatic Christ and the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God to be one with the bride of the Lamb (Christ) to proclaim the coming of Christ. Revelation 22:17 says, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who hears say, Come! And let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely." In this verse the title the Spirit indicates that everything of the Triune God has been processed and consummated. Now as the Spirit He brings the Triune God into us to be one with us as the bride. This consummated Spirit has joined Himself to the bride. Hence, at the end of Revelation the Spirit and the bride speak together, saying, "Come!" For the Lord's coming He needs people who have been searched and burned by the sevenfold Spirit until in their being and their living, the Spirit and the bride are speaking together, saying, "Come, Lord Jesus!"</P><P>7 brothers</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE VITAL GROUPS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The vital groups cannot be formed by organization.</li><li>A vital group could come into being only by a saint who is desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lord's recovery.</li><li>Such a desperate saint would spontaneously contact others by the Lord's leading and gain some companion or companions for him to have a vital group.</li><li>They should definitely and absolutely fulfill the first four basic requirements:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Intimate and thorough fellowship that they may be blended together.</li>	<li>Thorough confession of sins, transgressions, defects, wrongdoings, etc.</li>	<li>Thorough consecration of themselves and of all that they have and do to the Lord.</li>	<li>Praying unceasingly that they may be brought into the infilling and the outpouring of the essential and economical Spirit.</li>	</ol><li>They should pick up the burden and take the action to contact others, either sinners or Christians:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Always taking care of two or three persons.</li>	<li>Not expecting to have a quick result, but setting a definite goal with a strong determination to gain at least one remaining fruit yearly.</li>	<li>With inexhaustible patience and unceasing intercession.</li>	</ol><li>They should have their group members meeting together once a week to fellowship about and study every case of their candidates to find out the best way to take care of each candidate and the best helper or helpers to catch the candidate.</li><li>After a candidate is gained and baptized, they should try their best to bring him or her to their group meeting and help him or her to participate in the fellowship of the group meeting and learn how to function in the mutual teaching and mutual perfecting.</li><li>They should instruct and guide the newly baptized ones to gain others and to prophesy in the church meetings.</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CRUCIAL NEED AMONG US TODAY<br>FOR THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>We need to be stirred up by the Lord so that we can cooperate with Him to go higher. We have attained to a certain extent, but we have not attained to the extent which we should, so we must humble ourselves to learn something and be improved every day.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Learning to Speak</H2><P>In these days we are taking the God-ordained way to have the church life. The big item in the church life is the meetings. Especially, we need to learn how to take care of the Lord's need in our speaking of His word in the meetings. Those in traditional Christianity do not consider that all the saints are qualified to speak the word of God. Therefore, they have set up a clerical class of people to be the unique speakers. Every Sunday morning in their main service, they have a practice of one person speaking and the rest listening. A Christian could be there for his whole life listening to this speaking for many years and eventually not be able to speak a word for the Lord. This is a poor situation. This kind of practice annuls the spiritual function of the saints and quenches their heart to speak for the Lord.</P><P>Furthermore, this kind of practice is absolutely unscriptural. In the New Testament, especially in 1 Corinthians 14, we are told that when we all come together as the church, everyone should prepare to have something to share with the others (v. 26). There is a picture of this in the ancient times with the Israelites. When they came together to worship the Lord, they all brought some surplus of the good land to present to God. The holy word in the Old Testament charged them not to appear before God empty-handed, without anything to present to God (Deut. 16:16). But today most Christians come to their main service with nothing, expecting that someone will be there to speak to them. This is altogether not based upon the Scripture.</P><P>About fifty-five years ago, Brother Watchman Nee saw the light from 1 Corinthians 14 that before we come to the meeting, we should have something prepared to present to the Lord and to the attendants. In other words, everybody should have some word to speak to others, to minister the Lord to others, that Christ may be glorified and His Body may be built up. Brother Nee also realized that if we stopped the one-man-speaking practice, we would need something to replace it or we would not have anything. At that time we were not able to enter into the practice of the church meetings in mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. Eventually, beginning in 1987 we began in Taipei to enter into the practice of having church meetings in mutuality with all the attendants speaking for the building up of the church. Since that time we have seen a slow improvement among us. This improvement has become an encouragement to us, especially to me.</P><P>Some may feel that the new way is all right but not that good. But as long as this new way would not reduce us but give us some increase at a good percentage, we should be satisfied. At the end of 1988 there were approximately one thousand five hundred sixty saints in Southern California. Today there are approximately three thousand one hundred eighty saints here. This is double the number of what we were five years ago. This shows that during the period of time in which we have been endeavoring to take the God-ordained way, we have still had the increase.</P><P>Since we are practicing the God-ordained way, the new way, we must learn to speak because speaking in the meeting is a vital thing for the Lord's recovery. We all need to be perfected to speak for the Lord. When we speak in a larger meeting, we must speak loudly, audibly. Furthermore, in order to speak we all need to learn something. I have over one hundred various kinds of dictionaries that I use to help me in studying the Bible. I have one dictionary on the history of the church which is very helpful. I am saying this to impress us that we need a learning spirit if we want to be those who speak for the Lord.</P><P>Since we love the Lord and love His recovery, we must take the way to have the proper and adequate meetings. The first item we must pursue for this is prophesying (1 Cor. 14:1). Prophesying is not only speaking but also speaking rightly, speaking accurately, speaking audibly, and speaking with something rich. This is why we have to learn. If we do not have any learning, we cannot have the riches to impart to others. Our speaking should also be adjusted in its rhythm. If we speak too slowly we can exhaust others' patience. If we speak too fast, others will not be able to understand us. I hope we would exercise ourselves to learn to speak for the Lord.</P><P>When I was thirty-two years old, I stood in front of a mirror to practice my speaking and my gestures. I also practiced speaking to members of my family. We love the Lord and many of us are young, so we have a long way to go in our Christian life. If we learn to speak accurately, adequately, properly, and richly to meet the Lord's need, we will be greatly used by the Lord and bring in much blessing to the churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Endeavoring to Be Vitalized</H2><P>The second thing we need is to be vital. We need the proper speaking, the proper prophesying, but we cannot be dead or lukewarm. We have to be vital, which means that we have to be living and active. The second point of my loving word to you dear ones is this: learn to be vital. You should not be passive.</P><P>Thank the Lord and praise God that we could have this big blending conference. In this short time, by His mercy and grace, we have covered six crucial points of the major items in His recovery. We believe that we are in the Lord's up-to-date recovery, and we believe that we are this recovery. But I feel very regretful to say that according to our present practical condition we are not vital, not living or active to the extent that we should be. It is of a certainty that we have the light and the truth concerning the Lord's up-to-date recovery, which is very rich and very high. However, we have to humbly admit that we are not vital, not living or active to the extent that we are satisfied. Because we are not vital, we feel deeply that our situation is not satisfactory to the Lord either. So we have to look to the Lord's mercy and grace desperately to get ourselves vitalized and to help others be vitalized. To be vitalized is our need today. Whether we pray or fast, whether we pursue by ourselves or seek with others, at any rate, we must be vitalized. I believe that we have overcome many items of today's degradation in the churches, but we cannot escape the condemnation that we have tolerated and still are tolerating the deadness of Sardis and the lukewarmness of Laodicea. At the beginning of the messages given in this blending conference, I gave an opening word concerning this crucial matter, a matter of life or death. I do not know how much you have been touched by that short, opening word. If you have not been touched by that begging word, regardless of how much you would appreciate the following six messages, the outcome will mean nothing to you and to the Lord's recovery. So today, the crucial point is that you have to be vitalized.</P><P>To have the vital groups should not be taken as a kind of movement. To be vital, to be vitalized, is an extremely personal matter. It is only possible to be vitalized if you yourself are pressed by the Lord to pursue Him desperately and absolutely in this matter. After being vitalized, you should not have a gathering of many saints to promote or to push this matter as a movement. After being vitalized, the only thing you should do is to seek the Lord's leading concerning whom you should contact among so many saints. You should absolutely follow the Lord's leading, and even His guidance, to contact others and fellowship with them, not more than two or three at a time. You have to give your testimony of how you have been pressed by the Lord to seek Him in the matter of vitalization. You have to initiate a thorough and intimate fellowship with your contact, which will usher you and your contact into prayers of desperation, which will be honored by the Lord.</P><P>You should also lead your contact to make thorough confessions to the Lord and also help him to pay the price at any cost as you have done. By this way a small group would spontaneously come into existence which will be vital, living, and active in the Lord's interest. When the number of such a vital group increases to ten or more, you should split it into two groups and charge every member in this kind of group to practice the vitalization along the same track as you have been doing all the time.</P><P>Since you have been vitalized and have raised up such vital groups, you should pray for the church and the leading ones. As the Lord leads, you should give testimonies in the church meetings, but not in the way of condemning or of promoting or pushing. Avoid the thought to change the church's way of meeting and service. Do not initiate any movement of changes. Prayer is needed, but any thought for any radical change must be avoided. After you get vitalized, do not despise anyone, especially the leading ones, the elderly ones, and the ones who are used to rendering help to others. Do not look down on the weaker ones, the indifferent ones, and the ones that seem to be without any care for spiritual things. In conclusion, you should not expect to see that the church is altogether uniform and unified according to your view and practice. The church is not artificial by man's doing, but organic in the growth of the divine life with the growth of Christ in the believers.</P><P>This is my burden in this concluding word. Please pay attention to these two matters. First, learn to speak. Second, endeavor to be vitalized. Speaking and vitalization are the crucial need among us today for the Lord's recovery.</P><P>W.L.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SPEAKING BY VARIOUS BROTHERS<br>CONCERNING THE VITAL GROUPS<br>THE VITAL GROUPS CANNOT BE FORMED<br>BY ORGANIZATION</H2><P>Today we must admit that the deadness of Sardis and the lukewarmness of Laodicea have come into the Lord's recovery. We need to condemn the condition of Sardis among us and also abhor the situation of Laodicea. We need to hate these things, and we also need to get out of these things. This is not a common thing but a matter of life and death facing the whole recovery. It is a life and death matter that we all must be vitalized.</P><P>There are four needs among us in these days. First, the Lord needs a corporate overcomer for His testimony. The Lord needs to have the real testimony of Jesus. Second, the recovery needs to be vital today. The recovery needs a revival of morale, a revival of impact, a revival of the dynamic motivation within us, a revival of vitality among us. This is a real need in the recovery.</P><P>Third, the churches' need is for the prevailing increase. We need to grow; we need to multiply; we need to increase in the churches today. Although the Lord has granted us a substantial increase over the last five years in Southern California, based on the length of time the churches here have existed, our number should be much greater than it is today. We should not boast that we now have more than three thousand members in the churches in Southern California. We should labor and endeavor so that the Lord would increase the churches much more.</P><P>Fourth, as saints in the Lord's recovery, we desperately need to be vitalized. Through intimate and thorough fellowship, through confession, through consecration, through prayer, through our being soaked with the Spirit, through our laboring, and through our learning, we need to be vitalized. This is more crucial in the recovery today than it has ever been before. We all have a responsibility, we all have an obligation, before our Lord. We should pray, "Lord, make me vital. Make me vital today for the sake of Your move."</P><P>Therefore, we need a thorough reconsideration of our way. Is the way that we have been going the right way? We need to get on the God-ordained way. From 1984 until now, a period of almost nine years, the Lord has fully unveiled His ordained way to us. However, if we all are honest before the Lord, we must acknowledge that our reaction, our feeling, toward what the Lord has spoken through His ministry has been somewhat dull. The proof of this is that we are still not vital. We are still in our habit, still somewhat in our tradition. We need to be vitalized.</P><P>The vital groups should constitute eighty percent of the church life. In the beginning of the church age, immediately after the three thousand were saved on the day of Pentecost, they began to meet from house to house (Acts 2:41, 46-47); that is, they began to have vital group meetings. They did not have the name "vital groups," but they had the reality. As they were meeting in that way, day by day the Lord added many people to them. On another day five thousand men were saved (4:4), and at another time multitudes of disciples were added to them (5:14). All these were not only added, but they were also contained, supported, and kept as remaining fruit. This could take place only because of the practice of the vital groups. Their primary way of meeting was not in a congregational style with one man speaking. Their main way of meeting was to have vital groups in every home. They could have vital groups because each one of them was vital. It is not a matter of merely forming a group and calling it a vital group. We do not need merely the name "vital group"; we need the reality of being vital.</P><P>The vital groups cannot be formed by organization. We can testify from our experience that the way of forming vital groups by organization does not work well. Anything that is organic cannot be formed by organizing. Something that is organic can come into being only in a spontaneous and organic way. We need a drastic change in our concept. We should not attempt to organize vital groups by neighborhood, geography, language, or some other factor. This is not the way to be vital. In forming the vital groups, the first thing that we need is to be vital.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A VITAL GROUP CAN COME INTO BEING<br>ONLY BY A SAINT WHO IS DESPERATE AND ABSOLUTE<br>FOR THE INCREASE OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>A vital group can come into being only by a saint who is desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lord's recovery. A vital group begins with one person. It does not begin with nine or ten persons; it begins with one vital saint. We all need to tell the Lord, "Lord, I want to be that saint, a saint who is desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lord's recovery."</P><P>Such a saint must be desperate and absolute not merely to be vital; he must be desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lord's recovery. According to our experience, when we are desperate and absolute for the increase of the church, we have a burden to be vital. If we do not care for the increase but rather are content to see the number in the church remain the same year after year, there is no reason to be vital. We desire to be vital for a purpose, for a goal, and that is for the increase of the Lord's recovery. For this we need to be desperate and we need to be absolute. To be vital we need to begin by taking this matter as life or death. If we take anything as life or death, we are vital in that thing. We need to be desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lord's recovery; then we will be vital.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUCH A DESPERATE SAINT WOULD SPONTANEOUSLY CONTACT OTHERS BY THE LORD'S LEADING</H2><P>Such a desperate saint would spontaneously contact others by the Lord's leading and gain some companion or companions for him to have a vital group. A vital group cannot be formed by promoting or by giving a message or by exhorting the saints to form vital groups. A vital group can be formed only by a saint who is vital. By the Lord's leading such a vital saint will find some others to be his companions. These will then come together to have intimate and thorough fellowship and begin to vitalize one another. In this way the genuine vital groups will be formed and produced in the church life from within. May the Lord give us this kind of desperation and this kind of absoluteness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THOSE IN THE VITAL GROUPS DEFINITELY<br>AND ABSOLUTELY FULFILLING<br>THE FIRST FOUR BASIC REQUIREMENTS</H2><P>There are four basic requirements that we must take care of in order to become vital and to be sustained in our vitality. We must be definite and absolute to fulfill these requirements.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Intimate and Thorough Fellowship<br>That We May Be Blended Together</H2><P>The first requirement is for the intimate and thorough fellowship that we may be blended together. The basis of our blending, the foundation of our blending, is our fellowship, and our fellowship must be intimate and thorough.</P><P>When the Lord was ministering in the four Gospels, He went about contacting people. Surely He was vital. Surely He was absolute and desperate for God's increase. He contacted some young ones and they were drawn to Him. They lived together, ate together, and did everything together. They had a wonderful, intimate, and thorough fellowship with one another day after day, and the Lord was speaking to them. He was blending them together. As He spoke, there was the training. Even in His silence, He was training them.</P><P>Shortly after the Lord revealed to them that He was going to be crucified, James and John asked Him if they could sit on His right hand and on His left hand in the kingdom. When the other ten disciples heard this they were indignant (Mark 10:35-45). It seems that they did not gain anything during the Lord's earthly ministry, but something was built up within them. After witnessing the Lord's death, resurrection, and ascension, they and others who followed the Lord became different persons.</P><P>In the evening of the day of His resurrection, the disciples received the essential Spirit of life (John 20:22). Before He ascended, the Lord told them to return to Jerusalem and wait there until they received the promise of the Father, the outpoured Spirit (Luke 24:49). Because they had witnessed the Lord's death, resurrection, and ascension and because they had received the essential Spirit of life, they were in one accord.</P><P>Acts 1 tells us that the one hundred twenty disciples prayed like one person in one accord (v. 14). They stayed together, ate together, prayed together, and did everything together for at least ten days. Surely they had an intimate fellowship. After ten days of prayer, the Spirit was poured out upon them on the day of Pentecost (2:1-4). The day of Pentecost was a day produced by ten days of this kind of fellowship and prayer. Among us there is a shortage of such an intimate fellowship.</P><P>We need to have an intimate and thorough fellowship in Christ as the element and sphere by exercising our spirit with much and thorough prayer, concerning our status, spiritual condition, and present situation in and with the Lord. Such fellowship is the flowing, the current, of the oneness. We need to have this kind of fellowship for the sake of being blended together into one accord. The way to be blended is by much and thorough prayer, as fine flour of the wheat, with all the members of our group, with the Spirit as the oil, through the death of Christ as the salt, and in the resurrection of Christ as the frankincense, into a dough for the Lord (1 Cor. 5:6-7a; Lev. 2:1-13). If by the Lord's mercy we are able to experience such a blending, we will be absolutely different from what we are today.</P><P>The New Testament tells us that we, as the many grains of wheat (John 12:24) become one lump (1 Cor. 5:6-7a) and eventually we become a loaf (1 Cor. 10:17). After we become a loaf, we mean something and we are something in the hand of the Lord. The loaf is the group. At the Lord's table, we often praise the Lord for the loaf, the bread, yet in actuality we may not be a loaf. As the grains of wheat, we have not been ground, broken, and blended together. The way to become a loaf is to be blended together in the groups by the intimate and thorough fellowship with much and thorough prayer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Thorough Confession of Sins, Transgressions, Defects, Wrongdoings, Etc.</H2><P>The second point is that we need to have a thorough confession of our sins, transgressions, defects, wrongdoings, etc. We need to confess the sin of individualism and individuality. We also need to confess our sinful nature, its defilements, its attachment to the contamination of the world, and its oldness, asking for the Lord's cleansing with His precious blood. All of these things concerning our sinful nature related to our fallen human being and our natural man become real hindrances to the blending, so our confession is a real need for the vital groups. We need to have the thorough fellowship, and we also need to confess all of the hindrances that we may be blended together into one accord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Thorough Consecration of Themselves and<br>of All That They Have and Do to the Lord</H2><P>We also need to make a thorough consecration of ourselves and of all that we have and do to the Lord. In order to be vital persons and have the vital groups, we must be desperate. We need to be the vital persons, the overcomers, to rescue the church from its degradation. The Lord will gain what He desires through His overcomers.</P><P>To be such people we need to put aside our personal interests, our care for the necessities of this life, and make a strong resolution and an absolute consecration to the Lord. Second Timothy 2:4 says that no soldier entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please the one who enlisted him. If we are going to be vital persons, we must clear away all earthly entanglements.</P><P>In the Old Testament, there is the principle of the Nazarite. This is the principle we need to take today. We need to make, with much and thorough prayer, a Nazarite's consecration to the Lord (Num. 6:1-4). In the Old Testament, one could be a priest by birth according to the order of Aaron. But if the priesthood became degraded, the Lord made a provision for others to become priests by voluntary consecration. During a time of degradation there needs to be people who voluntarily consecrate themselves to the Lord in an absolute way as Nazarites.</P><P>John the Baptist was a Nazarite (Luke 1:15). He was born as a priest, but he did not function according to the principle of the order of Aaron. He functioned according to the principle of the Nazarite. This man was used by the Lord to change the age. He ended the Old Testament priesthood and was the beginning of the New Testament priesthood. In order to be the New Testament priests of the gospel (Rom. 15:16) we need to make a Nazarite's consecration to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Praying Unceasingly That They May Be Brought into the Infilling and the Outpouring<br>of the Essential and Economical Spirit</H2><P>Also, we need to pray unceasingly that we may be brought into the infilling and outpouring of the essential and economical Spirit. The secret to being filled with the Spirit inwardly and outwardly is our prayer. We need to be desperate in our prayer.</P><P>An example of this is seen in Mark 10 with the blind beggar who desired to see. He did not pray a composed prayer in a religious and formal way. He cried out desperately to the Lord by saying, "Son of David, have mercy on me!" (v. 48). Then the Lord said to him, "What do you want Me to do for you?" He responded, "That I may receive my sight!" (v. 51). We do not need formal, religious, composed prayers, but desperate prayers in which we tell the Lord directly what we want Him to do for us.</P><P>We need to pray, "Lord, make me vital! Make me living and active! I want to be a factor for the increase of the Lord's recovery." We also should pray desperately, "Lord, fill me up. Transfuse Yourself as the Spirit into my being, my constitution, and pour Yourself out as the Spirit of power upon me." In order to be brought into the infilling and the outpouring of the essential and economical Spirit, we need to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17) by exercising our spirit (1 Tim. 4:7) to redeem the time (Eph. 5:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THEY SHOULD PICK UP THE BURDEN AND TAKE ACTION TO CONTACT OTHERS, EITHER SINNERS OR CHRISTIANS</H2><P>After we become vital and are grouped together in the vital groups, we need to do something. First, we need to pick up a burden, and then we need to take action to contact people. If we are vital, we will realize that among the churches in Southern California there is a desperate need for the proper increase. For many years among us the rate of increase, especially among the Caucasian people, has been too low, yet it seems that not many of us have been touched by this matter and not many have picked up a real burden. If we are vital, the Lord will be able to burden us in a definite and particular way to meet His need today. The Lord has a great need to have the proper increase in the churches in Southern California, especially among the typical Caucasian people. Today we need to put away so many things that are occupying and preoccupying our hearts and pick up a burden for the increase of the church. If we are vital, we will have the capacity to be burdened by the Lord. We need to be unloaded, we need to be released, and we need to be vitalized so that we can be burdened by the Lord for two things: the increase of the churches and the building up of the organic Body of Christ. This is the Lord's burden today, and this should be our burden. Nothing should occupy our hearts but what is on the Lord's heart. Today the Lord desires to see the churches in Southern California have the proper increase, and He also desires to see a real building up in the churches as the organic Body of Christ. The Lord will do this through the God-ordained way. Therefore, we need to be burdened and vitalized to take this way absolutely and desperately.</P><P>After we pick up such a burden, we need to take definite action to go and contact others, either sinners or Christians. To be vital is not only to be living but also to be burdened and very active for the Lord's interest. Once we are living, we also need to be burdened and we need to take action to contact people. We should make a list of those who are unsaved among our relatives, friends, colleagues, and classmates, and we should begin to pray for them in a desperate way. While we are praying for them, we need to exercise our discernment according to the leading of the Spirit to select two or three from our list for us to work on for their salvation. We should have the loving concern of God's heart for the salvation of sinners, and we should be burdened not just to save souls but to convert sinners into members of the Body of Christ for the carrying out of God's economy. The Lord may lead us not only to contact sinners but also to contact some Christians who are seeking, backslidden, or dormant, and gradually, little by little and step by step, to lead them into the church life. We must believe that there are some people in our sphere of influence who are being worked on by the sanctifying Spirit to separate them unto the Lord. They need us to pick up a burden and to take definite action to go and contact them.</P><P>We need to contact people in the principle of incarnation. According to this principle, God and man live together, speak together, and do everything together as one. If we contact people in this kind of living way, they will see in us a living expression of the reality of God's New Testament economy. Whenever we speak to people, we should always minister something real of Christ to them. We should never give them any impression of any kind of involvement with any kind of religious formality. Many people today are seeking after God, but they do not want to be involved in organized Christianity. They want something real, something living, and something vital. If we minister something real of Christ to them, the seeking unbelievers and the seeking Christians will be attracted. They will be attracted and they will be gained by our vitality. Today people will not be gained in any other way. This is the unique way for the Lord to gain people today.</P><P>In our contacting of people, we should not expect to have a quick result. Rather, we should set a definite goal with a strong determination to gain at least one remaining fruit yearly, with inexhaustible patience and unceasing intercession. In 1986 and 1987 thousands of people were saved and baptized in a quick way in Taipei and Orange County, but not many of them have remained to become living members of Christ. In recent years, because we still expected a quick result and did not see that kind of result, many of us became discouraged and dormant regarding the contacting of people. This shows that we do not have the proper concept concerning the way to gain the increase.</P><P>To gain the proper increase through the practice of the vital groups, our concept needs to be revolutionized. We need to see and practice the way of fruit-bearing revealed in John 15. The real fruit-bearing in the Christian life is just like the vine. The vine does not bear fruit every day or many times a year. The vine bears fruit only once a year and only in a particular season. The fruit-bearing by the vine is both yearly and seasonal. As the living branches of Christ, the true vine, we should bear remaining fruit once a year.</P><P>According to John 15:16, we have been chosen by the Lord and set by Him to go forth and bear remaining fruit. Fruit-bearing is our destiny, and to bear remaining fruit every year must be our definite goal with a strong determination. However, in order to do this, we must not be loose or idle. Before the season for fruit-bearing comes, the vine tree is not idle. On the contrary, it is producing the fruit. While we are waiting for the season to come, we need to produce the fruit. We need to live a certain kind of life. First, we need to abide in the Lord through unceasing prayer in intimate fellowship with Him (vv. 4-5). To abide in the Lord is to live in the Lord under all kinds of suffering. The vine suffers for many months before the season comes to bear fruit. Like the vine, we should expect to bear fruit only in season and through much suffering. Second, in order to bear remaining fruit, we need to labor diligently and pray desperately and unceasingly. We should exercise ourselves to always have two or three persons under our care so that one of these could be remaining fruit at the end of a year. As we labor on these people, we should not be anxious or be in a hurry concerning their progress. Instead, as we labor on them, we should enjoy Christ as our inexhaustible patience. We must keep in mind that the vital groups need to gain the proper increase through much prayer and labor. As we pray for people, we should not be discouraged or disappointed but should have the full assurance that at the proper time the Lord will answer our prayer and fulfill His word to us. If we live properly prior to the season of fruit-bearing, we can be assured that at the end of every year we will have one or two as remaining fruit. This is the God-ordained way of fruit-bearing. May the Lord carry this out fully in all the vital groups.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>STUDYING OUR CANDIDATES AND FINDING OUT<br>THE BEST WAY TO TAKE CARE OF THEM</H2><P>Once a vital group is formed, the group members should meet together once a week to fellowship about and study every case of their candidates to find out the best way to take care of each candidate and the best helper or helpers to catch the candidate. We need to consider all of our acquaintances, and we need the proper discernment in our consideration of whom we should labor on. We should spend our time to labor on those whom we consider to be promising and not waste our time on others who are not open. In our group meetings we should pray and study our candidates for the gospel together. We need to consider people's condition, especially spiritually, and then act appropriately to meet their need in the gospel. If we do this, we will gain a clear vision of what their situation is, and this will lead us to contact them in the right way. We need to decide how we should visit a certain person and who would be the right one or ones to go.</P><P>In Luke 19 the Lord likened our church service to a kind of business. He charged us in verse 13 to do business until He comes. We need to do business in and with the Lord by studying how we can gain people. Thank the Lord that we can bear the burden with the Lord in the vital groups to gain the increase for the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AFTER A CANDIDATE IS GAINED AND BAPTIZED,<br>THEY SHOULD DO THEIR BEST TO BRING<br>HIM OR HER TO THEIR GROUP MEETING</H2><P>After a candidate is gained and baptized, the vital group members should do their best to bring him or her to their group meeting and help him or her to participate in the fellowship of the group meeting and learn how to function in the mutual teaching and mutual perfecting. After a person is gained and baptized, he must be raised up to be a living member of the Body of Christ. Today what God needs are not merely saved souls but living members so that His Body can be built up to the fullest extent. Some may have the concept that if they can help someone to be saved and baptized, that is sufficient. However, God is not satisfied until every saved and baptized one is a living member who can be useful for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>It is not easy to raise up a newly baptized one to be a living, functioning member of the Body of Christ. This may require two years of diligent and patient labor. Today in the Lord's recovery there is no better atmosphere in which the new ones can be raised up than the vital groups. If we endeavor to bring the newly gained and baptized ones into the vital groups to be with the other vital members, the new ones too will become living and functioning members. Therefore, we need to make it a priority to bring our newly saved ones to the vital group meetings.</P><P>We also need to help the new ones to participate in the fellowship of the group meetings. This fellowship is the flow of life among the members in the group. In such a fellowship, the new ones will be nourished and cherished by the vital members of the group as nursing mothers. The apostle Paul considered himself a nursing mother in his care for the young believers in Thessalonica (1 Thes. 2:7), and we need to follow his pattern. The vital persons within the group become the mothers who can nourish and cherish the new ones through the fellowship in the group meetings.</P><P>The newly saved ones also need to be helped to learn to function in the mutual teaching and mutual perfecting. They need to be equipped and perfected, according to Paul's word in Ephesians 4:12, unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ. This kind of equipping and perfecting takes place mainly through the mutual teaching. This mutual teaching is one of the major items of the vital group practice. The mutual teaching can be carried out through the mutual asking and answering of questions. The new ones need to be helped to participate in the mutual teaching through the asking and answering of questions in the vital group meetings. The members of the vital groups can ask and answer questions regarding matters such as God's economy, the Lord's recovery, justification, reconciliation, sanctification, the confession of sins, the exercise of the spirit, and the ground of the church. Many matters can be brought up in the atmosphere of the vital group meetings, and through the mutual teaching by all the group members, an all-inclusive teaching can come forth that no single member could give by himself. This will render the best perfecting to the new ones in the crucial matters related to life and truth. We should not underestimate the capacity of the newly gained ones. Recently, two young churches have been raised up in Russia in the cities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Within six months some of the newly gained ones in these two churches were able to speak forth the truths with a certain measure. If we are faithful to learn how to impart life and teach the highest truths in the proper way, eventually the newly gained ones will become perfected and equipped.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THEY SHOULD INSTRUCT AND GUIDE<br>THE NEWLY BAPTIZED ONES TO GAIN OTHERS<br>AND TO PROPHESY IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS</H2><P>In the group meetings we must also take the opportunity to instruct and guide the newly saved and baptized ones to gain others and to prophesy in the church meetings. Before we can help the new ones to be fruitful, we must first become patterns to them by being fruitful branches ourselves. We need to help them to see that our goal is not merely to win souls but to convert sinners into living members of the Body of Christ. We should not delay in bringing our new ones into this matter, because they are able to gain others immediately after they are saved. Finally, we must bring the new ones into a vision that prophesying builds up the church (1 Cor. 14:4). We must also help them to learn to prophesy by practicing to speak the Lord's word.</P><P>We all must rise up to be vitalized and endeavor to rid ourselves of any kind of deadness and lukewarmness. The only way to accomplish this is to be desperate and absolute to practice all that the Lord has shown us concerning the vital groups. The vital groups are the only thing that can renew the Lord's recovery and bring in the prevailing increase.</P><P>6 brothers</P></body></html>
