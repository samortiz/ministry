   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE LIFE THROUGH FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the critical point of the Christian faith; it is the peak of the salvation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We want to see how Christ can be our life in a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order that we may know and contact Him, God was incarnated to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through this man we come to realize what God is like.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This man was none other than Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was God clothed with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Physically speaking, the body of Jesus was no different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the life within Him was absolutely of another category.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His life was purely the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It had the characteristics of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God bestows to those who are in Christ the very same life that was embodied in Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>DEATH RELEASED LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, when Jesus was walking on the earth, the life that He possessed could not be imparted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His life was bound by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was confined to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It could not enter into the believers to be their new source of existence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, Christ had to die in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When He died, the bondage of the flesh was shattered and His life was released.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In John 12:24 the Lord said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord compared Himself to a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is life embodied in the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the grain falls into the ground and dies, the life within is released, and much fruit is brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, God did not stop at incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He went through death in order that His life would be freed from the flesh and released into the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is no longer limited by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His life can now be dispensed unreservedly to all who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The death of Christ on the cross was not merely for redemption of sin but also for the release of divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The latter is the primary goal, while the former is only a remedial necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>DEATH ALSO SOLVES THE PROBLEM OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, before we could receive this life, God also had to solve our problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the death of Christ had the aspect of redemption with it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now God has a just ground upon which He can dispense life to us, and we also have a proper standing to receive boldly this new life from God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is a passage in the Bible with which we are quite familiar.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I wish to point out two things in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, it does not say that God loves sinners; it says that God loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The world denotes humanity in general and has a higher sense than sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I do not mean to say that God does not love sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the purpose of God in this verse the bestowing of eternal life is not granted to sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sinners are at a lower level than God's basic requirement for humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is a basic standard upon which God can freely dispense life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But a sinner is below that standard.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, before anything could be realized, God had to forgive and deal with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The death of Christ paid the ransom for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we need no longer be sinners.</S>
