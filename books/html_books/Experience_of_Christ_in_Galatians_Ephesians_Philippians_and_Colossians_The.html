We will begin by reading a number of portions from the first three chapters.<p>Verse 9 of chapter one says, &#8220;Therefore we also, since the day we heard of it, do not cease praying and asking on your behalf that you may be filled with the full knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding.&#8221; This verse reflects the prayer and desire of the apostle that we be filled with the full knowledge of God&#8217;s will. We should not consider that God&#8217;s will here is concerning minor things, such as whether or not to buy a pair of shoes, whether we should rent a house, or where we should go to college. Rather, this refers to God&#8217;s greater will, even the greatest will of God.<p>God&#8217;s will is His plan or purpose, and the knowledge of His will is in all spiritual wisdom and understanding. Wisdom is something in the spirit, while understanding is something in the mind. To realize and understand the will of God, we first need wisdom in our spirit and then understanding in our mind.<p>Verse 12 says, &#8220;Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light.&#8221; The Greek text here refers not to an inheritance but to a lot, a portion. This lot is the portion of the saints that is given to us by God. This allotted portion is Christ. God has no intention to give us something else as our allotted portion. The portion, the lot, given to us by God is the Christ of God. Beginning from verse 13, the apostle tells us who Christ as our God-given portion is. Verses 13 and 14 say, &#8220;Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&#8221; The portion given by God to us is the Son of God&#8217;s love, and in this One we have redemption through His blood.<p>If possible, I would ask you to memorize all these words and phrases. I would even encourage some young brothers to memorize the whole book of Colossians, from the first to the last verse. Then you can speak this book from memory. At least we need to remember all the items concerning Christ.<p>Verse 15 says, &#8220;Who is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation.&#8221; God is invisible, unseen, yet He has an image. This image is Christ. Image here refers to expression. God is invisible, but He has an expression, who is Christ. Verses 16 through 20 continue, &#8220;Because in Him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him. And He is before all things, and all things cohere in Him; and He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things; for in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross-through Him, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens.&#8221; Not only were we humans reconciled by Christ to God; all creatures, the things on the earth and in the heavens, were also reconciled.<p>In these verses there are more items concerning Christ that we should memorize. He is the image of God, the Firstborn of all creation, the means of all creation, the One through whom all things were created, the One in whom all things cohere, the Head of the Body, the Firstborn from the dead, the One who has the first place, the One in whom all the fullness was pleased to dwell, and the One in whom all creatures were reconciled to God.<p>Verses 25 and 26 say, &#8220;Of which I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God, the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints.&#8221; Stewardship means &#8220;economy,&#8221; &#8220;administration,&#8221; or &#8220;dispensation.&#8221; From the very beginning throughout all the generations, this mystery has been hidden.<p>Verse 27 says, &#8220;To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&#8221; Bible students have differing opinions as to what the antecedent of which is. Some say it is the riches, while others say it is this mystery. I prefer to say that which refers to this mystery, but whether it is riches or mystery, it is the same. We may speak of the riches of our bank account; the riches and the bank account are the same thing. Without the riches, the bank account means nothing. Likewise, without the riches in verse 27, the mystery means nothing. The mystery depends on the riches, and the riches are the contents of the mystery. The King James Version incorrectly says, &#8220;What is the riches of the glory of this mystery,&#8221; using is in the singular. The riches are not one item only. They are the many items of the mystery as the contents of the mystery. This mystery is Christ, not Christ alone, but Christ in you, the hope of glory. Christ is in us for today, and He is our hope of glory for tomorrow.<p>Verse 28 begins, &#8220;Whom we announce.&#8221; What Paul announced was not dispensations, prophecy, teachings, doctrines, gifts, or tongues. I say this again because people stress these things too much. Who is the whom that Paul announced? It is Christ. This verse continues, &#8220;Admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom.&#8221; Paul not only announced but he admonished and taught. Some say that I am a trouble maker; if I am, it is because I desire to admonish every man and teach every man. We need not only to announce but also to admonish and teach. We need to admonish because there are too many things to distract people from the central item, which is Christ. Admonishing is negative, while teaching is positive. We admonish and teach not only all men but every man, one by one.<p>Verse 28 ends, &#8220;That we may present every man full-grown in Christ.&#8221; The Greek word here is not perfect but full-grown. The word perfect is too simple; it does not give the feeling that we need to grow. The word here implies maturity, growth in a full way to its fullest extent. This is not maturity in doctrine, teaching, speaking in tongues, or gifts of healing. It is to be mature, full-grown, in Christ. We have to grow in Christ, and we must mature in Christ. Verse 29 continues, &#8220;For which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power.&#8221; The apostle strove, struggled, and fought to labor in this way, not by his own human strength but by the divine power which operated in him.<p>Chapter two reveals more concerning Christ. Verses 2 and 3 say, &#8220;That their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love and unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ, in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.&#8221; Then verse 6 says, &#8220;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.&#8221; I like these two words: received and walk. We have received Christ, and now we walk in Him. Verse 7 continues, &#8220;Having been rooted and being built up in Him, and being established in the faith even as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.&#8221; In Greek, having been rooted is in the perfect tense, while being built is in the present. We have been rooted in Christ; this is an accomplished matter. Now we are in the process of being built up in Him; this is still going on.<p>Verse 8 is a warning: &#8220;Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.&#8221; To be carried off as spoil is worse than being damaged. It is to be brought into captivity, to be captured. Verses 9 and 10 say, &#8220;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you have been made full in Him, who is the Head of all rule and authority.&#8221; Fullness in verse 9 and made full in verse 10 are from the same Greek root. The fullness dwells in Christ, and we have been made full in Him. We may illustrate fullness and being made full with a glass containing blue dye. If we put a white handkerchief into the glass, it will be made blue, because the blue dye is in the glass. The fullness dwells in Christ, and now we have been put into Christ, &#8220;dipped&#8221; into Him, so in Him we have been made full.<p>Verses 11 through 13 say that we have been baptized, buried together with Christ, raised with Him, and made alive together with Him. Christ also blotted out the ordinances and stripped off the rulers and authorities (vv. 14-15). Stripping off may be compared to dusting, like the way we dust off our clothes. When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, the principalities, the evil powers, came to Him, but the Lord brought all this &#8220;dirt&#8221; to the cross. Through His death on the cross He dusted them off.<p>Verses 16 and 17 say, &#8220;Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath, which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ.&#8221; The apostle mentions five items: eating, drinking, a feast for joy, a new moon for a new beginning, and the Sabbath for rest. Food, drink, joy, the new beginning, and rest are all a shadow, but the body is of Christ. Verse 19 goes on to speak of the Head, the Body, the joints for the supply of the Body, and the sinews for the knitting together of the members of the Body.<p>Chapter three begins, &#8220;If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth&#8221; (vv. 1-2). In this book Paul speaks of the mind several times. In 1:21 he said that the Colossians had been enemies in their mind because of evil works, in 2:18 the defrauders are vainly puffed up by the mind set on the flesh, and here in 3:2 the believers should set their mind on the things which are above.<p>Verse 3 says that we have died, and our life is hidden with Christ in God, and verse 4 says that when Christ our life is manifested, we also will be manifested with Him in glory. Following this, verses 10 and 11 say, &#8220;And have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&#8221; Finally, verses 15 and 16 say, &#8220;And let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts, to which also you were called in one Body; and be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE VISION OF CHRIST IN GALATIANS, EPHESIANS, PHILIPPIANS, AND COLOSSIANS</h2><p>For a long time I have felt that we must come together to see the vision of Christ in four short books: Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. Galatians and Ephesians each have six chapters, and Philippians and Colossians each have four, for a total of twenty chapters. More than thirty years ago, in 1933, I was surprised to realize how these four books relate to one another. At that time I gave some messages on these books in Shanghai, and since that time the Lord has continually opened my eyes to see more and more. In all my Bibles, this portion is the most worn out. It is easy for me to find the book of Ephesians, because after I have a Bible for only fifteen months, the pages around Ephesians are already worn. In a training in Taipei in 1953 we had a study of the book of Ephesians, which comprised more than five hundred pages, almost one hundred pages for each chapter. We cannot exhaust reading these four short books. They are short but truly profound. If we would take them out of the Bible, we could not know Christ adequately. The full revelation and complete vision of Christ is in these four books. I am sorry that many Christians do not speak much about these books. They talk about Ephesians a little, but in a very doctrinal, objective way.<h2 class=head2>The Gospels Being a Full Record of the Life of the Lord Jesus</h2><p>The arrangement of the books of the New Testament is under the sovereignty of the Lord. Matthew is first, and Revelation is last. To put Revelation first and Matthew last is like putting the feet on the top and the head on the bottom. The four Gospels first give us a full record of the life of the Lord Jesus, a full biography of the Lord Jesus on the earth. They tell us who the Lord is and what He did for us.<h2 class=head2>Acts and Romans Revealing the Body of Christ</h2><p>After the history of the Lord Jesus in the Gospels, Acts is a record of the preaching of Christ to others. By this preaching people were saved to be the members of the Body of Christ, so after Acts there is Romans to tell us what the members of the Body are. All the members of the Body of Christ were originally sinners. The first two and a half chapters of Romans tell us that we were sinful and under the condemnation of God, but we were justified through the blood of Christ. Then the subsequent chapters tell us that we were transferred out of Adam and into Christ. Now we are in Christ, and we need to walk in the Spirit of Christ. In this way we become the members of the Body to live the Body life.<h2 class=head2>The Epistles to the Corinthians Unveiling Christ as the Solution to All Problems in the Church</h2><p>After Romans, the two Epistles to the Corinthians tell us the way to solve all the problems in the church, the Body. First Corinthians speaks of doctrines and gifts. The Corinthians, like theologians, discussed many matters, such as marriage, going to law courts, sacrifices to idols, and resurrection. They even argued about Paul&#8217;s apostleship. They were the experts in studying and discussing the teachings and doctrines. On the one hand they liked to talk about doctrines, but on the other hand, they also liked to exercise all manner of gifts. These were the peculiar characteristics of the Corinthians. However, all their troubles and problems came from the doctrines and the gifts.<p>According to the two thousand-year history of the church, all divisions, confusion, denominations, and problems come from these two sources: doctrines and gifts. If we are frank and honest, we will admit that the more doctrines and gifts we have, the more divisions we have. Every division and denomination is built upon either a certain doctrine or a certain kind of gift. I am standing here to challenge this. Recently I received some letters from the Far East in which some brothers insisted on nine points and wanted to know my attitude toward them. I replied that my attitude is toward Christ, not about doctrine. I do not like to talk about doctrine. I told those brothers that we simply need to help people to believe in the Lord Jesus, to personally receive Him as their Savior, the Son of God who was incarnated as a man, died on the cross for our sins, and resurrected on the third day. Then we need to help people to love this Christ, know this Christ, experience this Christ, and be built up as the church to express this Christ. As long as we do that, that is wonderful; that is good enough. Let us forget everything else.<p>We are not here for a certain kind of doctrine. Some may say, &#8220;But, Brother Lee, you are here for the doctrine of Christ.&#8221; Praise the Lord, that is right! We all have to be for the &#8220;doctrine&#8221; of Christ. Then some may say, &#8220;You are not only for Christ; you are also for the church.&#8221; That is right also. We are fighting for nothing other than Christ and His Body, the church. We cannot solve the problems in the church by teaching and gifts; it is only by Christ, and this One crucified (1 Cor. 2:2). We, the members of Christ&#8217;s Body, have been put on the cross, and now we are in Christ. Christ is the answer to solve all the problems.<p>At the beginning of 1 Corinthians Paul says, &#8220;For indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom&#8221; (1:22). If we seek signs and miracles, we are following the Jews. The signs are related to the gifts, and knowledge, wisdom, is related to teaching and doctrine. In contrast to this, the apostle said, &#8220;But we preach Christ crucified&#8221; (v. 23), and in the following chapter he said, &#8220;For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified&#8221; (v. 2). Then in the following book, 2 Corinthians, the apostle Paul tells us about his own experience. He experienced Christ under any kind of circumstance.<h2 class=head2>Four Short Books Providing Us with the Full Vision of Christ</h2><p>After the two Epistles to the Corinthians, we have the four short books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. These four books reveal Christ in a full way. After the two Corinthians, we need these four books to give us a full revelation, a full vision, of the very Christ who is the answer to all the problems in the church life. These books tell us first who Christ is. Second, they tell us how this Christ must be very subjective to us, that is, how Christ has to be worked into us to be the inward, indwelling Christ. Third, they tell us the secret of experiencing and partaking of Christ. Then fourth, they tell us what is the result, the issue, of the experience of Christ.<p>Thus, these four books cover four points. As the basis, Colossians tells us who Christ is. In order to know who Christ is, we must read the short book of Colossians. Then Galatians tells us that the all-inclusive Christ has to be wrought into us. He has to live in us and even be formed in us. Following this, Philippians tells us the secret of how to experience this indwelling Christ, who is the all-inclusive One. Finally, Ephesians reveals that the issue, the result, of the experience of Christ is the church.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE FOCUS OF GOD&#8217;S WILL AND ECONOMY, AS THE MYSTERY OF GOD, AND AS THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS</h2><p>Colossians speaks of the eternal will of God, the economy of God, the mystery of God, and the God-given portion to us. What is the will of God? What does God intend to dispense to us in His economy? What is the mystery of God? And what is the portion God gives to us? The answer to all these questions is Christ. God&#8217;s will is to work Christ into us, in His economy God intends to dispense Christ to us, Christ is the mystery of God, and Christ is the portion God gives us. That is why in this short book we have such great terms as His will, the stewardship (economy) of God, the mystery of God, and the allotted portion of the saints (Col. 1:9, 25; 2:2; 1:12). All these are Christ.<p>God has one will in the universe. Romans 12:2 speaks in the singular of &#8220;the will of God..., that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.&#8221; Some may say that the will of God is to go to a certain college or to get married. However, if our going to college is not for Christ, that is not the will of God. Likewise, if we marry without Christ, that also is not the will of God. Whatever we do in Christ, with Christ, and for Christ is the will of God, because God&#8217;s will is simply Christ and nothing else. God&#8217;s will is to make Christ everything to us. It is that we take Christ as everything, that we take Him as life to live by Him and give Him the first place, the preeminence, in all our life.<p>For something to be of the will of God, it must be in Christ, with Christ, and for Christ. Even if I minister here, yet not in Christ, with Christ, and for Christ, this ministry is not the will of God. God has only one will. There is no need to check something in another way; simply check whether or not that thing is in Christ, with Christ, and for Christ. There is no need to wait and analyze. If we can boldly say with full assurance that we are doing something in Christ, with Christ, and for Christ, then it is of the Lord.<p>I say again, God&#8217;s economy is to dispense Christ into us, and this very Christ is the portion of the saints. We have no other portion. If you ask me what I have, I will tell you that I have nothing, yet I have everything, because I have Christ as my portion. If we receive something other than Christ as our portion, we will be cheated. In the Old Testament, Solomon the wise king told us that all things under the sun are vanity (Eccl. 1:1-11), and in the New Testament, Paul counted all things as refuse, as dung (Phil. 3:8). Even a Ph.D. degree is dung, and all the tall, attractive buildings in the affluent part of this city are dung. God would cheat us if He gave us these things as our portion. These are not our God-given portion. The portion God gives us is the reality, that is Christ, the Son of God. All things are vanity of vanities; only Christ is real. He is grace and reality (John 1:17). Praise Him, He is our portion! I am satisfied because I have the unique, universal portion, the portion of the saints, which is Christ Himself. God&#8217;s intention is simply to give us this portion.<h2 class=head1>WHAT CHRIST IS TOWARD GOD</h2><p>Who is this portion? Colossians first tells us that Christ our portion is the image, the expression, of the invisible God (1:15a). What God is, what God has, and what God has done and can do are all embodied in Christ and expressed in and through this Christ. Christ is the very expression of the very God. We may think that we need Christ only to be our Savior to save us from hell and take us to heaven. However, Christ being the image of the invisible God is much higher than this.<p>Within Christ as the image, the expression, of God dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily (v. 19; 2:9). The fullness of God is in Him, and He is the very embodiment of God. Without Him, or outside of Him, we do not have God and we cannot find God.<p>This Christ is also the mystery of God (v. 2). As the mystery of God, Christ is also the history of God. The whole &#8220;story&#8221; of God is in Christ and is Christ. Whatever God has been, is, and shall be is in Him. Moreover, all that God planned and purposed to do is for Him, so that He might have the preeminence, the first place, in all things (1:18). This pertains to the relationship of Christ toward God. With God, everything is Christ and is in Christ.<h2 class=head1>WHAT CHRIST IS CONCERNING CREATION</h2><p>Then concerning creation, Christ is the first item, the Firstborn of all creation (v. 15b). I do not have the human words to explain this. In a word, Christ is the Creator as well as the creature. He is the One who created, and He is also the One who was created.<p>All creation was made in Him, through Him, and unto Him (v. 16). In Him and through Him refer to the past, while unto Him refers to His inheritance in the future. What then of the present? At the present time, all things cohere in Him. He is the first of all the creatures, and all creatures were made through Him in the past, exist in Him in the present, and are unto Him in the future. How big is creation? Millions of solar systems comprise one galaxy, billions of galaxies form the universe, and no one has found what is at the center of it all. All this was created through Christ, has its existence in Christ, and is unto Christ. All the scientists realize that there is an unknown power in the universe. This power is Christ Himself. Praise Him!<h2 class=head1>WHAT CHRIST IS IN REDEMPTION</h2><p>Redemption is in Christ, and Christ accomplished redemption (v. 14). In this redemption He dealt with our sins and the world, He abolished the ordinances, and He dusted off the evil forces (2:14-15). The whole universe is full of &#8220;dirt.&#8221; When Christ put on the flesh, He took all this dirt upon Himself. Then He put this flesh with its dirt onto the cross, and by the death of the cross, He dusted away, stripped off, all the dirt. In particular, He dusted away the principalities, powers, dominions, and evil powers in the air. His redemption includes all of this. Moreover, Christ accomplished redemption to reconcile, to bring back, not only us the believers but also all things in the heavens and on earth, all the things that were created through Him, subsist in Him, and are unto Him (1:20).<h2 class=head1>WHAT CHRIST IS IN THE NEW CREATION</h2><p>In the new creation, Christ is the Head of the Body, the church, and the Firstborn from the dead. Christ is the Firstborn in two ways: the Firstborn of the old creation and the Firstborn of the new creation (vv. 15, 18).<h2 class=head1>WHAT CHRIST IS AS THE BODY OF ALL SHADOWS</h2><p>All positive things in the universe are shadows; they are not the reality. A man is not the real husband, and his son is not the real son. No matter what kind of light someone is under, if he does not have Christ, he is still in darkness, because that light is not the real light and the sunshine is not the real sunshine. Our clothing is not the real clothing. Regardless of how good our clothing is, if we do not have Christ, we are naked. Christ is also the real food and drink. The reality of all things is Christ (2:16-17).<p>We should not enjoy the shadows too much. All the shadows simply signify the reality. My photograph is only a shadow of me; it is not the real me. The real me is a living person. The food we eat every day is only a &#8220;photograph&#8221; of the real food. We should not be cheated and fooled by the photographs. They simply signify Christ as the real One. We do not care for eating, drinking, a feast, a new moon, or the Sabbath. If we do not have Christ, we do not have a &#8220;new moon,&#8221; a new start. Christ is our morning. Whenever we meet Christ, touch Christ, and experience Christ, we have the sense that we have a new start. Moreover, Christ is the real feast for joy. If we do not have Christ, we do not have the real joy. Christ is also the real Sabbath; without Him we have no rest.<p>We cannot exhaust how much Christ is. Christ is everything to God, to creation, in redemption, in the new creation, and to all physical, material things, which are nothing but a shadow of this Christ. How much Christ is to us! Colossians tells us that He is our life today and our hope for the future. I am afraid that we do not realize Christ to such an extent.<h2 class=head1>THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</h2><p>Colossians speaks not only about who Christ is but also about the experience of Christ. Verse 6 of chapter two says, &#8220;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.&#8221; The following verse says that we have been rooted in Him. We are like little plants, and Christ is the soil, the earth. Moreover, we are now being built up in Him. Only Christ is so important to us. He is everything to us; He is our life and our hope, we have been rooted in Him, and now we are built up in Him. Therefore, we have to live by Him and walk in Him. We should not be beguiled, distracted, or sidetracked by anything. Philosophy, empty deceit, the elements of the world, and the worship of angels can beguile, distract, and sidetrack us. We must pay our full attention to this Christ. Moreover, we need to realize that this Christ is the very life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit. If Christ were not the Spirit, He could not be life to us, and if He were not in our spirit, we could not experience Him, enjoy Him, and take Him as our life. Now day by day we have to live by Him and walk in Him.<p>We need to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our hearts and the word of Christ dwell in us richly (3:15-16). The words that He speaks are spirit and are life (John 6:63).<p>What I have spoken here is just a sketch. Please read Colossians again and again, and pray about what you have heard and about what you understand. Christ is so much to us. Now we have to praise Him. We have received Him, so now we must walk in Him, having been rooted in Him and being built up in Him and with Him. He is our life for today and our hope for the future. Therefore, we must learn to preach Him, admonishing others not to be sidetracked from Him by other things. We also need to teach Him to others, to grow, and to help others to grow until we can present them to God full-grown in Christ.<p>When we have this kind of vision of Christ, we will declare that doctrines, teachings, gifts, miracles, and signs mean nothing. God is not for those things; all those things are for Christ. If there were a number of miracles among us today, however, we may all be distracted away from the indwelling Christ and the inner life; we may pay our full attention to the miracles. In the Gospel of John the Lord did many signs. The crowds were impressed, but the Lord gained very few of them. He would not entrust Himself to those who came to Him because of the miracles (John 2:23-25). The Lord is truly wise, and He knows that what we really need is the inner life. We need to know Christ.<p>In the book of Colossians there are no tongues, gifts, and miracles. Still, some people today pay attention to these things yet neglect the Christ revealed in this book. Let us come back to the Christ in Colossians, to know Christ in an inner way, in the way of life. To know Christ requires a vision, a revelation. Therefore, we have to pray. In these days let us pray that the Lord would open our eyes that we may see Christ who is the mystery of God, the center of God&#8217;s economy, and the portion of the saints given to us by God. Let us pray in this way that we may know Him as our life and experience Him in a full way. He is everything to us. This must not be a doctrine; it must be a real vision to us. We have to fight for this. That is why we need to know the book of Colossians.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST IN GALATIANS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gal. 1:13-16; 2:19-20; 3:1-3, 14, 24-28; 4:6, 19; 5:1-2, 4, 16-17, 22-25; 6:1, 8, 14-18</h1><p>In the previous message, we saw Christ in a full way in Colossians. Colossians is a short book, but the revelation of Christ in it is full. It is a full revelation in a brief way. It shows Christ in His relationship with God, creation, redemption, and the church as the new creation, and it reveals that He is the reality of all the positive physical, material things, which are only shadows of Christ. Moreover, Christ is life to us for today and hope to us for tomorrow. All these items are very great. Christ is related to God, to creation, to redemption, and to the church. He is the reality of all things, and He is subjectively related to us. We have to clearly know all these items and properly keep them in mind. Then we have to apply this Christ to ourselves as our life to us today and hope to us for the future.<p>In His relationship to God, Christ is the image, the expression, of God, and all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him. He is the mystery-the history and &#8220;story&#8221;-of God, and He has the preeminence. In God&#8217;s plan, economy, and in all things God purposed to give Christ the first place in everything.<p>In Christ&#8217;s relationship with creation, He is the Firstborn, the first item, of all creation. All things were created in Him and through Him. Moreover, all things exist, subsist, and cohere in Him at the present time and are for Him in the future.<p>In His relationship with redemption, Christ is the Redeemer. He accomplished redemption, dealing with many things, such as sin, self, and the world. He also dealt with the evil forces by &#8220;dusting&#8221; off the principalities, powers, and dominions in the heavenly places. All those powerful elements were dusted off by Christ through His cross.<p>In His new creation, the church, Christ is the Head and the Firstborn from the dead. He is the first in resurrection. Such a Christ is the reality of all the things we need and enjoy. Whatever we see, possess, and enjoy are all shadows; the reality of all these things is Christ. Moreover, such a Christ is our portion. As our portion, He is our life within for today, and He is the hope of glory for the future.<p>I have simply named the items of what Christ is. We cannot speak these things adequately in such a short way. Most Christians know Christ only as the Son of God, the Savior who died for us on the cross, not realizing Christ in the way revealed by Colossians. I hate that I do not have the time to explain more so that you can be deeply impressed with such a Christ.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING EVERYTHING IN THE NEW MAN</h2><p>In addition to the six points above, this Christ, who is our life and hope, is everything in the new man. The new man is the church, the Body of Christ. In the new man there is nothing but Christ. What then of all the different people in the Body? As we shall see, they have been put to death and buried; now Christ in them replaces them. In the church every item must be Christ. In the new man there is no Greek, no Jew, no barbarian, no Scythian, no slave, and no free man, but Christ is all and in all. All the old creation has been put to death and buried.<h2 class=head1>EXPERIENCING CHRIST BY BEING INCORPORATED WITH HIM</h2><p>Christ has been put into us, and we have also been put into Christ. In Colossians, as in other books, there is the little word in. Verse 27 of chapter one says, &#8220;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&#8221; In 2:10 we also have the phrase in Him: &#8220;You have been made full in Him.&#8221; This shows that not only is Christ in us, but we are also in Him, as verse 7 says, &#8220;Having been rooted and being built up in Him.&#8221; He is in us, and we are in Him. He is living in us, so we have to walk in Him. Eventually, who is in whom? In this way we are identified with Christ. We may use the term incorporated. This is a spiritual, heavenly incorporation.<p>To be incorporated with someone is to be entirely related to him. By incorporating with us Christ becomes us, sharing all our responsibilities, weaknesses, and all things. If someone is in debt and we incorporate with him, we have to bear his debts. You may be a millionaire, and I may be a poor person with many debts. If you incorporate with me, then legally and judicially you will bear my debts, but at the same time I will possess your wealth. Mine is the debt, and yours is the wealth, but now what is mine is yours, and what is yours is mine. This is why Christ needed to bear our sins. Christ needed to bear our sins because He is incorporated with us.<p>This is not merely an exchange. A key item of today&#8217;s Christian theology is that Christ and we have an exchange. Our experience, however, is not a matter of exchange but of incorporation. Christ incorporates with us, so He becomes one with us and even becomes us. At the same time, we are one with Christ, and we even become Christ. Whatever He is and whatever He has is ours. He is in us, and we are in Him. Because He is in us, He bears all our responsibilities, and because we are in Him, we have the ground, privilege, and right to enjoy what He is and what He has. This means that we are one with Christ, and Christ is one with us.<p>In Christ we have been buried (2:12). Someone may be dead but still be present. To be buried is the finality. We have been rooted in Him, and now we are being built up in Him, because we are not only buried with Him, but we are also raised, resurrected, with Him. Now He is living within us as our life for the present time and as our hope for the future. Therefore, Christ is everything.<p>I do not know why today&#8217;s Christianity misses this mark. People today pay attention to many other things, such as election, predestination, and rapture, yet they have neglected and still neglect the simple, important, and obvious matters. I have the strong feeling and the deep assurance that in these last days the Lord must recover these matters. All other things are just the &#8220;wrapper.&#8221; The more precious things in a department store or jewelry store have more wrappings. I have been to Japan several times. It is very interesting to see how the Japanese patiently wrap the items in their stores. Eventually, they exhaust your patience by taking so long to put on all the beautiful paper wrappings. When we bring an item home, however, the little children appreciate the wrapping more than the contents, which are the central item. The contents are nothing to them; they are not as good to play with as the box and the wrapping paper. Poor Christianity! So many people just like the &#8220;wrappings.&#8221; They do not appreciate the precious content, which is Christ Himself. The sixty-six books of the Bible are just the wrapping; Christ Himself is the precious content.<p>In these days we must see the very Christ revealed in the short books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. In the future the Lord will give us the time and the burden to minister more and more of Christ from all these books. From Colossians we must remember eight points: seven related to Christ and one related to our experience of Christ, that is, that Christ is in us and we are in Him.<h2 class=head1>THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST IN GALATIANS</h2><p>Let us begin our study of Galatians by reading some passages from each chapter. Galatians 1:13-16 says, &#8220;For you have heard of my manner of life formerly in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it. And I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more abundantly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers. But when it pleased God, who set me apart from my mother&#8217;s womb and called me through His grace, to reveal His Son in me that I might announce Him as the gospel among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood.&#8221; Paul did not announce doctrines, teachings, or other matters; he announced Christ, the Son of God.<p>Verses 19 and 20 of chapter two say, &#8220;For I through law have died to law that I might live to God. I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.&#8221; Following this, verses 1 though 3 of chapter three say, &#8220;O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed crucified? This only I wish to learn from you, Did you receive the Spirit out of the works of law or out of the hearing of faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?&#8221; Verse 14 says, &#8220;In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith,&#8221; and verse 24 says, &#8220;So then the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ that we might be justified out of faith.&#8221; A child-conductor was one who conducted a student to the schoolmaster. Verses 25 through 27 continue, &#8220;But since faith has come, we are no longer under a child-conductor. For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&#8221; To put on Christ may be compared to putting on a garment. In baptism we have put on Christ. Verse 28 concludes: &#8220;There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<p>Verse 6 of chapter four says, &#8220;And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!&#8221;, and verse 19 says, &#8220;My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you.&#8221; In chapter five, verses 1, 2, and 4 say concerning the yoke of the law, &#8220;It is for freedom that Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again. Behold, I Paul say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing....You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace.&#8221; Verses 16 and 17 say, &#8220;But I say, Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other that you would not do the things that you desire.&#8221; Verses 22 through 25 say, &#8220;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control; against such things there is no law. But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&#8221;<p>In chapter six, verses 1 and 8 say, &#8220;Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, looking to yourself lest you also be tempted....For he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life.&#8221; Finally, verses 14 through 18 say, &#8220;But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world. For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters. And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God. Henceforth let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brands of Jesus. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S PURPOSE THAT CHRIST BE WROUGHT INTO US</h2><p>The specific characteristic of Galatians is that the Christ revealed in Colossians needs to be wrought into us. We must stress again that God has no intention to do anything else. In the entire universe God has only one intention, that is, to work Christ into us. God had no intention in creating the universe other than for His purpose to work Christ into a group of human beings. God had no intention in creating the many human beings except to work Christ into them. Likewise, God had no intention in accomplishing redemption other than to work Christ into us. Similarly, He has no intention to give us teachings and doctrines outside of His purpose to work Christ into us.<h2 class=head1>THE DISTRACTIONS FROM GOD&#8217;S PURPOSE</h2><p>God gives us many material things because we need them to exist. These things, however, are for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose that Christ be wrought into man. We need food, clothing, housing, and many material things in order to live, so that we may exist for the purpose of Christ being wrought into us to make us the very expression, the vessel, to contain Him. However, look at the situation today. The unbelievers are distracted from God&#8217;s central purpose by the material things. The enemy of God is very subtle. All the unbelievers, the worldly people, do not care for Christ. They only care for their living-their food, drink, housing, and enjoyment. They have been and are still distracted by and drawn to all these material things from Christ.<p>In addition to the created material things, God also gave the Old Testament to the Jews. The Old Testament was given to reveal Christ to them, to keep them for Christ, and to bring them to Christ. However, even the Old Testament was utilized by the enemy, Satan, to distract the Jews from Christ. They were and still are distracted from Christ by the Old Testament and are drawn to the Old Testament. They are &#8220;addicted&#8221; to the Old Testament; they care only for it and not for Christ. The Pharisees, Sadducees, scribes, lawyers, and even Saul of Tarsus were one hundred percent for the Old Testament and for the Jewish religion, and not for Christ. Just as the Gentiles are the worldly people, the Jews are the religious people. The enemy can utilize everything, even the good things given by God to fulfill His purpose, to distract people from God&#8217;s purpose. The enemy utilized the Old Testament and the Jewish religion.<p>Do you not believe that the enemy can utilize even the New Testament? Christians are distracted from Christ by the letter of the New Testament and drawn to the letter of the New Testament. The history of the last five centuries shows us this. Many people have been distracted from Christ and His Body by taking the teachings of the New Testament apart from Christ. Do not be offended when I speak like this; I have a burden from God to speak these things. All the gifts given by God are for the purpose of working Christ into us, but even the gifts are utilized by the enemy to distract people from Christ. Many people are attracted to the gifts; they are addicted to them, and they forget Christ. With their mouth they say, &#8220;Thank You, Jesus; praise Jesus!&#8221;, but in their living they forget about Him and live only for their gifts. They care for the gifts and not for Christ.<p>It is pitiful that the material things have been utilized by the enemy to distract the Gentiles from Christ, the religious things have been utilized to distract the Jews from Christ, and even the spiritual things have been utilized to distract Christians from Christ. The material things, the Old Testament, and the New Testament were given by God for the purpose of working Christ into us, but today the enemy of God, Satan, has utilized all these things to distract not only the Gentiles and Jews but also the Christians, even the seeking ones. How subtle this is!<h2 class=head1>A TURN FROM RELIGION TO CHRIST</h2><p>In Galatians we have an illustration of one who was seeking God yet was distracted. Paul was zealous for the Jewish religion, and he was ready to sacrifice his life for it. However, one day God revealed Christ in him (1:15-16a). That was a one hundred eighty degree turn for him, a turn from religion to Christ. In some ways many of us may still be religious. One day we should be able to say that in no way are we religious. I am concerned that many are still holding a certain doctrine. If I were to go to Mongolia, I would not have this concern; the Mongolians do not hold to Christian doctrine. If I were to minister Christ to them, they would simply receive Christ. But in America, as in Europe, when I minister Christ in the way of life, some ask, &#8220;What about the speaking in tongues in 1 Corinthians? And what about the kingdom in Matthew; is it something in this dispensation or for a future dispensation?&#8221; Recently I visited five different Christian meetings, and each one was a different case. They were all strong and even antagonistic.<p>In a brother&#8217;s home we spoke with someone about baptism. He was strong to say that water baptism means nothing, that every mention of baptism in the New Testament refers to a spiritual baptism. He was as strong as a tiger; if he were not a Christian, I am afraid that he might have attacked me. He asked me why we do not care for this spiritual baptism. I told him that I do not care for any doctrine; I only care for the living Christ. On another occasion a woman interrupted my ministering to ask if I believe in water baptism, saying that it is not possible to be saved without being baptized in water. She was strong in this matter, and she began to distribute tracts about water baptism. I laughed within myself and said, &#8220;How strange the situation is in America. First I met a brother who was strong to say we should not have water baptism, and now I meet a person who is strong to say that we need it.&#8221; I do not like to say too much on the negative side. I simply want to show you how poor the situation is.<p>In all the places I visited, I told people that I do not care for anything but Christ. More than thirty-five years ago I was childish, but throughout these years I have dropped the childish things. I do not want the &#8220;wrappings.&#8221; I do not go to the department store to get wrappings; I go to get the jewels. Sometimes when I travel, a brother or sister may give me a gift. I always take the wrapping off of it. The wrappings are just a burden, and I have to pay extra for the weight when I travel. I like to drop the wrappings and keep the thing itself. Depending on the situation, we may need some wrapping that we do not have, but we always need the content.<p>In my recent travels I also met a doctor who wrote about me, saying that I neglect the &#8220;great commission&#8221; concerning faith and baptism. This illustrates that it is so easy for people to be religious. Instead, we need the revelation of Christ. We need to drop the religious things and know Christ and keep Christ in reality. The Galatians were frustrated from Christ. Paul even said, &#8220;You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ&#8221; (5:4). They were brought to nought concerning Christ because they were paying attention to something other than Christ Himself. The apostle Paul, as an example, was religious, but he eventually became one hundred percent for Christ and not a bit for anything else. In no sense and in no way should we be religious. We must forget about religion and instead know Christ in a living way.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST LIVING IN US AND WE BEING IN HIM</h2><p>The purpose of the book of Galatians is to reveal that we need to experience Christ in the presence of God. Nothing can please God but Christ experienced by us. Christ must be not only righteousness but everything to us. According to Galatians, Christ must first be revealed in us. Then this Christ must live in us (2:20). We are familiar with these verses, but we may not pay attention to them. Do we really mean business that Christ has been revealed in us and is now living in us? Not only so, we have put on Christ, just as we put on a garment (3:27). That we have put on Christ means that we are put into Christ. Christ has been put into us, He is being revealed in us as our life, and we have been put into Christ. He is like a garment covering us.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING FORMED IN US</h2><p>In addition, Christ must be formed in us (4:19). We may use a glove to illustrate the matter of being formed. When we put our hand into a glove, the hand is in the glove but it is not formed in the glove until all the fingers are fixed in place. Gradually the thumb fits in place, and then the second, third, fourth, and fifth fingers; finally the entire hand is formed in the glove. Christ must be fully, thoroughly, wholly mingled with us in all our inward parts-in our mind, emotion, and will. We may have Christ in us only in a general way. We have Christ in our spirit as our life, but we may not have Christ in our mind as our thought. We also may not have Christ in our emotions as our love. Christ must even be our hate; we need to hate certain things by Christ and with Christ. We also must have Christ in our will as our decision and choice. Christ must be everything in our inward parts. He must be mingled with us in every part of our being. Then He will be formed in us, and we will be conformed to His image. This means that we will be absolutely one with Him, not only in life and nature but also in form, expression, and image.<p>Christ must be subjective to us. In more than one place, people have criticized our hymn that says, &#8220;Christ to me is so subjective&#8221; (Hymns, #537). Many people do not have the concept that Christ is subjective. Once when I had trouble with my car, a brother tried to explain the problem to me, but I could not understand all the mechanical terms. I simply took the car to a garage and let someone do the talking for me. Today too many Christians are like this concerning Christ. To speak about Christ being the life-giving Spirit causes havoc. They say, &#8220;Jesus Christ is the Lord and Savior. This is good enough. Don&#8217;t say anything beyond this.&#8221; This is the poor situation today. Today I still do not drive a car, because in order to drive I must understand things about the car. In the same way, in order to be a good, normal Christian, we have to know the details of who Christ is. Christ must be revealed in us, He must live in us, we have to put Him on, and He must be formed in us.<h2 class=head1>BEARING THE BRANDS OF JESUS AND CARING ONLY FOR THE NEW CREATION</h2><p>In addition, we should bear the brands of Jesus and care for neither circumcision nor uncircumcision (6:17, 15). We do not care about being religious or unreligious. We care for only one thing: the new creation. Who or what is the new creation? It is Christ in our spirit to be experienced by us. This is the principle of the new creation.<p>We need to apply these things to ourselves. Are we persons like Paul? Many people in today&#8217;s Christianity pay attention to something other than Christ. I am afraid some of us are also this way. We may say that we do not pay attention to the gifts, but we may still pay attention to something else other than Christ. We need to be delivered from so many other things.<h2 class=head1>RECEIVING THE SPIRIT</h2><p>The main items in Galatians are that Christ is revealed in us, Christ lives in us, we put on Christ, and Christ is formed in us. In principle, this means that we know Christ and live by Him in our spirit. In addition, the Spirit is mentioned several times in this book. The Christ who is revealed in us, who lives in us, whom we have put on, and who is being formed in us is the Spirit. This Spirit today is in our spirit. This is why at the close of this book Paul says, &#8220;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit&#8221; (6:18a). The grace of the Lord is nothing less than the Lord Himself, and this grace, which is Christ as the Spirit, is with our spirit. Verse 2 of chapter three tells us clearly that we have received the Spirit, and verse 14 says we have received the promise of the Spirit, that is, the Spirit promised by God. The Father is the source, the fountain of living water; the Son is the course; and the Spirit is the flow. The Father as the source is in the Son as the course, and the Son comes as the Spirit, the flow. This flow has come, has flowed, into us. When the Spirit of God comes into us, He comes with Christ and with the Father. The Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and this Spirit has come into us. Therefore, when verse 14 mentions the promised Spirit, it refers to God Himself dispensed into us.<p>God has dispensed Himself into us in His Son and through His Spirit. Today this wonderful Spirit is within our spirit. Therefore, what we need today is simply to walk by the Spirit and cooperate with this Spirit (5:16, 25). Galatians 6:1 tells us that even when we go to restore a fallen brother, we must do it in our spirit. We have to walk in the spirit, live in the spirit, and sow the seed in our spirit (v. 8). Whatever we are and whatever we do and work must be in the spirit, because the Triune God dwells in our spirit, and in our spirit we realize the very Christ as the Spirit. This is the way to contact Christ.<h2 class=head1>BEING SNARED BY DOCTRINES AND GIFTS</h2><p>It is too easy for a seeking Christian to be distracted by doctrine. If someone is indifferent toward the Lord, he does not care for doctrine, but when he is raised up by Him to seek Him, it is easy to seek only after doctrine. When I was young, and even until today, I have heard many people say, &#8220;This is a good truth. I like this truth.&#8221; It is also easy to be attracted by gifts and functions. May the Lord be merciful to us. We need to be adjusted to say that we are seeking not truth or doctrine but Christ. I want to know and experience Christ in this way.<p>These four books-Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians-teach many doctrines. This is true, but what are the doctrines about? They are doctrines about Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, and also the Spirit. These are not mere doctrines or teachings, however, but a heavenly vision. In these four books there are no miracles, gifts, or healings. There must be a reason for this. All Bible students agree that what God does not say in His word is as meaningful as what He does say. Why, then, in these four books that are so significant concerning Christ and His church is there nothing of gifts, healings, tongues, or miracles? The phrase works of power is used only in Galatians 3:5, probably referring to something in the past, at the beginning of their experience. We need to be delivered from the distracting things.<p>I have the deep feeling that my word and language are not adequate to express what is on my heart. When we were in the world, we were indifferent to the things of God; we simply did not care for doctrines or gifts. Once the Lord raised us up to seek Him, however, two snares were before us. One snare is seeking after doctrines and knowledge. We wanted to learn the doctrines of dispensations, predestination, election, and the rapture. We wanted to learn Matthew, Corinthians, and Ephesians, what Luther taught, and what Darby says, and we may have bought many commentaries and books. I have had the thought to get rid of many books in my library. You cannot know how much of my time they wasted and how much distraction they offered. Now I have the secret. Whenever I come to the Word in my spirit and through the Holy Spirit, everything is living; everything is enlivening, full of light and life.<p>The other snare is seeking after the gifts. While someone is indifferent toward the Lord, he does not have these two snares. Because he is in the biggest snare-the world, the wilderness-there is no need for Satan to use another snare. But right away when this one is raised up by the Lord to seek Him, Satan puts these two snares in front of him to trap him. I have seen so many Christians who were trapped and are still trapped by the snare of knowledge, and so many others who have been trapped in the snare of the gifts. We need to be warned, and we need to be delivered from worldliness, from seeking after doctrines, and from seeking after gifts. We have to be kept by Christ and in Christ. Sooner or later, in this country and throughout the world, people will be raised up by the Lord to sound the trumpet that nothing is as important as Christ and His Body, the church.<p>We must be humble before the Lord to tell Him how much we are still outside of Him. We are still not on the right track because we are following something other than Christ. Someone may say that the things besides Christ are for Christ. I say amen to that, but the actual situation today is that they are not being utilized for Christ. We must be absolutely delivered from anything other than Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST BEING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>We first must see the vision of Christ. Christ is all-inclusive. He is everything. He is God, and He is man; He is the Creator, and He is the creation; He is the first item of the old creation, and He is also the first item of the new creation. He is also life and everything to us. Moreover, this Christ today is the Spirit. This is a key point. Christ is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), and He is in our spirit. Regardless of how much power is in electricity, if we do not have the current of electricity, we have none of its power. All the power, function, ability, and capability of electricity is in the current. Even if we do not understand electricity, as long as we have the current and we apply it, we can enjoy it. Today the all-inclusive Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the current, the fellowship. That is why we speak of three matters: the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is the fellowship, the transmission, the current. Whatever Christ is, is in this current.<p>We must realize that Christ is the life-giving Spirit living in our spirit, and we need to learn the secret of contacting Him. We should forget everything else, never be distracted by anything, and always pay our full attention to the Spirit. We must love Him, contact Him, obey Him, follow Him, and always hold on to Him. We need to learn the way to exercise our spirit to contact Him. Galatians speaks of the Spirit and our spirit several times. We must walk by the Spirit, live by the Spirit, sow unto the Spirit to reap of the Spirit, and restore a fallen brother in the spirit (5:16, 25; 6:8, 1). Today God is in Christ, and Christ, the all-inclusive One, is the Spirit, and this Spirit is the very communication, communion, fellowship, and transmission to us. He is in our spirit, so now we must learn to exercise our spirit to contact this wonderful Spirit. Then we will enjoy Christ, and all the more we will love Him, pray to Him, turn to Him, fellowship with Him, and know not doctrine but Christ Himself.<p>We must know Him and realize Him more not only individually but also corporately. We should spend time with Him alone individually, and also spend time with Him by being with others in the church and in the church meetings. Then we will be filled with Christ, learn Christ, and bear the brands of Jesus. Spontaneously we will also have the experience of the cross, because the more we contact Christ and have the fellowship of the Spirit, the more we will be put to death by the killing power, the killing element in the all-inclusive Spirit within us. The more we contact Him, the more He will kill all the negative things, such as the flesh, the desire of the flesh, the soulish life, the old nature, and the worldly things. In Colossians and Galatians we can see the working of the cross not only in the past but also in the present through the presence, the anointing, of the all-inclusive Spirit within us.<p>If all the thousands of Christians in this city knew this way to contact Christ-to forget about doctrines, gifts, and everything else and simply learn to live by Christ, live in Christ, and come together to fellowship with one another in the way of life-what a powerful impact there would be! The enemy, however, is subtle to distract people by various doctrines, gifts, and functions, as well as opinions, arguments, and even fighting. Nevertheless, we have the assurance that the Lord will recover the proper realization and experience of Christ, at least with a remnant, a small number of people. With them at least, God&#8217;s purpose will be fulfilled. We have to pray that we may know Christ more and more. He is the all-inclusive One who today is the Spirit.<p>I would suggest that we not only read these messages but even more that we spend two or three months to dwell on the four books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. Spend time in these books to read, pray, and seek the Lord through them. This will be a turning point for us. We will be turned from all things to Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SECRET OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST IN PHILIPPIANS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Phil. 1:19-21a; 2:5, 13; 3:3, 7-14; 4:12-13</h1><p>Philippians 1:19 through 21a says, &#8220;For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death. For to me, to live is Christ.&#8221; Verse 19 refers to the supply. In Greek this is a particular word, indicating a bountiful, all-inclusive supply. This supply is not of the Spirit of God, strictly speaking, but of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.<p>In chapter two, verse 5 says, &#8220;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,&#8221; and verse 13 says, &#8220;For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.&#8221;<p>Verse 3 of chapter three says, &#8220;For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh.&#8221; Verses 7 through 14 continue, &#8220;But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ. But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith, to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead. Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue, if even I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus. Brothers, I do not account of myself to have laid hold; but one thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize to which God in Christ Jesus has called me upward.&#8221;<p>In chapter four, verses 12 and 13 say, &#8220;I know also how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack. I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me.&#8221;<p>In the previous two messages we saw that Christ is everything. Colossians shows us that He is God, and He is man; He is the Creator, and He is also the first item of creation. In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead. Moreover, He is the reality of all positive things. All physical, material things are simply shadows; the reality of all these things is Christ Himself. Now Christ is life to us. According to 1 Corinthians 15:45b, Christ is the life-giving Spirit; He is in our spirit as our life today and also as our hope, aim, and goal for the future.<p>Now such a Christ, whom we have seen, must be wrought into us. This is the message of the book of Galatians. According to this book, Christ must be the indwelling One. He is subjective to us because He is revealed in us, He lives in us as our life, we have been put into Him, and He is being formed in us, that is, He is being mingled with us, wrought into us, and woven into every inward part of our being. Christ has come into our spirit, and now He is in our spirit in order to saturate us, to permeate all our inward parts by coming into our mind, emotion, and will. In this way He will saturate our entire being and mingle with us to be the indwelling Christ as our life. These are the main points from Colossians and Galatians.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS OUR LIFE AND EXPRESSION</h2><p>Philippians gives us the secret to experiencing Christ. The first chapter speaks of Christ as our life and expression. For Christ to be magnified in our body (1:20) is for Christ to be expressed in us in a glorious way. In order for Christ to be magnified, to be expressed, through us and from within us, He must be life in us. That is why Paul says, &#8220;For to me, to live is Christ&#8221; (v. 21a). This means that Christ lives in us and lives Himself out of us. He is our life; He is living within us. Now He wants to live Himself out of us so that He can be magnified in us. Therefore, Philippians 1 speaks of Christ as our life and our expression.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS OUR PATTERN</h2><p>In Philippians 2 the apostle sets up Christ as our pattern, our example. Here, the most important factor is our mind. Verse 5 says, &#8220;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.&#8221; In Greek the first phrase literally means &#8220;think this in you.&#8221; We have to think things as Christ did. The real human life is bound to the mind. Whatever we think, we will do. The kind of life we live depends on what we have in our mind. According to the New Testament the mind has an important position in our being. It is the leading part of the soul. After we are regenerated in our spirit, the next step is that we are transformed by the renewing of the mind (Rom. 12:2). This means our mind has to be changed. Even to repent means to turn, to change, the mind. We need to repent by turning our mind to the Lord, but that is only the beginning. After we have repented and been regenerated, from that time onward we need to have our mind constantly renewed. How is our mind renewed? On the one hand, it is to take Christ as the pattern, the example, and on the other hand, it is to have Christ spread Himself within us, permeating and saturating all our inward parts. Then we will truly have the mind which was in Christ Jesus.<p>The example of Christ set up in Philippians 2 actually refers to the record of the four Gospels. This is why we have to read the Gospels many times. We have to take Christ as our example. However, this is not merely to follow Him by imitating Him. Just as a donkey or a monkey cannot truly imitate a man, we cannot imitate Christ. We are as stupid as a donkey and as naughty as a monkey. If we could get into a monkey, however, the monkey could live our life. In the same way, how can we imitate Christ unless we have Him living within us? Christ has to live in us; then we can follow Him. Among the Catholic writings there is the book The Imitation of Christ by Thomas &#224; Kempis. It may be a good book, but strictly speaking I do not like the title. Without Christ living in us, we can never imitate Him. In Philippians, however, we have Christ set up as a pattern based on the fact that Christ is now living within us.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS OUR GOAL</h2><p>In Philippians 3 we have Christ as the goal, the mark, the aim, and even the prize. We should not be frustrated by all the other things. As we said before, God gave us many material items in order for us to exist and live. Without food, drink, and other things, we could not exist. How then could we live for Christ? In order to keep us alive, God created the material things and gave them all to us. However, there is too much of a possibility that we will be distracted by these material things, and attracted to the material things, away from Christ as the mark of God&#8217;s economy. God created these things for Christ, and God provides for us so we can live for Christ. God&#8217;s purpose in giving us so many material things that we may exist is that we may live with Christ and for Christ. The worldly people, the unbelievers, however, have been and still are distracted from Christ by these material things.<p>Not only so, but the religious things are also distracting, as mentioned in Philippians 3. In Galatians 1 the apostle Paul tells us that when he was religious, he was distracted from Christ. He was not distracted by the worldly things but by fundamental religion, not the heathen religion but by Judaism. Judaism was something given and ordained by God. Even something ordained by God can be a factor utilized by the enemy to distract people from Christ. God ordained the Jewish religion for the purpose of keeping people for Christ and bringing people to Christ, but the enemy of God utilized this God-ordained religion to distract the religious people from Christ. Paul indicates this in Galatians 1 and again in Philippians 3. In Philippians 3:5 and 6 he says that he was &#8220;circumcised the eighth day; of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless.&#8221; How much he was distracted from Christ by the religious things and to the religious things!<p>Today even Christianity distracts people from Christ. Christianity should be something for Christ, but today&#8217;s Christianity distracts people from Christ to itself. Not only can the worldly things distract us, even the religious things can distract us from the goal, the mark, the prize of God, which is Christ Himself.<h2 class=head1>TO KNOW CHRIST AND THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION</h2><p>We should not think that we know Christ. Yes, on the one hand, we all have known Christ, but on the other hand, we still do not know Him in an adequate way. That Paul aspired to know Christ (vv. 8, 10) seems to pose a problem. However, this does not mean that Paul did not know Christ. He knew Christ very well, but he still needed to know Him more. He aspired to know not only Christ but also the power of His resurrection. This relates to the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit within us, we could not know and experience the power of His resurrection. The power of His resurrection is not in our body; it is in our spirit.<p>At the time Paul wrote this Epistle, he was in prison. Throughout all the years, Christians have extolled the experience of Peter when he was in prison. The prison doors were opened, and Peter was released (Acts 5:18-19). The power that opened the prison and physically released Peter from the material prison was the power of God, but it was not the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. When Paul was put in prison at the time he wrote Philippians, the prison was not opened and his chains did not fall off. He was kept there month after month and year after year. Within him, however, was the power to suffer gloriously. This is the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. I have heard many people praising Peter&#8217;s experience of being released from the outward prison, but I have not heard many people praising the experience of Paul, who was imprisoned outwardly but released inwardly. Even today we still enjoy the issue of his release. Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians were all written in prison. Outwardly he was imprisoned, but inwardly he was resurrected.<p>When we are childish, even babyish, and we become ill, we may pray about the illness. The Lord may say, &#8220;All right, let the illness be gone,&#8221; and it is gone. When we gain more growth and maturity, we may still pray about our illness. However, many people can testify that the more they pray, the more serious the illness becomes. The Lord will not take away the illness. Rather, He will say, &#8220;My grace is sufficient. You have to experience My resurrection power.&#8221; The illness will remain, but praise Him, it simply paves the way and lays the ground for us to experience the resurrection power. If we do not have the illness, we can never experience the resurrection power of Christ. In the past and even until today, I know some brothers and sisters with problems. They prayed much, but their problems remained. Recently, a sister whom I have known for more than thirty years came to me. She spoke of her husband, whom I also had known even as a schoolmate, saying that there had been no change with him before the Lord for year after year. Day by day he still complains to her that she should not be a Christian. Every day this sister has suffered, and she is still suffering. She asked me why it is so. I did not say a word, but I looked to the Lord that He would speak to her. I realized that she has truly learned something within, not of the power of God&#8217;s creation but of the power of resurrection.<p>For almost forty years the people of Israel saw the miracle of manna every morning. If we were to open the door tomorrow and see that manna had come down, we would all be excited, and it would be in the major newspapers. The people of Israel experienced this more than ten thousand times. Day by day they saw a miracle as something that came down from heaven in the morning, regardless of where they went or where they stayed. However, that was too outward to be the power of resurrection. Regardless of how many years God performed that miracle, nothing was wrought into the people of Israel. Today in the New Testament time God will generally not do that kind of work. In the New Testament dispensation God&#8217;s intention is to work Christ into us. The manna sent down was of the power of creation, not of the power of resurrection. God&#8217;s intention, however, is not an outward miracle but an inward miracle. The inward marvel is that Christ as the Spirit is wrought into us. This is the power, not of creation, but of resurrection.<p>Even for the prison to be opened to release the apostle Peter was not the power of resurrection. In Philippians, however, there is another apostle, who was kept in prison. God did nothing for him outwardly, but he suffered by the power of resurrection within him. When Peter was released from prison, I believe he did not experience the resurrection power by that event alone. When he was old, though, he was martyred by crucifixion. At that time God would not release him; God would not deliver him from the persecutors. When Peter suffered persecution and was martyred, he experienced the resurrection power.<p>What kind of power do we expect to have? We all may childishly expect to have the power of creation. We may think that it would be wonderful for the Lord to send manna throughout the city we live in; then all the millions of people will be saved. I do not believe this. How many of the people of Israel were truly gained by Lord through the daily miracles for almost forty years? Not many were. The Lord Jesus fed five thousand people, not including the women and children, with five small loaves. That was a marvelous miracle, but how many people were saved through that miracle? Only a handful of people continued to follow the Lord and seek the inner life. According to John 6 the crowds left Him, saying, &#8220;This word is hard; who can hear it?&#8221; (vv. 60, 66). The power we expect to experience must be the resurrection power. We must have the goal of the resurrected Christ as the very resurrection power within us. We must seek Him, pursue Him, and follow Him, taking Him as our goal, aim, mark, and the prize of God.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE SECRET</h2><p>Philippians 4 speaks of Christ as the secret. In verse 12 Paul says, &#8220;I know also how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack.&#8221; Paul knew the secret not only of the good things but also of suffering, of being abased. Today we often hear testimonies about abounding. In the church meetings the brothers and sisters stand to testify of how they abound. We almost never hear a testimony of how someone was abased. The apostle Paul was very much abased. He may also have been challenged, &#8220;If the Jesus you preach is the living One, if He is God, why are you suffering here? If He is the almighty One, why are you still hungry? We have plenty to eat, but you do not.&#8221; In 2 Corinthians 11 Paul tells us that he was in hunger and nakedness (v. 27). That was a real testimony. If I testify that for the past thirty years I have been very rich, and now I am a millionaire, then I must be wrong in some way.<p>Christ is the secret for us to live, suffer, and sometimes enjoy. Sometimes we are truly rich. We know how to be abased, and we know how to abound. To know how to be abased may be easy, but to know how to abound may not be easy. If God were to put a million dollars into our hand, we may be changed; we may feel that we are now glorious. If we receive some money, that money may spoil us. Christ must be the secret by which we know how to use riches and not be spoiled by them. To have millions of dollars in our hand yet not misuse them or be spoiled by them is a true grace. This means we know the secret. Christ is the secret for us to be abased and to abound.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT BEING THE SECRET OF THE SECRET</h2><p>The foregoing points are the concept of the four chapters of Philippians. Christ is life, so He is our expression. He is the example, the pattern, and He is also the goal, the aim. Moreover, Christ is the secret. Still, there is a secret to the secret. The secret of the secret is in 1:19-the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This is not the Spirit of God, as such, but the Spirit of Jesus Christ. We all know that the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of God, but the apostle Paul spoke here not of the Spirit of God but of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit is the key and the secret.<h2 class=head2>The Bountiful Supply of the Spirit</h2><p>The phrase bountiful supply was a special term to the Greeks of ancient times. It relates to a chorus, a band or group of people that performed by singing. The leader of the chorus was the choragus, who was responsible to supply all the needs of the chorus. The choragus supplied what they ate and drank, what they wore, their dwelling place, and their music and instruments. This is the word used in verse 19. Today the Spirit of Jesus Christ is our Choragus, supplying whatever we need. We are the chorus, demonstrating Christ by our &#8220;singing.&#8221; We need many things, and whatever we need, the Choragus, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, will supply. This is the bountiful supply, the all-inclusive supply.<p>The Spirit here is called the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This is because Jesus Christ today is the Spirit. Christ said that He is the truth, the reality, and the Spirit today is the Spirit of reality (John 14:6, 17). Jesus Christ is the reality, the Spirit of God today is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, so the Spirit is the Spirit of reality. All that Jesus is and all that He has attained and obtained is in the Spirit. Moreover, this Spirit is within us. Electrical current is a good illustration of the Spirit. If you go to the meter, you can see that the electricity is flowing in a house. If a house has the current of electricity, it has the reality of the electricity; without the current, there is no reality of electricity. What then is the current of the electricity? It is the electricity itself. When we speak of the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, we mean that the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the current, the flow, of God and Christ. Christ as the &#8220;electricity&#8221; is flowing in the current. The electricity is in the generator in the power plant, but now by the current it is also in this building. In the same way, the Spirit is the current of Christ, and this current is now flowing in us. The current of electricity is a wonderful illustration of the Spirit. Perhaps because people a few hundred years ago did not have electricity, they could not understand the Spirit of Jesus Christ as we do today.<h2 class=head2>The Lord&#8217;s Recovery of the Spirit</h2><p>Christ today is so real to us as the Spirit. If Christ were not such a current to us, how could we experience Him as our life? Jesus said, &#8220;I am the bread of life,&#8221; and, &#8220;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&#8221; (6:48, 57). Christ is food to us, and we have to eat Him. If He were not the Spirit, though, how could we eat Him? I believe that in these days Christ as the indwelling Spirit is the main item of the Lord&#8217;s recovery. This will be more and more recovered among us. In the past six years, beginning from 1959, whenever I have had a time with the Lord, one thing has been within me: the matter of the Spirit and our spirit.<p>The apostle John saw all the visions of Revelation in spirit. In Revelation 4 there is the vision of the throne, and from chapter six to chapter twenty, there are the seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls. Verses 1 and 2a of chapter four say, &#8220;After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you the things that must take place after these things. Immediately I was in spirit; and behold, there was a throne set in heaven.&#8221; From this throne come the seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls. Then in Revelation 21 and 22 there is the vision of the New Jerusalem. Verse 10 of chapter twenty-one says, &#8220;And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.&#8221; The vision in chapter four is of the throne, the center of the entire universe. The vision in chapter twenty-one is of the city, the unique, universal expression of God. Both of these visions are a matter of spirit. Some versions capitalize spirit in these verses, while others render it in lower case. It is hard to know whether this is the Spirit or the human spirit of the apostle. Either way, this is a matter of spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Spirit Being the Breath of Christ</h2><p>In these last days the matter of the Spirit and our spirit will be more and more recovered. We must come to know that Christ is the Spirit, and everything related to God is realized by us in this Spirit. Even five years ago I was not as clear as I am today. At that time I never gave a message telling people that Christ as the life-giving Spirit is like the air. Now I can tell this to people, and I have the assurance it is right, because on the evening of the day of resurrection, the Lord came to His disciples, breathed into them, and said, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (John 20:22). The Spirit was the breath of Christ; when the Lord breathed into His disciples, the breath that came out of His mouth was the Holy Spirit. The Greek word for spirit is pneuma, which means &#8220;spirit,&#8221; &#8220;breath,&#8221; and &#8220;wind.&#8221; Our car tires have pneumatic pressure; when they are out of pneuma, they are flat. Many Christians today are flat, out of pneuma, out of spiritual breath.<p>Christ is so available to us today, just like the air. We can live for seven days without eating and three to five days without drinking, but without air, we cannot live for three minutes. After three minutes of not breathing, we will die. This physical air is not the real air; it is merely a shadow. The real air is Christ, in whom we live, move, and have our being. Christ is so vital and so available to us. Is this miraculous? On the one hand, it is the biggest miracle, but on the other hand, it is just something normal. Day by day we are living in the air. Christ is the miracle of air. He is the breath, the wind. Even the mighty rushing wind on the day of Pentecost also brought in fresh air; the wind always brings the air.<p>Perhaps we would not be able to adequately understand these things without scientific discoveries. Today science has proven that even in small substances there is atomic power. If within these poor items there is such a power, consider what power there is in Christ. Today this Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is in us. We are not talking about a mere religion. I hate to have a religion. In this universe there is the reality of the Triune God-the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the current, the flow. Oh, we have the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit within us! Such a reality of the Triune God is dispensed into us through the Spirit. Therefore, we are not dealing with a religion, with the gifts, or even with the Bible alone. We are dealing with the living God and the living Christ in the living Spirit, not in a miraculous way but in a very normal way, just like the air. I do not have the adequate words, even in my mother tongue, to express what is on my heart and what I have understood in my spirit. It is very hard to explain, but I truly have seen something in my spirit about this. I can never exhaust speaking about this. In a sense I am &#8220;crazy&#8221; about this.<p>The Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit today is the very current of the Triune God. This current flows into us and flows within us. While He is flowing, all the essence, elements, and fullness of the Godhead are transmitted into us. This is wonderful! This is not a religion, a set of teachings or gifts, or even the Bible by itself. This is the living Triune God in the Son and through the Spirit flowing into us day by day, constantly, like electricity and like the air. The Christ in whom we believe is such a living, life-giving Spirit, real and available as the air. Do we realize Him to such an extent? We need to realize Him.<p>This is the Christ that is revealed in the four books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. The apostle Paul, the writer, gives us the vision of Christ and then shows us the secret to experience this Christ in the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. If we have this Spirit flowing within us, we have Christ living in us. Then Christ will be magnified through us, and He will become our pattern, example, goal, prize, mark, and aim, and He will be the One who empowers us within. In this way He becomes the secret. If we have Him, we can do all things. The secret of the secret, however, is the Spirit. Just as the &#8220;mark&#8221; of electricity is the switch, the mark of God&#8217;s economy is the Spirit with our spirit. If we exercise our spirit and give heed to it, we will realize how rich, how real, and how living the indwelling Christ is. Again I say, this is not in the miraculous way but in a very normal way. The more spiritual we are, the more we are normal and powerful in a normal way. The life, expression, example, pattern, goal, mark, empowering, and secret are in the Spirit of Jesus Christ, who has the bountiful supply. Praise Him, He is in us! This is wonderful, and this is the secret of experiencing Christ. For this reason, I love the book of Philippians.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE ISSUE OF THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST IN EPHESIANS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:10, 13, 17-23; 2:5-6, 10, 15-16, 18, 20-22; 3:4-6, 8-11, 14-21; 4:3-6, 11-16, 22-24; 5:18, 25-27, 30, 32; 6:10-19</h1><p>Let us read a few verses from each chapter of Ephesians. Verse 10 of chapter one says, &#8220;Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&#8221; The Greek word for head up is the root noun for head formed into a verb. Christ is not only life, but He is also the Head, under whose headship all things will be headed up.<p>Verse 13 says, &#8220;In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.&#8221; In whom refers to Christ; in this One who will head up all things, we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.<p>Verse 17 says, &#8220;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.&#8221; In this verse, spirit is in lower case. According to this rendering, it indicates our human spirit. However, it is hard to determine whether this is simply our human spirit or the Holy Spirit. We have to say that it is the human spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit; the two spirits mingle and twine together.<p>Verses 18 to 23 continue, &#8220;The eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&#8221; In the phrase to the church, the little word to is very important. Whatever God has wrought in Christ and whatever Christ has attained is not only for the church but to the church, that is, transmitted to the church.<p>In chapter two, verses 5 and 6 say, &#8220;Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved) and raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.&#8221; Then verse 10 says, &#8220;For we are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them,&#8221; and verses 15 and 16 say, &#8220;Abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace, and might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity by it.&#8221; Christ not only made, He created, in Himself one new man of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles. The Body in verse 16 is the church, and according to verse 15 it is also the new man.<p>Verse 18 says, &#8220;For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father,&#8221; and verses 20 through 22 continue, &#8220;Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone; in whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&#8221; At the end of verse 22 we do not have the article the in Greek. In spirit, therefore, should be rendered in lower case; it is our human spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit.<p>In chapter three, verse 4 says, &#8220;By which, in reading it, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ.&#8221; Colossians 2:2 speaks of &#8220;the mystery of God,&#8221; but Ephesians 3:4 refers to &#8220;the mystery of Christ.&#8221; The mystery of God is Christ, while the mystery of Christ is the church. Christ is the history, the story, that is, the definition and manifestation of God. In the same way, the church is the history, story, and definition and manifestation of Christ. Verses 5 and 6 continue, &#8220;Which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit, that in Christ Jesus the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the Body and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel.&#8221; Again in verse 5 there is not the article the before spirit, so this refers to our human spirit.<p>Verse 8 says, &#8220;To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.&#8221; Paul did not preach doctrine, prophecy, or gifts; he preached the unsearchable riches of Christ. The riches are all the different items of what Christ is, the items of Christ&#8217;s wealth. Verses 9 through 11 continue, &#8220;And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&#8221;<p>Verse 14 speaks of &#8220;this cause.&#8221; This is the cause revealed in the previous verses. Verses 14 through 17a say, &#8220;For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&#8221; God strengthens us into our inner man for the purpose of Christ&#8217;s dwelling in our hearts. Verses 17b through 21 continue, &#8220;That you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God. But to Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever. Amen.&#8221;<p>Verses 3 through 6 of chapter four say, &#8220;Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace: one Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&#8221; Then verses 11 through 16 speak of both growth and building. Verses 15 and 16 say, &#8220;But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&#8221;<p>Verses 22 through 24 say, &#8220;That you put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.&#8221;<p>In chapter five, verse 18 says, &#8220;And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit.&#8221; Verses 25 through 27 say, &#8220;Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.&#8221; Verse 27 does not speak of sin and dirt, but rather of spot and wrinkle. Verses 30 and 32 conclude, &#8220;Because we are members of His Body....This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.&#8221;<p>Verses 10 through 19 in chapter six speak of the whole armor of God. Verses 14 through 17 say, &#8220;Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness and having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace; besides all these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one. And receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.&#8221; Both truth, righteousness, and peace are Christ, and Christ is the Author and Perfecter of our faith. In addition, Christ is also salvation, and He is the Word of God. Verse 18 continues, &#8220;By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit.&#8221; Again, spirit does not have the article the, so it should be rendered in lower case.<p>In the first message we saw Christ as all in all in the book of Colossians. In the second message we saw that this all-inclusive Christ must be wrought into us. Then in the third message we saw the secret of experiencing Christ. In this message we will see the issue, the result, of the experience of Christ. The result, the issue, of the experience of Christ is the church. The church comes out of the experience of Christ. This is revealed in a full way in Ephesians, a short book of six chapters. Ephesians is brief but truly profound. We can never exhaust reading it, and we can never exhaust what can be ministered of Christ with His church from it. There are four main items in this book. The first main item revealed in Ephesians is Christ &#8220;to the church&#8221; (1:22). The second main point is the ministry of Christ, and the third is the experience of Christ. The fourth main point is the mingled spirit; the Holy Spirit mingles Himself with the human spirit, and the human spirit is mingled with the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE TRANSMISSION OF CHRIST TO THE CHURCH</h2><p>We have seen in Colossians that Christ is everything, but we do not see much of the work of Christ in that book. Ephesians goes on to reveal what Christ has accomplished, attained, and obtained. Christ has a real attainment, a real success, and He has obtained something. Ephesians 1 tells us that God&#8217;s economy, His arrangement and plan, is to head up all things in Christ. This is something great. We do not know how many items there are in the universe. No one can exhaust telling of the billions of items that are there. All these will be headed up in Christ. Christ will be the Head to head up all these things. This is God&#8217;s intention, God&#8217;s purpose, and God&#8217;s economy. In order to do this, however, Christ had to accomplish something.<p>We know that Christ died for us. After His crucifixion, however, Christ was raised up, and after this resurrection He was uplifted, brought to the highest place in the entire universe. He was made transcendent above all things, the things not only in space but throughout time, since the universe is space plus time. Christ is so high and transcendent that He is above all the universe, not only the things in this age but also in the age to come. Moreover, He was made Head over all things. God ordained Christ to be the Head even before His incarnation, but He was brought into the position of Head, made to be Head, after His resurrection and in His ascension. After He ascended to the heavens, God put Christ on the throne to be the Head over all things.<p>Moreover, all that Christ accomplished, attained, and obtained is to the church (v. 22). Many of us may not be clear about the phrase to the church. We can compare this to an injection that imparts something into our whole body. What God wrought in Christ, what Christ attained and obtained, is not only for the church but also to the church. God resurrected, raised up, Christ. God lifted Christ up in ascension to the highest place, and God put Him on the throne as the Head of all things. Now all that God has done toward Christ is to the church, His Body.<p>It seems that we Christians are so poor. How high and transcendent we are, yet how low and mean we feel! We need a vision. If I ask you where you are, what will you say? Will you just say you are here in this room? We all have to realize that we are in the highest place in the universe. Christ has accomplished this. He has solved all the negative things and obtained all the positive things, so there is nothing left to do. We have been put into Christ, and we have been incorporated with Him. Therefore, all that Christ has done, all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained, is to the church, that is, is transmitted to the church.<h2 class=head1>THE MINISTRY OF CHRIST</h2><p>The ministry of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers is the ministry of Christ (4:11-12). They minister the unsearchable riches of Christ to people. Christ is the Head, and He is all-inclusive. He has accomplished, attained, and obtained everything. How can this Christ, who is so much and has attained so much, be ministered to us? It is through the ministry of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. All the different kinds of ministry of the gifted persons is the ministry of Christ to others.<p>We thank the Lord that in the past five centuries He has recovered many teachings through His people. With those teachings there is some reality, but due to the weakness of the human instrument, people have been attracted to the teachings instead of the reality. In these last days, however, the Lord will recover not more teachings but more reality, that is, more and more of Himself. All the ministers, the gifted persons raised up by the Lord, must absolutely minister Christ, and not doctrine, preaching the riches of Christ, the items of what Christ is, to the Gentiles. We have to minister the riches of Christ to people, such as life, wisdom, patience, and the humility of Christ.<p>In Taiwan in 1960 I shared with the young people all the names of Christ, denoting all that Christ is. I found almost three hundred different names, titles, or items of Christ. He is the temple, the tabernacle, and the Passover. As the offerings alone, He is many items: the burnt offering, sin offering, trespass offering, meal offering, peace offering, wave offering, and heave offering. Oh, the riches of Christ! All the ministers, all the gifted persons raised up by the Lord in these days, must learn to minister only the riches of Christ. Let us forget about doctrines, denominations, dispensations, predestination, and election. I do not like to hear these things. Let us learn how to minister Christ to others by the anointing of the Spirit.<p>Some among us have studied in seminaries and Bible institutes. I would ask them, &#8220;Have you ever learned that Christ is our wave offering and heave offering? Have you ever experienced Christ in this way?&#8221; We preach the riches of Christ, not the doctrines of Christ. Today the church needs the ministry that ministers Christ not as the menu but as food. Today&#8217;s Christianity is like a restaurant that serves only menus. In the so-called churches today we may learn to read the menu, but there is no food. There is doctrine about Christ, but there is no reality of Christ.<p>Sometimes when I go to a restaurant with the brothers, I am too tired to care for the menu. When they pass me the menu, I say, &#8220;I will just follow you. I don&#8217;t like to read; I like to eat. I don&#8217;t like to understand; I simply want to enjoy, so whatever you order for me is all right. I don&#8217;t care if it is sour or sweet; I will just take it.&#8221; We must learn to take the food. We must take Christ and not simply learn the doctrine of Christ. Learning doctrine exhausts us, but the enjoyment of Christ refreshes, strengthens, and satisfies us. After coming home from the restaurant, if someone asked me what I ate, I would tell them, &#8220;I ate a lot of things. I don&#8217;t know what they were. I just ate them. I don&#8217;t know their names, but I enjoyed them.&#8221; Even if I do not know the name of what I eat, I still digest it well. In a similar way, we must learn to know Christ, not knowledge, teaching, or doctrine.<p>Those who minister to the Lord&#8217;s people must realize that what people need today are the riches of Christ, not doctrine or teaching. Sometimes, of course, in order to convey Christ to others we need doctrine as a means, but what we give people is not the means but the Christ it conveys. In the book of Ephesians there is the ministry that always ministers Christ to others. The church today is not built up, because there are too little nourishment, supply, and real material with which to build up the church. There is too little ministry of the riches of Christ to the saints, so the saints are starved to death. The church needs Christ as the building material. This requires the ministers and the ministry to minister Christ to people. The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers all minister Christ to the saints to perfect them by this ministry.<h2 class=head1>THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</h2><p>The biggest point in Ephesians is the experience of Christ. Concerning the experience of Christ there are seven items. Five of the items are: being strengthened into the inner man (3:16), being renewed in the spirit of the mind (4:23), growth (v. 16), building by the growth (2:20-22), and fighting the battle (6:12). These five items-strengthening, renewing, growing, building, and fighting-are the different aspects of the experience of Christ, but before we experience these, we must realize two additional items. First, we have to realize that we are in Christ. In Ephesians, the phrase in Him or in whom is used many times (1:4, 7, 10-11, 13; 2:21-22; 3:12; 4:21). All the experiences of Christ are based on the fact that we are in Christ, that is, incorporated with Christ and one with Christ. If I am incorporated with someone, then legally and judicially speaking I am one with him; whatever he has is mine. Christ has ascended and has been made Head over all things. To be incorporated with a poor man is pitiful, but to be incorporated with a billionaire is very wonderful. Praise Him, Christ is more than a billionaire, and we are incorporated with Him!<p>People often ask us what the name of our church is and what we are doing. We may say we are Christ Incorporated, and day by day we are doing the business of the Christ incorporation. This is our business. We are &#8220;buying&#8221; and &#8220;selling&#8221; Christ, &#8220;dealing&#8221; with Christ, &#8220;making concessions&#8221; with Christ, and &#8220;trading&#8221; with Christ. Dear brothers and sisters, I wish to trade nothing but Christ with you. Today we are incorporated with Christ; we are in Christ.<p>The second item we must realize is that Christ is in us. Not only are we in Christ, but Christ is in us. This is a mutual &#8220;in.&#8221; We are in Him, and He is in us mutually. Christ wants to make His home in us. Verses 16 and 17a of chapter three say, &#8220;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&#8221; We are wholly in Him, and He is wholly in us. We must see these two facts. Once we have seen these two facts, we need the five factors mentioned above-strengthening, renewing, growing, building, and fighting. These five aspects of the experience of Christ are based on the facts that we are in Him and He is in us.<h2 class=head2>Being Strengthened into the Inner Man</h2><p>To be strengthened is the start of the real experience of Christ. Verse 16 speaks of being strengthened into the inner man. The inner man is a very specific term. Originally, before we were saved, we did not have such an inner man. We had a human spirit, but we did not have an inner man. We had only the human life in our soul, so our soul was a man. Formerly, though, there was no life in our human spirit, so it was not a man; it was only an organ. At the time the Lord Jesus came into our spirit, He imparted Himself into our spirit as life. Now there is another life in our spirit. We have the human life in our soul, making it a human person, but now we also have Christ as the divine life in our spirit, so there is now a divine person in our spirit. Our regenerated human spirit has become no longer just an organ but the inner man. This is the start of our experience of Christ.<p>However, a person may be immature; a person may even be a baby. Some persons are strong, while others are very weak. Some persons are grown up, but some are immature. All are persons, but there is also the matter of age and health. We have been regenerated, and we have an inner man, but with some the inner man is weak and young, even childish or babyish.<p>We are often weak in our spirit but strong in the soul. We can demonstrate this in the following way: When we come together, we always like to talk. We are strong in talking. This proves we are strong in the mind and in the soul. If we try to have a time of prayer, however, everyone will be silent. The best way to silence people is to ask for a time of prayer. Without a time of prayer, the brothers and sisters will talk unceasingly, even if we try to silence them. The best way to silence them is to say, &#8220;Let us pray.&#8221; Then everyone will be as silent as the tombs in the cemetery. This is because to pray is to exercise the spirit. The talking and the silence are proof that we are too strong in the mind and soul and too weak in the spirit. That is why we need to be strengthened into the inner man.<p>We need to be weakened a little in the soul, the outer man. We are too strong in the outer man. When a husband and wife argue, they are strong. Even when they do not argue but simply discuss, they are still strong to say, &#8220;I know this or I know that.&#8221; When they pray, however, they say, &#8220;O Lord, I don&#8217;t know how to pray.&#8221; They know how to talk, discuss, and argue, but they do not know how to pray. In the church life and even in the family and marriage life, we can see the weakness of the inner man. We are too strong in the soul, so we need to be weakened and lowered a little. Many times in my family life I have been tempted to argue, but I have learned the lesson to say, &#8220;Lord, lower me and weaken me a little. I like to be weak. I like to be brought to the cross to be slaughtered. I like to be weak in the soul but strong in the spirit.&#8221; This is the way the Lord Jesus was. In a proper sense, when He was brought to the cross to be slaughtered, He was weak in His soul, in Himself, but He was strong in the spirit. Our spirit, our inner man, needs to be strengthened and enlarged.<h2 class=head2>Christ&#8217;s Making His Home in Our Hearts</h2><p>The result of being strengthened is that Christ makes His home in us. The Greek word in 3:17a is the verbal form of the noun home. The inner man is our human spirit with Christ in it, while the heart includes the mind, emotion, will, and conscience. When our spirit, our inner center, is strengthened, Christ can spread out and take over our mind, emotion, will, and conscience. In this way Christ makes His home in our heart. We may illustrate this with a glove. I may put my hand into a glove, but it is not settled in the glove at first. There is still the need for the hand to &#8220;make home&#8221; in the glove. Gradually the thumb gets into the glove&#8217;s thumb, and then the second and third fingers settle into place, and after some time the entire hand settles into the glove.<p>Yes, Christ is in us, but He may be in us in an unsettled way. This requires further consecration and more yielding to Him. Our spirit, our inner man, must be strengthened. When we are strong in our spirit, the indwelling Christ has the ground, the opportunity, to spread Himself into and take over our mind, emotion, and will to occupy every part of our soul, that is, to occupy our heart. Then Christ will settle in all our inward parts. He will have not only regenerated our spirit, but He will have indwelt, made home, in our heart. This is an inward matter, not an outward one. Our soul must be taken over; our mind, emotion, and will must be saturated with Christ.<p>At the beginning of our experience of Christ, we were regenerated. Now we have a regenerated spirit, an inner man, but it is young, weak, and small. Christ is in our spirit, but He is not dwelling there; rather, He is imprisoned there. Our spirit becomes a prison to Christ rather than a home. Once Christ comes in, He may have no freedom to move around. Now we must be strengthened into the inner man. This means that our soulish life must be lowered down, our soul must be weakened, but our spirit must be uplifted. Our spirit, not our soul, must be first. With too many of us, however, the soul is first; it is too strong. It needs to be cast down. When we are strengthened into the inner man and give Christ more ground, then He can saturate our hearts and make His home there.<h2 class=head2>Being Renewed in the Spirit of Our Mind</h2><p>Ephesians 4:23 says, &#8220;Be renewed in the spirit of your mind.&#8221; The spirit of your mind is another particular term. It indicates that the spirit is in our mind. Again it is hard to tell whether this is the human spirit or the Holy Spirit. There is the article the, but spirit is rendered in lower case. I believe that this is the mingled spirit. To be renewed in the spirit of our mind means that our mind is taken over by the spirit. It is not that our mind controls our spirit but that our spirit controls our mind. With too many of us, the mind is over the spirit, but if we surrender, yield, and consecrate ourselves, the mingled spirit will control our mind, so it becomes the spirit of our mind. It is by such a spirit that our mind is renewed.<p>We have too much oldness in our mind, in our thinking. Our mind is too old. We need to be renewed in our mind. This is a great matter. The reason we do not grow is that we are simply too old. The husbandman of an orchard can tell us that the way to help trees grow is by cutting off the old branches to make the tree new. If the oldness is cut off, something new will come out. We have been using our mind for our whole life. It is too old, and it needs to be renewed, not by human hand or thought but by the renewing spirit.<h2 class=head2>Growing Up into Christ</h2><p>After we are renewed, we will grow with Christ and into Christ. Doctrinally speaking, we are in Christ, but experientially speaking, in so many things we are still not in Christ. Therefore, we need to grow up into Christ in those things. Verse 15 of chapter four says, &#8220;We may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&#8221; We need to grow into Christ not only in one thing but in all things.<h2 class=head2>Being Built Up with Christ as the Material</h2><p>By the growth we will be built up to produce a building (v. 16b). We all have to be built up, not with ourselves as the material but with Christ as the material. The more we grow, the more we have Christ, the material for our building up.<h2 class=head2>Fighting the Battle with Christ as the Whole Armor of God</h2><p>After being built up, we must fight the battle. We do not fight by anything of ourselves. Rather, Christ is every aspect of the whole armor of God. The truth, the reality, with which we gird and strengthen ourselves, is Christ (6:14a). Righteousness as our breastplate to cover our conscience is Christ Himself, and the shoes of the gospel of peace are also Christ (vv. 14b, 15). Peace is Christ, and even the gospel is Christ, whom we preach. In addition, the faith that shields us is also Christ, the Author and Perfecter of faith (v. 16). If we have Christ, we have the living faith; if we do not have Christ, we do not have faith. The helmet of salvation is also Christ (v. 17a). Christ is our salvation and our covering. If we have Christ, we have a covering for our head. The word of God is Christ, the living Word (v. 17b). This word is a sword. All the other items of the armor are defensive, but the sword is offensive to slay the enemy. Christ is every part of this armor. This means that we fight the enemy in Christ, by Christ, and with Christ. This also is an aspect of the experience of Christ.<p>We have to be strengthened into our inner man that Christ may settle and make home within us. Then we have to be renewed with Christ and grow with Christ and into Christ. Then we must be built up with Christ and fight with Christ. We have to learn to experience Christ in such a full and living way.<h2 class=head1>THE MINGLED SPIRIT</h2><p>All the foregoing points-what Christ is to us, the ministry of Christ, and the experience of Christ-depend on the mingled spirit. In Ephesians we have the Holy Spirit, the human spirit, and the two spirits mingled together. We can right away determine that some verses refer to the Holy Spirit, and we can decide that some verses refer to the human spirit, but in several verses it is hard to say whether it is the Holy Spirit or the human spirit, because they refer to the mingled spirit, the Holy Spirit mingled with our human spirit.<p>Whatever Christ is today is in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is the transmission. Christ ascended to the heights, so how can Christ come into us? He comes as the Holy Spirit, who is the transmitting element. The Holy Spirit in our spirit is the transmission, transmitting and flowing all the time, day by day. There is an inner flow within every Christian, and this inner flow is the transmission of the Holy Spirit, transmitting all the riches of Christ, Christ Himself, into us. He has come into us, He has sealed us (1:13), and we have to be careful not to grieve Him (4:30). This means that we have to obey Him, cooperate with Him, and go along with Him.<p>Then concerning our human spirit, we have to be filled in spirit (5:18), pray in spirit (6:18), and see the vision in our spirit (1:17). We should learn not merely to consider the things of God in our understanding, our mind, but to realize the things of God by our spirit, to see things in vision and revelation by our spirit. In this way our spirit will be mingled with the Holy Spirit, and we will realize all the wonderful riches of Christ in this mingling and mingled spirit. All that the Holy Spirit transmits to us is in this mingled spirit, and whatever we do to know the Lord and experience Him must be in this mingled spirit.<p>I say again, the first three main items of Ephesians depend on this item, the mingled spirit. The key is the mingled spirit. All that Christ is, is in the Holy Spirit, and today the Holy Spirit comes into us as the transmitting agent, indwelling us and transmitting to us day by day. This is just like the current of electricity that transmits the electricity into a building; when the current stops, the supply of electricity stops. In the same way Christ is constantly transmitted into us by the transmitting Spirit. The organ for us to receive the transmitting of the Holy Spirit is our human spirit. The Holy Spirit transmits Christ into our spirit. Therefore, we must learn how to exercise our spirit to contact the Holy Spirit.<p>If we read Ephesians again and note all the verses about the spirit, we will find these three aspects: the Holy Spirit transmits Christ to us, our spirit receives what the Spirit transmits, and these two spirits-the transmitting Spirit and the receiving spirit-are mingled together as one spirit. It is in this mingled spirit, including our spirit and the Holy Spirit, that we are one with Christ and one with the other saints. If we are not one with others, this means that we are out of the mingled spirit. If we are in the mingled spirit, we will be one, and we will have the Body. The Body is in the mingled spirit, and the building up is also in the mingled spirit.<p>Moreover, if we remain in the mingled spirit we will be sanctified and cleansed, and all the spots and wrinkles will be gone (5:26-27). We cannot wash away blemishes and wrinkles on our face with soap and water. In the same way the blood of Jesus can wash away our sins and the dirt from our earthly touch, but the blood cannot wash away our spots and wrinkles. These can be washed away only by the inner life. If I were young again, all my wrinkles would be gone. This proves that wrinkles are signs of oldness. The church, however, must never be old. The more the church grows, the younger it becomes. The inner life washes away all the wrinkles. Many people say that the longer a church is in a place, the older it becomes. In a sense, I believe this is so. I am afraid that after fifteen years the church here may be old with many wrinkles. Where there is the lack of the inner life, there are wrinkles. Similarly, spots are the signs of wounds. When the church has been wounded, there are spots. The longer a church remains in one place, the more wounds it will suffer, and it will have spot after spot. However, the more we have the rich inner life, the more the life brings the washing, purifying power. Life cleanses away all the wrinkles and spots.<p>This sanctifying and cleansing is by the washing of the water in the word (v. 26). In the word there is the inner life, and this inner life is the washing water. The water is in the word. The more we have the inner life, the more the washing power of the living word cleanses all the wounds and washes away all the wrinkles, recovering us to our original condition in life. In this way the church will not only be grown up but also purified-without blemish, spot, or wrinkle-and glorious, fresh, new, and perfect. All this comes from the experience of Christ.<p>There is no need to worry. We have the best promise: The Lord Jesus gave Himself up for the church because He loved the church, and He will sanctify and cleanse the church to present her to Himself a glorious and perfect church. Do you believe this? I believe it. Sooner or later the Lord will accomplish this. Praise Him! The building up and purification of the church is the result, the issue, of the experience of Christ.</body></html>
