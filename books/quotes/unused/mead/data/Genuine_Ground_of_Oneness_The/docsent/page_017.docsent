   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DESIRE FOR THE HOUSE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have pointed out that the genuine speaking of God was in the Holy of Holies in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 27:4 expresses the deep aspiration of God's people with respect to the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse says, "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How the psalmist desired to remain in the house of God to behold the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A similar longing is conveyed in Psalm 84.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 2 the psalmist says, "My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 10 he goes on to say, "For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we see that the aspiration for the house of God was so strong that the psalmist desired even to be in the courts of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was happy simply to be a doorkeeper in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Psalms 36 and 23 also express a deep desire for the house of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Psalm 36:8 the writer says that God's people "shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is in the house of the Lord that they are made to drink of the river of God's pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, it is in the house that they enjoy the fountain of life and see light in the light of God v. 9 . Psalm 23 concludes with the words, "I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever" v. 6 . In Old Testament times the godly ones aspired to be in the temple where God's presence was.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such an aspiration repels evil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Simply the desire to be in the presence of God in the house of the Lord repels divisiveness and all the negative things it includes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This desire causes us to be godly, holy, and, eventually, to be one with the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the children of Israel were chanting Psalm 133 on the way up to Mount Zion, surely it would have been impossible for them to hate or despise one another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Psalm 133 is a psalm of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This oneness includes all positive attributes and virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By keeping the oneness we spontaneously enjoy all these attributes and virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, we have God's presence.</S>
