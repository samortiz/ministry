   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Like a Sheep Being Dumb before Its Shearers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Isaiah 53:7 prophesied, He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted, / Yet He did not open His mouth; / Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter / And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, / So He did not open His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Matthew, on the night in which Christ was betrayed, some from the chief priests and elders of the people came to seize Him and bind Him so as to deliver Him to Pilate.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These were His afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The high priest stood up and said to Him, Do You answer nothing?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is it that these testify against You?</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before the Sanhedrin, as a sheep being sheared before the shearers, He did not say one word for self-vindication.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His intention was not to save Himself but to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the time, those who were with Him by His side did not realize that He was dying for them, just as it was prophesied in Isaiah 53:8: As for His generation, who among them had the thought / That He was cut off out of the land of the living / For the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even some esteemed Him stricken, / Smitten of God and afflicted v. 4b . His oppression, suffering, and persecution were all for us.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ was executed with two criminals.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This fact indicates that the Roman ruler considered Him to be a criminal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was done under the sovereignty of God so that the prophecy in Isaiah concerning Christ s execution might be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>D. Interceding for the Transgressors</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Isaiah also prophesies that Christ bore the sin of many / And interceded for the transgressors 53:12b .</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After God caused our iniquities to fall on the crucified Christ, God considered Him the unique sinner, even sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to 2 Corinthians 5:21, God made Christ, who did not know sin, to be sin on our behalf.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This does not refer to a sin offering but to an offering for sin in its totality for wrongdoings, mistakes, trespasses, transgressions, evildoings, and iniquities.</S>
