   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION 3 Date: July 24, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Kuling THE WORD BEING THE LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: How can we be thorough in dealing with the ten or more lessons you have given concerning the character of the Lord's worker?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: One basic lesson a worker has to learn is to use God's word effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some people separate God's word from His light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To them, God's word is one thing and His light is another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They think that light will come after a minister of God's word opens his mouth, but this is precisely the reason their works are short of result.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's word can never be separated from His light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should never allow our words to exceed our light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The amount of words and the amount of light should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The general notion of most Christians is that they receive light from God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet in reality, light is merely something they hope to get; their own words still fill their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This ministry produces paltry and shallow results.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As ministers of God's word, we should not only release God's word when we speak, but also we should release His light spontaneously when we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ordinarily, light is found in lamps, but sunlight comes directly from the sun itself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is no need for a lamp to contain the sunlight.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same way, God's light does not require a lampstand; it shines directly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For the same reason, light should shine as soon as we open our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no need to speak and then to wait for light to come.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Consider the matter of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes a preacher delivers a clear message, and then at the end says, "You should now pray, repent, and believe in the Savior."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is separating the preaching and the receiving into two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the gospel is prevailing, however, a sinner does not need to wait to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He would be shaken and pricked in his heart, and he would have repented and believed as soon as he heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no need to have a separate step of receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As soon as a sinner hears the word, he receives it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was the case when Peter preached the gospel to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As soon as they heard the words of the gospel, they were convicted in their hearts, and they received instantly Acts 2:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In preaching various subjects, our word should be the very light; it should shine into man immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no need to package the light within the word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no need to carry the light within a lantern.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Unless our words can impart light directly to others, our speaking as ministers of God's word will be a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is a big failure if our words cannot directly transmit light to others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Something is very wrong if others have to search for the light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem, He was hungry and looking for fruit from a fig tree, but the tree only had leaves without fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord then said to the tree, "May there no longer be fruit from you forever!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Matt 21:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The tree instantly dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The very instant the Lord spoke, the thing was done.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He told the tree, "Wither up!" and the tree dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose we tell a little brother not to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If he goes home and prays, "Please, Lord, help me not to lie," we have only awakened him to himself with our wonderful words; there is still no light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The lie within him is still not burned away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the Lord told the tree to dry up, it dried up immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There was no time for it to pray, "Lord, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the future I will surely bear figs."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The tree dried up in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As ministers of God's word, we have to reach the same height.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As soon as the word is released, there should be great light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Others should be subdued, and their problems should be burned away.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The results should be instantaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As soon as God's light shines, the sterilization is completed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We do not wait for the light to come and then experience the sterilization of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No, the light is the sterilization.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If light is separated from sterilization, we will have to wait for months and years before we will be sterilized.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sterilization does not come after the shining; rather, the shining is the sterilization.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When a minister of the word speaks, his word should carry light.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A sinner should fall down before such a light, and a believer should fall and wilt before such a light.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is what it means to have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As soon as the word is released, others should fall down on their faces.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The instant Paul met the great light, he fell down Acts 9:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He did not wait for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our words should do the same thing.</S>
