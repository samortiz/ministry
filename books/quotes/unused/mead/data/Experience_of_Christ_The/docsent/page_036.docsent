   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING A LITTLE OF CHRIST AT A TIME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When some Christians speak about experiencing Christ, they become greedy and desire to swallow all of Christ at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But it took Paul more than thirty years to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, some of the young people are impatient in the experience of Christ and complain about enjoying only a little of Him at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not try to experience too much of Him at once.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Simply keep on experiencing Him and enjoying Him daily.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Regarding the experience of Christ, we need to slow down and realize that it will take eternity to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Day by day we need to experience a little more of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to partake of Christ many times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this way we shall have a greater enjoyment of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The enjoyment of Christ is an eternal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is inexhaustible, and we cannot exhaust the experience of Him even in a lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH IS OF GOD BY FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we come to the second kind of righteousness in Philippians 3, the righteousness which is of God by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we have seen, the righteousness of the law requires us to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more we obey the law, the more of the righteousness of the law we shall have.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, the righteousness of the law depends upon our effort and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The righteousness of God is different, for it does not depend upon our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, the righteousness of God is simply God Himself living in us and out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When God lives in us and then out of us, He becomes our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, it is not we who honor our parents or refrain from stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is the righteous God who lives in us and out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By living out of us, He becomes our living righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we try to keep the law, we endeavor to honor our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even when we are angry, we know that we are obliged to honor our parents and suppress our anger.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The righteousness of God by faith is in a different category.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This causes us to be full of joy and shining.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The righteousness of the law is dead, but the righteousness which is of God Himself is living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We experience this righteousness only when we repudiate ourselves and enjoy Christ as the remainder.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time, God lives in us and out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then our daily living will be full of God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE POWER OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 10 we see that Paul wanted to know the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This power is the resurrected Christ living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our Christ today is the resurrected One.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the resurrection, He lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Like a dynamo, the resurrected Christ lives within us as our source of power.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we repudiate our flesh and our natural man, we often have a sense of this power working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ as the remainder is like a motor empowering us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because we have the power of resurrection, it is easy to die with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The second stanza of a hymn written by A. B. Simpson goes like this:</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>'Tis not hard to die with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When His risen life we know;</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>'Tis not hard to share His suff'rings</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When our hearts with joy o'erflow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In His resurrection power</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He has come to dwell in me,</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And my heart is gladly going</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the way to Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A. B. Simpson certainly knew Christ as resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He knew that the resurrected Christ lived in him as resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By this resurrection power, we can overcome all negative things, including Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Christian life is a life lived by resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Experiencing the power of Christ's resurrection requires that we repudiate the flesh, the self, and the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we do this, we shall experience the resurrection power within.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By this power we experience all the riches of Christ.</S>
