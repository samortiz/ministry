   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GIVEN TO PLEASURE, NOURISHING ONESELF,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND GETTING READY FOR GOD'S JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 5 James rebuked the rich for accumulating material goods and gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let me say a word of truth: There has never been a time when the world has had as many rich men as we have today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There has never been a time when so much surplus value was taken from workers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is an abundance of rich men and wealth because many wages are being retained.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The luxury these rich men enjoy is unprecedented.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Middle Ages a few noblemen enjoyed some privileges.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the last one or two dynasties in China, only one or two families were able to have the kind of luxury these rich men enjoy today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Throughout history, there has never been a time when there were as many rich men as today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There has never been a time when there were as many material goods and material enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only is there a multiplication of material enjoyment, but there is a multiplication of lustful indulgence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We only need to partially open our eyes to see what I mean.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is an abundance of rich men, riches, and exploited wages of workers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the characteristic of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once a brother told me that a certain man always wears a platinum ring, and the ring is always new because he discards and replaces it when it becomes rusty.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is just like what the Bible speaks of in regard to the rusting of gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once it rusts, the owner discards it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For such hedonists and seekers of pleasure, anything that becomes rusty is no longer an enjoyment to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some people have hoarded enough goods to last them two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No wonder many rich men seek longevity and everlasting life after reaching middle age.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They know that they cannot enjoy all their wealth; they cannot use up all their riches even if they live another two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They seek longevity so that they can enjoy more.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The second part of verse 5 says, "You have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that men are like animals before going to the slaughter house they are well fed and nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once a sister brought three chickens from her village for a brother in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The brother felt that the chickens were not fat enough.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was reluctant to kill them, so he kept them for a few more days until they became fat.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then he killed them and ate them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is James's meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who are accumulating riches and given to enjoyment are nourishing their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Their unprecedented hedonism and license are a kind of fattening of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the fattening is complete, God will come in to judge them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He will slaughter them, and they will perish in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE PROPER CHRISTIAN WAY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>FORSAKING ALL FOR VOLUNTARY POVERTY</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A Christian should not set his hope on any change in the government.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His hope lies in his own deliverance from the bondage of mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From the first chapter of James to the end of the fifth chapter, there is no justification for riches and wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>James 2:5 speaks of the poor in the church being rich in faith, and chapter five speaks of the end of rich men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The current of the age lures men to become rich and to accumulate material goods, but James says that Christians should be long-suffering 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means they should not try to change their poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They should not follow the spirit of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The spirit of the age is to compete for riches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christians, however, should not try to change or alter their poor condition.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only when the Lord comes back again, will all of the problems be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I hope that the brothers and sisters in Hong Kong will not be three or five years behind those in inland China in spiritual growth and life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today the Holy Spirit is calling; He is calling you to forsake everything to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Communist regions, not only does the Lord move and the Holy Spirit call you to forsake everything, but the environment forces you to forsake everything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This world is like fire; you have to run away from it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This world is also like a flesh-eater; it will not allow you to fatten yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today in Hong Kong, this is more than a matter of the Lord's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I hope that the brothers and sisters will seize the opportunity, answer the gracious calling of the Lord's Spirit, and serve Him together as one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When I returned to Shanghai from Foochow, many brothers and sisters came to me in tears and said, "Had I listened to your word, the brothers and sisters as well as the church would have had a chance to enjoy my consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I do not feel sorry because I have lost my possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>My greatest sorrow is seeing the things disappear without giving the brothers, the sisters, and the church a chance to enjoy them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The poor did not get them, and neither did the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Letters from many places reported the same thing to me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do not seize the opportunity to answer the Spirit's call, one day we will find that our greatest sorrow is the Lord not gaining anything, the church not gaining anything, and the poor not gaining anything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>James 5 is a sign of the end times.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It depicts things that will happen before the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>James told us to be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should be aware of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The entire New Testament, from Matthew to Revelation, tells us that the church should befriend the poor and stand against the rich.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It says that the poor have faith, that the gospel is preached to them, and that God answers the prayer of the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today, if we want to be Christians at all, we should not prepare ourselves to be rich, nor should we dream of becoming rich.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Forsaking everything here in Hong Kong is different from forsaking everything under the Communist rule.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are anticipating James's words.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Riches will burn a person like fire; they will consume his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We cannot embrace our riches and be burned by them; we cannot allow them to eat up our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>On the one hand, this is a consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>On the other hand, it is a kind of running away.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should get rid of our riches while they are still in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should offer them up for the brothers, the sisters, and the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I hope that we will all think the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should take the way of voluntary poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should not be forced to become poor.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Day by day we should be simple, choosing poverty with all of the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Like Moses, we should not live in a palace while the rest of God's children are outside of it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we take this way, the church will have a good testimony.</S>
