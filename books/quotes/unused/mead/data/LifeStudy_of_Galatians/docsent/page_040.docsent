   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE ASPECTS OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning faith there are two aspects, the objective aspect and the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Objectively faith is what we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Subjectively faith is our believing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, faith denotes both the act of believing and that in which we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Regarding the act of believing, faith is subjective, but regarding what we believe, faith is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we hear about those things in which we are to believe, faith is produced within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more we hear about these good things, the more we appreciate them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Spontaneously this appreciation issues in our believing in those very things about which we have heard.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, faith is both objective and subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1:23 we are told that Paul, who once persecuted the believers in Christ, now preached the faith which formerly he ravaged.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Faith here and in 3:2, 5, 7, 9, 23, 25, and 6:10 implies our believing in Christ, taking His Person and His redemptive work as the object of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This, replacing the law, by which God dealt with people in the Old Testament, becomes the principle of God s dealing with people in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This faith characterizes the believers in Christ and distinguishes them from the keepers of law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the main emphasis of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The subjective aspect of faith implies at least eight items.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, faith involves hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without the hearing of the word, there can be no faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Faith comes from hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word we hear includes God, Christ, the Spirit, the cross, redemption, salvation, forgiveness, and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It also includes the fact that God has been processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the New Testament, the gospel tells us of all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the gospel is preached in a proper way, those who hear it will be stirred up and filled with appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Their hearing of the word of the gospel is the beginning of their believing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reason Christians are lacking in faith is that their hearing is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If they heard a living message on how the Triune God has been processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, no doubt this hearing would produce faith in them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second, faith also implies appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After hearing the word of the gospel, a sense of appreciation spontaneously rises up in those who hear.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is true not only of those hearing the gospel for the first time, but for all believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever we hear the word in a proper way, this hearing awakens more appreciation for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This appreciation is followed by calling, the third item implied in the subjective aspect of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All those who appreciate the Lord Jesus will spontaneously call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If our gospel preaching is cold, dull, and dead, it will be necessary to persuade people to pray and call on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if our preaching is precious, rich, living, inspiring, and stirring, there will be no need to persuade people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, they will spontaneously call, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps instead of calling on Him in this way, they will utter some word of appreciation for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps they will say, Oh, how good the Lord Jesus is!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Fourth, faith implies receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By appreciating the Lord Jesus and calling on Him, we spontaneously receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With receiving, we have the fifth aspect, that of accepting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is possible to receive something without accepting it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Faith involves both receiving and accepting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who hear the gospel and appreciate the Lord Jesus automatically accept Him as well as receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sixth, faith includes becoming joined to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By receiving and accepting Him, we are joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then, as the seventh and eighth items, we partake of Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Faith partakes of and enjoys what it receives and accepts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the preaching of the gospel, people hear of God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then they appreciate it and call upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They go on to receive, accept, join, partake of, and enjoy this grace, which is the Triune God processed to be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is faith.</S>
