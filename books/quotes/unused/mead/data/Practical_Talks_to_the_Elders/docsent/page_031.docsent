   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SETTING AN EXAMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Elders in the church are not a special class; they do not have a special rank.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They are normal believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are not leaders, but they take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are patterns of all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In organized Christianity, in both Catholicism and Protestantism, bishops are considered to be of extraordinary rank; then elders and deacons are considered to be of lower rank.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such ranking is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But this kind of human thought may have invaded us already; we may have in our understanding the thought that we have the rank of elders, that we are a special class.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Elders are just normal believers; they simply set a pattern for the rest of the believers to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, when the Bible tells us that all believers should pray unceasingly 1 Thes 5:17 , the elders should set an example.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All that the New Testament charges the believers to do, the elders should do.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not all believers can fulfill all the charges, but the elders should.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since you are taking the lead, you should carry out all that is commanded by God; all believers may not be able to do this, but you should.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>WILLING, EMPTY, PRAYING</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not think that your teaching in itself will help others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nor can I trust in my teaching to help you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you are short of willingness, short of emptiness, short of prayer, I cannot help you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nor can you be of help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all need these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lord, by Your mercy I am willing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Your grace I am empty.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am open to You with utter emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not want to hold on to anything of my past experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I want to be fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the time, unceasingly, pray to be filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then you will experience wisdom, understanding, and knowledge coming to you like a tide.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You will be under the flooding of divine wisdom, divine understanding, and divine knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You will know how to contact the saints with the divine nature, how to supply them with Christ, how to build them up with the redemption of Christ and with God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You will also have an inner ability to build up the saints in transformation and in the church life; not just to build them in character, but to build them up as a dwelling place for God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If talks like this are to be of help, they only avail when you are willing and empty and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are short of this constant prayer, I assure you that you will be very poor in the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be rich in the leadership, we need a willingness, an emptiness, and continuous prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>MANY THINGS TO BE DROPPED</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have brought many things into the leadership that we need to get rid of.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The longer we have been in the leadership, the more of these things we unconsciously have.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet we do not realize those things need to be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If, however, we are willing to bear responsibility for the building of God s dwelling place, and if we open to the Lord with complete emptiness and pray continuously, God will surely fill us up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we will discover all these things, and we will be enabled to let them go.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need a further, wider, deeper evacuation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One of these things, which you have picked up through the years and which you must drop, is the way you are related to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Your fellowship with the saints is not even.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You have your choice, your preference: you like to fellowship with this one, and you avoid having fellowship with that one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, your fellowship is biased, unhealthy, not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Your personal taste, your personal preference, is hidden there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That is honey, which in typology was not to be added to the meal offering Lev 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sooner or later it will corrupt your leadership or the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is needed is salt Lev 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In a doctrinal way it is easy to understand these things, but in practice it is only as you are open with complete emptiness to the Lord and praying continuously, that you will recognize how much honey you have brought in. You must put an end to that.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then you will know how much salt you need to add, and you will be able by exercising in a strong way to add the right amount of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then your leadership will be pure, or purified, and there will be no corruption in it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Teaching cannot help much with this; only the very God who fills you can do this work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I believe we have all had some experience of this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever we have been emptied and are in a prayerful spirit, if we stand up in the church meeting, we are aware, and all the other saints are also aware, that we are living, fresh, and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Other times we may stand up and share a lot, but the congregation has the feeling that it is from the old man, that it is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we contact others, we may speak the same word, talk about the same point, but sometimes there is a result and other times it is lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is when we are willing and empty and continuously praying that we have the wisdom to work in the divine nature and to minister to the needy ones the very Christ they need, not just minister in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>FELLOWSHIP OR DISCUSSION?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the elders come together, they should pray, not just discuss things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You like to call it fellowship, but maybe it is only a discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The elders need to pray: to pray their mind, their different understandings, into the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Rightly speaking, you should pray yourselves into the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When you are praying in the spirit, you have one mind; you are in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whenever you meet together, you should pray yourselves into the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even in shepherding, in visiting others either the unsaved or the saints, we should be constantly in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have all experienced that if we pray continuously, when we go we do not speak what we thought we would.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We find ourselves saying things we had no intention to say; what we say is new.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By being in continuous prayer, our spirit is released, and we will find that we speak from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>SHORT OF PRAYER SHORT OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The crucial lack is this continuous prayer on the part of all the elders, whatever the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You are short of prayer, so you are short of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is when you are fully condemned in your prayer that you receive wisdom and the real understanding of the Lord concerning the situation, concerning people, and concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Christian life is a life of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Elders are not extraordinary Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To be a proper elder is to be a normal Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many Christians are abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thus the elders should set up a normal pattern, giving the saints a normal lead.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In this way the church can be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Try to practice this, looking to the Lord for His mercy and grace.</S>
