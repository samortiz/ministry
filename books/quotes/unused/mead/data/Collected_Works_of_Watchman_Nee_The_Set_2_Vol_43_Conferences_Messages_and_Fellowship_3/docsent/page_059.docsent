   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTY-THREE LEARNING THE LESSON OF THE CROSS Date: April 5, 1938</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Penang</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Jer 48:11 THE WAY TO REMOVE THE LEES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>BEING TO BE EMPTIED CONTINUOUSLY</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Jeremiah 48:11 God said, "Moab has been at ease from his youth;/And he is settled on his lees/And has not been emptied from vessel to vessel;.../Therefore his taste remains in him,/And his scent is not changed."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moab was like wine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His lees remained, his taste stayed the same, and his scent was not changed, because he was never emptied.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today Christians are filled with lees.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is why God has to pour them from vessel to vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you have never been emptied and if your taste still remains, you are not of much use in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to perfect us, God must continually empty us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many times when a task is about to be finished, we find God forcing us to start everything all over again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We expect days of ease, and we want to keep God out of our territory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Day by day we pray for days of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But even while we are thinking this, something happens at home, in the church, or among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do not think about peace, we may have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But as soon as we think about it, trouble comes!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is emptying us to purify us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After we are purified once, He empties us again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After we are purified a second time, He empties us a third time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God will not allow us to remain settled on our lees.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He continues to empty us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do not humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God and if there is no joy in us, the lees within us will never be purified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if we submit and our hearts rejoice, we will find that all of God's dealings are necessary for us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we accept what God has measured to us, we will be purified from the lees through our willingness to accept, submit, and be poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has placed many undesirable things in our pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we submit to His arrangement, we will be purified again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if we do not submit and instead react inwardly to His arrangement, then lees will remain within us, and our taste and scent will remain un- changed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God allows us to experience shame, pain, and mishaps in the church, at work, and in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These are the crosses that God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are there for us to learn the lesson of bearing the cross, denying the self, and submitting to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we are faced with these things, we should say to the Lord, "Since it pleases You to give me days of affliction, I am happy to pass my days in affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If it pleases You that I suffer, I will never ask for ease."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to learn to satisfy God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are not only those who believe in the Lord but also those who love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The only question we need to ask about anything is whether or not God is pleased with it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Are we living for God?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are, what more can we say if a thing pleases the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John Bunyan said, "God, if it pleases You that I go to hell, I will jump into it this very moment!"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do not live for ourselves but for God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A RAW CHRISTIAN AND A MATURE CHRISTIAN</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are two kinds of Christians: raw Christians and mature Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Most Christians who are saved have not yet experienced God's dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They speak and walk as freely as before.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When they argue with others, they want to return an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before they were saved, they lost their temper when they were unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now that they are saved, they still lose their temper when they are angry.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These are raw Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They have not learned the proper lessons before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Their will has never been broken, and they have never been humbled under the mighty hand of God; they have never been disciplined by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After a Christian has passed through God's dealings, he will spontaneously accept God's discipline in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When God directs his pathway with the chastening whip, he will go along with all the lessons that God gives to him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a mature Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem on a donkey's colt which no man had yet sat upon Mark 11:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A donkey is very difficult to ride on, more difficult than an elephant, horse, or camel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the little animal has a fit of temperament, no one can push or pull it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A donkey is an animal with a terrible and stubborn temperament.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A donkey's colt that has never been disciplined and trained is an absolutely wild animal.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It was born free and has never carried anyone on its back.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It walks and eats according to its own way; it is not tame.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A tame donkey's colt is one that has been disciplined and chastised.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Someone has been running, subduing, pulling, and directing the way it should take.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the difference between being raw and being tamed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord has to work on most Christians like working on a donkey's colt before He can use them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But we like to choose our own way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who choose their own way are raw Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, no matter how raw we are, when the Lord wants to use us, He can ride on us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we have never been disciplined and chastised, we will never be useful.</S>
