<h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 11</h1><h2 class="head4">P. O. Box 84, Hankow, September 1938</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">Footsteps of Brothers Hu and Hsu,<br />Yunnan Province,<br />Having Returned from Li-Suh to Yeh-Ji and<br />en Route to Areas around Gung-Shan County</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Respected Brother Kwang-hsi:</p><p>The Lord bless you and your family with grace and peace! The work in K'un-ming has truly comforted us. May the Lord multiply your strength. We are always praying for this. Yesterday (June 26), Brother Hsu Jung-jieh and I returned from evangelistic work in Tuo-Bah-Oh, Zha-Tze-Oh, Yen-Wah-Loh, etc. Although our bodies are tired from traveling, our hearts are rejoicing greatly. I have worked in these places before. The ones who came to listen to me were baptized, but none of them dared to admit that they were saved. When Brother Hsu spoke, I interpreted for him, which took a long time. Thank the Lord that it all went very smoothly. The listeners were all very quiet. These people were once very impatient and could never keep any order. I know that we accomplished God's will this time because when we returned, we were filled with joy. According to Brother Hsu, their meetings are all according to the principle of the local church.</p><p>Brother Hsu and I sent men to borrow a gas lamp and a barrel of gas from the Wei-Si Assembly of God Church. This is for use in gospel work near Lu River and Cha-Wa-Rong, because most of our work is conducted in the evening. We very much need a gas lamp, gas, and an accordion. The one who borrowed the lamp will be here in eight days. By then we will have to go on further. Our itinerary is not limited by time; we just want to move as the Lord leads. We do not know when we will return home. Because of the Lord's grace and the love of the brothers and sisters, the storm has been quelled, and everywhere we have peace. The only way we can advance is through the Lu River. There are a few thousand people who have been baptized but do not know what it means to be saved. If we do not give them the truth of salvation and the church, we will be like those who cross oceans and lands to lure some into their religion, making them sons of hell. Hence, this is the first thing that God has charged us to do. We will inform you as to our plans later. May the Lord grant you rich power and gifts, amen. Give our greetings to all the brothers and sisters in K'un-ming!</p><p>Brother Hu Yi-min, June 27</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>My Brother Kwang-hsi:</p><p>On the fifteenth of this month, Brother Hu and I set out to preach the gospel in Li-Suh. We went to three places, all of which were former fields of Brother Hu. The Li-Suh believers were brought to the Lord by Brother Hu. Originally, both Brother Hu and I were reluctant to preach in these places for fear that we would be accused of stealing others' sheep. Later, he felt that he should testify to them of his former mistakes and his future way. I felt that it was right to preach the gospel to those places which previously had not heard the true gospel. As a result I agreed to walk with Brother Hu. Getting to those places from Yeh-Ji is, at most, a two-day journey; it takes one day to get to the nearest place. These three places are (1) Tuo-Ba-Oh, (2) Zha-Tze-Oh, and (3) Wah-Shi-Loh Street. There were six to seven hundred people baptized in these areas in the past. After Brother Hu left for Shanghai, many of them became backslidden, and now there are only about two hundred left. Some of them (not too many) are saved, but they do not know anything about the truth. Most of them are not even regenerated.</p><p>The natives of Li-Suh mostly live in the mountains, in places that are very inaccessible. Most of them are scattered. In some cases a dozen or so families cluster together, while in other cases, a whole hamlet consists of only one family. Most of their houses are built along the slopes, in the clefts of the rocks, or by the mountain gullies. The houses are made of wood and are called Mu-Leng-Tze, which hold at most five or six people. Except for work, the dwellers spend all four seasons of the year in the house around a fire. For their beds they spread two or three wooden planks on the floor. During the day most of them are out of the house. When the sun goes down, they come home to sleep. Our gospel preaching is conducted mostly in the evening because they have no other free time. Most of the unbelievers among the natives like to drink and are in heavy debt. The Han Chinese induce them to drink wine, and then strip them of their possessions, land, and properties. Most of the Li-Suh natives labor day in and day out. There are only two months out of a year when they have some better days. The rest of the time they cannot even make enough to fill themselves. What a pity! Recently the Lord's word has spread among them, and many Li-Suh natives have turned to the Lord. As a result they abhor alcohol as much as snakes and do their best to remove this abuse. The Li-Suh culture does not consider fornication to be sin. For this reason fornication is very common. Of course, the believers are not like the others; they have advanced greatly. Since the Han merchants realize that believers do not drink, which takes away their source of profit, they have a deep hatred for preachers. However, they can do nothing about it. May the Lord grant them much grace and save their souls from sins so that these Li-Suh people can receive the benefit in their spirit, soul, and body. When the Lord's light shines on them, they will turn to Him through the testimonies among them. Of course, the responsibility is on our shoulders. May the Lord make us faithful to the end, and may the brothers and sisters pray much for us and share in the work here!</p><p>We spent ten days traveling to three places. The purpose of this trip was to bear a testimony and to survey the situation. Thank the Lord that many people like to hear about God's salvation and the gospel of Christ. Many know that they have eternal life and that the Spirit is in them. Those who are saved desire the truth very much. The nature of their meetings is somewhat local (in the eyes of the local believers). But the X denomination in Yeh-Ji considers this area its parish and extension. This is why we do not stay too long to preach the gospel. In these mountain regions I have observed that some among them do have a brotherly love, which proves that they are saved and have life. The past three to four months (between April and July) have been the most difficult months for them. Sometimes they are unable to even buy any food. When we were among them, they always gave us the best. Although we are by no means well-fed, our hearts are filled with joy. The Lord has enlightened us concerning the work ahead. Both Brother Hu and I are of the same mind.</p><p>Preaching in these areas must be conducted in the evenings. These people cannot even afford kerosene lamps. They use chestnut oil for their lamps. The first need in our work is lamps. (Sikang is also short of oil, more than we are.) It is uneconomical to use candles. Brother Hu and I considered buying a gas lamp and a few cans of gas from K'un-ming and using them here. Please ask about the price of a medium-size gas lamp (the kind that lights up without alcohol), the price of a can of gas, and the price of a hand-held lamp in the stores in K'un-ming.</p><p>If it is of the Lord's will and if He so arranges, Brother Hu and I intend to go to the upper tributary of the Nu River, around Gung-Shan County, and preach the gospel. (This area is at the border of Yunnan and Sikang.) No gospel has been preached to this area yet. According to Brother Hu, the natives of Nu River (an eastern tribe) are much less hungry for the truth than the natives of Li-Suh, yet they are quite aggressive. Brother Hu preached there before. There are about five to six thousand people in this place already, and it is an excellent place to work. May these ones truly belong to the Lord. If the Lord is gracious to us and the gospel spreads from here, we can establish local churches here and stay for a longer time. We need a house for our work. Houses near Nu River are mostly built with bamboo, and we can build three or four of them with thirty to forty Yunnan dollars. Gung-Shan County is also close to Sikang. It would be easier for us to advance into Sikang from here. Presently, Sikang province belongs to the Chinese government in name only. The whole region from the west of Jin-Sha River has been under the jurisdiction of the Tibetan government. A few counties east of Ba-Tong are still under the jurisdiction of the Szechuan government. Any Han Chinese entering the areas under Tibetan jurisdiction must first have their papers examined and checked. They consider Han Chinese the same as Westerners. This is one of the reasons there are still no Westerners preaching the gospel in Sikang; there are too many difficulties involved. May the Lord grant us mercy and grace and open the door of preaching so that we can preach His gospel and advance into Tibet. Please pray for us. We will report the details of the work to you later. Peace.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, June 27</p>
