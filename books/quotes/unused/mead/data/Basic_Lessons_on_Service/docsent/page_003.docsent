   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There is only one ministry in the New Testament 2 Cor 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As long as we minister Christ according to the apostles' teaching Acts 2:42 , the teaching of God's New Testament economy 1 Tim 1:3-4 , we are in the one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The one ministry is the ministry of Christ to people for the producing and the building up of the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we see this we can realize that the interpretation or the application among Christians today of the word ministry is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to come back to the pure meaning of this New Testament word to see a clear vision of the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first thing we have to help the saints with concerning the service is how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I do not think that many Christians would consider that to meet is to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Meeting is a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Meeting is a service.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Immediately after we are saved, the first service we have to render to God is to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you have not come together with the saints to meet, you have never begun your ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first time you attended the church meeting, that was the beginning of your service.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is because in the meetings we render our worship to God, and this is the service.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We worship God and we serve God in our meetings, and in our meetings we offer our praises and our thanks to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The crucial thing in the meetings is that we offer Christ to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At our conversion God gave us His Son as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Immediately after we are saved, we come to worship God in our meetings to render God's gift, Christ, to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is our offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At our conversion God gave His Son to us as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we were saved, we became the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we have to serve God, to come to the meetings to offer Christ to God as the unique gift which God the Father has given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our ministry toward God is to minister Christ to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the type in the Old Testament, the priests ministered to God with offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They offered their burnt offerings, meal offerings, and peace offerings to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These were things ministered to God for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the top service.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is a shame that we Christians have missed this kind of understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We never considered that to come to the meeting to offer Christ to God is our top service.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In ancient times, all the Israelites came together to worship God three times a year Deut 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first thing they did was to bring all the rich surplus of the produce of the good land and offer this surplus to God for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That was the top service they rendered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That type has to be fulfilled today in the New Testament with us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our salvation was our Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now that we have received God's salvation with Christ as our Passover, we must offer Christ to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Offering Christ to God is our service.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more that we stress this, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Very few would consider that we meet to serve God and that our service is our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To meet is to serve, to minister.</S>
