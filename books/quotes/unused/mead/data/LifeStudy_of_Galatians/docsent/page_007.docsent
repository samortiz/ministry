   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THREE GOD S SON VERSUS MAN S RELIGION Scripture Reading: Gal 1:13-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1:13-16 we see the matter of God s Son versus man s religion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 13 and 14 present a vivid picture of man s religion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 13 Paul says, For you have heard of my manner of life formerly in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we see a contrast between the Jewish religion and the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Paul was in Judaism, he persecuted the church because the church was different from his religion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul hated the church because it detracted from his religion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In his religious zeal, he persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 14 Paul goes on to say, And I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The traditions here were those in the sect of the Pharisees, to which Paul belonged.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He called himself a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee Acts 23:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Jewish religion was composed not only of the God-given law and its rituals, but also of man-made traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because Paul was so zealous for the traditions of his fathers, he became a leading religionist and advanced beyond many of his contemporaries.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>GOD S PLEASURE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>TO REVEAL HIS SON IN US</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then in verses 15 and 16 Paul declares, But when it pleased God...to reveal His Son in me....</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the time appointed by God, when Saul, zealous in his religion, was persecuting the church, the Son of God was revealed to him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God could bear with Saul s zeal for the traditions of his fathers, for this produced a dark background against which to reveal Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At a time which was pleasing to Him, God revealed His Son in Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God was pleased to reveal to him the living Person of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To reveal His Son in us is also a pleasure to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is Christ, the Son of God, not the law, in whom God the Father is always pleased Matt 3:17; 12:18; 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Son of God as the embodiment and expression of God the Father John 1:18; 14:9-11; Heb 1:3 is life to us John 10:10; 1 John 5:12; Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The desire of God s heart is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life John 17:3; 3:16 , and become the sons of God John 1:12; Gal 4:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the Son of the living God Matt 16:16 , Christ is far superior to Judaism and its traditions Gal 1:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Judaizers bewitched the Galatians so that they considered the ordinances of the law above the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, the apostle in the opening of this Epistle testified that he had been deeply involved in that realm and far advanced in it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God, however, had rescued him out of that course of the world, which was evil in God s eyes, by revealing His Son in him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In his experience, Paul realized that there is no comparison between the Son of the living God and Judaism with its dead traditions from his fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1:16 Paul emphasizes the fact that the Son of God was revealed in him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that God s revealing of His Son to us is in us, not outwardly but inwardly; not by an outward vision but by an inward seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not an objective revelation; it is a subjective one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God made the Apostle Paul a minister of Christ by setting him apart, calling him, and revealing His Son in him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, what Paul preached was not the law, but Christ the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, he did not merely preach the doctrine concerning Christ; he preached Christ as a living Person.</S>
