   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Glorification is the last step of our full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we are glorified, we reach the climax of God s full salvation and enter into its full enjoyment for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the time all Christians look forward to very much.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is our glorious hope.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is glorification?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is the process of bringing something or someone into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then, what is the meaning of the word glory according to the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I. GLORY GOD EXPRESSED</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 3:23 says, For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the Bible, glory is just God expressed or the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When God is hidden, there is no glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When God is seen and expressed, glory is there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man was created to contain the life of God and to express Him with such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we can say that man was created for glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But this man sinned, losing his right to receive God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because of this, man could not express God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So the Bible says he has come short of the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Glorification is God s action in bringing us into the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He does this in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE BLOSSOMING OF THE SEED</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A carnation seed is a small, round ball and without any beauty, yet it has the life potential to blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The blossom is the full expression of all that is in that small seed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is the glory of that seed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After planting, watering, and growing, this seed becomes a plant.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After a while, it blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This blossom is just the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the seed is full-grown, you see a flower.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The seed becomes the flower, and the flower is just the seed fully grown.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you have the seed, you have the living hope of the flower.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you have no seed, you have no living, practical hope of a flower.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So, within the seed is a flowering life, and this life is the hope of the seed s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>CHRIST IN US, THE HOPE OF GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Colossians 1:27b says, Christ in you, the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the gospel was preached to you and you believed, Christ came into you as a seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This seed in you is your hope of glory in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our hope of being brought into the full expression of God is in this seed of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today, we don t look glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Christ inside of us has not grown so much.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But from regeneration through the process of sanctification, transformation and conformation, Christ is added into us and grows within us just as the carnation seed grows in the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One day, when Christ becomes fully grown, He will blossom in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What has been hidden within this seed will be fully expressed, and we will be glorified!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>AT CHRIST S SECOND COMING</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Colossians 3:4 tells us that when Christ our life is manifested, then you also shall be manifested with Him in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ s second coming, when He comes to the earth again, is His manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we would live by Christ as our life today, we will be manifested with Him in glory when He appears.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We will be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This glory comes out from within us; it does not come upon us suddenly from outside.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First, this seed is sown into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then, it grows into all the parts of our soul; and finally, it fills and saturates even our physical body, making us just like the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that time, we will become the many sons of God in full.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How glorious that day will be.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But now, we all must grow in life so that we will blossom in life at that day.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not a miracle, but a result of life growing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Second Thessalonians 1:10a says, Whenever He comes to be glorified in His saints.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This verse tells us that His coming is our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When He comes, we will be glorified in Him and He will be glorified in us!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Through God s salvation, we the sinners become the sons of God, full of God s life and glory in order to express Him for eternity!</S>
