   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>l The Case of Zebedee's Two Sons</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One day, the mother of Zebedee's children came with her two sons to Jesus to pray Matt 20:20-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She prayed a good prayer, asking that her two sons sit on the Lord's two sides in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all might have prayed such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus answered her prayer, but not according to the way she prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus said, "You have prayed about the two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now you must know that whether or not your sons will have these two sides is not up to Me. It is up to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But I tell you one thing you must suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You must drink what I will drink and suffer what I will suffer."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that if you are going to have authority, you need to have life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To suffer is to gain life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there is no death, there is no life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there is no suffering, there is no life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Life always comes through suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are going to obtain authority, we need to gain life through suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>m The Cases of the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The entire book of Acts and all the Epistles show us that the apostles were persons who bore the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, they constantly had God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They had God's image and they exercised God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not just consider them as good preachers or great teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That is not the climax.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must look at them as persons who bore God's image and exercised divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>n The Negative Case of Sceva's Seven Sons</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The seven sons of Sceva saw how Paul cast out demons by the name of Jesus Acts 19:13-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They imitated Paul, telling the demons, "I cast you out by the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The demons are not so easy to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The demon said, "Jesus I know and Paul I know, but who are you to cast me out?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I will jump all over you."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead of defeating the demons, the demons defeated them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you don't have the image, you can never have authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The demons know and you yourself also know.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you don't have life, you don't have authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you don't bear the image, you can never exercise dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>o The Case of the Believers in the Church Age</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Revelation 5:10 and 1 Peter 2:9 both tell us that today Christians are royal priests.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand we are priests; on the other hand we are kings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, we need to contact God that we may have the real image to bear the glory of God in life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we have the authority to represent God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But most Christians miss this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They don't look like priests and, thus, they are not kings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you don't bear the image, you will lose the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Praise God that through all the centuries there have been and there still are some saints who contact God, keeping themselves in the real priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They have authority and they exercise kingship.</S>
