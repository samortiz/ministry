<h1 class="title">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT<br />
AND PRACTICING TO SPEAK<br />
FOR THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: March 31, 1961</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUR SPIRIT BEING LIVING AND RELEASED<br />
AND NOT WAITING FOR INSPIRATION</h2>
<p>When we lead the young people&rsquo;s meeting, our spirit should be living and released. The atmosphere in a meeting is crucial because it can either enliven or kill the saints. If we activate and exercise our spirit when we arrive at a meeting, the saints will be enlivened by the atmosphere of the meeting. Due to our background, however, many brothers and sisters are passive when they attend the bread-breaking meeting or the prayer meeting. Instead of exercising their spirit, they wait to be inspired by the Spirit. This is not a good situation. If we merely sit on chairs with Bibles and hymnals in our hands but do not exercise our spirit, it will be difficult to experience the flow of the Spirit.</p>
<p>If we do not stir up our spirit, the Spirit will not be able to move us. A car moves only when its engine has been ignited. If we do not &ldquo;ignite&rdquo; our spirit and, instead, wait for others to &ldquo;ignite&rdquo; it, the atmosphere of the meeting will not be living. Our meetings have suffered greatly in the past because this has been our practice. We need to break this pattern. Others always know when our spirit is not exercised. Without an exercised spirit, our spirit will be lethargic, and we will have an attitude of waiting for the Spirit&rsquo;s inspiration in the meeting. Furthermore, a lethargic spirit is not a serving spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING THE MEETING WITH OTHERS<br />
IN A SERVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We can illustrate this situation by considering a basketball game. When basketball players arrive at a game, they must be ready to play. If they come onto the court wearing long gowns instead of uniforms, they will not be prepared to play. Similarly, the meeting will be affected if we sit quietly and our spirit is not exercised through either praying or singing. However, if we exercise and release our spirit as soon as we arrive at a meeting and if all the saints bear the burden of the meeting by praying together in a blended way, the meeting will be full of power. If we are burdened, we will even arrive at a meeting five or ten minutes early and we will begin to pray with whomever is there. Consequently, the prayer will begin spontaneously with just two or three.</p>
<p>Coming together to meet is a service, so we must have a serving attitude. Just like a basketball player who is prepared to play, we must be prepared to &ldquo;play ball&rdquo; when we arrive at a meeting. We cannot merely be spectators. When we arrive at a meeting, we should not wait for others to function. Neither should we wait for the leading brothers to pray or call a hymn. Young saints who do not pray in a young people&rsquo;s meeting are like basketball players who do not play ball when they arrive at a game.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT AND FELLOWSHIPPING<br />
WITH THE LORD CONTINUALLY</h2>
<p>We cannot be spectators in the regular meetings of the church and then exercise our spirit when we are serving in the young people&rsquo;s meeting. This kind of service cannot receive much blessing, because we cannot fool God. The law of God&rsquo;s blessing is that we must exercise our spirit. We must exercise our spirit at all times in order to receive His blessing. Our spirit is strengthened whenever it is exercised. If we do not exercise our spirit during the regular meetings of the church, it will be difficult to exercise our spirit when we are serving in the young people&rsquo;s meeting. The church has not advanced much because the saints are waiting to be inspired by the Spirit and thus are not exercised in their spirit. The thought of waiting for the Spirit&rsquo;s inspiration is an erroneous concept.</p>
<p>Those who serve the young people should come together to pray for the young people&rsquo;s meeting. If there is a preparation time before the young people&rsquo;s meeting, the serving ones should come early and pray together. It is not good for serving ones to be singing during the preparation time while others arrive late and at a leisurely pace. Someone who comes late does not have an attitude that corresponds to a serving spirit. If a person has a serving spirit, he will arrive early because he is burdened inwardly, not because he is following a pre-arranged schedule. If the saints have a serving spirit, they will arrive early to pray and sing. Thus, when they go to the young people&rsquo;s meeting, the meeting will be living, and the atmosphere will be absolutely different.</p>
<p>If the serving ones prepare material related to some points and only begin to exercise their spirit when they arrive at the young people&rsquo;s meeting, this is not a proper attitude. If they do not exercise their spirit regularly, their time in the young people&rsquo;s meeting will only be a performance. When some saints begin to serve with the young people, they have a burden, and they pray. However, as they continue to serve, their service becomes routine, and they do not continue to pray. Then their service becomes a duty that they force themselves to fulfill. A serving one should be a man of prayer, even if he is serving only out of a sense of duty. The Yangtze River in China flows continuously; it flows whether people need water or not. Likewise, when a serving one is preparing to give a message, he needs to pray, but even if he is not giving a message, he still needs to fellowship with the Lord. It is not enough to pray only when he has to give a message. His fellowship and prayer with the Lord should be continual, just like the continual flowing of the Yangtze River.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Leading the Young People with the Word and the Spirit &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
