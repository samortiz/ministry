   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Ninety-nine THE FIRST SIGN WATER CHANGED INTO WINE Scripture: John 2:1-11 The Lord came to Cana The Lord came to Cana.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Cana means a land of reeds, signifying weak and fragile people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Isaiah 42:3 says, A bruised reed He will not break.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>So the reeds refer to those who are weak, fragile, and bruised.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord coming to Cana meant He came to the place of fragile people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Cana is in Galilee, a place despised by people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This message uses the weak and fragile people as a base, so it talks about man s weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man is weak and bruises easily.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once pressed, he is bruised; once touched, he falls.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord came to Cana on the third day, the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means the Lord came to the fragile people in resurrection, or the resurrected Lord came to the fragile people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The foregoing chapter talks about the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Lamb of God took away the sins of the world, He entered into resurrection; that is, He came the third day to bring enjoyment to man s life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord was invited to the wedding Marriage is the most important event to man, and wedding signifies the enjoyment of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Human life depends firstly on the creation of God and secondly on marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without marriage, there would be no continuation and therefore no existence of man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus marriage is human life, and wedding is the enjoyment of the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord coming to the wedding meant He had come into human life and into the enjoyment of the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The center of the wedding feast was wine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Wine is the life-juice of the grape.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Though it is a liquid, it is different from water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Water does not grow out from something, but wine does.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The center of the wedding is the wine, signifying that the enjoyment of human living depends on life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without life, there is no enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The wine is limited; it runs out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This signifies our human life will die.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only the old couples die, but also the young couples die.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If, in a couple, one dies, the enjoyment is also gone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the running out of wine in the wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When life ends, the human living and the enjoyment of human life also ends.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A newlywed couple might get tuberculosis while they are enjoying the pleasures of human life; then there would be the running out of the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>An old couple married for fifty years is also running out of wine.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If they drink a little more, it would still run out.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord changed water to wine He did not follow man s will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mary first told Him that there was no wine, but the Lord did not do anything then.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is to say that the Lord does things not according to man s will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You might be very anxious in hoping your husband, wife or children will be saved, but the Lord purposely slows down His work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord does everything according to His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When all the opinions of man have ceased, then He starts doing something.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before the Lord changed water into wine, there were six stone waterpots.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Six is the number of man, for man was created on the sixth day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Stone is natural, thus six stone waterpots signify the created human beings and those that do not have God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There was only water in the stone waterpots.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Water signifies death, and wine signifies life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord used His life with His creating power to change water into wine, that is, to change death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This wine is not a natural wine, but a miraculous wine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The wine in the wedding feast was natural wine, which meant the center of the enjoyment of life depended on the natural life, and this life will run out.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since the Lord had come in, the life which man received was God s eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The enjoyment of this new life is endless, and causes the wedding to last until eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the beginning of signs All the signs which the Lord did had this sign as a beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the work which the Lord has done upon us is that of signs, to change the death in us into life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Giving us life is the beginning of all His works.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord changing death into life was a miracle among miracles and was the biggest miracle in all His miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Moody once said that the biggest miracle which the Lord ever did was to give life to those who were dead in sins.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Results To satisfy the enjoyment of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To express God s glory and God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God s glory can only be manifested when man receives the resurrection life.</S>
