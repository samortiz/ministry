   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>But let us remember, if God gives you a message which He means you to take hold of, He holds you, even when you appear to lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>His Word given to you lays hold of you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That word has divine life and energy in it, and it can grip you, and hold you to it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God requires your co-operation, of course, and you must actively take the word by faith; but the power is in the Word itself when God has spoken it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the Lord has given you the word "power over the power of the enemy", you have to co-operate by saying in response, "I choose and accept it, Lord, but I have no power to hold it; the Word must hold me."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And in truth you often apparently lose it, so that it goes right away from you, but if you go on steadily in bare faith, you come at last through the tunnel working of God, to the consummation point, and then what looked like a literal impossibility to you when God gave you the light, you find has been wrought into you as part of your very life; assimilated and incorporated into your spiritual being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a believer has pressed on with God faithfully from plane to plane, and has reached the sphere of warfare and victory over the powers of the air, then he should be able to lead others into any of the degrees of blessing they need; but, usually, when the soul is in a certain stage, and not arrived at its full consummation, he can only help others in the same stage, speaking out of his present light and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not until the consummation point is reached that the believer has liberty and facility in dealing with others in planes which he himself has left behind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the transitional stage of each plane, you can only give the vision you have, so that your ministry seems limited to those who are at the same stage.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You interpret to them what you, and they, are experiencing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But when you are through that plane, it seems as if you are able to minister to souls at any degree as they may need it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore you must never be disturbed if any one says that your "message" did not help them at all, or possibly your message was "above their heads".</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fact is, you were obliged to give it, for you were not free enough for anything else, and you ministered only to a certain number of souls who could be helped by that message.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What about others, you ask?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Remember you cannot meet the needs of all until you have passed through the stages of all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A worker needs to be very matured in the spiritual life to have light and truth for "all saints", just as Paul had, and the other apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the believer has passed through these "planes" a matter of years, more or less and he reaches the plane of power over the forces of darkness, in its fullest degree, then he is in the "apostolic" stage, with sufficient facility, and equipment, and knowledge, and liberty, from his own experience of the Word of Righteousness Hebrews 5:13 , to be able to handle the Word of God as a steward, and to minister it to others at their various degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you become matured and ripened, then you do not speak from what you yourself are at the moment experiencing, but you are able to use the Scripture of truth as an armoury, and be "furnished completely" for every good work, able to wield, or apply the Word of God to each soul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is real equipment, and ripeness of maturity, and fitness for service in the power of the Holy Ghost.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is also needed is that Christians should know that the victory of Calvary over the powers of darkness is required to be apprehended by them in every stage of the spiritual life, and every plane of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1 The evangelist needs to know it, because to win souls to Christ, he must learn how to bind the devil holding souls, and therefore the truth of victory over the powers of darkness as declared in the Word of God, is part of the evangelist's armour and equipment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2 Those who receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit need to know the victory over the powers of darkness, so as to be able to detect the counterfeits, and to refuse them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3 Those who go on in the path of the Cross equally need to know the devices of the deceiving spirits, because they will interfere with them at every step onward in their knowledge of the Cross, and try to mix their workings with the work of God in every degree.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In fact, the truths about the powers of darkness need to be known in every plane, and at each stage of the spiritual life, according to the measure and need.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the urgent work to be done now is to meet the need of the advanced ranks of the Church of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who can, "by reason of use", exercise their spiritual senses, and are able to "eat" and assimilate the "solid food" which is for those of full age; as well as to give the same spiritual food in "milk" form to the babes, so that they may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In helping others, if you find that believers do not understand the meaning of the prayer-warfare, you should ask them if they know anything about the Cross, and the position of death with Christ, according to Romans 6; for they must know the death to sin, and to the world, before they can understand the spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they do not know the power of the Cross, you must go further back, and ask them if they know the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, for the power to know experimentally the fellowship of Christ's death is given by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If they do not know the baptism of the Holy Spirit, you must go further back still, and ask them if they possess the new life in Christ at all.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can a soul receive the fulness of the Holy Spirit, if it does not know Christ as a Saviour, and is not born from above into the kingdom of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must as workers be able to lead souls back from point to point to the place of need, and recognize the four grades, or planes, of growth in dealing with them.</S>
