   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Receiving Light 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the Light of Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Lord Jesus saw this blind man, He said, While I am in the world, I am the light of the world 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord is the light of life 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Blindness comes from the shortage of the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every dead person is a blind man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Undoubtedly, the dead cannot see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, blindness indicates the lack of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you have life, then you have sight, for light opens your eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So, first of all, the Lord pointed out that the blind man needed the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By the Anointing of the Word of Life</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mingled with Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 6 is very interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When He had said this, He spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed his eyes with the clay.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I was a young Christian, not understanding the meaning of this verse, I laughed at what the Lord did.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What He did was very strange.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No one likes to touch a person s spittle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the Lord Jesus mixed His spittle with the ground and made clay.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then He used the clay to anoint the man s eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Gospel of John is a book of pictures, and this incident is a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not understand it merely according to the black and white letters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must pray and look to the Lord that we may receive the true meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I cannot tell you how much time I have spent in studying this point.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I consulted various books in my attempt to find an interpretation, but I did not find one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One day, not more than twenty-five years ago, I saw the matter of the mingling of the divine life with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This word mingling has been in use by us for not more than twenty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you go to the Christian bookstores, you will not find even one book that speaks about mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The most that the books speak of is union with Christ or identification with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not one book discusses this matter of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1958, when I first visited this country, I delivered a message on the mingling of the divine life with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A preacher, a graduate of Oxford, immediately corrected my English, saying that mingling was not the right word and that I should use the word co-mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I replied, Whether this word is the right English word or not I am not sure because English is not my mother tongue, but I do know that there is such a fact between the divine life and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Later, I received a confirmation from the book of Leviticus that the word mingling was the right word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word mingling is used in Leviticus 2:5.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And if thy oblation be a meat offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a type.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The fine flour typifies the humanity of the Lord Jesus, and the oil typifies the Holy Spirit, the divinity of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, in the Person of the Lord Jesus there is the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, when I visited this country the second time, I began to speak boldly about the mingling of the divine life with our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some cautioned me not to speak much about this, but rather to stay within the limits of identification and union.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I said, Brothers, I don t care for the human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I only care for the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How about Leviticus 2:5 the fine flour mingled with the oil?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not come to me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You should go to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was the first one to use this word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since 1963 the Lord has burdened us to publish the magazine entitled The Stream.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Again and again in that magazine we have spoken about the mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now many people are picking up this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now we may return to John 9 and apply to it this concept of the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The clay in 9:6, as in Romans 9:21, signifies humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man is clay.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We all are clay.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is the spittle?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Spittle here, as something that proceeds out of the mouth Matt 4:4 of the Lord, signifies His words which...are spirit and life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Figuratively speaking, the spittle is the Word, which is spirit and life, that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Word that proceeds out of the mouth of Christ is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, to mingle spittle with the clay signifies the mingling of humanity with the Lord s living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The word anointed proves this, because the Lord s Spirit is the anointing Spirit Luke 4:18; 2 Cor 1:21-22; 1 John 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The spittle, then, signifies the Word, the outflow of the very element or essence of the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The clay was mingled with the spittle.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This signifies that the Lord mingles His essence with us by and even with His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are clay by nature, and the very essence of the Lord in the Word is the spittle.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Formerly, when we were sinners, we were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we heard the Word of the Lord, His Word came into us as those made of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we heard and received the gospel, it was actually the spittle of the Lord that came into us, men of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In other words, the clay received something that proceeded out of the mouth of the Lord and was mingled with it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The mingling of divinity with humanity is the most prevailing ointment on the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>No other ointment can surpass it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord anointed the man s blind eyes with the clay that was mingled with spittle.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This signifies the anointing of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The anointing of the Spirit of life follows the mingling of the Lord in His Word with the clay.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Immediately after you receive the Lord through His Word, there is the anointing of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord s anointing the blind eyes with the clay made of His spittle signifies that by the anointing of the mingling of the Lord s Word, which is His Spirit, with our humanity, our eyes, which were blinded by Satan, may have sight.</S>
