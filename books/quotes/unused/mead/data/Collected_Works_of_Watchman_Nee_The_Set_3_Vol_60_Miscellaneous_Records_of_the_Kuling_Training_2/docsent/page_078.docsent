   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REASON FOR THE BELIEVERS' MARTYRDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If a new one asks why there must be martyrdom, we should tell him that the world hates the Lord for no reason John 15:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 10:22 tells us that believers will be hated by men because of the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Satan is the one who instigates this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is the one who is behind men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One writer who wrote of the martyrs in the first two centuries said that every year, except for the first day of January, over five thousand believers were killed every day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time those who preached the gospel, preached with their own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There was a saying that the martyr's blood is the seed of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some Roman soldiers observed believers at the time of their martyrdom and were so greatly moved that they believed in the Lord and requested that they be allowed to join the martyrs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan hates the name of Christ; his followers are all workers of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They do not want the light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the reason they try to kill believers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand, a believer suffers death because he is faithful and would not betray the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the other hand, this is how he confesses the Lord's name according to the teaching of the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matthew 10:32 says, "Every one therefore who will confess in Me before men, I also will confess in him before My Father who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christian martyrdom is different from any other kind of martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Others are caught because they cannot run fast enough.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A Christian can escape, but he would rather not run because of the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some were brought before the idols and were asked only to burn incense before the images in order to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, they refused and were thrown to the beasts and eaten up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the great Catholic inquisition, those who acknowledged the Catholic mass were released, and those who refused were murdered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Under all kinds of duress, believers chose to confess the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All of God's children know that there is no need to fear him who is able only to kill the body but not the soul and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such ones can only destroy one's mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The noble expression on the face of many martyrs is indeed a beautiful testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Acts 20:24 Paul said, "I consider my life of no account as if precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify of the gospel of the grace of God."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The way of the church is to finish the ministry it has received and to testify of the gospel of the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the conference in Acts 15, James, Peter, and the elders also said in their letter of recommendation of Paul and Barnabas that they were men who had "risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ" v. 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christian martyrdom comes from the persecutions of the world on the one hand and from the Roman Catholic Church on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John 16:2 says, "For every one who kills you...think s that he is offering service to God."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Roman Catholic Church believes in God, but it considered killing Christians as a service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Persecutions from these two sources make Christian martyrdom one of the most beautiful chapters in church history.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Persecutions have followed the same pattern throughout the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Countless numbers of people died from the Catholic persecution during and before the time of Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During the Spanish reign, the Roman Catholic Church murdered many people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Still more died during the reign of Mussolini.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From 1929 to 1940 over 1.3 million Christians died in the Soviet Union.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Second Thessalonians 2:3 says that Antichrist, the son of perdition, will oppose the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the one hand, there is the persecution from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the other hand, there is the persecution from the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These persecutions will follow God's children wherever they go.</S>
