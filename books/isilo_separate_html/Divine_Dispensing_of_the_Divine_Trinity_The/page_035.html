<p>Our Christ is the Son of Man (John 1:51; Rev. 1:13). Christ is not only the Son of God with the divine nature, but also the Son of Man with the human nature. He is the Son of Man for redemption, to take away our sin and solve the problems between us and God, that God might be dispensed into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Lamb of God</h2>
<p>John ministered Christ as the Lamb of God (John 1:29; Rev. 5:6; 13:8; 22:1). The Lamb of God was not the Son of God, but the Son of Man. God does not have blood to shed for our redemption, nor does the Son of God have blood, but the Lamb, the Son of Man, has blood. This is not the blood of goats or oxen, but the genuine blood of a genuine man which is able to redeem us. Men need a man&rsquo;s blood to redeem them. This redeeming is for the dispensing of God as life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As a Propitiation Concerning Our Sins</h2>
<p>As the Lamb, Christ is the propitiation concerning our sins (1 John 2:2). A propitiation is a kind of appeasing. Because of our sins there was a turmoil, a storm, a problem between God and us. There was no peace. Christ as the Son of Man who was the Lamb of God died on the cross to be our propitiation. He calmed down the storm and the turmoil. He solved the problem. So He is our propitiation. He calmed the turmoil, and He appeased God. So now there is a kind of peaceful condition between God and us. This is for life dispensing. If there is not such a peaceful condition, there is no way to dispense life. When you are going to eat, you must stop any fighting. You cannot eat well if you are quarreling with your wife or with the brothers. If you are quarreling and fighting there is no life dispensing. Eating and life dispensing need a peaceful situation. The Lord Jesus became the propitiation concerning our sins between us and God to create a peaceful situation for the life dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As an Advocate with the Father</h2>
<p>Christ is our Advocate with the Father (1 John 2:1). This means He is our Attorney. He takes our case legally. Satan, the enemy of God and our subtle enemy, is very subtly legal. The Bible tells us that he accuses us before our God day and night (Rev. 12:10). His accusation is somewhat subtly legal. He would say, &ldquo;God, You are righteous. Look at all the children You love. Not one of them is righteous. And You are so holy. But look at Your children; every one is dirty.&rdquo; This kind of accusation is somewhat legal. But God the Father would say, &ldquo;Satan, look at Jesus Christ the righteous One. My children have a good Attorney.&rdquo; Then our Attorney, Jesus Christ, would turn to Satan and say, &ldquo;Satan, don&rsquo;t you see My blood? Satan, shut up! Don&rsquo;t say anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is not just my teaching. This is the word in Revelation chapter twelve. According to revelation 12:10 and 11 Satan is accusing God&rsquo;s children day and night. But they can over come him by the blood of the Lamb. Once we realize that we are unclean, unholy, and unrighteous, we are defeated and the life dispensing stops. But we have the blood of Jesus! He is our Advocate, our Attorney. We have to tell Satan, &ldquo;Shut up! Don&rsquo;t say anything!&rdquo; Then we need to praise the Lamb! Hallelujah to the Lamb! Hallelujah for the blood! When we shout Hallelujah! life is dispensed into us once more. Christ, our Advocate, is taking care of our case so that life dispensing can keep going on all the time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Alpha and the Omega</h2>
<p>Our Christ is the Alpha and the Omega (Rev. 22:13a). In the Greek alphabet Christ is the first letter, Alpha, the last letter, Omega, and all the letters in between. He is every letter. In ourselves we are no letter, but we are in Christ. As He is an Alpha, so we are an alpha. As He is an Omega, so we are an omega. He is every letter of the alphabet for the dispensing of life. He is inexhaustible, and His dispensing of life is inexhaustible. He is the Alpha, the Omega, and all the alphabet.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> </body></html>
