   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE CHRIST IN HIS HUMANITY THE MEANING OF RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because we are in His recovery, we must know what the word recovery means.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be recovered is to be brought back by the Lord to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the beginning, there was the Lord Himself and the pure, living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christianity, however, has deviated both from the Lord and from the living Word and has become a religion of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Christianity there is very little of the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Most Christians have the Lord Jesus only as their Redeemer and Savior; they do not have Christ as their everything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some have Christ in name, and others have Christ in doctrine; however, they do not have Christ in His all-inclusiveness and the complete, pure, living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, they have the so-called creeds that cover only certain parts of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We in the Lord s recovery do not care for creeds; we care only to follow the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No matter how good or how accurate a creed may be, it can never contain the entire Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you devote your attention to creeds rather than to the Bible, you will certainly be lacking something.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Fifty years ago, we saw that we had to come back to the beginning, to the Lord Himself and not to any kind of religion, including the religion of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, we saw that we had to return to the whole Bible, not just to part of it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason, we have never followed anything blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Anything we observed in Christianity, we brought to the Lord, and we prayed about it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we considered it in the light of the Bible to see whether or not it corresponded to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We studied everything carefully and thoroughly according to the pure, complete, living Word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the time of Martin Luther, the majority of the so-called Christians in the historic church had lost the Lord Himself and had been deprived of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the Lord raised up Martin Luther and brought him back to Himself and to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Bible Luther saw the matter of justification by faith, which was absolutely a contrast to the teaching of Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Luther fought for justification by faith, the battle was won, and justification by faith was firmly established.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>AND THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, that was just the beginning of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What about the practice of the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>More than four hundred years have passed since the time of Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although justification by faith was recovered long ago, the church life has not yet been fully recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The reason for this is that the church life comes out of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It does not take much experience to be justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As long as we believe in Jesus Christ, we are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But to have the church life, we need the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The eating of the manna signifies the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we have seen, the tabernacle comes out of the eating of the manna, that is, out of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, the temple issues out of the enjoyment of the rich produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This strongly indicates that the experience of Christ issues in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The reason the church life has not been practiced throughout the centuries is that Christians have had mainly the doctrine of Christ; they have had very little of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever we experience Christ, we spontaneously have the desire for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you enjoy and experience Christ in the morning, you will desire to meet with other Christians in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The enjoyment of Christ will bring you to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I speak of the experience of Christ, I refer to the eating of Christ, the enjoyment of Christ as our food and our life supply, the partaking of Christ as our daily enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everyone who enjoys Christ and eats Him desires to attend the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever I experience Christ, this experience encourages me and even inwardly compels me to seek the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many Christians have no interest in the church life because they have merely a mental doctrine of the three Persons of the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although they hold to their doctrine, they have no experience of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To them, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are very remote.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>While some of them hold the Triune God as a doctrine, they continue to go to movies, to drink, and to dance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Apparently, their doctrine has no effect on their living.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But when they hear of someone speaking of the Son and the Spirit in a way that differs from their concept, they rise up to defend the traditional teaching of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What a pitiful situation!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We, on the contrary, want to have a Father whom we can experience, a Son who is our life supply and daily enjoyment, and a Spirit who transforms us and changes our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we have merely the doctrine of the Trinity, we shall not sense our need for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if we experience the Triune God, we shall immediately become aware of our need for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We in the Lord s recovery are burdened for the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are not in tradition and we do not care for tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We care for the living Lord and the living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the living Word, we see the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The all-inclusive Christ is not for doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is for our enjoyment so that we can have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, for the sake of the church life, we need to see who Christ is and what Christ is.</S>
