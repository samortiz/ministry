   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE DIVINE ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE SURPASSING RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; John 12:24; 14:20; Eph 2:6; 1 Pet 1:3; Eph 1:19-23; Gen 2:21-24; Eph 5:30-32</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Four main items concerning Christ in His divine economy are His incarnation, His human living, His death, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we understand these four major items of Christ, we will realize that these major points of Christ's process are for the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen that His incarnation, human living, and all-inclusive death are for God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this chapter we will see that His resurrection is also for the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>AN ILLUSTRATION OF CHRIST'S DEATH,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>RESURRECTION, AND REPRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Lord Jesus told His disciples that He was going to die, they were troubled and disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They thought that if the Lord would suffer and die that everything would be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But every time the Lord told them about His death, He also told them about His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At least three times the Lord Jesus told them this one thing Matt 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They only grasped the thought of His death but not of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, the Lord told them that He was a grain of wheat John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>People generally do not have the concept of resurrection, but in God's creation we can see the principle of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a grain of wheat is sown into the earth, it dies in the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But that death is not the end. That death leads to something further resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you bury a small rock, it will not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if you sow a grain of wheat into the earth, it will die and grow, and that growth is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When it grows, it produces and brings forth many grains, and those grains are the release, the reproduction, the multiplication, and the increase of that one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may consider the matter of a grain of wheat falling into the earth and dying in a common way, but the principle here is not common.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus used this as an illustration of His death, resurrection, and reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This reproduction is the dispensing of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reproduction of the one grain of wheat is the dispensing of the life of this one grain into many grains.</S>
