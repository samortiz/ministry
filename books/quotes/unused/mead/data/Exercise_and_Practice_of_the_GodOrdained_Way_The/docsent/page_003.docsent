   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As the Priests of the Gospel Preaching the Gospel by Visiting People Where They Are</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First, we are the priests of the New Testament gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, we must act, behave, live, and move as priests of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All of us have to visit people where they are to get them saved, to bring them to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although many have been preaching the gospel, most of the preaching of the gospel today is not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although some preach things that are according to the Scriptures, the way they preach is not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They do not preach the gospel of the New Testament according to God's ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to realize first that we are the New Testament priests of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all know that the main work a priest does is to offer sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must do the work of the gospel as a priest to produce some sacrifices for God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From my youth as a Christian, I learned that we Christians are priests of God, but I did not know what sacrifices we should offer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I was taught that we should offer our praises and thanks to God as sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I also learned that we should give material things to God, His children, His church, His servants, and so forth as sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But these are too minor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The major sacrifices we should offer to God are the sinners saved by the gospel through our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Romans 15, Paul says that he was "a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable" v. 16 . Paul offered the Gentile believers saved through his preaching as a sacrifice to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all must have this kind of concept.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How many people have you brought to Christ since you have been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As one of God's priests, could you not bring one person to the Lord in one year, three hundred sixty-five days?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is logical and fair.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If not, suppose you were the Lord, what would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe you would fire such a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some have criticized door-knocking, saying, "I went out for two months and did not gain anyone."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then I would answer: "What about the other ten months?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Does a mother bring forth a child every day?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's natural law regulates.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A child should be in its mother's womb for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a mother wants a second child, it is not so easy because nine months of one year are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She has only three months left, so she has to borrow from the next year.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is God's regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once a mother has conceived, she learns the lesson of patience day after day for two hundred seventy days.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we preach the gospel like such a patient mother, in at least nine months, we could bring one to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may think this would be small, but actually it is not small.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose each one of us will get one yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Surely the church will be doubled within one year.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's way seems too slow, yet it goes very fast.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God created only one man, Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But today there are billions of Adams on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is very slow, yet the most prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I recently studied some statistics.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the past one hundred fifty years, two heretical groups have been the most successful in increasing their numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They did this by the way of door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One group is the Mormons, and the other is the Jehovah's Witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I studied statistics put out by the Jehovah's Witnesses for the twelve nations in which their work was the most prevailing last year.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Japan, they figured out that they need to spend more than six thousand hours to get one person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that even if they work ten hours a day for two years they may get only one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even if you could get only one person in one year, although it seems slow, it is much better than doing nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may have gone out for two months and gained no one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>So why not try another two months?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why not try the third two months, the fourth two months, and the fifth two months?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you could not gain one this year, try the next year.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our problem is, first, we do not realize that we are priests of the gospel, and second, we do not persevere in our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some may say, "Peter spoke once on the day of Pentecost and three thousand were saved, and then a few days later, five thousand were added."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is such a history in the Bible, but today who can say, "I speak, and I gain three thousand"?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That is not God's ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God did not say that if a woman would be faithful and believe in Him, one day He would suddenly give her three thousand children.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I believe Adam brought forth many children, but I do not believe he brought forth one dozen a year.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some have said that we should bear fruit every month like the tree of life in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To talk this way is one thing, but to practice it is another.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I would not count on that way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It would be good if each of us would gain one person within three years.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If every member in the church could bring one person to the Lord and into the church life within three years, the church would increase by one third each year.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But how many among us even do this?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our way to preach the gospel is too old and stale.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I still remember D. L. Moody's story.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He once vowed that he would not go to sleep without speaking the gospel to at least one person each day.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then one night near midnight, he realized that he had neglected to speak the gospel to anyone that day.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He went out, but nobody was on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He could only find a policeman, so he went to him and tried to get him to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But the policeman became very offended and angry.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Later though, he became interested and found out who the man was that had preached to him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Eventually, that policeman got saved.</S>
