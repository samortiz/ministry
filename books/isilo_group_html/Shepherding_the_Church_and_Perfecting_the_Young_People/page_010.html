Shepherding the Saints with a Parent&rsquo;s Heart</h2>
<p>An elder may say that he cannot speak the word because he has not received much training and does not know the Bible. Suppose there is a co-worker in a nearby church who knows the Bible. It may not be beneficial for the elder to invite him to speak the word, because the co-worker may not have a burden for that locality. Speaking the word must come out of a burden. In order to be effective, a person must be burdened to work until a fire in the saints is kindled. Our speaking is to enliven the saints and cause them to be burning for the Lord. If we do not have a burden, we should not speak. The elders are obligated to feed the flock; they are like parents with children. If the elders have such a heart, the situation in the church will change.</p>
<p>Some brothers may ask how to &ldquo;prepare a meal.&rdquo; Our publications are very rich. We should study the publications and select portions that will meet the need. We cannot rely on others to do this for us. We must learn. This is the responsibility of the elders. This responsibility will also make the elders more useful.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Needs of the Saints</h2>
<p>Our weakness has been that we have the concept that it is the full-time co-workers who are specialized in giving messages. Our concept is that the co-workers, not the elders, are responsible for speaking the word. We must change this concept. If the elders are willing to endeavor, they will be very effective when they speak the word, because they know the needs of the saints. They may not be eloquent, but they will be very useful.</p>
<p>There was a brother in northern China who was a good speaker. However, after giving good messages for four years, he did not reap much result. There was also a brother who did not know how to give messages and was not eloquent, but he established the church in Tsingtao. When he went to Tsingtao in 1934, there were no brothers there. Fourteen years later more than seven hundred people had been baptized. Although this brother was not a good speaker, his messages were practical. He administrated and led the church, and he knew the needs of the saints. In order to meet the need of the saints, he studied and prepared his messages. If the saints needed a word on redemption, he studied and prepared a message on redemption. In this way the saints received the benefit. As a result, the church was built up in a very solid way.</p>
<p>Messages that are lofty and nice do not bear fruit. As long as we are willing to make an effort, there will be results. The elders indeed need to devote more time to their service. Some elders should even serve full time. First Timothy 5:17 says, &ldquo;Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.&rdquo; This means that elders who serve full time should be honored and should receive material support. Some elders should devote all their time to administrating the church, and some brothers who serve full time should get a job. If the function of a full-time brother is not manifested, he should not waste his time. He should do something else. However, some elders should give all their time to care for and administrate the church.</p>
<p>The principle is that the elders are like parents or older siblings in a family. They ensure that everyone in the family is fed. The elders should do the work of shepherding and feeding; they must not rely solely on the co-workers. The co-workers who are useful should set aside some time for the spreading of the work. A co-worker who stays in one locality is tied down by that local church. In principle, this may not be profitable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OVERSEEING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Entrusting and Overseeing</h2>
<p>The elders in the church should first shepherd the saints and then oversee them. This means that after shepherding the saints, the elders should entrust them with some services. This is not merely to teach the saints but to put things into their hands. After entrusting the saints with a service, the elders should then oversee. This means that the elders should take their hands off and let the saints be responsible for giving suggestions and making decisions. The elders should not make decisions. Suppose a brother is assigned to the young people&rsquo;s work. The elders no longer need to take care of the young people&rsquo;s work. They should let the brother bear the work. The elders should only oversee. If every matter in the church is handed over to the saints, the function of the saints will be developed.</p>
<p>When the saints are assigned to a service, they should be in charge of everything, and the elders no longer need to manage that service. We should train the saints to be responsible for their service. Then the elders and co-workers will only be overseers. It is not proper for the co-workers and elders to keep everything in their pocket. A proper elder is an overseer. The more responsibilities he has, the more he should delegate and oversee. In this way he will bring the saints into the service.</p>
<p>Some brothers are concerned that the saints will make mistakes when we let them serve. We should not be so concerned. The churches in Taiwan are established; consequently, even if the saints make a mistake, it will not be serious. When the saints make a mistake, we should assist them. This is more effective and will help the saints to participate in the service.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Shepherding the Church and Perfecting the Young People &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
