The Seven Eyes of the Lamb</h2><p>The sevenfold intensified Spirit, as the seven Spirits, is the seven eyes of the Lamb sent forth into all the earth, searching and infusing all the churches and all the saints with His eyes (5:6).</p><p>As the seven eyes of the Lamb, the seven Spirits are one with the Lamb. Your eyes are not separate from you yourself. When you look at someone, your eyes look at that one, and when your eyes look at someone, you yourself look at that one. The fact that the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of Christ the Lamb indicates that Christ and the Spirit are one. It is heretical to say the Spirit is not one with Christ. Just as the eyes of a person are not separate from the person, so the seven Spirits as the seven eyes of Christ are not separate from Christ. The seven Spirits are Christ Himself because they are the eyes of Christ. The seven Spirits are just Christ Himself pneumatically.</p><p>The seven Spirits as the seven eyes are for both searching and infusing. While your eyes are searching a person, they are infusing something of yourself into that person. With the seven Spirits as His eyes, Christ is searching all the churches and all the saints and also infusing Himself into the churches and the saints. On the one hand, we may fear His searching, but on the other hand, we should welcome it and be thankful for it because it is always followed by His infusing. Actually, His searching and His infusing go together, for His searching is accompanied by His infusing. As He searches us He infuses Himself into us.</p><p>We may experience this searching and infusing as we are praying. While we pray, the Lord searches us and infuses us with Himself. Suppose, for example, a brother speaks to his wife with right words but with a wrong spirit. Later, while he is praying, the Lord searches him and rebukes him for being wrong with his wife. The brother repents and says, &ldquo;Lord, I was wrong with my wife, yet it is hard for me to repent to her and ask her to forgive me.&rdquo; However, the Lord not only searches and rebukes this brother but also infuses Himself into him. As a result of this infusing, the brother has the supply to go to his wife, confess, and ask for her forgiveness.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Saving the Believers</h2><p>As the sevenfold intensified Spirit Christ saves the believers from the things related to the degradation of the church.</p><h2 class="head4">a. The Formal Church Life</h2><p>The sevenfold intensified Spirit saves the believers from the formal church life, the loss of the first love to the Lord, the loss of the shining capacity of the lampstand, and the loss of the enjoyment of Christ as life in the church in Ephesus (2:1-7). The church in Ephesus had lost four things: the genuine and proper church life, the first love toward the Lord, the shining capacity of the lampstand, and the enjoyment of Christ as life. Such a loss is very serious.</p><p>Some of the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery may have lost these four things. Instead of a real and genuine church life, the saints in these churches have only a formal church life. The saints still love one another, but their love is quite formal. They do not have the real and genuine love toward the brothers. Furthermore, the saints in these churches still come to the meetings, but they attend the meetings merely in a formal way. A good number of saints have this kind of formality. We need to be genuine, and to be genuine is to be in the spirit and do everything in the spirit.</p><p>If we have lost our first love to the Lord, we will not be warm toward Him. Although we may continue to serve Him, we will be cold in our serving. We need to be saved from a formal church life and serve the Lord with a burning spirit (Rom. 12:11).</p><h2 class="head4">b. Defeat</h2><p>The believers need to be saved by the seven Spirits from the defeat that leads to the taste of the second death spoken of in the Lord&rsquo;s word to the church in Smyrna (Rev. 2:8-11). Those who are defeated in the way described in verses 10 and 11 may taste of the second death, the lake of fire. We need to realize, therefore, that it is possible for a saved person to be hurt by the lake of fire as the second death.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
