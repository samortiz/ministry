<h2 class="head1">COMING TO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE<br />
OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>My burden is to share with you concerning the biggest shortage among us today. The biggest shortage is that the elders are short of the full knowledge of the truth. I appreciate 1 Timothy in that it deals with the matter of the truth. In John 17:17 the Lord prayed, &ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.&rdquo; The truth, the word, not only regenerates, feeds, and enlightens, but it sanctifies. God desires all men, after being saved, to come to the full knowledge of the truth. No need to say all men, I even doubt all the elders in the recovery have come to the full knowledge of the truth. We should not merely have the knowledge of the truth, but the full knowledge, the complete knowledge, the perfect knowledge, of the truth. In the 1984 elders&rsquo; training thirty-six messages were given. I really doubt that you have entered into the full knowledge of those truths which were delivered to you then. If we have never been constituted with this knowledge, then how could we speak? How could we preach? How could we teach?</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING APT TO TEACH</h2>
<p>Paul charged the elders in the church in this way: if you are going to be an elder, you must build up a habit to teach, to be apt to teach. Being apt to teach is a kind of habit. How about the elders today? Are you apt to teach? This really concerns me. Please give me mercy to say that I do not care for how much Spirit you have; I care for how much you can teach. I do not care for how much gift you have gained or how much you can speak in tongues; I care for how much you can teach the solid truth. Do you not realize that without the Word the Spirit is just in vain? You can never separate the Word from the Spirit. Firstly, in John 6:63 we are told that the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit. Then in Ephesians 6:17 we are told that the Spirit is the word. According to the Greek text, the antecedent of the relative pronoun &ldquo;which&rdquo; in this verse is the Spirit, not the sword; &ldquo;the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Generally speaking, those in the Pentecostal movement do not pay attention to the Word. Their attention is fully occupied by their thought of the Spirit. They do not see that without the Word, the Spirit is in vain. We all have to realize the Spirit comes after the Word. The Gospel of John begins with the Word. In the beginning was the Word, not the Spirit, and the Word was God. This Word which was God became flesh, the very embodiment of the Word. Then when He speaks, His words are spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RAISED UP IN THE WAY OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>We have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for over sixty years. We were not raised up in a nonsensical way without any knowledge of the truth. The Lord raised us up altogether in the way of the truth. The missionaries who were there in China testified that among all the Christians in China we were on the top in knowing the truth. They were even surprised, and marveled that we, the young Chinese natives, could expound the Bible in such a wonderful way.</p>
<p>In 1934 when I was staying in Shanghai the church there decided one day to have a special gospel preaching meeting. I was happy, waiting to hear Brother Nee preach the gospel. Just a short time before the meeting I got a note from him, delivered by another brother. The note said, &ldquo;Witness, please preach the gospel tonight.&rdquo; I was staying above the meeting hall. When I received the note, we were getting ready to eat, and after eating we would go to the meeting. By that time no one knew where Brother Nee had gone, so I had no choice but to give the message.</p>
<p>Shortly before the meeting started, the burden came to me to preach the gospel from John 16 using the verses concerning the coming of the Spirit of reality to convict the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment (John 16:8-11). The light came and I went to the meeting. I spoke on this portion of the Word telling them, &ldquo;You can see three things in this portion of the Word: sin, righteousness, and judgment. You all have to realize sin refers to one person, righteousness refers to another person, and judgment refers to a third person. Each of the three things refer to one person, respectively. Sin refers to Adam. You were born in Adam and you were born in sin. That is your status. Righteousness refers to Christ who died for your sins, and who resurrected and went to the Father for your justification. You were born in Adam to have sin. Now you need to have a transfer. Get out of Adam and get into Christ. Then you will have righteousness instead of sin. If you do not do this, you are just waiting for another person, Satan. Judgment refers to Satan, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire. That will be his destiny. If you do not have the transfer out of Adam into Christ, you will share the judgment of Satan for eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While I was speaking I looked around, but I could not see Brother Nee. Much later as we were taking a walk one day he turned to me and said, &ldquo;Witness, that night when you gave the message on John 16, I was standing outside the door behind where you stood to give the message. Probably very few, if any, Christian teachers in our country can teach people the Bible in your way. I encourage you to teach people the Bible in this way.&rdquo; I say this to show you that we were raised up by the Lord by the way of the Word, not by the way of the Spirit &ldquo;in the air.&rdquo; We were raised up by the Lord in the solid Word. If I, as a preacher, have some power, then that power must be in the Word. Most of you were attracted by the ministry of the Word, not by the Spirit.</p>
<p>But thank the Lord, where the Word is there is the Spirit. The Word is the embodiment of the invisible, abstract, and mysterious Spirit. The Spirit is too mysterious, too abstract, too invisible. Without the Word as the embodiment of the Spirit, no one can touch the Spirit. Therefore, as elders, I encourage you all, I even beg you all to get yourselves saturated, constituted with the Word. Your entire being must be a constitution of the holy Word. For more than sixty years I have been in the Word. This is why the ministry is here, the ministry of riches, of life, of power, and of light.</p>
