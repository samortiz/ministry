   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPENDING MONEY, ENERGY, AND OUR PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we want the Lord to have an outlet and for the gospel to spread, every brother and sister should have the attitude of spending their money, energy, and person for the sake of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have been serving full time in the Lord s recovery for over fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During the Sino-Japanese War, when I was recuperating from a sickness, my family sometimes went to the beach to pick up driftwood because we were short of cooking fuel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We also lived on soybean cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That was a very difficult time for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps the parents of our young saints would oppose their children serving full time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, we must remember what the Lord said concerning using unrighteous mammon to make friends while the mammon is still useful Luke 16:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to use unrighteous mammon to preach the gospel and bring people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who are saved due to our money are the friends whom we have made with our unrighteous mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When unrighteous mammon fails, all these friends will welcome us into the eternal tabernacles v. 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should never be wasteful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For our daily life, it is sufficient to have clothing and food.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should save money for those who go out for the Lord s work under difficult circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not think that I have an easy life because my work is successful and the saints take good care of me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have testified to you that when I began to serve the Lord, I was determined that if I drank mountain water and ate tree roots, or even if I starved, I would not complain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May the Lord s precious blood cover me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Until today I have not forgotten my co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord is true, and His Word is reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we can be saved by believing into the reliable Word of the Lord, then the portion where the Lord said that He would settle accounts with us when He returns is also reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must keep in mind His word of warning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord has blessed our country, and our income has increased.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, as we are enjoying the riches, we should never forget the source.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not forget that all the blessings we have are from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a dollar is enough for me to purchase what I need for myself, I will not spend a dollar and twenty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I would rather save the twenty cents for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we build a meeting hall, we should consider how best to use the money.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we can meet the construction need with five hundred thousand dollars, we should never use five hundred twenty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should save the twenty thousand for sending out full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord never intended that we spend a large sum to build a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead, the Lord wants us to go out and gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We would rather have a simple meeting hall, which can shield us from the wind and the rain, than be short in sending out full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord is pleased when we save money in order to send out full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not only consider our current situation; we should also consider our future.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to produce full-timers continually, we also need to have a training.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Most of the saints will not be able to work for the Lord immediately after they set their heart to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We hope that every full-timer would receive two terms of training.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Each term would last for four months, so they would receive eight months of training in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to arrange room and board for these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a great burden.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever I consider the work ahead of us, I feel that the burden is too heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have a long distance to travel, and the burden is heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I hope that all the saints will waste themselves in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>WASTING OURSELVES FOR THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the one hand, we hope that all the parents will encourage their children to serve full time; on the other hand, we hope that all the saints in the churches will give their best for the spread of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is a shameful thing for a church to construct a luxurious meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should give our money and send out full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I believe that we all love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our love for the Lord is expressed by our pouring out the ointment upon the Lord rather than on other people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even the two denarii that the widow gave were remembered by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I hope that when the sisters buy groceries, they will calculate a little.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever there is a way to save ten dollars, they should do so for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In every aspect of our daily living what we eat, what we wear, where we live, and how we travel we should save money for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the only way for us to go forward.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whether we are able to climb up this slope depends on how much effort we exert.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We cannot continue to hibernate.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In order to evangelize Taiwan in five years, we need to produce five hundred full-timers every year.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Who will answer this call?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Should I bear this burden alone, or should all the co-workers bear it together?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If I am to bear the burden alone, how can I support twenty-five hundred people?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, the co-workers should give themselves for the Lord s sake by offering up whatever they can to bear this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Furthermore, it is necessary to have a big meeting hall where all the saints can come together to be supplied and to be perfected, but the big meetings should only be forty percent of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The other sixty percent should be spent in small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The small groups can bring in people, recover the dormant saints, and uphold the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We cannot rely solely on the elders or a few responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Instead, we must all participate.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Every small group should take care of itself, and the members in the small groups should have mutual care for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The saints must change their view concerning the church life, from stressing the big meetings to emphasizing the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should give the big meetings only forty percent of our time, and the rest of our time should be given to the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we continue to pay attention to the big meetings and neglect the small groups, we will never build up the church in our locality in a solid way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must build up the small groups and diligently take care of the brothers and sisters in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All the co-workers and elders should diligently build up the small groups in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We need to be impressed that we are not here to do another work in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are in the Lord s recovery and for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Our first responsibility is to spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is an obligation from which we cannot escape.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Furthermore, we need to support the livelihood of the full-timers so that they can go out and spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This requires that all the saints save money, because we love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then our money can be given to save people s souls.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In addition, we must learn to bring the saints into the truth and to progress in learning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I truly look to the Lord that you can all receive this word and that you can put your spirit, your prayer, and your shoulders under the Ark to bear this testimony together with me.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I believe that if we are faithful in this matter, the Lord will bless us.</S>
