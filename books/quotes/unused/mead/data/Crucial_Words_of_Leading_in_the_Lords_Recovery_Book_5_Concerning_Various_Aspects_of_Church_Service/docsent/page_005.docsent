   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CREATING AND GRASPING OPPORTUNITIES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A number of saints in the church are serving either part time or full time, and still more saints have a heart to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Seventy percent of these saints are young people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the work began in Taiwan, this generation of young people was not born yet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We thank the Lord that these young saints have come into the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must not waste the time of these saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must make progress.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not blame anyone or anything for the past.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is a Chinese proverb that politicians like to use, which says, Circumstances often create a hero, but a hero creates circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These are two views of the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who are wise use their circumstances to distinguish themselves and to make history.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I would therefore encourage the co-workers not to waste their time but to open new frontiers, new circumstances, and new prospects.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to create new opportunities and grasp these opportunities in our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Frankly speaking, our situation does not require us to create more opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thirty-five years ago we came to Taiwan and opened up many frontiers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now there are many brothers and sisters from many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not need to create any more opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our need is to grasp the opportunities that are available.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To labor is to grasp the opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If there are no opportunities, we should create some.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is regrettable that year after year we have not grasped these opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who allow the opportunities to pass have hundreds of excuses, but no excuse is valid.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our eyes need to be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Taiwan may be a small island, but there are still many towns and villages that do not have a church life and need to be gained.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must raise up a church in these towns and villages.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not worry about financial provisions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we fall into this trap, we have become degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are not beginning a new work, we are not going out under a new banner, nor are we starting another recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are one, and we will keep this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The co-workers go out to open new prospects and new opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if we should suffer hunger, we will continue until churches are raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If all the workers have such a spirit, in two or three years more churches will be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There will even be churches raised up in the neighboring towns.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we lose the aspiration to create new prospects and new opportunities and instead hold on to our old meetings, we will eventually be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Going to a town or a village to lead people to salvation, raise up a church, and bring the newly saved ones to serve the Lord is much more valuable than earning all the money in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Raising up a church in a town is much more worthwhile than starting a new factory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Making a profit of ten million U.S. dollars cannot be compared to going to a village and raising up one hundred new believers to meet together and serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These one hundred souls are more valuable than ten million U.S. dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only this kind of pioneering spirit can stir up the interest of the young saints and cause them to rise up to follow and also serve.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way, in a few years there will be churches everywhere in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such a pioneering spirit will become our family heritage, and the young saints will be useful and capable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This word is not only to the young saints but also to the co-workers who have been trained for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>May we not lose this pioneering spirit ever again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>More than twenty years ago I went to the United States with nothing in my pockets, and I did not receive any financial support from any of the churches in the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It was under difficult circumstances that I went to the United States to open up a new frontier.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>My going forth was to create an opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The work in Taiwan now is much easier.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The young saints should take this word to heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we go forth to labor in the schools, we should forget all that is behind us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The old ways are not profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>COORDINATING TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>TO PREACH THE GOSPEL IN THE SCHOOLS</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to coordinate together to preach the gospel in the schools, there needs to be a number of full-time co-workers who will receive the burden to facilitate the gospel in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need at least two or three brothers to coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These full-time brothers should facilitate the gospel work in the schools, including junior high schools, high schools, technical colleges, and universities.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The full-timers, especially those who are under the age of thirty, will be assigned to specific schools to carry out the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We also need to identify the saints who are under the age of thirty and serve part time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to study how these saints can use their spare time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every block of time is an opportune time for the gospel work in schools, whether it is in the morning, the afternoon, or the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The only time that might be difficult to use is the early morning.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, we will ask all the saints who serve part time to fill out a form so that we know who is available at different times each day and can make allocations for the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is useful information.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we know that at a certain time every day some part-time brothers or sisters are available to coordinate for the gospel, it will be easy for us to make arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In principle, the saints who serve part time should also participate in the gospel work in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, we need at least three groups of saints for the gospel in the schools: two or three matured co-workers to facilitate the gospel work, younger full-timers, and part-time brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In addition, there is the need for a fourth group of saints, those who are teachers or staff in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to know how many saints are teaching in the schools and how many are burdened to coordinate in the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The fifth group of saints is very useful in facilitating the gospel work in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This last group of saints is the students who are studying and are willing to participate in the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We will therefore have five groups of saints: two or three co-workers who take the lead, the younger full-timers, the part-timers, the saints who work in the schools, and the saints who are students.</S>
