BEING FOR THIS MINISTRY</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:11 says, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers.&rdquo; These are the gifted ones. Verse 12 continues, &ldquo;For the perfecting of the saints.&rdquo; This reveals that all the gifted ones are for the perfecting of the saints. Thus, these two groups of people&mdash;the gifted ones and the saints who are being perfected&mdash;are for the work of the ministry and for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Many people have asked me over the years whether we have a problem in regard to the matter of ministry. We need to answer this question carefully. In the past twenty-five years, especially since we began propagating overseas, some people have said that we have brought the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to the point that it receives only Brother Lee&rsquo;s ministry and no other ministry. For us to take the Lord&rsquo;s new way, all the co-workers and elders need to see clearly that we have only one ministry in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the unique ministry. Although there is only one ministry, all the serving brothers have their ministries within the unique ministry. For example, some saints&rsquo; ministry is to go to the communities to knock on doors and to take care of home meetings, whereas my ministry is to train the elders and co-workers and revise the Recovery Version of the New Testament. While I am fulfilling my ministry, they are also fulfilling their ministries.</p>
<p>There are over forty thousand saints in the church in Taipei, and more than thirty thousand of them still need to be visited and cared for. This requires that at least ten thousand brothers and sisters fulfill their ministries. Sometimes the brothers and sisters may be moved by the Holy Spirit to knock on doors and bring people to salvation; then after baptizing them, they immediately need to establish home meetings and read <em>Life Lessons</em> with them; this is their ministry. Many brothers and sisters in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have this kind of ministry. There are also hundreds and thousands of saints who take care of the high school students, the college students, or who specifically bring people to salvation. In the church there are many people who have different kinds of ministries.</p>
<p>In our practice, we accept many ministries, and we emphasize the word <em>many.</em> Today there are thousands and even tens of thousands of ministries within the church. Hence, those who criticize us do not know the distinction between the singular <em>ministry</em> and the plural <em>ministries.</em> As far as the ministry is concerned, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we do not have two ministries; we have only one ministry, the unique ministry. As far as ministries are concerned, every saved one in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has a ministry as long as he exercises to function; in this sense, we have many ministries. Our hope is that everyone would function in the meetings; this functioning is the fulfilling of their ministries. Therefore, there are both ministry and ministries.</p>
<p>We need to see from the New Testament the relationship between <em>ministry</em> and <em>ministries.</em> In the New Testament John the Baptist had a ministry, and the Lord Jesus also had a ministry. Was the ministry of the Lord Jesus an addition to the ministry of John the Baptist or a repetition of it? It is not easy to answer this question. It is correct to say that the ministry of the Lord Jesus was a repetition of the ministry of John, because the Lord Jesus preached what John had preached. In the New Testament the Lord Jesus repeated John&rsquo;s words. In Matthew 3:2 John said, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.&rdquo; When the Lord Jesus ministered, He said exactly the same thing without changing a word (4:17). Later He sent His disciples to preach the same message (Mark 6:12). Thus, we see that John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus, and His disciples all spoke the same thing. These three groups of people repeated one another.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus came, He repeated and added to what John the Baptist had spoken. Later the disciples came and repeated and added to what the Lord Jesus had spoken. Then Paul repeated and added. Still later Brother Nee and I did the same thing, repeating and adding. Today all of us should be repeating and adding. In this way the ministry is a whole, a totality, of many ministries. This totality will ultimately consummate as the manifestation of the New Jerusalem. Before the manifestation of the New Jerusalem, the works done for God by all who belong to Him are parts of the totality of the one ministry. Thus, we are not carrying out our own ministries; rather, we repeat and add. We are not at all independent. We are not carrying out thousands and thousands of independent ministries; instead, we are carrying out thousands and thousands of repetitions and additions. This is the work of the unique ministry.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> </body></html>
