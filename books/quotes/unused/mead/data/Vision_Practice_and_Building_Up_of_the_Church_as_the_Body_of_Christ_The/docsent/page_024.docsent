   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Joined by the Divine Nature</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>through the Strengthening of Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and the Subduing of Our Soul</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The greater part of the tabernacle was the forty-eight standing boards, which were overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the overlaying gold were golden rings, and within the golden rings were golden bars Exo 26:18-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is by this overlaying gold that all the boards were joined together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we could have taken away the gold and left only the forty-eight boards, they would immediately have fallen apart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This signifies that in ourselves there is no oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The oneness is in the overlaying gold, which signifies divinity, the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is in this divinity, in the Triune God as the overlaying divine gold, that we are covered and joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This type gives us a clear picture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not possible for us to be one with each other in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are only the wooden boards.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In ourselves there is no joining element.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The uniting element is the gold, the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we need to be overlaid by, with, and in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Triune God there is the joining power.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The golden ring and bar also signify the joining power in the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Christ possesses us and makes home in all the parts of our being, He becomes our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only Christ is the oneness, and we all are one in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 17:21 says, That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are one in Us, that is, in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The secret of the oneness is first with our spirit, our inner man, and then with our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our inner man must be strengthened, and our soul must be subdued, renewed, taken over, occupied, and possessed by the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then Christ will be freed, and we will be under Him and in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is through this indwelling and released Christ that we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this way we can have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all need to bring these things to the Lord and spend some time with Him to pray for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I believe that one day the Lord will open our eyes to see this clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These things are spiritual facts, but not many people have realized them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The unbelievers cannot realize them, and not many believers realize them either, or else there would have been no need for the apostle to pray in Ephesians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He prayed for us to this end, and we also need to pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>PRACTICING THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After his prayer in Ephesians 3, Paul proceeds to chapter 4.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first part of this chapter reveals the proper way to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today we hear many voices speaking in different ways about the church, but many people have forgotten Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the short passage from verse 1 to verse 16, the apostle under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit wrote something very profound.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the aspects of the church life are here.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many who talk about the church life today have neglected and forgotten this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to practice the church life, we must realize all the main aspects, the main points, concerning the church in Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul begins by saying, I beseech you therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord v. 1a . Paul realized that he was a prisoner not merely in a prison but in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was imprisoned in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to have the church life, we need to be a prisoner in Christ with no freedom of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must lose our liberty to be imprisoned by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church is a prison to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to be imprisoned in the Lord in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul continues, To walk worthily of the calling with which you were called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing one another in love, being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>1b-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever we talk about the practice of the church life, we must remember that the first thing needed is to keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This requires that we forget about everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The third stanza of the traditional hymn Onward Christian Soldiers says, One in hope and doctrine, one in charity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not an accurate concept.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christians can never be one in doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If someone has a certain understanding about a particular portion of the Bible, he may hold to that portion without caring for the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many Christians insist on baptism by sprinkling, some insist on a single immersion, and some insist on three immersions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some immerse in warm water, others immerse in cold water, and still others baptize in other ways.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this one matter alone there are many opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In order to realize the church life we need to forget about doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we pay attention to doctrine, we may become a three-immersions church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Praise the Lord, the Spirit is in you and in me, so we all are one in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, it is better to sing the above line as, One in faith and Spirit, / One eternally Hymns, #871 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am concerned that we may hold on to something that is not an element of the saving faith or of the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some believers have their favorite item, a matter that they love.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In a sense, they are addicted to that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some, for example, are addicted to speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If they hear someone speaking in tongues, they do not consider whether it is genuine or false.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the same principle, we too may have something to which we are addicted.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whatever someone is addicted to is a dividing element.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It may seem that he is one with others, but there is still something within him that divides and keeps him from others.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He may come to the meetings, but inwardly he is not one.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Something within him is secretly and subtly dividing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord can testify that by His mercy I always try my best to forget about everything else in order to keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When certain dear ones brought tambourines to play in the meetings, I was not bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although I do not prefer this, I did not insist on not having them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I told the brothers, As long as they worship God, it is all right with me.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Let them play the tambourine.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, those dear ones eventually insisted on their practice in a divisive way, and they frightened others away.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should not have anything within us as a dividing element.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The practice of the oneness exposes where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The problems we have faced in Los Angeles for the past two and a half years are due to some dear ones insisting on something other than the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We need to care for keeping the oneness of the Spirit and not for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If someone says that the Lord Jesus is not the Son of God, we should sacrifice our life to fight for the truth, but if someone wants to play the tambourine in the meeting, we should simply say, Brother, if you feel free to do that, then do it, but please also take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Whether or not to play the tambourine means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must forget about everything else and keep only one thing the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Verses 4 through 6 go on to name all the elements of the oneness one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one Father that is, the Triune God in us to make us one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit is in us John 14:11; 1 Cor 15:45; Rom 8:9, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Now we are one Body, which is the real mingling of the Triune God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In all the above matters we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>There is no argument about these items; they are what we need to hold.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To keep the oneness of the Spirit is the first aspect for the practice of the church life.</S>
