F.</h2><p>I grew up in a China Inland Mission Church. Someone preached the gospel to me and told me that my sins would be forgiven if I believed in the Lord. I secretly accepted the Lord, and peace filled my heart. Later I bought a small Bible and began to read it by myself. I heard that there were meetings at Hardoon Road, Shanghai, and I attended some. I felt that my condition was far behind the others. I could understand Sister Wang, but I could not quite understand Brother Nee. I felt that I should be a preacher. I did not know whether I should be a preacher for the sake of making a living or whether I should make my preaching my living. The nature and goal of the two things are entirely different. Eventually, I chose to take care of my daily necessities for the sake of being a preacher. Once while Witness Lee was preaching, I had a sudden thought of wanting to serve the Lord full-time. I wrote over twenty letters of confession to deal with my sins. The last letter did not go into the mailbox for several months after it was written. During my fasting and prayer, I felt the burden of sin lifted from me, and I was full of peace and joy. Later I went to Shanghai, and on the third day I heard the messages about handing over all. A brother said that if I did not hand over myself, the church would not know where I stood and would not be able to speak an honest word to me. I became afraid. I thought, "What if the church is wrong?" Later Brother Nee told us that some needed to go to Foochow, Fukien, to be trained. I said to myself, "Either I do not take this way at all, or I have to go all the way."</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our brother has been taking a straight course in this way. It is true that we face difficulties in our work. But whenever we encounter problems and difficulties in the work, such as opposition and rejection, we discover whom we are really serving, what is the center of our service, and for what we serve. This was the problem between Paul and Barnabas. During times of trial, the attraction of the work, the natural human elements, and our own inclinations drop away; our work begins to be purified. Our service must not be based on natural attraction, human affinity, our own inclinations, the attraction of the brothers and sisters, or the work itself. It must be only based on God.</p><p>If a man is successful in his work and has never encountered any difficulty but instead is welcomed everywhere, having no burden of the church upon his shoulders or friction with the saints anywhere, it is easy for him to be attracted to the work, the people, and the things. He may even think that he is serving the Lord in all honesty. Actually, he does not know how much is of the Lord and how much is of himself. However, the day will come when everything will change. His work will collapse, men will oppose him, and the Lord will allow everything to fall. Even he himself will collapse. The work, himself, and others will no longer be an attraction to him. Then he will know whether or not he is serving the Lord and how much of his work is for the Lord. This is a purifying work. When the attraction of work and men and the inclination of the self are all removed, our service will be solely under the direction of the Lord, and our labor for Him will be pure. Then we will not dare to involve the self in the work any longer. We will begin to stand on resurrection ground. We have to put our own life to death, and we have to put the work to death. After everything goes through the test, something will disappear through death, while something will remain on the other side of death. That which remains and rises up again is resurrection. If we plant a seed into the ground, it will resurrect. But if we plant a stone into the ground, it will not resurrect. What should die will die, and what will not die will rise up in resurrection. When we place our work in death, whatever withers away should be dead anyway, and whatever corrupts should become corrupt anyway. Whatever cannot die is resurrection. Whatever the Lord does will not die; it will always rise again. This is the way of our work today; it is the way of death and resurrection. We can no longer return to our old way. We should ask the Lord to put to death the elements in our work that deserve death. Anything that is not built up by the Lord should be torn down. If a thing is not torn down the first time, it will be torn down the second or the third time. Sooner or later it will be torn down. If something can be torn down, it proves that it is of the self. Anything that is of God will never be torn down&mdash;not once, not ten times. Resurrection is that which will never die. Anything in me that can go away should go away; the only thing that should resurrect is what the Lord has built up. Whatever is left after the demolition is God's work. We have to drop and purge ourselves of many things that are hanging on to us. Only then will we be able to say, "I no longer want to work. If there is still any willingness in me, it is something that the Lord has done." Anything that has passed through God's fiery furnace will be purified. From that point onward, every work will be done by the Lord alone.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> </body></html>
