   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO RECEIVING THE WORD AS THE LIVING SPIRIT AND COMING TO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:16-17; John 6:63; Matt 4:4; Eph 6:17-18; 1 Tim 2:4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that in nature the Scripture, the holy Word, is God's breath.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The function of the Scripture is to unveil, to roll away the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Proper teaching is always a kind of unveiling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the unveiling, we have reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness "that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work" 2 Tim 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE LORD'S WORDS BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let us now go on to consider further another important verse related to the nature of the Bible John 6:63.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here the Lord Jesus says, "It is the Spirit who gives life the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that the Lord's words are the embodiment of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we receive His words by exercising our spirit, we get the Spirit, who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we read the Bible, we should receive life; and when we teach others concerning the Bible, they should receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not receive life when we read the Bible, something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our reading of the Bible, there may be no spirit; and in our teaching of the Bible to others, there also may be no spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For there to be no spirit means that there is no life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may read a portion of the Bible, several verses or a few chapters, without receiving the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The reason for this lack of supply is that in our reading of the Word there is no spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not sense the Spirit as we are reading the Bible, we should realize that something is wrong, and then we should adjust ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the same principle, as we are teaching the young people in the Summer School of Truth, we need to check whether there is any spirit in our teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If there is no spirit, we should change our way of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Teaching a class in the Summer School of Truth should not be the same as teaching a class in a secular school.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In a secular school there is no need of spirit, but in our summer school there is the need of much spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>INHALING AND EXHALING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From experience we know that in order for there to be much spirit in our reading and teaching of the Bible, we need much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must be a person of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, we must be a person who is continually breathing the Lord, a person who is always inhaling God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our reading of the Bible should be a kind of inhaling, and our teaching of the Bible should be a kind of exhaling.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As you are teaching a class in the Summer School of Truth, you should be exhaling God into your students.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible is God's breath; this breath is the Spirit; and the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you breathe the Spirit you receive not only unveiling, rebuking, correcting, and instructing you receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever you touch the Spirit as you are reading the Bible, you receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, as you are teaching in the Summer School of Truth, you need to touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You should have the sense that you are touching not only the Spirit but also the spirits of your students.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You should have the sense that you are exhaling God and that they are inhaling God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that there is a communication between your exhaling and their inhaling.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that your way of teaching is right, for you are exercising to minister life to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In teaching the Bible to others, you must be very strict with yourself, adjusting yourself again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>During one class session you may need to adjust yourself a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you experience failure the first few times you teach, you should go back to the Lord with much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Pray yourself into the Lord, breathing God into you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then, having become a praying person, a person who inhales God, go back to your class and exhale what you have received of God.</S>
