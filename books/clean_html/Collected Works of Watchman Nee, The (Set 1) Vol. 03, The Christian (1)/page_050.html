<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Six</H2><P>Six is the number of the devil and also the number of man. Because man sinned and listened to the devil's speaking, man is joined to the devil. The night is darkest just before the dawn. In like manner, six is the worst number because it comes before seven, the complete number. Six is two times three, signifying the exposure of sin. Six is divisible; therefore, it is also a number of weakness. Both man and the devil are weak in any case. The number six, regardless, is always less than seven; likewise, neither man nor the devil can in any way triumph over God. May we realize more that man himself is number six.</P><P>Man was created on the sixth day (Gen. 1:26-31). Man should work six days (Exo. 23:12). The Israelites could be slaves for only six years (Deut. 15:12). The land of Canaan could be sown for only six years (Lev. 25:3). There are only six thousand years in human history. Moses waited six days on the mountain before God appeared to him (Exo. 24:15-18). There were six ascending steps to Solomon's throne (1 Kings 10:19). The number of hours in a day is divisible by six. Athaliah reigned over the land for six years (2 Kings 11:3). In Genesis 4:16-24 the descendants of Cain were recorded only up to the sixth generation. The sixth letter to the churches mentions the sufferings of the people of the world. The sixth seal mentions the death of the people of the world. The sixth trumpet mentions that one third of the people will die. The sixth bowl mentions that the evil spirits will cause the people of the world to fight against Christ. One-sixth of Gog's army will be left (Ezek. 39:2); the whole army is six-sixths. The Lord Jesus took on the form of sin for man, which was typified in the Old Testament by six curtains made of goats' hair (Exo. 26:9). Christ became a man with the name Jesus. "Jesus," in the original language, is composed of six Greek letters. Six times men said that the Lord Jesus was possessed by the demons; fleshly people are always ready to attack our most holy Lord.</P><P>When men oppose God under the hand of Satan, their numbers are related to six. The first one was Goliath. He was six cubits tall; his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron (1 Sam. 17:4, 7). The second one was the image of gold set up by Nebuchadnezzar. Its height was sixty cubits and its breadth was six cubits (Dan. 3:1-3). The third one is the future Antichrist. His number is six hundred sixty-six (Rev. 13:18). There is one thing that can comfort our heart: no matter how poor man is, his number is only six. Our God's number is seven, so man can never catch up with God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Seven</H2><P>Seven is the number of completion. Seven is four plus three. Four stands for man. Three stands for God. When God and man are joined, there is completion. (Seven is a number of temporary rather than eternal completion. We will speak more about this when we come to the number twelve.) Therefore, seven often shows the intimate relationship between God and man, the close connection between the Creator and the creatures. There are many examples in the Bible showing that seven signifies completion. The first time seven is used in the Bible is when God rested on the seventh day, which He sanctified as a holy day (Gen. 2:1-3); it was a complete rest. Enoch was Adam's descendant of the seventh generation (Jude 14); it was a complete human life. After Noah went into the ark, God still reserved seven days for a period of grace (Gen. 7:4); it was a complete waiting period. Jacob served Laban seven years before he got Rachel; it was a complete service (Gen. 29:20). There were seven fat years and seven lean years in Egypt (Gen. 41:29-30); this was complete mercy and judgment. The golden lampstand in the holy place has seven branches (Exo. 25:37); this signifies complete union. Aaron and his sons were required to put on the holy garments for seven days (Exo. 29:30) and be sanctified for seven days (v. 35); this is complete sanctification. If a man sinned, the priest sprinkled the blood seven times for him before the veil of the sanctuary (Lev. 4:6); this is complete washing. Aaron and his sons abode at the tabernacle for seven days (Lev. 8:35); this is complete mutual abiding. On the day of atonement the blood was sprinkled seven times before the mercy seat (Lev. 16:14); this is complete redemption. During the feast of unleavened bread, an offering made by fire was offered unto the Lord for seven days (Lev. 23:8); this is complete consecration. At the feast of the tabernacle the Israelites dwelt in booths seven days (Lev. 23:42); this is complete glory. In the seventh year the children of Israel could not sow the land (Lev. 25:4); this is complete rest. When the Israelites attacked Jericho, seven priests blew seven trumpets and they surrounded the city for seven days and compassed the city seven times and the city collapsed (Josh. 6:4); this was complete obedience and complete victory. Solomon spent seven years to build the temple and then held a feast for seven days (1 Kings 6:38; 8:65); this was a complete work and a complete worship. Naaman dipped himself seven times in the Jordan (2 Kings 5:14); this was complete trust. Job had seven sons (Job 1:2); this was complete blessing. Job's friends sat with him in sorrow seven days and seven nights without saying a word (Job 2:13); this was complete sorrow. Later, they were told to take seven bullocks and seven rams and offer them up as the burnt offering (Job 42:8); this was complete repentance unto the Lord. When our Lord Jesus was on the cross, He spoke seven sentences; this was the expression of complete grace and mercy. Seven ministers were appointed over the business (Acts 6:3); this was complete labor. The Old Testament uses the seven feasts of the children of Israel to typify how God deals with man (temporarily) (Lev. 23). The New Testament uses seven parables to express the situation of the hidden age of the kingdom (Matt. 13). Revelation uses seven epistles to prophesy the condition of the churches in different ages (Rev. 2â€”3). These are all temporary; they will all pass away.</P><P>In Revelation, we can see many sevens. A brother once said that Revelation is a book of "sevens." It has seven visions; there are seven praises to the Lord God and the Lamb; before the throne of God there are seven Spirits; there are the seven golden lampstands, seven stars, seven lamps of fire; the Lamb has seven horns and seven eyes; there are seven seals, seven angels blowing seven trumpets, seven thunders; the beast has seven heads and seven crowns on the heads; there are seven bowls pouring out God's last seven plagues, and seven mountains standing for seven kings. The whole book uses the number seven fifty-six times. It speaks of how God deals with people in the last age. Hence, this number is the number of completion for this age, that is, a number of temporary completion.</P>
