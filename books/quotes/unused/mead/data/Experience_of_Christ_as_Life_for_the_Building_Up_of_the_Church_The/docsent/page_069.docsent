   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In 8:23 some brothers are spoken of as the apostles of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This means that they are the ones sent by the churches, and they are the glory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not just a matter between you and the Lord, nor between you and your local church, but between you and the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you are sent out, it is not only by your local church but by the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the churches agree in this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then the apostle, in verse 24, advised the church in Corinth to show their love before all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are to show something for the Lord in the sight of all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do need a practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 11:8 we see how frank and how absolutely unpolitical the apostle Paul was.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said, "I robbed other churches, taking wages for the ministry to you."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I love the apostle Paul for his frankness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 12:13 we see the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was so genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brothers and sisters, in the church life we need to be genuine and frank.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not think that this is a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the church life you cannot tell a brother to his face that he is good, and then behind his back say that he is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If there is no need to say anything, it is better not to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Who are we to criticize?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord is the Judge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether brothers or sisters are right or wrong, the Lord knows.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Leave this matter to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must be wise and not say so many things criticizing this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But sometimes, as the leading ones, it is necessary to speak, not with the intent of criticizing, but with the burden of bearing responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I must say something about you, then whether in your presence or behind your back, I must speak according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must learn the lesson of being genuine and frank.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must never say anything in two ways with two faces.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we say something, we must not speak loosely or lightly, but frankly in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we can have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you are dealing with only one local church, it is comparatively easy to be two-faced and go undetected.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if more churches are involved, you will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How do you behave in Los Angeles, and how do you behave in San Francisco?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you are political, sooner or later you will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you cannot be exposed in the first church, you will be exposed in the second.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If not in the second, in the third or the fourth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then your whole fabrication will collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The churches are the proving ground to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Finally, in 11:28 the apostle Paul said, "Apart from the things which have not been mentioned, there is this: the crowd of cares pressing upon me daily, the anxious concern for all the churches."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How much the apostle Paul cared for the churches!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It says here that he cared for all the churches, not for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How practical Paul was!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all need to know the churches, not just the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is more than worthwhile to sell ourselves for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am so happy that I have been spoiled for everything else by this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do not have any taste for anything but the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we may all be so clear and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE PROGRESSION OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Lord's recovery of the experience of the church life, there is a progression.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the last century, the Lord recovered the doctrine of the church through the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then in the beginning of this century, the Lord recovered something more, that is, the spiritual principles, the spirituality, of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But this was still not so practical.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then after the year 1930, the Lord began to reveal the practicality of the church not just the doctrine, not just the spirituality, but the practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The doctrine is certainly right and necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The spirituality is definitely right and necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The spirituality is definitely required and is even an improvement upon the doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But in what way can we practice the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Must we wait until the New Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No. The church life must be practiced today, and there is no other way but the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Without the local churches, we cannot have the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There must be the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is interesting and regrettable to see how Christians in each stage of the Lord's recovery of the church life have criticized and opposed those in the succeeding one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those without the doctrine of the church criticized those who introduced it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then those with the doctrine of the church opposed those who saw the spirituality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Eventually, those who see the spirituality of the church criticize the matter of the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is exactly the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we may be in the forefront of His recovery.</S>
