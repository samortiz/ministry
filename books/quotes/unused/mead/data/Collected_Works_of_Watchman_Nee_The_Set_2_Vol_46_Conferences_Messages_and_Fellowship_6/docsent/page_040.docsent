   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETY-ONE CONFORMITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We cannot live in Philippians 3 unless we first know Romans 6 in our vital experience.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Philippians 3 speaks of the death of the new man, and of taking the resurrection life back to the cross and having the stamp of death placed upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Resurrection life constantly gravitates to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After His baptism Christ was on resurrection ground, yet He was constantly under the shadow of the cross: "Not My will, but Yours" Luke 22:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We live to die.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We live through cycles of life and death as we become conformed to His image through deeper and deeper experiences of dying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The good self often intrudes into divine service; therefore, it has to go through death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, we cannot let our eloquence intrude into the teaching of divine truth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suppose Brother A can preach and Brother B can manage affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If Brother A is asked to preach, he will go forward with confidence; but if he is asked to manage affairs, he will be driven to his knees.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must have no confidence in our natural ability; instead we must put our natural ability to death and be willing to die to it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No one has an advantage over anyone else in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The only difference is in the extent of our faith and obedience!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our attitude toward natural wisdom should be: "Lord, I refuse to understand Your Word by myself or by my natural intellect.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I prefer to remain in ignorance unless You will be wisdom to me."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must be willing to wait for revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Lord, I refuse to love anyone with my own love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am willing to let my self be limited in order to gain Your approval."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The cross is both a fact and a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In regard to salvation, it is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In regard to victory, it is a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Death deals with sin and self, and life deals with resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, in regard to victory, the cross is a principle, not a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There must be many experiences of death and resurrection, that is, cycles of death and resurrection which take us through death and life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should often say to the Lord, "I refuse to live by this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I confess that this or that has to go, and I accept Your verdict."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is going through a new experience of death and coming out in a realm of greater resurrection that has the stamp of death upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Victory needs only faith; conformity requires obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should set ourselves against ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"I'll kiss the chastening rod," Madam Guyon said.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul said that conformity was something he desired to attain to.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue" Phil 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The flesh profits nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to pray, "Lord, give me light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Reveal what the flesh is to me."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The revelation of the flesh is a crisis, whereas the daily putting to death of the flesh is a process.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The joy of victory is exuberant, but conformity to His death is different.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As one hymn says, "Let the spirit praise Thee,/Though the heart be riven" Hymns, #377 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Salvation and deliverance are free gifts, whereas conformity costs us everything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is a joy to be healed, but a greater joy to bleed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First Corinthians 2:2-4 indicates that we should have conformity in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified...weakness...fear...much trembling."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Enduement gives self-confidence, and very often the carnal man is fed through such enduement.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the reason so many Pentecostals do not go on to the stage of conformity and do not even know deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not enough to receive enduement alone; one must go through death and receive the stamp of death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Conformity to His death leads to the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Miss Barber once said, "Lord, I die because I want to leave the field for others to die.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let me stand in the place of death that others may pass into life."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every new light is for the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It may mean death for us, but life for others 2 Cor 4:11-12, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake" v. 11 . This "dying" or killing is His killing work in us.</S>
