 <h2 class="head1">DIFFICULTIES AND PROBLEMS<br />
BEING MAINLY DUE TO INDIVIDUALISM</h2>
<p>There is a certain matter that causes my heart to ache. After hearing a brother speak, some have come to me and complained that he was attacking others in his speaking. When the brothers give messages, their purpose is to edify. Concerning the content of their messages, I do not believe the brothers say anything heretical. There is also no need for them to attack others when they speak. If we have a motive in our labor, we are not doing the building work. The saints are as simple as children. The brothers should cooperate with God to speak for God for the purpose of building, not for tearing down. The brothers who minister the word should not help on one hand and transmit germs on the other hand. Otherwise, the saints will be edified and harmed at the same time. This will issue in the tearing down of the building.</p>
<p>After listening to a message given by a young brother, some have come to me and asked about his speaking. This indicates that there is a thorn in his work that makes people feel uncomfortable. We may think that we have done a work yet be unaware of a thorn in our work. This kind of work is not helpful. Our messages should not attack people; they should be positive. Our speaking should give life. It should not cause people to make negative comparisons or have a critical or judgmental feeling. The goal of our speaking is the building up. Therefore, we should not give the saints the impression that our speaking is higher than that of others. Instead, the saints should have the impression that our speaking is in harmony with the speaking of others. The saints should not feel that one brother is attacking another brother when he gives a message. Although the brothers speak from different angles, they are one. Hence, we must endeavor to speak words of building. This requires us to be broken and built. Otherwise, it will not be possible for us to do God&rsquo;s work. This is a solemn matter.</p>
<p>Although the local churches stand on the proper ground, the situation among the churches seems to be one of self-government. We should not have local flavors; rather, we should have only the flavor of Christ. For example, if we come to Kaohsiung we should sense that we are simply the church in Kaohsiung. A believer can only be in one locality, and he should be for the building in that locality.</p>
<p>However, this can cause another problem if a local church is unwilling to fellowship with other churches. When different localities were being raised up by the Lord, the brothers did not know how to administrate the churches, and they relied on other local churches. For example, the churches in Tainan and Kangshan depended on the church in Kaohsiung. After making some progress, they began to take care of themselves without depending on Kaohsiung. Although they do not quarrel, argue, or dispute with the church in Kaohsiung, they practice self-government. Those in Kaohsiung may be able to break the bread with them, but there is a feeling of independence. There is not even the building among the individual saints. The lack of building among the local churches is the result of a lack of building among the saints.</p>
<p>The brothers who do the young people&rsquo;s work do not depend on one another for life. This is very disappointing. They are clever and capable and feel that it is more efficient to work alone. This type of individual labor, however, will not have any result. Although they may not quarrel or argue with others, they are unable to get along with others and serve the Lord together in one accord. Hence, there is no blessing.</p>
<p>We cannot deceive others concerning our true condition. When others touch our spirit, they can know our true condition and are clear whether we are being dishonest. The responsible ones for the young people&rsquo;s work have an uncooperative spirit. They say that they need others and that they cannot be independent; however, in their hearts, they wish that they did not have to work with others.</p>
<p>If we want to have the Lord&rsquo;s blessing and His presence, and if we want others to be edified, we need to learn to be built up. We must do one work in the position, atmosphere, and spirit of being built. Only then will our work produce the result that God seeks and blesses. If we have seen this light, we will prostrate ourselves before God and say, &ldquo;I cannot live independently of others. I need to be built regardless of how spiritual I am.&rdquo;</p>
