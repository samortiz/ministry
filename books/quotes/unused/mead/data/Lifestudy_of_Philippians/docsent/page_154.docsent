   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To have a proper understanding of 3:9 we should consider it according to the context of the whole book of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1:19 Paul speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This bountiful supply does not merely belong to the Spirit; it is actually the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the same principle the expression the Spirit of Jesus Christ does not mean that the Spirit simply belongs to Christ; it means that the Spirit is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Just as the Son of God is God Himself, so the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 2:16 Paul goes on to speak of the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once again we see that the word here does not simply belong to life, but actually is life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In New Testament usage, the word of life is life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First John 1:1 mentions the Word of life, and in John 6:63 the Lord Jesus says that the words He speaks are life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the book of Philippians, on the one hand, we have the Spirit of Jesus Christ as the supply and, on the other hand, the word of life as the means.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to consider Philippians 1 through 3 as a whole and put together the supply of the Spirit, the word of life, and the righteousness which is of God based on faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When in our experience we have the Spirit, the word, and faith, we are infused with God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then the very God who has been infused into us becomes our daily living, the living which Paul describes as the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>INFUSED WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we have the supply of the Spirit, the word of life, and the righteousness of God through faith, we are infused with God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This infused God will then be lived out of us as our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kind of daily life can be called the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not merely the gaining of Christ; it is the experience and enjoyment of Christ in a very practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is to be found in Christ under the condition of enjoying God s infusion that we may live Him out through the supply of the Spirit, the word of life, and the righteousness of God through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am fully persuaded and assured that this was Paul s concept when he composed the book of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul was very experienced in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From the word of life and through the supply of the Spirit he obtained faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This faith brought him God s infusion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Spontaneously Paul lived God out as his daily living and could be found in Christ, having the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was Paul s expectation and also his aspiration that he would always be found in Christ in such a condition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul desired not only to gain Christ, but also to be found in Him in such a marvelous condition that people could recognize that he was a man living out God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As such a person, Paul was not a man in culture, religion, philosophy, ethics, or morality; he was absolutely a man in Christ who lived out God as his daily life.</S>
