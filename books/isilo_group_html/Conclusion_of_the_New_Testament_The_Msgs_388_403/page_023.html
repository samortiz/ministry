<p>In this message we will continue to consider the aspects of Christ as our abiding place.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. Abiding in Him That We May Have Boldness<br />
and Not Be Put to Shame from Him at His Coming</h2>
<p>First John 2:28 says, &ldquo;Now, little children, abide in Him, so that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming.&rdquo; Here the pronoun <em>He</em> refers definitely to Christ the Son, who is coming. This, with the preceding clause <em>abide in Him,</em> which is a repetition of the clause in verse 27 involving the Trinity, indicates that the Son is the embodiment of the Triune God, inseparable from the Father or the Spirit.</p>
<p>Verse 28 indicates that some believers, those who do not abide in the Lord (that is, remain in the fellowship of the divine life according to pure faith in Christ&rsquo;s person) but are led astray by the heretical teachings concerning Christ (v. 26), will be punished by being put to shame from Him, from His glorious parousia. When the Lord comes back, we must be found abiding in Him; otherwise, we will be put to shame. If we do not abide in the Triune God, continually living the divine life, then at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back we will suffer shame, which will be a kind of discipline exercised upon us. Then we will be kept away from His glory.</p>
<p>If we abide in Christ and bear much fruit by His life to glorify God, when He is manifested, we will boldly meet Him and not be put to shame from His glorious presence (cf. Matt. 25:30). If we abide in the Lord and have fellowship with Him, we spontaneously walk before the Lord and live in His will. This will cause us to have boldness and not be put to shame at the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Otherwise, when we see Him, we will be in fear and become separated from His presence. Such danger should warn us to live in the fellowship of the Lord&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>If we do not abide in the Lord according to the anointing, we will &ldquo;be put to shame from Him at His coming&rdquo; (1 John 2:28). To feel shameful is one thing; to be put to shame is another. This verse does not say that we will feel shameful, but that we will &ldquo;be put to shame.&rdquo; Notice that, according to the Greek, it does not say &ldquo;before Him&rdquo; but &ldquo;from Him.&rdquo; The Greek preposition here is <em>apo,</em> which means &ldquo;away from.&rdquo; If we abide in the Lord according to the anointing, when He appears, we will have confidence, assurance, boldness, and peace and not be put away from Him. Literally, the Greek words translated &ldquo;at His coming&rdquo; mean &ldquo;in His presence.&rdquo; The Greek word for &ldquo;presence&rdquo; is <em>parousia,</em> which includes the meaning of coming. We may have His coming and yet not be in His presence. The Lord Jesus will come, but will we be worthy to be in His presence? If we live in a worldly way, loving the world and not giving the Lord the first place, how can we be brought into His presence when He comes? We must abide in the Lord according to the inward anointing so that we may have confidence, boldness, and assurance before Him in His presence at His appearing and not be put to shame away from Him.</p>
<p>At His appearing, the Lord will deal with His believers. To be put to shame away from Him must mean to be put to the place of shame outside His presence. A believer who is put to shame away from Him is not lost. He is still a saved person, but he must suffer being put to shame, which will be a dealing and a discipline for him. It will be the chastisement exercised by the sovereign Lord over His defeated believers. This matter is quite clear and is very serious.</p>
<p>Lot&rsquo;s wife was saved from destruction, but she became a pillar of salt (Gen. 19:15-17, 26; Luke 17:32). In the form of powder, salt is useful. But when salt becomes a block, it is useless. That Lot&rsquo;s wife became a pillar of salt meant that she had lost her usefulness in the hand of God and had become a sign of shame. Today Christianity helps people only to take care of the matter of salvation or perdition. But the Bible reveals that besides the matter of salvation or perdition, there is the matter of glory or shame. Lot&rsquo;s wife was not lost; she was saved from destruction. Eventually, however, she became a shame. Hence, the Lord said in Luke 17:32, &ldquo;Remember Lot&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; warning us that, although we are saved, at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back we might possibly suffer shame like Lot&rsquo;s wife. Although we are saved, we may become ashamed at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (1 John 2:28).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 388-403) &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
