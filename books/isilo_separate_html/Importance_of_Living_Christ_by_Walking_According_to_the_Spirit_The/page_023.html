<p>As leading ones, we also need to consider the matter of our character. In 1953 I gave a training on character in Taiwan and shared thirty points of character in ten groups of three. The first group is genuine, exact, and strict. We need to be genuine. A teenager who pretends to be an old man is not genuine, because he is acting like someone he is not. We should be what we are. To be exact is to be accurate and precise. Most people&rsquo;s character is not accurate or precise. In 1947 a serving sister in Shanghai told me, &ldquo;The roof of the meeting hall has a big hole in it and needs to be repaired.&rdquo; In order to get an accurate estimation of the size of the hole, I had to ask her several times, &ldquo;How big?&rdquo; Eventually, it became clear that the hole was not very large. Inaccurate information may cause damage to the church. An elder must have a precise character and be accurate when speaking to others. To be strict is not to be loose.</p>
<p>The second group of character traits is diligent, broad, and fine. After we decide to read the Bible every day, the time we spend reading the Bible may gradually decrease. Such laziness is versus diligence. In writing the footnotes for the Recovery Version of the New Testament, I scheduled a certain number of chapters per week. Although I often finished my scheduled work before the end of the week, my character caused me to continue working rather than relaxing. Before going to bed at night, if we do not put our shoes in the proper place, it indicates that we are lazy and loose. Keeping a clean living place requires a proper character. Those who serve the Lord must be diligent in everything, including caring for their appearance. A brother who does not keep his shoes shined cannot take good care of a church or speak the word of God with impact. When a person is exact, strict, and diligent, he often becomes narrow. He does not forgive others or tolerate looseness or laziness. Toward ourselves, we need to be diligent. Toward others, we need to be broad. We should not criticize or condemn others. Those who are broad are often rough. To be fine is to pay attention to detail. We need to have balancing character traits. We need to be diligent but not small, broad but not rough.</p>
<p>The third group of character traits is stable, patient, and deep. The fourth group is pure, just, and calm. The fifth group is single, corporate, and open. The sixth group is affectionate, ardent, and accommodating. The seventh group is strong, pliant, and submissive. The eighth group is suffering, lowly, and poor. The ninth group is steadfast, enduring, and bearing. The tenth group is clear, magnanimous, and grave. These character traits may serve as a mirror with which we can examine ourselves. We may be surprised by the truth about our character.</p>
<p>In 1965 I traveled with a group of brothers from the United States to Taiwan. The brothers in Manila wrote me a letter asking that I send a brother to preach the gospel in English there. I fellowshipped with one of the brothers who had come with me, and he had the burden to go. The serving ones in Manila provided him with excellent hospitality. One day when he was out, some sisters went into his room to clean. They saw many things tossed carelessly about, including a sock that was on a glass on the desk. This was a great shame. One with such a character cannot be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s work. A loose person cannot do a diligent work. A person always works according to his character.</p>
<p>Character is thirty percent nature and seventy percent habit. We receive our nature by birth, but our habit is built by practice. By birth we may have a quick or slow nature, but our upbringing and culture affect our habits. As a result, two children with the same disposition, or nature, but raised in different cultures will have different characters. A slow Chinese person is very different from a slow American. They may have the same nature by birth but their characters will be different because of their different practices and habits.</p>
<p>Our character affects even our walking according to the spirit. A diligent person who walks according to the spirit will rise up early to have a time in the Word, but a loose person who walks according to the spirit will rise later and spend a shorter time in the Word. An elder who talks to another saint may do so according to the spirit but will speak mostly according to the standard of his character. The same dye applied to different textiles will produce different results. A green dye applied to silk will produce a shining green color. However, the same dye applied to cotton will produce a dull green color. The brightness depends not on the dye but upon the quality of the textile. Similarly, the kind of Christian we are depends not on God&rsquo;s life and nature but on our character. We all need to walk according to the spirit, but our character will make a great difference in the outcome.</p>
<p>According to my experience, for the Lord to regenerate a person is easy, but for the Lord to change a person&rsquo;s character is difficult. We can easily change our mind, but we cannot easily change our character. Once a habit becomes part of our character, it is difficult to change. Before the 1953 training on character in Taiwan, I built a co-workers&rsquo; home near the meeting hall. The first brothers to live in the home attended the 1953 training. In the first year after the training, everything in the home was kept clean, neat, and orderly. However, over several years, the home gradually became sloppy. This shows that it is very difficult to change someone&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>The leading ones in the churches should not assume that because they are elders, their character is up to the standard. We must be careful not to act, speak, or make decisions loosely. We need to be genuine, exact, strict, and diligent in everything. The elders should always arrive at the meetings on time. In the training we require that everyone arrive at the meetings five minutes before the scheduled time. However, I have noticed that when the trainees return to their localities, they do not continue to practice this. Character is not a small thing. Our usefulness to the Lord depends not only on whether we walk according to the spirit but also on our character. Any regenerated person can walk according to the spirit, but only a person with a proper character can walk according to the spirit well.</p>
<p>The more we walk according to the spirit, the more the resurrected human nature of Christ will saturate our fallen human nature and transform our poor character. Nevertheless, when we consider the thirty character traits mentioned above, we will see that our character is lacking and may delay our spiritual growth. This word of inoculation should affect our attitude so that we have no trust in ourselves. We all tend to subconsciously appreciate ourselves and not others. However, when we consider our character, we will see that there is not much to appreciate. We may say that we do not lie, steal, or commit gross sins, but we probably cannot say that we have the thirty character traits mentioned above. We may have a problem with every point. If we have a proper attitude of humility, the Spirit will have the freedom to saturate us.</p>
<p>A good gospel message mainly changes the listeners&rsquo; attitude, which enables them to repent. Formerly, they were self-righteous. When they are convicted, their attitude changes, and the Spirit has an opportunity to work in them. The same principle applies throughout our Christian life. The earlier we begin to practice to improve our character, the more likely it is that we will receive the mercy and grace to be successful. We work and take care of the churches mostly unconsciously according to our character. Two brothers may interpret the Lord&rsquo;s leading in a particular situation differently because their character is different. Thus, we even understand the Lord&rsquo;s leading mostly according to our character.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
