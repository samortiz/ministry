   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN FUNCTION BY THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT Scripture reading: 2 Corinthians 3:6, 17; Romans 1:9; 8:4-5; 12:11; 1 Corinthians 5:3-4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The real function in the church is the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The functioning in the local church depends entirely upon the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"It is the Spirit that gives life" 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is another basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"THE LETTER KILLS"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In our function, we must release the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The letter means doctrines, forms, regulations, and even ways or methods.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All these things are letters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Anything other than the Spirit is a kind of letter, and the letter kills.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whatever we do in the church function must be something out of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It must be a release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we pray in the meetings, we must do it with the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we share a testimony, we must do it in the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It must not only be in the spirit, but with the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even when we go to visit a person for fellowship, we must do it with the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There must be the release of the spirit, because it is the Spirit that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Anything other than the Spirit is a kind of letter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not say that because I prayed in a certain way last night, I must do it that way all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is something of the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It might have been living last night, but it will be dead this time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Last night it was in the Spirit, but now it becomes a kind of letter because the spirit is not released only the way is kept.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even keeping the old way is of the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The basic principle is that in all the function of the church, we need the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may ask whether you should pray loudly or silently, but I cannot say.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you can pray loudly with the release of the spirit, you must do it loudly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you can release the spirit by praying silently, then do it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Perhaps yesterday I had to pray loudly, but this morning I have to pray silently.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit sometimes blows so strongly and sometimes so silently.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not have any regulation according to a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It all depends upon the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Others may ask whether we should call for a hymn first or pray at the beginning of our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But do not talk about first or second.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you put these things into regulations, they are immediately in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It all depends upon the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you have the sense to pray at the beginning of the meeting, you must do it; then the release of the spirit will be so prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no need for you to wait for a hymn to be called.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you think that you should not pray because a hymn has not yet been called, you will simply kill yourself and the others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The letter kills.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why we are fighting against formal Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The leaven of formal Christianity has even crept into the meetings of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In some of the local churches, people are used to regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>People come in and sit, waiting for the time to start.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then they wait for someone to call a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Of course, these matters are not in writing, but they are written more deeply in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If anyone behaves or functions in the meetings in a way which is not according to pattern, they say it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But this is of the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must not only reject this, but fight against it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must fight against formalities.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We praise the Lord that the church in Los Angeles is somewhat peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But I believe that we are not yet peculiar enough.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to be more peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I expect some day to see the brothers and sisters singing hymns on the streets as they are coming to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They will start to sing hymns and call on the Lord while they are driving in the car on the way to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They will even march into the hall with a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Everyone will be so happy, fervent in the spirit, and set on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There will be no regulations, no forms, yet no disorder.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everything will be in good order, but in the spirit, without any regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some say that the church in Los Angeles is "awful."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But it is still not "awful" enough!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to be more "awful."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We want to frighten all of Christianity to such an extent that the whole universe will be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Look at the picture on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Within Judaism, something unusual occurred that day, which I am certain was not according to the regulations of the Temple.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>And I do believe that the Lord will do the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today there is something new and different, something so peculiar and strange, happening to Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Yet it is so spiritual, so living, and so full of life.</S>
