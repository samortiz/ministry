   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIVING WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After speaking so much about Psalm 95, the writer of Hebrews suddenly says in 4:12, For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word for at the beginning of this verse connects it with the preceding verse.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why does the writer here suddenly speak of the word of God?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because the promise in Psalm 95 is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever we read the Bible, it must be living, energizing, and sharp enough to divide and discern all the things within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If it is not, we have not touched the word of God but only the black and white letters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The printed matter in black and white letters is neither living nor energizing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every word in the Bible must be the living and operative word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How do we know that we have touched the word of God and not just the printed matter?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We know it when the word we have touched is living, energizing, and dividing our soul from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is an important principle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The writer seemed to be saying, You Hebrew brothers cherish the Old Testament, especially the book of Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One of the psalms says, Today if ye will hear His voice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You have read this verse again and again without anything happening to you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now I am using this psalm as a base for my talk with you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This word of God must be living and operative and must divide our soul from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brothers, I know why you are staggering and hesitating.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is because your soul is mixed with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes, when you are calm, deep within, your spirit is telling you to go on and follow Christ as today s Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although you may be clear about this in your spirit, you turn from your spirit to your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Your mind in your soul begins to wonder and this causes your soul to wander.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because your soul and spirit are mixed together, I have quoted the living word of God which is sharper than a two-edged sword.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It will pierce your mixture, divide your spirit from your soul, and show you how foolish you are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You should no longer wander in your soul; you must turn from your soul to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Don t consider, talk, hesitate, or stagger.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The more you talk and hesitate, the more you are in your wondering mind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many of us have had this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before we came into the church life, we were wandering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we were attracted by the church and deep within our spirit something said, This is it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But then our mind began to wonder, asking, Is this right?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If it is, then why haven t the spiritual giants practiced it?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Under the influence of our background, we began wandering in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, in the calm of the night, something deeper than our mind stirred within us, saying, The church life is right.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During such a time, it was difficult to sleep or work well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We only found rest when one day the living word of God came in to divide our being, revealing what was our spirit and what was our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The living word of God must pierce into our being and separate all the mixture of soul and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church life is absolutely in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is very easy to be in religion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, to enter into the church life we need to be pierced and divided by the living word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only the word of God can divide our soul from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our soul, like fly paper, is sticky.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, it is easy for our spirit to be stuck to our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because of this, we need the piercing and dividing of God s living word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We not only experience this upon first coming into the church life but often afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many times God came in and our spirit responded.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, our soul also reacted, mainly through our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord may speak in our spirit and say, Subject yourself to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But the sticky soul, speaking through the mind, says, Be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Don t listen to the church so much.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the leading brothers have faults like anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Look at Brother So-and-So.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He s good, but he s not absolutely good.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When our mind acts like this, we soon begin wandering.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only when the merciful and faithful God comes in with the piercing of the living word of God do we find deliverance from our wandering mind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is why we need the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the Bible is not living and energizing whenever we read it, something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although many Christians take the Bible only as a printed book, day by day we must take it in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I. THE OUTFLOW OF THE LIVING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The living word of God is the outflow of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It flows with the life of God John 1:4 , the light of God Psa 119:105, 130 , and even with God Himself John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Because the Scriptures are breathed by God 2 Tim 3:16, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>, the word of God in the Scriptures is God s outflow.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It brings the life of God, the light of God, and even God Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Since the word of God is His outflow, being spirit and life John 6:63 , it is living.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In our experience the whole Bible must not be dead letters but rather living as spirit and life.</S>
