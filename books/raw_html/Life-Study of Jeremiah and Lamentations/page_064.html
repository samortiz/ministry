Regarding this covenant, in Jeremiah 11:3 and 4 Jehovah says, "Cursed is the man who does not listen to the words of this covenant, which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Listen to My voice and do the things according to all which I command you; and you will be My people and I will be your God."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Covenant of the Law<br>of the Ten Commandments</H2><P>The covenant of Jehovah with Israel, called the first covenant and also the old covenant, was the covenant of the law of the Ten Commandments.</P>
