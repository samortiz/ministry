   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST IN GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to see the revelation concerning Christ in God's economy versus the law in man's appreciation in the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous message, we saw the truth concerning the law in man's appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we need to see the divine revelation of Christ in God's economy in Psalm 2 vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2, 6-9, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. A Declaration of God</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>according to His Divine Concept</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Psalm 2 is a declaration of God according to His divine concept.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Psalm 1, however, is according to the natural, human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>David thought that the one who meditated in the law day and night would prosper in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is according to the human concept of doing something for one's personal benefit and gain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no consideration in Psalm 1 for God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. Exalting Christ as the Center</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>of the Economy of God</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Psalm 2 exalts Christ as the center of the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the word economy is not in Psalm 2, the revelation and reality of God's economy are there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this psalm God declared that He had installed His King v. 6 . For God to have a King is for the fulfilling of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then God said, "I will give the nations as Your inheritance / And the limits of the earth as Your possession" v. 8 . This is for a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of course, the King needs a kingdom, and this kingdom is not small.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is a great kingdom of all the nations, covering the limits of the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This will be the biggest kingdom in human history.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ will possess all the continents.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His kingdom will be everywhere to include everyone.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Anointed in His Divinity in Eternity by God</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>to Be the Messiah Christ the Anointed One</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Psalm 2 reveals Christ, the Anointed One v. 2 . Among the Brethren, there was a debate concerning when Christ was anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Daniel 9:26 says that Messiah would be cut off, crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Messiah is a Hebrew word, and the Greek equivalent is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They both mean the Anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Daniel 9:26 shows that before Christ was incarnated and crucified, He was already the Anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, Christ was anointed in His divinity in eternity by God to be the Messiah Christ the Anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is also based upon John 1:41, where the Lord's disciple Andrew told Simon, his brother, that he had found the Messiah, the Anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that Christ was anointed in eternity in His divinity before His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Anointed in His Humanity in Time</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>at His Baptism</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He came as the Anointed One to accomplish God's eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He became a man and He was anointed again in His humanity in time at the time of His baptism Matt 3:16-17; Luke 4:18-19; Heb 1:9; Acts 10:38 .</S>
