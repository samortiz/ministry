   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>CHRIST BEING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>FOR OUR ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We saw in chapter one that 1 Corinthians is on Christ as our portion for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the past I pointed out there are at least nineteen items of Christ as our portion in 1 Corinthians see note 9 2 in 1 Corinthians 1 Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul first says that Christ is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is theirs and ours 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The concluding aspect of Christ in 1 Corinthians is that He, as the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are going to enjoy Christ as our portion, we have to realize that this portion today is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the items of Christ in 1 Corinthians, such as Him being our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification redemption 1:24, 30 , are included in the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without being the life-giving Spirit, how could Christ be our wisdom?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without being the life-giving Spirit, how could the objective Christ who is sitting on the throne in the heavens, be our spiritual food and spiritual drink 1 Cor 10:3-4 ?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He had to go through a process to become the life-giving Spirit so that we could eat and drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If someone put a big cow in front of me, I would have no way to eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The cow would have to go through a process to become steaks to make it eatable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The raw God could not be our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because God has been processed, cooked, we can enjoy Him as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Word who is God became the last Adam in His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through death and resurrection this Man became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John 1:14 and 1 Corinthians 15:45b tell us of these two becames.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Word became flesh, and the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our God went through these two major processes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, the raw God became the cooked God, and the cooked God today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This truth is not according to today s traditional theology which says that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not only distinct but also separate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible, however, tells us that God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is one God, yet He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>W. Griffith Thomas, the founder of Dallas Theological Seminary, said that we may borrow the word persons to describe the three of the Godhead, but if we press this too far it will lead to the heresy of tritheism, the teaching of three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to the truth of the Scriptures the three of the Godhead are distinct but they are not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our portion, who is God embodied in Christ Col 2:9 , went to the cross as the last Adam in the flesh to die.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He then resurrected, and in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
