<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
BY VISITING PEOPLE TO BEAR FRUIT AND<br />
HAVING HOME MEETINGS TO HAVE OUR FRUIT REMAIN</h2>
<p>The first step we should take is to preach the gospel for the bearing of fruit. According to the Bible, history, and our own experiences, the best way to preach the gospel is to visit people. We should not stay at home or in the hall and invite people to come. This is not the God-ordained way. God did not stay in the heavens and invite the sinners to come to Him. Rather, He came down to the very spot where the sinners were. God came to Adam and said, &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; That was God&rsquo;s visitation to Adam. That was God&rsquo;s door-knocking. God came to knock on the door of Adam&rsquo;s heart. Then the Lord Jesus was incarnated to come to man, even to come within man. He went to Jericho purposely to visit that great sinner, Zaccheus (Luke 19:1-10). He also went to Samaria to wait for a sinful woman to come to Jacob&rsquo;s well (John 4:1-42). He sent the twelve to visit people (Luke 9:1-6). Then He sent seventy to visit people (Luke 10:1-9). They were instructed to enter into people&rsquo;s homes and stay with them to find out whether or not they were sons of peace.</p>
<p>To preach the gospel we have to go to visit people in their homes. In order to visit them in their homes, surely there is the need to knock on their doors. Some may think that this is too much activity and that we must come back to life. We have been emphasizing life again and again for years, but we bore very little fruit. Barrenness has been prevailing among us. I am fully disgusted with the barrenness.</p>
<p>I would like to help all the saints to bear remaining fruit. The Lord chose us that we might go forth and bear fruit and that our fruit might remain. For us to bear fruit, we have to go to visit people in their homes. For the fruit to remain, we have to set up home meetings. Only home meetings can help the new ones to remain. The best way to bear fruit is to knock on people&rsquo;s doors, and the best way for the fruit to remain is to have home meetings. This is for the multiplication of Christ, which is the glorification of the Father, and this glorification of the Father is the very expression of the Triune God. The scriptural way to meet and to serve is for this expression.</p>
