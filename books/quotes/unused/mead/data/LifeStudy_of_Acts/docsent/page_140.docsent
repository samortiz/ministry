   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Salvation of the Jailer and His Household</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 30 the jailer said to Paul and Silas, Sirs, what must I do that I may be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They replied, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household v. 31 . The word household indicates that the family of the believer is a complete unit for God s salvation, like the family of Noah Gen 7:1 , the families partaking of the Passover Exo 12:3-4 , the family of the harlot Rahab Josh 2:18-19 , the family of Zaccheus Luke 19:9 , the family of Cornelius Acts 11:14 , the family of Lydia 16:15 , the family of the jailer here, and the family of Crispus in 18:8.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul and Silas spoke the word of God to him together with all those in his house v. 32 . Then taking them with him in that very hour of the night, he washed their stripes v. 33a . Literally, the Greek words rendered washed their stripes mean washed them from their stripes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to 33b, he was baptized immediately, he and all his household.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As in the case of Lydia, baptism was practiced immediately after the jailer and those in his household had believed, that they might be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 34 continues, And he brought them up into his house and set a table before them; and he exulted, having believed in God with all his household.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The jailer, after believing and being baptized, also came into fellowship with the apostles, the fellowship of the Body of Christ, as a token of his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It may seem strange to us that the jailer and his household believed, were baptized, and were brought into the fellowship of the apostles all in the same night.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What a wonderful conversion!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I hope that we shall see such conversions today where people believe and are baptized and brought into the fellowship of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul Claiming His Rights as a Roman Citizen</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Acts 16:35 says, Now when day came, the magistrates sent the deputies, saying, Release those men.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here the deputies were the Roman lictors, those who held the rod to clear the way for the magistrates and to execute punishment on the criminals.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 36 the jailer reported to Paul the words of the magistrates: The magistrates have sent that you may be released.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now therefore come out and go in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 37 we have Paul s strong reply: They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Romans, and have thrown us into prison; and now they are thrusting us out secretly?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No indeed!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But let them come themselves and bring us out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here Paul did not behave like a lamb that was being brought to the slaughter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the contrary, he claimed his rights as a Roman citizen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some who read Paul s word here may say, It seems that in this situation Paul was not very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He acted like a lion, not like a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may also say that he was not a dove but a hawk.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For years I could not understand Paul s behavior at this point in Acts 16.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Gradually through my own experience of suffering persecution, criticism, and opposition, I came to realize that we should not always give in. We have tried to be faithful and honest followers of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have tried to walk in His footsteps, suffering persecution as He did.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually I learned that this is not always wise, and that it is not always God s intention that we react to persecution and opposition in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, in 16:35-39 the question is not whether Paul should have been a dove or a hawk.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The important matter here was Paul s evangelical work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul realized that for the sake of the future of this evangelical work it was necessary for him to claim his rights as a Roman citizen.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Roman government was a government of law, and this government protected its citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, Paul was wise in having the attitude described in verse 37, for this was a help to the future of his work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This attitude made it impossible for the Roman officials to think that they could treat Paul in any way they desired because he was a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 37 Paul seemed to be saying, No, we are not willing to go out secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are Romans, and we have not been judged guilty of any crime.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First you put us into the inner prison, and now you ask us to go out secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We refuse to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let the magistrates come and escort us out of the prison.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We shall not slip away like escaped criminals.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We want to be brought out of the prison in a way that is worthy of Roman citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, ask the magistrates to come and accompany us out of prison.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The record of Acts 16 indicates that the Roman magistrates had no choice except to fulfill Paul s request.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The deputies reported these words to the magistrates.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And they came and entreated them, and bringing them out, they asked them to depart from the city vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here we see that the magistrates accompanied Paul and Silas out of prison as Paul had asked.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 40 concludes, And they went out from the prison and entered the house of Lydia; and when they saw the brothers, they encouraged them and went out.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 16:35-39 Paul was not spiritual in a religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this situation he was not a religious dove; instead, he was a right-claiming hawk.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For the future of his evangelical work, Paul claimed his rights as a Roman citizen.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without vindicating ourselves in any way, we can testify that we have learned of Paul to claim our rights as citizens and to appeal to today s Caesar the law of this democratic country to deal with evil books that libel us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We live in a country of law, and in this constitutional country there are laws against defamation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For the sake of his evangelical work, Paul claimed his rights as a Roman citizen and appealed to Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In like manner, for the Lord s interest, not for our personal profit, we claim our rights as citizens and appeal to the law as our Caesar today.</S>
