<h2 class=head1>THE DIVINE DISPENSING BEING THE GOSPEL</h2><p>Today, we should preach this gospel to others. We should not preach the shallow gospel that Christianity preaches. That gospel tells people that they have sinned and must suffer the punishment of hell, but that God has had pity on them and has given His beloved Son to die for them to redeem them and to resurrect for them, and that as long as they repent and believe in Him, they will receive eternal life and will go to heaven. It tells them further that although the world is full of sufferings, they can trust in Him, learn to do good, and glorify God. Although this is the gospel, it is a low gospel. The high gospel that we preach says that the Word who was God from the beginning became flesh, passed through human living, was crucified, resurrected, and has become the life-giving Spirit to accomplish the great work of the divine dispensing.<p>Today, Jesus is not only our Redeemer and our Savior, He is also the dispensing God, dispensing Himself into all those who believe in Him. When He is dispensed into us, the believers, He becomes our grace and our reality, so that we have substance and are no longer empty. Our lives have a purpose and a goal. Since Christ has accomplished this divine dispensing and has become the life-giving Spirit and is now everywhere, He can enter into those that call on His name anytime and anywhere. At any time, when a person believes in Him and calls on His name, He will enter into this one and will become his life and everything to him.<p>I know definitely that I am saved. I also know definitely when I was saved. In April 1925, a young lady came from Shanghai to preach the gospel, and I went to listen out of curiosity. When I heard the word, I was caught by the Lord. There was no loud shouting, nor was there any jumping or skipping. I simply felt that I was captured by the Lord. I told the Lord that I did not want Satan to usurp me anymore. I did not want the world anymore. After the meeting, while I was on my way home, and before I reached home, I lifted up my head to heaven and said, “Lord, from today, even if the whole world is given to me, I will not take it anymore. I want to go and preach Jesus.” After one or two years, I discovered that there was a change in me. The worldly entertainments that I formerly enjoyed were all shaken off from me. From that day on, I began to love the Lord, to pursue after Him, and to serve Him. During my Christian life, very many things have confirmed to me that spiritual experiences are normal. The more normal the experience, the more proper it is. It is, in fact, miraculously normal. The reason for this is that the Triune God has been dispensed into me to be my life.<h2 class=head1>THE BELIEVERS’ ENJOYMENT AND APPLICATION OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2><h2 class=head2>Regenerated to Receive God’s Spirit of Life, Begetting into the Believers’ Spirit That Which is the Life of Christ</h2><p>After the Lord accomplished His divine dispensing, He sent men to preach the gospel. When we hear the gospel, our only choice is to believe. Once we believe and call on the name of the Lord, the following things happen. First, we are regenerated. When we receive the Lord, the dispensing of the Triune God begins to operate in us. The Spirit that was produced through the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus enters into our spirit, and we receive God’s Spirit of life, which begets into our spirit that which is the life of Christ (John 3:3-6). In other words, we receive the life of God in addition to our life in the flesh. From that point on, we are born of God and become God’s children (John 1:12-13). God is our Father, and we are His household.<h2 class=head2>Breathing the Pneumatic Christ as Breath</h2><p>Christ is not only our life to regenerate us. He is also the holy breath for our breathing. John 20:22 says that when the Lord Jesus came into the midst of the disciples, He said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.” This means that every believer can breathe in the Lord through calling on His name. This breathing is the breathing in of the pneumatic Christ as air (John 20:22). Stanza 2 of Hymns, #73 says, “Just to breathe the Name of Jesus, is to drink of Life indeed.”
