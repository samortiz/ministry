<h1 class=series>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEED FOR A NEW GENERATION</h1><h2 class=head1>BEING BROUGHT OUT OF EVERYTHING THAT IS ROUTINE</h2><p>In this series of messages, I have the burden to help us get out of all kinds of formality and routine. We hate any kind of form; we hate formal meetings; we hate rituals; we hate routine meetings, routine prayer, routine speaking, routine reading, routine sharing, and routine prophesying. Anything that is routine, we hate. We want to be vitalized overcomers in the church life who are one with the Lord to conquer deadness, lukewarmness, and barrenness.<h2 class=head1>USING TRACTS IN OUR LABOR IN THE GOSPEL</h2><p>We are preparing a number of tracts for our labor in the gospel. The ones we have prepared thus far are entitled Our Faith, Our Gospel, Our Commission, and Our Meetings. When we visit new persons, they will wonder who we are and what we believe in. We can give them the tract entitled Our Faith to show them what we believe. They will realize from reading this that we are bona fide Christians. Then they may wonder what we preach. We can give them Our Gospel, which tells them what we preach. If they would like to know what we are doing, we can give them Our Commission, which speaks about our work. If they want to know what kind of church we attend, we can give them Our Meetings to show them how we meet. They will realize from reading this that we have home meetings, perfecting meetings, and church meetings to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, for building up the church. They will also see that we have ministry meetings for the release of Godâ€™s word. After reading these tracts, the new ones will be very clear about us and will have the peace to talk to us. These four tracts may be considered as the first series.<p>The second series of tracts which we will publish will be for our gospel preaching. These tracts will be concerning God, Christ, the Spirit, the eternal life, the Body of Christ, the local churches, and the oneness of the Body of Christ. God, Christ, the Spirit, and the eternal life are for producing the Body of Christ, the Body of Christ is expressed in local churches, and all the local churches should keep the oneness of the Body of Christ.<p>Whenever we go out to visit people, whether they are Christians or unbelievers, we should bring all of these tracts. Then, as the Lord leads, we can give them a certain one to meet their particular need. We have to learn how to use these tracts in an effective way. We need to study what they say, so that we can have a conversation with the new ones about their contents. To ask a new one to read an entire tract together with us is awkward. That is the stale way. Instead, at a certain point in our conversation, we can read a portion of a particular paragraph to him. Then we can strengthen and confirm what we read in order to impress him. We should be familiar with all the appropriate verses in the Bible that are mentioned in these tracts. This is a practical part of our training in reaching people.
