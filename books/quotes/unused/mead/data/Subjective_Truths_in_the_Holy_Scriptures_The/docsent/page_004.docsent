   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first item revealed in the Scriptures is God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning God, there are two sides in the revelation of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is the objective side, and there is the subjective side.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Objectively speaking, first, God is God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is the God who is high above in the heavens with glory and majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As such, He is outside of us and is completely objective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, He is our Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All things in heaven and on earth were created by Him, and we also were created by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is our Creator, and we are His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Third, He is the sovereign Master.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There really is a sovereign Master in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fourth, He has become our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We sinned and became fallen, and He came to redeem us; this also is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Fifth, He is our good Shepherd, and we are His flock.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The shepherd is outside of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The shepherd loves the sheep, and the sheep also love the shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, to the sheep, the shepherd is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sixth, He is our Master.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He owns us, and we serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our relationship with Him is like that of a servant to a master.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All these items concern the objective aspect of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, in the Scriptures there is also the subjective aspect concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, God is our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is subjective because He has given us His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second, He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the Spirit, He enters into us just like air.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is also subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Third, He is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If He were outside of us and merely objective to us, there would be no way for Him to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is only by coming into us to live in us subjectively and to be mingled with us that He can be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fourth, He is light.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Scriptures, this light is called the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"The life was the light of men" John 1:4b .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not an objective light outside but a subjective light inside.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fifth, He is our breath.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sixth, He is our living water and food to be taken into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All these are subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christianity has fallen very deeply into the tradition of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In their concept they think that this God is too great, too majestic, too glorious, and too transcendent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They say that on the one hand, we must honor Him, and on the other hand, we must humble ourselves to prostrate before Him as we worship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we say that He is our living water and our food to be taken into us, they consider this altogether a blasphemy against God and an insult to God in that we lower God and exalt ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the opposers in America say that I came from China to teach heresy there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They say, "We have a hymn of praise that says, How great Thou art.'</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, this certain Mr. Lee comes and changes our hymn to How small Thou art.'" Yes, God is so small to the extent that we can eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You cannot eat a big cow unless you slaughter it and cut it up into small pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After going through a process, the cow can be conveniently eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Is the cow big or small?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was a big cow, but now it has become small pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord Jesus said, "I am the bread of life which comes down out of heaven so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" 6:48, 50, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Is this heresy, or is this the truth?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nevertheless, the opposers grope blindly only from behind and are not willing to take a look at the front.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If only they would be willing to come to the front, they could see seven openings with just a glance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am not merely telling you about fighting the battle for the truth in America.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I want to show you that even though you have been saved, edified, and nurtured in a local church, I know for a fact that even up until tonight in your religious concept, you still consider Jesus Christ as the Lord of all, the great Lord, who is high above.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Within you there is not much enjoyment of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, I would like to ask you, "How much of Jesus have you eaten today?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I am not asking you how many times have you prayed and how many times have you meditated.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I know that some of you enjoy meditating, and I also believe that some of you like to listen to messages and dislike the way the church meets today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, we know that in order to enjoy our food and its flavor we cannot be too concerned about manners.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Suppose you are invited to a feast, but you dare not move or make any noise; you just eat slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This kind of eating is only a half enjoyment; it is not the full enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, if you eat with big mouthfuls, saying, "It's delicious!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It's delicious!", this kind of eating is full of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Perhaps you think, "Brother Lee, this speaking is for a three-year-old child from the countryside."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I do hope that you would all become three-year-old children from the countryside.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Just be simple and come to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Get rid of your religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today the Lord Jesus will say, "Foolish child, I already humbled Myself through incarnation, I died for you on the cross, I even entered the tomb, and I resurrected from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Today I am just like the air to you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Don't make Me so great.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I have been so great from eternity; I have been in My greatness long enough.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I don't want to be so great any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Today I want to become small to enter into you."</S>
