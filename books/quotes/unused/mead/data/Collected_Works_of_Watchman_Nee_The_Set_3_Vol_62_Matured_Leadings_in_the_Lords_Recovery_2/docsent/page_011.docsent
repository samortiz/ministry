   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God's Requirement Being</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for the Whole Body to Serve</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What I saw in 1949 was much more than what I saw in 1939.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I saw that God intends for the church to become a solid and sure Body, an institution that brings salvation to men, and an entity that fights, edifies, and heals.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today the age of monumental achievements by great giants is over.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God wants the whole church to rise up to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today the brothers and sisters have handed themselves over to be material for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The elders and responsible brothers have to rise up to learn to make arrangements, to take the lead, and to build.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This will make the church the multifarious serving Body to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once this is in place, the church will be able to absorb five thousand or even ten thousand new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord intends that each church in each locality bear the burden of the gospel as well as meet the need of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What do we mean by spiritual needs?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is the need the brothers and sisters sense within themselves when they rise up to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A church should never allow a brother to have this need before the Lord yet not satisfy his need.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a man is sick, you have to give him medicine, not food.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a man is without food, you have to feed him, not give him medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church is where the genuine need within the spirit of every brother and sister is truly met.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The elders have to consider all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have to bring the whole church to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They have to bear all the brothers and sisters upon their shoulders and lead them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today our goal is for the whole Body to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's demand is great.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He requires that we forsake everything to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Is there an organization on earth in which one is required to forsake everything and to sell all before he can join?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only the church requires a membership fee that comprises one's total possessions!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is an uncompromising demand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we accept this uncompromising demand, and if we are willing to come forward and act upon it uncompromisingly, we will see uncompromising results.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this universal service, everyone is active and aggressive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If only one person is passive, we do not have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whether or not God's will is done rests entirely in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Blessed are those who see and hear this word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we see all these points clearly, we are most blessed.</S>
