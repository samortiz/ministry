<h2 class="head2">Handing Ourselves Over for Coordination</h2>
<p>The first matter concerning the church is the ground, and the second matter is coordination. During the period that I worked together with Brother Nee, he often pointed out that we say we are meeting in the Lord&rsquo;s name, taking His way, following Him, and giving up the denominations, but where can we see coordination in the churches? Can we see coordination among the co-workers?</p>
<p>In 1948 we experienced what we called &ldquo;handing over.&rdquo; At the end of 1947 several co-workers visited some major cities in Kwangtung and Fukien Provinces. Then we went to Foochow for a three-week conference. Several of us co-workers asked Brother Nee to let us stay with him for two weeks after the conference in order to have some fellowship with him. The other co-workers who attended the conference were supposed to return to their localities after the conference, but after hearing of our request to Brother Nee, they refused to leave, hoping that they would be allowed to participate in the fellowship. Eventually, Brother Nee agreed that they could participate in the fellowship on the condition that they sat behind a screen. Only a few co-workers were allowed to sit face to face with him. Brother Nee asked me to be responsible for this matter.</p>
<p>Those who have fellowshipped with Brother Nee know that he was never the first to raise a question. If someone would sit with him from nine to twelve o&rsquo;clock, without asking a question, Brother Nee would not say a word. That was what happened in our meeting. He was very patient; he sat without saying a word or asking a question. After a while, since I was the one who initiated the fellowship, I asked, &ldquo;Brother Nee, recently we traveled through Canton, Hong Kong, Swatow, and several important places in Fukien Province. We feel that the churches in these places are in confusion. What do you think should be done about this situation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Based on my question, Brother Nee gave a message concerning our lack of coordination. In essence, he said that all the co-workers feel that they are called by God, that they love the Lord, and that they are taking the way of the church in their service to the Lord. However, everything is being done without any coordination. Hence, the Lord has no way to go on. Brother Nee spoke for at least two hours. His speaking brought tears to our eyes. It was rare for Brother Nee to shed tears before people, but even he wept during that fellowship. Many co-workers, even the most hard-hearted, wept.</p>
<p>After Brother Nee spoke, the room was quiet. No one spoke, and no one moved. Among the twenty-some co-workers who were present, an older sister suddenly stood up and said, &ldquo;This being the case, why don&rsquo;t we practice it right away?&rdquo; Immediately, the rest of the co-workers agreed. Then Brother Nee said, &ldquo;If you want to do it, you must write on a piece of paper that you will hand yourself over and give it to Brother Lee. He will collect the pieces of paper for me.&rdquo; When we asked Brother Nee the purpose of our handing ourselves over, he said, &ldquo;By handing yourself over, you indicate that you are willing to accept coordination. Henceforth, you cannot be individualistic. If you want to be individualistic, you can take back your piece of paper. Anyone who hands in a piece of paper must accept coordination.&rdquo; That was the beginning of &ldquo;handing over.&rdquo; The emphasis was not on handing over our possessions but on handing over our person in order to accept coordination.</p>
<p>The church in Shanghai experienced a revival during 1946 and 1947. As a result of this revival, co-workers from various places in China, including the northern and central areas, wanted to come to Shanghai to seek fellowship. We asked Brother Nee to join us for a conference in Shanghai. In one of the meetings he said that handing ourselves over was for coordination. He showed us that the enemy&rsquo;s attack from outside was due to the matter of the ground and that the internal problems we had with one another were due to the matter of coordination. The enemy wants to remove the ground and destroy the coordination. He has been doing this for two thousand years.</p>
<p>Brother Nee also said that we are not more spiritual than the believers who have gone before us. We are not more spiritual than Madame Guyon, and our speaking concerning our co-death with Christ does not surpass what Mrs. Penn-Lewis taught. But we must see that the Lord has raised us up not for spirituality or for teachings. The Lord has raised us up for the church.</p>
<p>From 1933 to 1934 Brother Nee led me to see Christ and to experience His death and resurrection. In 1940 he showed me the blueprint for the building up of the church. By 1942 I had a deep realization that the spiritual riches of the believers who have gone before us, which we have inherited, are for the building up of the church. In order to experience the building up of the church, we must hold two concrete and practical points: a definite ground and the practical coordination. A person who wants to build a house must not only gather materials; he must also determine where to build the house. This is the matter of the ground. If he gathers materials but does not have a proper site, he cannot build a house. Furthermore, if there is a definite site, but the materials are not built together, there cannot be a house. This is obvious. In order to build a house, we need materials, a definite site, and a practical way to build the materials together.</p>
