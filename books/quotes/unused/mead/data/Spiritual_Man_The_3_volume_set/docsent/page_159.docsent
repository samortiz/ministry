   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Just as man has fellowship with the physical world through his body, he has fellowship with the spiritual world through his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This fellowship with the spiritual realm is not through the mind or emotion but through the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is through the intuition of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once we understand the functions of the intuition, we will understand the nature of the fellowship between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For a man to worship God and have fellowship with Him, he must have a substance that is similar to God's. "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit" John 4:24 . There cannot be fellowship between two different substances.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, unregenerated persons, whose spirits are not resurrected, and those regenerated believers who do not worship with their spirits cannot have any real fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although a person may have some beautiful thoughts and strong feelings, he can never enter into spiritual reality and have personal fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our fellowship with God is in the deepest part of our being; it is in the part that is deeper than our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We fellowship with God through our intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 2:9 through 3:2 explains clearly how man fellowships with God through the intuition in his spirit and how he understands the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us now look into this carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE HEART OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 9 says, "Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man's heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse talks about God and the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All of His acts are things which man's outer body the eye and the ear has neither seen nor heard.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are things which have never come up in man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Man's heart" is man's understanding, mind, or intellect.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man's thought can never fathom God's acts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's acts are far beyond man's thought.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who want to know God and have fellowship with Him can never reach God by simply using their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 10 says, "But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit searches all things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit does not have to use the mind to figure out all things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit knows even the deepest things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The things which man does not know, He knows.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He searches all things by His intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, through Him God can reveal to us things which have not come up in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is "revelation."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not the understanding which comes after an exercise of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since it is something that has not come up in our hearts, it is even more unlikely that it would come up in our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a "revelation" or an unveiling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no need for help from our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God does not reveal anything to us through our ears, eyes, or mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How does revelation come?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The next two verses answer this question.</S>
