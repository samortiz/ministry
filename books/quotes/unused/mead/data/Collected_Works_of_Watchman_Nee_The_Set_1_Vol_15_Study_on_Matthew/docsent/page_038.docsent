   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 6:"But I say to you that something greater than the temple is here."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since the Lord is the place that is filled with the glory of God, what He did for the glory of God was guiltless.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord is greater than the priests and also greater than the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord said that He was David; this refers to His person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord said that He was the priest and the temple; this refers to His work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By replacing the Sabbath with His person and His work, the Lord altogether put aside the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the problem of sin is not solved, there can be no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As long as the Lord was still being rejected, and as long as the people in the world were still in sin, there could not be a Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord was saying that as long as He was David and the temple, His disciples could profane the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 7:"I desire mercy and not sacrifice."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a conclusion, indicating that God does not want men to do something for Him, but He wants to do something for men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Mercy" is what God gives to men, whereas "sacrifice" is what men give to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 8:"For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From this we can see that until today, men still do not know the Lord of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verses 1-50 may be divided into seven small sections: 1 verses 1-13, the question of the Sabbath; 2 verses 14-21, the first time the Pharisees took counsel to destroy Jesus; 3 verses 22-32; 4 verses 33-37; 5 verses 38-42; 6 verses 43-45; 7 verses 46-50.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Chapter twelve is a transitional chapter; therefore, it is of the utmost importance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Beginning from chapter twelve, the destiny of the Jews is decided.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This chapter is crucial in terms of the dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we fail to see the Lord's turn in this chapter, we are inexperienced in understanding the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Prior to this chapter the Lord was evidently for the Jews and hiddenly for the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After chapter twelve He was clearly for the Gentiles and hinted that He was rejecting the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Chapter twelve is a turning point, a transitional chapter; this is why there is the need to overthrow one thing the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In type, it is all right to have the Sabbath; in actuality, it is not permissible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Men have sinned, so that even God has no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man does not have rest because God has no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Wherever sin is, there cannot be rest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From verses 1 through 8 there are two turns from David to the king, and from the king to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 9:Here is another case of violating the Sabbath among the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 10:"And behold, a man who had a withered hand was there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And they asked Him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath? so that they might accuse Him."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A "withered hand" is a hand that can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here, the man was not without a hand; rather, he had a withered hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The form was still there, but the strength was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All men are exactly like this: they are dead spiritually, but they are still human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verses 11-12:The Lord did not reply as to whether or not it was lawful; instead, He asked them two questions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the Lord was confronted with difficult questions, He did not answer first but responded with a question.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All truths can stand questioning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whatever is not the truth cannot stand questioning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Pharisees talked about men; the Lord talked about sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Pharisees talked about the withered hand; the Lord talked about the sheep falling into a pit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man treasures material possessions but despises sinners; he treasures sheep but despises men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What the Lord meant was that as long as the world remains, there will be pits, and there will be sheep falling into pits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The only way for the Lord was to take hold of the sheep and lift it out.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"To do well on the Sabbath" does not point to a particular matter; it speaks of a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord always speaks in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 13:"Then He said to the man, Stretch out your hand."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the Lord's action.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"And he stretched it out."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The man acted according to the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Life is behind the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God's word is like a capsule filled with medicine, and life is likened to the medicine contained in the capsule.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When one swallows the capsule, he swallows the medicine at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Likewise, when one receives the word of God, he also receives the life of God at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no word of God that is without power.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means that there is not one word behind which there is no life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The hand was "restored."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This shows that the work of Christ is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the life of a sinner is restored, he receives a life that is better than what he had in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verses 14 to 21 form the second subsection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verse 14:"But the Pharisees, going out, took counsel against Him as to how they might destroy Him."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This was the Pharisees' plotting to destroy Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The reason for this was that the Lord broke the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Pharisees considered that if the Sabbath was broken, Israel would not be reckoned as God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Sabbath was a sign of the covenant that God had made with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once this sign was removed, the covenant would become ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Pharisees knew the Lord's attitude toward the Israelites, that is, to put the Israelites aside.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Because the foundation was overthrown by the Lord, the Pharisees wanted to kill Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Verse 15:"But Jesus, knowing it, withdrew from there.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>And many followed Him, and He healed them all."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord "withdrew from there"; He did not run away.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>On another occasion the Lord "passing through their midst, went away" Luke 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He went away as if nothing had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Such calmness is unmatched.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>"He healed them all," indicating that He took care of all those who had needs.</S>
