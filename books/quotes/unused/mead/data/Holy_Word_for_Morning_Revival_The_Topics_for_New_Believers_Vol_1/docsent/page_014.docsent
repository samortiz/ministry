   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 2 DAY 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Cor 12:13 For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>3 And no one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Out of a Pure Heart Calling On the Lord Corporately, Daily, and as Long as We Live</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How should we call on the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must call on Him out of a pure heart 2 Tim 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our heart, which is the source of our calling, must be pure, seeking nothing except the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Also, we must call with purified lips Zeph 3:9 NASB .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to watch our speech, for nothing contaminates our lips more than loose talk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If our lips are impure due to loose talk, it will be difficult for us to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, we need to call on the Lord corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second Timothy 2:22 says, "But flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to come together for the purpose of calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Psalm 88:9 says, "I have called out to You, O Jehovah, every day."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, we should call daily upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, Psalm 116:2 says, "Therefore I will call upon Him all my days."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as we live, we should call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>59</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Enjoying, Breathing, and Drinking the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To call on the Lord is to enjoy the Lord, to breathe the Lord in. Calling is just breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jeremiah was designated the "weeping prophet."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the book of Jeremiah, he felt he was not finished, so he wrote Lamentations as a weeping book.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this weeping book there are two wonderful, joyful verses: "I called upon Your name, O Jehovah, / From the lowest pit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>/ You have heard my voice; do not hide / Your ear at my breathing, at my cry" 3:55-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our calling is our breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes our dear husband or wife or our children put us into "the lowest pit."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever you get into "the lowest pit," do not murmur or complain.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Simply call, "O Lord Jesus," and you will be in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To call on the Lord is just to breathe Him in. Verse 56 says, "Do not hide / Your ear at my breathing, at my cry." The Lord turns His ear to our breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This spiritual breathing is our calling, "O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>60</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The secret to enjoying the Spirit is found in 1 Corinthians 12:13.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all must believe that we have experienced the first half of 1 Corinthians 12:13.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In one Spirit, that is, in the Spirit, we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit and the Body are connected.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must believe that we believers of the Lord were in that one Spirit baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since you believe that you are in the Body, then you must also believe that you are in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have all been baptized into the Spirit, and now we need to drink this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>61</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The way to drink is in verse 3 of the same chapter: "No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is similar to saying, "No one can breathe except that the air gets into him."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Can we say that we are breathing, but the air never comes in?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we breathe, the air comes in. If we say, "O Lord Jesus!" we are in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The way we drink of the Spirit is by saying, "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hymn #73 in Hymns was written by Miss M. E. Barber, an older sister who helped Brother Watchman Nee very much.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Stanza 2 says, "Blessed Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Mighty Savior!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>/ In Thy Name is all I need; / Just to breathe the Name of Jesus, / Is to drink of Life indeed."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To call on the name of the Lord is to breathe Him, and to breathe Him is to drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The way to drink of the one Spirit is to call, "O Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you are thirsty, call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At any time or any place, even while we are driving, we may be thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then we may call on the Lord and receive the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Try it; it always works.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is very simple, and this is our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our Christian life must be a calling life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>62</S>
