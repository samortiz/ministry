<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">IMPRESSIONS AFTER VISITING CHRISTIANS<br />
IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>On the one hand, I am disappointed with the condition of Christianity that I saw during my visit abroad, but on the other hand, I have more faith in the way of the church that we are taking. I cannot fellowship concerning all my inner feelings, but I will share something as an introduction.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DISAPPOINTING CONDITION<br />
OF CHRISTIANS IN THE WEST</h2>
<p>Even though the condition in the Far East is not ideal, the condition in the West is worse. We did not fellowship with all God&rsquo;s children in the West, but in the past we contacted Christianity in the West through their publications. We also studied their history. We did not fellowship with them often, but we became familiar with them through their writings. Hence, even though we did not contact every Christian group, we feel that we have a clear understanding of the situation in the West.</p>
<p>Before this trip it did not occur to me that the situation in the West could be so poor. Before we left England, a brother asked me about my impression of Christians in America and Europe. I responded that I was disappointed. I said that because the believers who preached the gospel in the Far East came from Christian countries in the West, I had not thought that the condition in the West could be so poor.</p>
<p>I will not give all the reasons for my disappointment, because an inaccurate repetition of this fellowship can cause misunderstandings. However, I am not the only one who has this realization. The brothers whom I spoke with in the West did not say that the condition in the West is good. These brothers were not being humble, nor were they being polite. They were sincere and honest in what they said. The believers with whom I fellowshipped spoke of the poor condition in the West.</p>
<p>Nearly all the saints here asked me about the spiritual things I saw in the West. I did not touch many spiritual things during my trip. In the one place where I should have seen something spiritual, I saw a lack of harmony. There was no spiritual atmosphere. Most of the believers there, who fellowshipped with me, acknowledged that there was a lack of harmony. There was almost nothing spiritual.</p>
<p>I received some help from this trip, because it is always profitable for a person to visit other places. However, the help that I received was not on the positive side. Instead, I was greatly disappointed. I also saw that believers have an exaggerated opinion of us. The believers whom I visited received me as someone who could help them, not as someone who could receive help from them. Hence, most of the believers fellowshipped their difficulties with me, just as a patient speaks to a doctor. They did not speak of any positive situations with me.</p>
<p>I traveled from the Far East to the West and back to the Far East, and the brothers in every place that I visited fellowshipped about their problems. It may be that the believers came to us with their problems because they regard us too highly and think that we can help them solve their problems.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Confirmation of the Way<br />
of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery</h2>
<p>As I visited the different places, observed the local situations, and contacted the saints, I gained an understanding of the actual condition in each place. My observation of the condition also strengthened my faith in this way. My faith is strengthened to take the way of the recovery. The more places I visited, the more I understood that their problems and difficulties are because they do not take this way.</p>
<p>Even though the needs and problems in every place differ, the answer to these needs and problems is found in this way. If the believers could know, see, and receive this way, spontaneously their needs would be met and their problems would be solved. Therefore, what I observed strengthened my faith in this way.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find an example in church history of the way that we are taking. It is also difficult to find a person who has taken this way. According to our consideration, we discovered this way. We did not invent it; we discovered it. Hence, as we take this way, on the one hand, we feel that it is according to God&rsquo;s leading, but on the other hand, we sometimes feel that we may be too much, since there is no precedent in church history.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we feel that this way is of God and is according to His leading; on the other hand, since there is no precedent in church history, we feel that we may be peculiar. However, what we saw in the different places gives us a strong confirmation that this way is truly according to God&rsquo;s leading. The different needs and problems are the issue of a lack of vision and revelation concerning this way.</p>
