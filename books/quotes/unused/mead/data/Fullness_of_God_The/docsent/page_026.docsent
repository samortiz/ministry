   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MATERIALS FOR GOD S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 Corinthians 3:10-15 Paul says, According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But let each man take heed how he builds upon it...If anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble, the work of each will become manifest; for the day will declare it, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one s work, of what sort it is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If anyone s work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward; if anyone s work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These verses show that even before the book of Revelation was written, Paul said that gold, silver, and precious stones are the materials for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He used gold, silver, and precious stones as a sign to show that once we are saved, we possess the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Gaining God through Regeneration</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For over ten years after my salvation, even though I said that I had God s life and nature, I did not have a deep impression of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was not until 1939 in Tientsin that I received a revelation as I was praying and reading the Word in my room.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I had a deep sensation that God is in me and that I was made to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all need to see that to be saved is to have God, to gain God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the time of our salvation we gained God, and we now have God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Gold in the Bible signifies the divine nature of God, which is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, when Paul says that we need to build the church with gold, he means that we need to build the church with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Receiving the Element of God Day by Day</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How do we build with God?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the revelation in the Bible, the Christian life is a matter of transformation, not a matter of cultivating one s character or improving oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are to be transformed, a new element must enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that another essence must enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>An example of this is petrified wood, which is wood that has become stone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When wood is in flowing water for a long period of time, the element of the wood is carried away and replaced with various minerals from the earth that are in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These minerals change the wood and gradually transform it into stone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This example shows that transformation requires the addition of new elements.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As Christians, we do not rely on cultivating our character, nor do we depend on outward improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need transformation; we need to receive a new element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This new element is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we wake up in the morning, we need to spend five minutes to pray and ten minutes to read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is Spirit John 4:24 , and we receive Him into us by praying and reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we pray, we breathe in the Spirit, and when we read the Bible, the Spirit of God enters into us, because the Spirit is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, we need to read the Word and pray daily.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I preach God s word, and I work for the Lord in order to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If I encourage others to cultivate their character or if I promote self-improvement, I am building the church with wood, grass, and stubble, which are of no value before God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>My burden and the messages that I release are to let God spread in us so that He can fill us and transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are not here to speak to people about cultivating their character, because our quick temper is wood, and our meekness is also wood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whether we are quick tempered or meek, it is of no value before God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Consequently, our work is not to improve other people; it is not a work of wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must not do a work that helps people wear makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, we need to tell people that man needs to have the life of God and to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this reason, after we are saved, we need to breathe in the Lord through prayer every day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must learn to put aside the self, and instead of cultivating our character or trying to improve ourselves, we only need to be filled in spirit with God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we live in this way, we are building the church with gold.</S>
