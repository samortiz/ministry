<P>A number of people oppose this scriptural revelation. They think that the three of the Godhead are separate and that we cannot say the Son became the Spirit. They just care for their theology. They do not care for the spiritual, divine fact. The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 15:45b, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." The Lord in whom we believe, Jesus Christ, who is the last Adam, has become a life-giving Spirit. Paul said that Christ lives in us (Gal. 2:20a). If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit, how could He live in us? Christ lives in us, works in us, and even makes His home in our heart (Eph. 3:17). Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit." If He were not the Spirit, how could He be with us in our spirit? At the most He could only be among us, not within our spirit.</P><P>When I came to this country, a number of saints told me that they never knew that they had a human spirit. Many Christians today do not believe that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, nor do they believe that they have a spirit. They do not have these two key points. Without these two key points, there is no way to live the Christian life. The Bible tells us that God created a spirit within man (Gen. 2:7; Prov. 20:27; Job 32:8; Zech. 12:1). The Bible also tells us how God became a man and died to accomplish redemption to end the old creation. Then He rose up. In His rising up He became another person&#151; the life-giving Spirit &#151; to enter into us. In the morning He rose up. In the evening He came back to the disciples to breathe upon them, saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (John 20:22). By that time He was the life-giving Spirit to be received by His disciples. From this point onward, the key points of the Christian life are the life-giving Spirit and our spirit.</P><P>Today He is the life-giving Spirit. He not only rose up but also transcended to the heavens and passed through the heavens (Heb. 4:14). The ascended Christ has at least twelve statuses. Each status qualifies Him to minister in a certain realm. In His ascension He was enthroned as Lord of all and appointed, assigned, to be the Christ of God (Acts 2:36). He is the Leader of all the rulers (Acts 5:31a). He is the Savior (Acts 5:31b). Even though we may want to save people, we cannot do it. But He can do everything. Because He is the omnipotent One, He can save us. He is the High Priest (Heb. 4:15; 7:26) and the Advocate (1 John 2:1b). He is the Intercessor, interceding for us (Heb. 7:25). He is also the Mediator of the new covenant (8:6) and the surety of the new testament (7:22). He is the Life-giver (John 10:10b), the Comforter (14:16-17), and the Lamb-God (Rev. 22:1b). He is in the heavens ministering all the time. The key point is that today He is the life-giving Spirit. Without being the life-giving Spirit, He could never be the High Priest ministering to us. He could never be the Life-giver. He could never be the Comforter. He is the life-giving Spirit to execute His covenant, to carry out what He has accomplished through His all-inclusive death.</P><P>Ephesians 1 says that in Him we have redemption. He redeemed us back to Himself. We were fallen in Adam. That was our location. But Christ's redemption redeemed us out of that location and brought us into Himself as the realm and the element. Actually this realm and this element are the Spirit. He is the life-giving Spirit, and He has redeemed us out of Adam into Himself as the life-giving Spirit. As the redeemed ones of Christ, we all should declare, "I am in the Spirit!" We are not on the earth, nor are we merely in the heavens; we are in the Spirit. The Spirit is our location. The Spirit is our realm. The Spirit is our element. In this realm and with this element, Christ is working every day to transform us.</P><P>The Spirit, who is the realm and the element, is the sanctifying and transforming Spirit. He is transforming us metabolically, making us a particular treasure to become God's private possession, even God's heritage, God's inheritance (Eph. 1:11). God wants to inherit something. He wants to inherit those who were once sinners and who have become a treasure. Today we are in the cocoon, but eventually we will become a butterfly. We are expecting to be glorified, and God is also expecting to see that we are glorified. Then He will have a complete treasure. This may seem like a dream, but one day this dream will be fulfilled.</P>
