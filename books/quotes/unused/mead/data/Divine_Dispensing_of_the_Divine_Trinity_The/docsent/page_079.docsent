   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE EXPERIENCE OF THE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10-17; 8:2-3, 6, 9-11, 14-16, 29-30</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we began to consider the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although the word dispensing is not used in this book, the fact of the divine dispensing is nonetheless found in this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fact of dispensing is indicated by the word give in 8:11.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen that Romans 8 includes the Divine Trinity, the process through which the Triune God has passed, and our experience of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This dispensing involves our tripartite being, our spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to open ourselves to the divine dispensing so that we may be soaked with the Triune God,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF ROMANS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The central thought of the book of Romans is that God is producing sons for the formation of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This book reveals that God is making sinners into sons for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the members of the Body of Christ are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If someone has not been regenerated, born again, he is not a child of God, and he is not a member of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>An unregenerated person may be a member of a particular religious group, but he cannot be a member of the living Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ s Body is living and organic.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only through regeneration can we become the living, organic members of the Body of Christ, which is an organism, not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may use dentures as an illustration to show that every member of the Body of Christ must be living and organic.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although a person may wear dentures, they are not an organic part of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because the dentures are not living or organic, they may come out of place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually the dentures are a foreign article in the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, every genuine member of a person s physical body is living, organic, and attached to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because the ears are such living members of the body, they do not fall away from the body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In a similar way, we who have been regenerated of the Spirit are not foreign articles in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are not dentures that have no life and that are not organic.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the contrary, as members of the Body, we are living and we are organic.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A living person with a body is very different from a robot.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A robot may act in a mechanical way, but a person acts in a way that is living and spontaneous because he is full of life and every part of his being is living and organic.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In like manner, all the sons of God have the divine life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This life makes us the living, organic members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Romans 8 Paul speaks concerning the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, verse 14 says, For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in chapter twelve of Romans Paul goes on to speak regarding the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 12:5 he says, So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The many sons of God in chapter eight are the many members of the Body of Christ in chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The real church is this Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The living, organic Body of Christ is the church of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This church of the living God is produced by the dispensing of the Triune God into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It will be helpful to give some practical illustrations of our need for the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in order to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose a group of brothers live together in a brothers house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These brothers will be tested as they live together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The brothers house may be called a house of testing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose one of the brothers realizes that he is doing the dishes much more often than the others are.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He begins to complain about the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, when he complains, he has the sense deep within that, in a practical way, he is not in the church life, because the switch within him has been turned off and he is no longer experiencing the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Simply complaining about having to do the dishes so often causes this brother to lose the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As a result, when the brother comes to the church meeting, he is not able to praise the Lord or even say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a strong evidence that, in a practical way in his experience, he is not in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Let us also use married life as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose a brother is not happy because his wife showed him a long face at home before the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When he comes to the meeting, he is still bothered by what happened at home with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The switch has been turned off within him, and he is not able to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is an evidence that something within him has been disconnected and that in his experience the divine dispensing has been interrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not a mere teaching or doctrine; it is our actual experience.</S>
