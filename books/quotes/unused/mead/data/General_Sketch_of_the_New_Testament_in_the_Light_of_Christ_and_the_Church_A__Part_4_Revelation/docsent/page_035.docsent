   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO THE NEW JERUSALEM 1 Scripture Reading: Rev 21:1-11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From this point we must spend much time to have a thorough view of the glorious city of New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the best sightseeing in the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE TWO ENDS OF THE SCRIPTURES</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The two ends of the holy Scriptures the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation correspond to and reflect one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first two chapters mention the heavens and the earth Gen 1:1 , while the last two chapters speak of the new heaven and the new earth Rev 21:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the first two chapters is a garden which was the center of God s old creation Gen 2:8 , while in the last two chapters there is a holy city as the center of God s new creation Rev 21:2, 10; 22:14, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the garden at the beginning of the Bible there was the tree of life Gen 2:9 , while in the city at the end of the Bible there is the tree of life again Rev 22:2, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise, in the beginning there is a river with three precious materials gold, bdellium pearl , and onyx in the scenery of creation Gen 2:10-12 , while at the end there is the river of water of life with the same three precious materials gold, pearl, and precious stones built up to be a city Rev 22:1; 21:18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Moreover, in the garden at the beginning there is Eve as a bride Gen 2:22 , while at the end the city itself becomes the bride Rev 21:2, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In addition, right after the first two chapters of the Scriptures the serpent came in, bringing sin, death, and the world Gen 3:1-5 , while just before the last two chapters of the Scriptures the serpent is cast into the lake of fire with sin, death, the world, and all negative things Rev 20:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation must be put together, but between these two ends the troublesome one came in, and it took a long time to cast him out again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A great part of the construction of the Scriptures, from Genesis 3 through Revelation 20, is for dealing with the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Scriptures tell us simply about a garden and a city.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s intention is to build the garden into a city for His habitation to fulfill His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although this seems simple to accomplish, the frustrating one came in. We may plot the course of the Scriptures with a line.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At Genesis 3 the line takes a deep, downward curve in the shape of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Bringing the line back up to the normal level is a story that takes a long time, perhaps six thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On this long line God accomplishes His redemption and applies His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Finally, at the end of the Scriptures the serpent is cast out, and God s purpose is fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW EARTH The First Heaven and the First Earth</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Having Passed Away and the Sea Being No More</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation 21:1a says, And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the old things have passed away and everything, even the heavens and the earth, has been renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How are they renewed?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is by God s judging fire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second Peter 3:10-13 tells us that all things will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be burned is to be purified for renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After being burned, the old heaven and the old earth are renewed to become the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 1b says, The sea is no more.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although there will be no more sea of water, there will be a lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the beginning of Genesis, the earth was covered with deep waters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That was a chaos, waste and void, with nothing in order and no light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then God came in to bring light, an expanse, and the dry land, which emerged from the covering water on the third day as a clear type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that point, all the water was gathered together to form the seas.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From the entire Scriptures we can realize that God s work of creation and redemption throughout all the generations, on the positive side, has been to bring forth something from the earth to satisfy Himself and, on the negative side, to abolish the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a result of this, at the end of the Scriptures there is the New Jerusalem as the positive issue, result, and consummation of God s work, and there is the lake of fire as the negative issue and result of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has been working throughout the ages to abolish the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ultimately, He will restrict the sea within a lake and consume the water in fire.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the New Jerusalem and the lake of fire are the two ultimate issues of God s work in creation and in redemption.</S>
