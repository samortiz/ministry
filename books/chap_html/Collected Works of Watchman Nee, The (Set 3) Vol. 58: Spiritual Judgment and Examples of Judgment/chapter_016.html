<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(12)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 6, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER S. Y.</h2><p>I was saved in 1935 despite opposition from my parents. In 1936 I turned to the local church and enjoyed the sweetness of the Word. I consecrated myself to the Lord and became very desirous of the messages. That year I quit my job at the hospital and returned to my village to preach the gospel. Because I was not trained, my work produced very superficial results. For two and a half years I preached the gospel and took care of sick patients on the side. My initial zeal toward the Lord gradually cooled down. I learned the lesson and realized that everything should have its source in the Lord. Even my zeal should not be from myself. I started a clinic with a friend and began to preach the gospel again. I had only one desire, which was to please the Lord. I did not care about men's opposition. I read many of the publications of the Shanghai Gospel Book Room, and they suited my taste. I feel that there is still something wrong with my person. Others have gained something, but I have not gained anything. I used to be an active person. Now I no longer dare to be so active. Recently I picked up a desire for prayer. My inner sense has become more sensitive now. This is my condition.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">The Need for the Sense of Light to Increase</h2><p>I have nothing special to say concerning your situation. I can only say that for a period of time you should take bold strides in your walk with the Lord. You should not take any more detours. Instead, you should take the straight course, the fast course. There is no more time to look back. Additionally, I have two things to say. First, the sense of light within you should increase. If your inner being is not shining, you will not have proper feelings. Your inner feelings are the basis of judging others. If the inner feelings increase, it means you have the proper organ to contact God and to judge men. This will bring you spiritual discernment. When your deposit increases, you will become useful to God. Once the light shines within and the inward consciousness increases, you will spontaneously know whether others are right or wrong when you contact them. You have to ask for more light. Once you have the light, you will be clear, and when you are clear, you will have feelings and know how to discern. Everyone has to learn to judge men, but you first must be judged by the light before you can identify others' mistakes and render them the proper judgment. Do not expect to help others by saying a few words extemporaneously. You must have a particularly discerning spirit before the help you render to others can be proper. The degree to which others receive your help, however, is up to them.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Delivered from One's Own Feelings</h2><p>Second, you have to be delivered from your own feelings. In your going on with the Lord, your feelings have to follow your will. You should not be affected by your feelings, or else you will not be able to finish a year's course in ten years. This is like a broken twig which flows from a stream to the sea. If it is entangled constantly with obstacles in the stream, it will take a long time before it reaches the sea. Some people are too sensitive to things in their lives such as money, criticism, or judgment. These things are like obstacles in the stream, preventing the twig from flowing. There are two kinds of Christians. Some have no feelings at all; they are insensitive to everything. Others have too many feelings, and they are handicapped in their going on with the Lord. A profusion of feelings takes over their whole being. Our going on with the Lord should not have too much to do with our feelings. It is a joy and enjoyment to follow God. If we are led by our feelings, we waste much time. We may end up spending five years doing what could have been done in one year. We should not be running the race with the burden of our own feelings on our shoulders. If a man wants to believe in the Lord but will not commit himself until he first has joy and peace, we should say to him, "Believe first. Do not seek for a feeling of joy and peace. After you have believed, feelings of joy and peace will come to you." We have to abide by this principle for the rest of our life. We believe first and then, after a period of time, feelings of joy and peace will follow.</p><p>Philippians is a book on rejoicing. Paul gave us a commandment which is hard to find anywhere in the world. He said, "Rejoice." Rejoicing typically involves feelings; it is not a matter of will. In the world, joy is controlled by the feelings. But for believers, joy is controlled by the will. When the Lord says, "Rejoice," we should say, "All right, I will rejoice." An unbeliever cannot rejoice when he is asked to rejoice. Christians, however, can bring their feelings under the control of their will. We can rejoice when we need to rejoice. When Paul said to the Ephesians, "Be strong" [KJV], he meant that they should be strong. Everything relates to the will. Brothers and sisters, if we are chained by our feelings, we will need ten years to take a year's journey. A soldier cannot say that he will not fight today because he does not feel good or happy or because he is depressed. This is wrong. When a soldier is called to fight, he has to fight, no matter how he feels or what his temperament is. The same is true of spiritual matters. Today most children of the Lord follow their feelings. This is wrong. The most stable feeling is peace, the most intense feeling is joy, and the most fierce feeling is temper. We cannot be bound or hindered by these feelings. We have to follow the will and be led by the will. If we do this, we will be able to run the race swiftly.</p>
