   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION 1 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:17-23; 3:16-21 THE TWO DEEPEST PRAYERS OF THE APOSTLE PAUL Concerning the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this book we will cover the two deepest prayers of the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These two prayers are found in the book of Ephesians, a deep, high, and profound book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This profound book covers mainly one matter the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is the deepest matter in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not something superficial, shallow, or easy to realize.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today the term the church has been used in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When people refer to the church, what do they mean?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To many the church is something common.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some may even consider that the church is a material building, but according to the Bible, the church is the deepest matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to be in the deepest part of our being, our spirit, to know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All of us, especially the young brothers and sisters, have to know something that is not merely for our enjoyment, our salvation, or our building up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to know the church, the deepest matter in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because the church is so deep, the apostle prayed for us to know this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need the apostle's prayer to see the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Need for Both Revelation and Experience</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to consider what Paul covered in these two prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the first prayer, he prayed for a spirit of wisdom and revelation that we could see the church Eph 1:17-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This prayer is for a spirit that can see, a spirit of revelation, and even a revealing spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need such a spirit to see the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many may have a common or superficial understanding concerning the church, but it is not a simple or superficial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not consider that we understand the matter of the church thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church is the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4 , and we need a revelation to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Paul's second prayer 3:16-21 , he prayed for the strengthening of our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is related to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His first prayer is for the seeing, the enlightening, the revealing, and the other is for strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, we need the revelation that we may see the things concerning this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then after seeing, we need to get into, to experience, what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In other words, the first prayer is a prayer for revelation, and the second is a prayer for experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the book of Ephesians, both the revelation and the experience are for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION The Human Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the first prayer, Paul prays, "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom" 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This does not mean that God would give you the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word spirit in this verse is not capitalized, indicating that this is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To see the mystery of Christ 3:4 , the church, requires more than just having a smart mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A smart mind may be good for the university, but the mind alone can never realize the mystery of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To see the church, we need our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God did not create us in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to 1 Thessalonians 5:23, man is of three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our human body is very complex.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Medical doctors spend many years studying medicine, yet they still do not understand the human body thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The psychological part of our being is called the soul, composed of the mind Psa 13:2; 139:14; Lam 3:20 , the emotion S. S. 1:7; 2 Sam 5:8; Isa 61:10; 1 Sam 30:6 , and the will Job 7:15; 6:7; 1 Chron 22:19 . These three organs are wonderful, but they can also be the cause of much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes we cannot sleep well because we have such an active mind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we could control our mind, we would sleep well.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our emotion can also be troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we were not so emotional, we would not be so concerned with how people treat us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whether they would highly appraise us or scorn us, we would not be moved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because we have such a troublesome emotion, sometimes we are so bothered that we cannot go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our stubborn will is also the source of many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Not only do we have a body with so many parts and a soul with so many organs, we have another part of our being, a deeper part, our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The wisest man is the man who lives in his spirit.</S>
