   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIKE-SOULED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although Paul had a number of co-workers, only of Timothy could he say that he was like-souled.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning the churches, only Timothy had the same soul as Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I treasure the expression like-souled used by Paul in 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This short phrase opens a window through which we can see the secret for us to experience Christ in a way which issues in a true concern for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I hope that we all will come to know this precious secret.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because Paul and Timothy were like-souled, they could experience Christ to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, if we experience Christ only in our spirit and are not one in soul with others who love the Lord and are seeking Him, our experience of Christ will be limited.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those co-workers who were not like-souled with Paul could experience Christ, but not to the extent to which Paul and Timothy experienced Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was shocked when I first read that apart from Timothy Paul had no one like-souled who would genuinely care for the things concerning the saints in Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Were there not others who also had a genuine concern for the churches?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yes, there were, but their concern was not the same in soul as Paul s concern.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sooner or later, we shall all be tested whether or not we are one in soul with the leading ones and with those who have more experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you are not like-souled with the leading ones and experienced ones, those with a true knowledge of the situation in the church life, you will be hindered from going on in the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if you are one in soul with these saints, you will be protected, and you will not have any problems in experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>RISKING OUR SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 2:25 Paul speaks of Epaphroditus, referring to him as my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul also tells the Philippian believers that Epaphroditus was their apostle, one sent with a commission, and a priestly minister to his need.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A priestly minister is one whose ministry is like that of a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All New Testament believers are priests to God 1 Pet 2:9; Rev 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, our ministry to the Lord, in whatever aspect, is a priestly ministry, a priestly service Phil 2:17, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 2:30 Paul points out a striking feature of Epaphroditus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here Paul tells us that for the work of Christ Epaphroditus drew near even unto death, risking his life, that he might fill up your lack of service toward me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Greek word rendered risking means venturing, recklessly exposing one s life, like a gambler throwing down a stake.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Greek word for life in verse 30 is psuche, the word for soul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, to say that Epaphroditus risked his life means that he risked his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Epaphroditus was one who was willing to sacrifice his soul for the churches and the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This sacrifice of soul is revealed clearly by the Lord Jesus in John 10:11, where He says concerning Himself that, as the good Shepherd, He was ready to lay down His soul-life so that we could receive His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Philippians 2:19-30 we see two crucial points concerning the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, we need to be one in soul; second, we need to be willing to sacrifice or risk our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Both are necessary if we are to have a genuine concern for the churches with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Timothy was a like-souled person, and Epaphroditus was a soul-risking person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We also should be those who are one in soul and who are willing to risk our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should be ready to sacrifice our mind, will, and emotion to be one with our dear co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is especially important for the elders and leading ones to be like-souled and to risk their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead of loving your soul, learn to risk it, to sacrifice it, and to pay the price for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the elders do not have this kind of soul, they are not adequate to take the lead in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we love the Lord and the church, we should first experience the Lord in our spirit and then be like-souled in the experience of Christ for the concern of the church and also ready and willing to sacrifice our soul for the sake of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Lord s recovery today we need saints who seek the Lord and enjoy Him in their spirit and who also are willing to have a genuine concern for the churches by being like-souled and by risking their soul life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are one in soul as well as in spirit, our experience of Christ will reach the peak.</S>
