 <h2 class="head1">ENDEAVORING TO PRACTICE THE SCRIPTURAL WAY<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Now we are endeavoring, and we are desperate because we are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We have the riches, yet where are the people? What is the way for us to get people? Christianity has their own way, but we do not believe that is the best. By going forth to visit people, knocking on their doors, we have the assurance we can get some people. After you knock on twenty doors, you will get one. If each of us goes out to visit people with the gospel four times a year, we can gain enough new ones for us to labor on year round. After a whole year, you may still have one or two that remain. In one year, we can all gain at least one new one as remaining fruit. In this way the churches can double year after year.</p>
<p>We feel that we have found a scientific and definite way to keep people as remaining fruit. The way to keep people is to take care of our meeting, and the best way to take care of our meeting is by speaking. The Christian meeting is a matter of speaking. In the meetings of Christianity, there is only &ldquo;one-way speaking&rdquo;; there is no two-way traffic. Now we do not only have two-way traffic, but we also have multiplied ways of mutual speaking to one another.</p>
<p>We need to be trained to speak. We have been meeting for years and years according to a traditional and natural way. This kind of meeting is what we have seen and what we are accustomed to. But we would drop that way and come back to the biblical way. We do not have the habit of speaking, so we may not have much ability either. This is why we need to endeavor desperately to build up another habit. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, there should not be anything old or natural. Everything should be recovered according to the standard of the Bible.</p>
<p>I am so grateful to the Lord for the Bible. Suppose today that we did not have the Bible on this earth; in what kind of age would we be living? We would not know where to go. But thank the Lord we do have the Bible as our standard, and we know where to go. Thank the Lord that some of the saints among us have been laboring on the Word year after year; we have a history of studying the Word for over sixty years and we have reaped a lot of riches. We have put many of these riches into print. Although we have these riches, we do not have the adequate increase. Our number is too small. Thousands and thousands of people have never heard the gospel or the truths we have seen. I will never leave the central lane of Christ and the church, but I am not satisfied with the present situation. We should not take any excuse. We must learn to repudiate our present practice because it did not bring in the results. We have to repudiate it with the new way, and we have a book, the Bible, to show us the way. The only thing that is needed is our sincerity in practice. We should have a heart to practice the new way.</p>
<p>It is altogether worthwhile for us to endeavor to get into the new and scriptural way of meeting and serving, especially for those of us who have been in the recovery for a number of years. Even though I am an elderly brother, I am still learning. All of us can learn much more. The Spanish-speaking saints have to improve their way of speaking so that they may build up the Christian meetings according to the holy Word, making them fresh, living, refreshing, and releasing so that they will attract people to come. We will gain people, and we will have a way to keep them and build them up. Then there will be the possibility for the Lord to build up His Body as an organism for the real expression of the Triune God. Today on this earth, we can see &ldquo;churches,&rdquo; but we cannot see a living Body as an organism of the Triune God. There is not such a thing on this earth yet. There are millions of Christians, but where is this organism? Where is the Body of Christ built? For this we must endeavor.</p>
<p>Our present situation forced us to come back to the holy Word to find out something concerning the Lord&rsquo;s way. I believe the Lord has shown us His way to gain people and to build up His Body. Whether or not this will work depends upon how much we will endeavor, how much we will labor, how much we will really offer ourselves to the Lord&rsquo;s new way. If there is a will, there is a way. I would especially encourage all of us to practice speaking the hymns. A group of six to ten saints can gather together and practice speaking the hymns. In addition to speaking these poems in our meetings, we also need to speak teachings, revelations (1 Cor. 14:26), the gospel (Acts 5:42), and personal testimonies (cf. Acts 15:12). We need to learn how to speak in all these ways in our meetings that they may be enriched, living, and attractive.</p>
