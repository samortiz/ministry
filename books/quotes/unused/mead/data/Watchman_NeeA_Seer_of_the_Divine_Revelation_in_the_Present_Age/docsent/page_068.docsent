   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Few Spiritual Sayings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Watchman Nee once said, "The lower we put something, the safer it is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is safest to put a cup on the floor."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The implication was that the more the workers of the Lord humble themselves, the safer it is for them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On another occasion he said, "When the cross is not 'air-sealed,' it will be blown away."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that when you are bearing the cross you should not tell the secret to others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As soon as you tell what you are passing through, the meaning of the cross is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Another of his sayings went like this: "Some who fall, fall on the upper floor, while some who stand, stand on the ground floor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who stand on the ground floor should not laugh at those who fall on the upper floor."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning admonishing someone, Brother Nee said, "There can be two results: 1 The person you admonish is restored, or 2 He is hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The way to tell whether your admonition was accurate or not is to observe the person you admonished.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If by rejecting your admonition, such a one ends up in darkness, it proves your admonition was correct.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if after such a one rejects your fellowship, he still continues to have fellowship with the Lord, it proves your admonition was wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One time he said to me, "If some beggars are sleeping under the eaves and you wake them up, treat them with won ton and then preach the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Surely you will touch the anointing within."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After coming to Taiwan, I met Watchman Nee's nephew, Soo-fu.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He told me that when he was young he saw his uncle meet a group of coolies squatting around gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Watchman Nee also squatted beside them, talking and laughing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To all he really became all in order to gain some.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His Living</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From observing Watchman Nee's way of life, I feel that he learned how to abound and how to be abased and that everywhere and in every way he learned the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he first came to Chungking, he lived in a small apartment with only a bed and a table.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When one went to visit him, the wooden stairs would sway and make creaking noises.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later, when he moved into his own factory buildings, it made no difference; his attitude was the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Concerning eating, he sometimes ate only bread and water, and at other times he enjoyed an abundant love feast.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To all such matters regarding his living he seemed indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
