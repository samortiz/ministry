Lord, You have created for us a human spirit, and in Your organic salvation the first thing You do is to regenerate our spirit. Eventually, Lord, You put Yourself as such a Spirit in our spirit and mingled with our spirit to make us one spirit. Oh, he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit! We can never forget all this. We worship You for this. Impress us and always remind us of our being one spirit with You. Do we live in our spirit with Your Spirit? Do we move in our spirit with Your Spirit? Lord, do we fellowship with You in our spirit with Your Spirit? Lord, remind us all the time. Lord, speak to us that we may receive further visions. Amen.<p>In this message we do not want to merely repeat the items of God&#8217;s organic salvation. Instead, we want to see that the key of God&#8217;s organic salvation is the Spirit Himself with our spirit. We should not forget that there is such a marvelous phrase in the Bible in Romans 8:16. Even after we enter into the New Jerusalem, I would like to see a banner there saying-&#8220;The Spirit Himself with our spirit.&#8221; The Spirit Himself with our spirit is doing one thing: witnessing that we are the children of God. Just to say the people of God is not too critical, but to say the children of God is so great.<p>The Spirit Himself is the witnessing One, and this Spirit is the Spirit of life, the Spirit who gives life, the Spirit who is the Spirit of Christ. This Spirit is also the pneumatic Christ and the indwelling Spirit. Our spirit was created by God but became dead through the fall. But later it was regenerated by God. Not only so, after regeneration the regenerating Spirit remains in our regenerated spirit and mingles Himself with our spirit to make the two one. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#8221;<p>Not only are we God-men but also we are one with God, one spirit with God. The human spirit and the divine Spirit are not only joined and mingled but are also one spirit. The Spirit is life and the One who gives life. God is the Spirit and in His marvelous organic salvation, He has made us one spirit with Him. This is just a simple word in 1 Corinthians 6:17, but I never saw this truth until after I had studied the Bible for at least thirty years. One day I realized that I am one spirit with God. This is not a small thing. Regretfully, even in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, many of the elders and even the co-workers do not know their real status. Our real status is that we are one spirit with God. We have been saved to such a high level. What God is, we are.<p>When we realize our status, this will affect our living. When I speak with others in a joking way, I am inwardly rebuked for being so loose and light with no gravity. I am reminded about my status, and I have to confess to the Lord. Due to my divine status, I dare not be loose or light. I dare not joke. Even with my grandchildren I dare not speak lightly, because I am not merely their grandfather. I am a grandfather who has the same status as God.<p>According to 1 Corinthians 6:17 God&#8217;s intention in His organic salvation is to join the believer&#8217;s spirit with His Spirit as one spirit-a mingled spirit. Eventually, this is not just the mingled spirit but a spirit that is one spirit with God, that is the same as God in His life and nature but not in His Godhead. This is the key to open the eight sections of the organic salvation of God. If we do not have this key, the door is closed. When we have this key, the door is open and we can see all things concealed within.<h2 class=head1>I. TO OPEN THE FIRST SECTION OF REGENERATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Spirit of Reality Coming to Convict the Sinners</h2><p>The Spirit of reality came to convict the sinners concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment (John 16:8-11). Sin is related to Adam. Adam is the source of sin. Righteousness is related to Christ. Christ is our righteousness. The judgment must be Satan&#8217;s judgment. Here are Adam, the source of sin; Christ, the source of righteousness; and Satan, the one who should bear the judgment. In the whole universe God&#8217;s blame is not to anyone else but to him. The whole universe today is full of rebellion due to one archangel who is Satan, so judgment has to be his. Sin came from Adam, righteousness is given from Christ, and judgment goes to Satan. The Spirit of reality came to convict us of this, causing us to repent of our fallen condition and enter into the death and burial of Christ (Matt. 3:2, 5-6). This conviction brought us to the death and resurrection of Christ to receive Him and be regenerated.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
