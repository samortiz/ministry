   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATTHEW CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are seven sections in verses 1-13: 1 ten virgins going to meet the bridegroom v. 1 ; 2 two kinds of virgins vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2-4 ; 3 their history or experience vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>5-7 ; 4 the discovery of the lack vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>8-9 ; 5 the separation v. 10 ; 6 the pleading of the foolish ones vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>11-12 ; and 7 the lesson v. 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 1: "At that time the kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"At that time" refers to the time of the parousia the rapture .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The kingdom of the heavens is not synonymous with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The term "church" was used in Paul's time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the term is qualified by the name of a locality, such as "the church in Laodicea," it refers to a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When there is no qualifier, it refers to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church speaks of God's grace, while the kingdom of the heavens speaks of God's righteousness; it speaks of the scope of God's reign.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since the "virgins" refer to the Christians and the "bridegroom" refers to the Lord, why is there no bride?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is because the bride of Revelation 21 is the New Jerusalem, which includes Jesus and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here we have only the church; hence, it can be called only a virgin and not the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The number ten in the Scriptures alludes to the major four complete numbers in the Scriptures: three God's completion , seven a temporary completion , ten man's completion , and twelve eternal completion .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Revelation 21 everything is of the number twelve: the gates, the pearls, the names of the apostles, the tribes of Israel, the precious stones, and the height of one hundred and forty-four cubits twelve times twelve .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Prior to this, seven was the number of completion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Beginning with the new heaven and the new earth in chapter twenty-one, the number twelve is used throughout.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Three is God's number, and four is man's number.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Seven equals three plus four God's number plus man's number.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The number seven can be split up; therefore, it signifies a temporary completeness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Twelve equals three times four God's number times man's number.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It cannot be split up, and therefore signifies eternal completion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Ten is only a little less than the number for eternal completion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When two is added to ten, the sum is twelve, signifying eternal completion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The two grinding at the mill in chapter twenty-four represent the believers who are alive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The ten virgins in chapter twenty-five represent the believers who are dead, that is, those who have "slept."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Greek and Hebrew languages, twelve is spoken as two plus ten.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Twelve is the base number and two is the remainder.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Genesis 42:3 and 4 there are ten older brothers and two younger brothers; in Numbers 14:37-38 ten spies were with Joshua and Caleb; in 1 Kings 11:29-31 the prophet rent the garment into twelve pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The twelve pieces were divided into ten pieces and two pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, as ten is the major part of the whole, the dead believers occupy a major part of all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Matthew 20:24, ten disciples argued with the two.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have other proofs: Genesis 24:10; Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>6:27; Ruth 4:2; Luke 19:13.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The beast has ten horns; the revived Roman Empire is divided into ten parts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As in all parables, the virgins here cannot be regarded as literal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The virgins are we who have been regenerated by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The term virgin does not refer to chastity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even a married woman can be chaste.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A virgin is a girl who is not yet married, one who is hidden away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, virgin cannot refer to the Jews or the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only Christians can bear this title.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The virgins' only goal is to take their lamps to meet the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The lamp in the Bible has many meanings: 1 the word of Jehovah Psa 119:105 ; 2 prophecy 2 Pet 1:19 ; or 3 Christian behavior Matt 5:14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The word used here is not "candle."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A candle burns its own oil, but the oil of a lamp comes from outside.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The behavior of a Christian should be a proclamation to all of the coming of the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The reason that we preach the gospel is that the Lord is coming soon.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In breaking the bread we: 1 remember the Lord's work and 2 remember the Lord's soon return.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verses 2-4:"And five of them were foolish and five were prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them; but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There are two kinds of virgins in verses 2-4.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many Bible expositors consider the five foolish virgins to be unsaved persons, but there are a few dozen sure proofs that will refute such suppositions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We will list only fifteen major reasons to prove that these are saved ones:</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>1 They were all virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To the very end they were called virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord never questioned this point; He recognized this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>2 There was light in their lamps v. 8 . This light lasted through half the night, proving that it was of the Holy Spirit which issued forth in good works that glorified God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In verse 8, "are going out" indicates that there was still some light that had not yet died out.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>3 They all went forth to meet the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>An unsaved one surely will not welcome the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Would bandits light lamps to meet the army?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>4 "But at midnight there was a cry,...Go forth to meet him!"</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The archangel will not make any mistake in calling the ten; neither will the Lord call them by the wrong names.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>5 Having oil in their lamps but not in their vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Oil refers to the Holy Spirit; hence, the foolish virgins must be saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>6 All the virgins arose.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Verse 7 refers to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The saved ones and the unsaved ones are not resurrected together.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They are resurrected one thousand years apart.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>7 The five prudent virgins went in with Him v. 10 . They were caught up into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The five foolish virgins followed afterward, being caught up together in the air also.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The only difference is that the five foolish virgins could not partake of the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>8 The ten virgins differ only in behavior but not in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is no distinction of true and false ones, only a distinction of prudent and foolish ones.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Foolish does not mean unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>9 Their lamps were going out because of the tarrying of the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If He had not tarried, they would have been qualified to be caught up together with the prudent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>10 They were still virgins in verse 11.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When they came they had already bought oil and brought it with them.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>11 The word "buy" in Matthew 25:9 cannot be used to speak of unsaved persons; only the word "ask" could have been used, because grace is free.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Only the saved ones can buy, that is, pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>12 Suppose the five foolish virgins were not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This would indicate that dead people can still be saved, because the prudent ones advised them to go and buy oil.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>13 Suppose the five foolish virgins were not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The five prudent virgins would not then say, "Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you"; they would not have turned them down.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If the five foolish ones were not saved, the five prudent ones would have been willing to pay any price for them.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>How could they not save those who are dying?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>14 The Lord said, "Watch therefore."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Those who can watch, as in verse 13, must have life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If the five foolish ones are unsaved, they cannot be told to watch; rather, they can be told only to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>15 Compare Matthew 25 to the gospel feast in Matthew 22.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>There we have a lost one at the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Here the words are spoken to the disciples, that is, the saved ones only.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Chapter twenty-two deals with the problem of salvation and perdition, but chapter twenty-five has nothing to do with salvation or perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In chapter twenty-two the lost one is bound and cannot do anything, whereas in chapter twenty-five they are still free and can do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Chapter twenty-two is concerned with the king's gain or loss, while chapter twenty-five is concerned with the virgins' gain or loss.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Salvation is a glory to the King, but the kingdom of the heavens is a gain for the prudent virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Today, when they expound the Bible, believers speak only of the problem of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>They do not know that after salvation there is still the problem of the kingdom.</S>
