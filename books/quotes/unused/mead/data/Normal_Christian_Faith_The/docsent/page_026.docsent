   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR GOD BECOMING MAN 2 THE BIRTH OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If God is to be a man, He must come into the world in a way that is very different from all other mortals.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We come into the world through our parents and are conceived by our mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To ascertain whether Jesus of Nazareth is an ordinary person or the incarnated God, we need to examine His birth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If His birth was no different from ours, we have to conclude that He is nothing but a man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not only does He have to pass the first qualification, but He needs to pass the second one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not hastily believe in a person simply because he claims to be God; we have to test him by our second criterion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If he is indeed God, he must be born in an extraordinary manner.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we study the birth of Jesus, we will find that it was very different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was born of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke in the New Testament tell us this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jesus was born of a virgin, Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>BORN OF A VIRGIN</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before we go on, we have to realize that there are two ways to know God: by natural speculation or by revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to natural speculation, one meditates and conjectures about God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In revelation, God speaks to man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We want to look at the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We want to know what God says.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Gospels of Matthew and Luke show us that Jesus was born of a virgin, Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This important fact enables us to conclude that He is no ordinary person, and it justifies our being a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The natural mentality cannot readily accept this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some years ago, a big debate was conducted in England.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On one side were prominent leaders of modernistic schools of theology.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the other side was a famous Presbyterian pastor-theologian.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Four major topics were raised.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Twice a day, for four consecutive days, each side took turns delivering a long speech for a total of eight messages.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One of the topics was related to our subject the virgin birth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The modernistic theologians asserted that one reason alone was enough to disprove the virgin birth the event was biologically impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the law of biology, it is impossible to have the virgin birth.</S>
