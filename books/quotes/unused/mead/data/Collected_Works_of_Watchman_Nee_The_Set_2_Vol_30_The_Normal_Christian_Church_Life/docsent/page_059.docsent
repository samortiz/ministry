   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There is only one verse in the New Testament which speaks of the importance of Christians meeting together; it is Hebrews 10:25: "Not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more as you see the day drawing near."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This verse shows that the object of such assembling is to exhort "one another."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is obviously not an apostolic meeting, for it is not a case of one man exhorting the entire assembly, but all the members bearing equal responsibility to exhort one another.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A church meeting has the stamp of "one another" upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are several purposes for which the church meets, as recorded in Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, for prayer Acts 2:42; 4:24, 31; 12:5 ; second, for reading Col 4:16; 1 Thes 5:27; Acts 2:42; 15:21, 30-31 ; third, for the breaking of bread which are not meetings presided over by a single individual who bears all responsibility, since reference is made to "the cup of blessing which we bless...the bread which we break" 1 Cor 10:16-17; Acts 2:42; 20:7 ; and fourth, for the exercise of spiritual gifts 1 Cor 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The last type of meeting is a church meeting, for the phrase "in the church" is used repeatedly in the passage which describes it vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>28, 34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of this meeting it is said that all may prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How different from one man preaching and all the others sitting quietly in the pew listening to his sermon!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That meeting has no place among the different gatherings of the church, for its nature makes it evident that it is an apostolic meeting, and being an apostolic meeting, it belongs to the sphere of the work, not of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Meetings where activity is one-sided do not come within the scope of the church, for they lack the distinctive feature of all church gatherings; and where any attempt is made to fit them into the church program, much trouble is sure to result.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today, alas! this style of meeting is the chief feature of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No meeting is attended with such regularity as this one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Who is considered a really good Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Is it not one who comes to church fifty-two Sunday mornings in the year to hear the minister preach?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this is passivity, and it heralds death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even he who has attended "church" fifty-two Sundays in the year has not really been once to a church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He has only gone to a meeting in connection with the work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do not imply that we should never have this kind of meeting, but the point is that such a meeting is part of the work and is not part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you have a worker in the locality, then you may have this type of meeting, not otherwise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The local church, as a church, has no such meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Where they are found in connection with a church, we must discourage them and help believers to see that church meetings are conducted by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If apostolic meetings take the place of church meetings, then the church members become passive and indolent, always expecting to be helped, instead of seeking, in dependence upon the Spirit, to be helpful to the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is contrary to the New Testament principles of mutual help and mutual edification.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The reason the churches in China are still so weak, after a hundred years of Christian missions, is that God's servants have introduced into the local churches a type of meeting that really belongs to the work, and the church members have naturally concluded that if they attend such services and just passively receive all that is taught them there, they have performed the chief part of their Christian duty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Individual responsibility has been lost sight of, and passivity has hindered the development of spiritual life throughout the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Further, to maintain the Sunday morning preaching, you must have a good preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, a worker is not only needed to manage church affairs, but also to maintain the meetings for spiritual uplift.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is only natural, if a good address is to be delivered every Sunday, that the churches hope for someone who is better qualified to preach than recently converted local brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How could they be expected to produce a good sermon once a week?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And who could be expected to preach better than a specially called servant of God?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So an apostle settles down to pastor the church, and consequently the churches and the work both lose their distinctive features.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The result is serious loss in both directions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, the brethren become lazy and selfish because their thought is only centered on themselves and the help they can receive, and on the other hand, unevangelized territories are left without workers because apostles have settled down to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For lack of activity the spiritual growth of the churches is arrested, and for lack of apostles the extension of the work is arrested too.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since so much havoc has been wrought by introducing a feature of the work into the churches, and thus robbing both of their true nature, we must differentiate clearly between meetings that belong specifically to the work and those that belong specifically to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When God blesses our efforts in any place to the salvation of souls, we must see to it that the saved ones understand, from the outset, that the meetings which resulted in their salvation belong to the work and not to the church, and that they are the church and must therefore have their own church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They must meet in their homes or in other places to pray, study the Word, break bread, and exercise their spiritual gifts; and in such meetings their object must be mutual helpfulness and mutual edification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Each individual must bear his share of responsibility and pass on to the others what he himself has received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The conduct of the meetings should be the burden of no one individual, but all the members should bear the burden together, and they should seek to help one another depending upon the teaching and leading of the Spirit, and depending upon His empowering too.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As soon as believers are saved, they should begin to assemble themselves regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such gatherings of local believers are true church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Meetings connected with the work are only a temporary institution unless the object is to maintain a special testimony in a special place .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the assembling of the believers for fellowship and mutual encouragement is something permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even should the believers be very immature, and their meetings seem quite childish, they must learn to content themselves with what help they receive from one another and must not always hope to be able to sit down and listen to a good sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They should seek revelation, spiritual gifts, and utterance from God; and if their need casts them upon Him, it will result in the enrichment of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Meetings of recently saved believers will naturally bear the stamp of immaturity at the beginning, but for the worker to take over the responsibility of such meetings will stunt their growth, not foster it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is the condition of the church meetings, not of the meetings connected with the work, that indicates the spiritual state of a church in any locality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When an apostle is preaching a grand sermon, and all the believers are nodding assent and adding their frequent and fervent "Amens," how deeply spiritual the congregation seems!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But it is when they meet by themselves that their true spiritual state comes to light.</S>
