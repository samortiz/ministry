What a joy this is to us! Paul told the Corinthians that the Lord died in order that we who live would no longer live to ourselves but to Him who died and was raised for us (2 Cor. 5:15). If the Lord died and resurrected for us but did not give us a chance to live for Him, it would indeed be a suffering and a pain to live the Christian life.</p><p>Once I was moving my home. I was the only person doing the work and could not move the heavy furniture. Two brothers came to my rescue and helped me move. When they were finished, they were all covered with dirt. I asked whether they were hungry and thirsty. They said no and returned home immediately. That night I did not sleep well. I thought of the two brothers who helped me move. They were covered with sweat and dirt and returned home late at night. Yet I did not repay them anything. I felt bad, and the whole night I could not rest my head or sleep well. The Lord has accomplished a great redemption for us. His work is many times greater than moving a house. If we asked the Lord, "What do You want me to do?", He could answer, "Everything is done. You do not have to do anything." If He said this, we would feel terrible. I often have felt that it is a great grace of the Lord that we are redeemed. It is also a great grace to be allowed to consecrate ourselves to Him. If a man receives the matchless grace of the Lord's redemption yet has no intention of living for Him, either he is not saved at all or he must not have a clear idea about his salvation and the greatness of God's grace.</p><p>If a Christian does not serve the Lord, he will feel that he owes the Lord something. He will feel queasy. Even though the Lord has everything and even though the cattle and sheep on a thousand hills are His, He wants our consecration. Man is created by God. All men belong to Him, but He wants our consecration. We often think that if God commissioned the angels to preach the gospel, they would probably do a better job than us. Their emotions are not finicky as ours are. We preach according to our feelings. The angels could preach eight hours a day without being affected by their emotions. They would also preach better. Our preaching is flawed, but the angels would not have this problem. Yet if the angels were given the responsibility of preaching the gospel, they could only preach about a sinless Savior; they could only preach a sinless salvation. However, we can speak as sinners saved by the Lord from our sins. Our preaching is so much richer than the preaching of the angels. For the same reason God also sees our consecration as being so much richer. We all love money, but if we see how much the Lord has done for us, we will gladly offer up everything for Him. I hope all the brothers and sisters will see that it is a great grace to be allowed to serve Him. It is also our greatest joy and peace. I hope all the brothers and sisters will strive to enter into this supreme peace and joy. If our consecration falls short of giving our all and if our standard is anything less than absolute, we will know the difference; the difference will be great, and the gap will be wide.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_070.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_072.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 71</div><br></body></html>
