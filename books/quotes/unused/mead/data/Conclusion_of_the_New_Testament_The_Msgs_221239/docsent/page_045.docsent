   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the Old Testament God first gained a people through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eventually, that people became the nation of Israel, which was called a kingdom of priests Exo 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That people, that nation, was a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Acts 7:38 Stephen even refers to the people of Israel as "the assembly in the wilderness," using the word ekklesia, the word for "church" in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a further indication that the children of Israel are a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The entire history of the nation of Israel is a full type, an all-inclusive type, of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The nation of Israel began with the exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The children of Israel were in slavery in Egypt, but through the lamb of the Passover they were redeemed out from Pharaoh's usurpation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They made their exodus from Egypt, crossed the Red Sea, entered the wilderness, and came to Mount Sinai, and there they built the tabernacle as God's dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, the people of Israel crossed the Jordan and entered into Canaan, the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After conquering the people and gaining the land, they built the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The time immediately after the building of the temple was a golden time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, that golden time did not last very long.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Mainly due to the failure of Solomon, the temple was destroyed, and the children of Israel were taken to Babylon as captives.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Babylonian army not only destroyed Jerusalem with its temple but also brought the utensils of the temple to Babylon and put them into idol temples.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What a shame!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The people of Israel remained in Babylon for seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Spiritually speaking, the church, due to its degradation, has been in captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's people have been divided, scattered, and carried away from the proper ground of unity to a wrong ground.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Old Testament type, the children of Israel were centered around Jerusalem, but later they were scattered and carried away to many places, in particular, to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This portrays the situation among many of today's Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a very real sense, the believers today are more scattered than the children of Israel were.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we need to be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need not only revival but also recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From Babylon the Capturing and Divisive Ground</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As typified by the latter part of the history of the children of Israel, the recovery is from Babylon the capturing and divisive ground Ezra 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For the children of Israel to be recovered meant for them to be brought back to Jerusalem from Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Negatively, to be recovered means to be brought out of Babylon; positively, it means to be brought up to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the Scriptures reveal that some of the people of Israel were taken captive to Syria and others to Egypt, the majority of them were taken captive to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Babylon was the main place of their captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, in type the meaning of Jerusalem is the ground of unity, and the meaning of Babylon is division, scattering, and captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be recovered out of Babylon is to be recovered out of division, and to be recovered to Jerusalem means to be recovered back to the original ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Old Testament, the temple was destroyed, and all its vessels were carried away to Babylon and placed in the temple of Nebuchadnezzar's idols.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This signifies that at a certain time the entire church was destroyed by the "Babylonians," who carried away the contents of the temple to Babylon and placed them in the temple of their idols.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At a certain time in church history, Babylonianism came into the church, destroyed it, and carried away its contents.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you study church history, you will see that this was truly the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, in Revelation 17 the apostate church is called Babylon the Great, the great prostitute.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In its degradation the church was captured and held in the captivity of Babylon the Great.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Revelation 18 Babylon refers to the city of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In a figure of speech, John, the writer of Revelation, called Rome "Babylon the Great."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, the organized church under the pope was called the Roman Church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This Roman Church in Revelation 17 is given by the Lord the title "Babylon the Great, The Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth" Rev 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This expression corresponds to the use of the word Babylon in Old Testament times.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In those times God's people were carried away to Babylon and kept in captivity there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the New Testament, with the fulfillment of the type, the principle is the same: the church, God's chosen people, eventually were held in the captivity of Babylon the Great.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament God's people were held captive in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we see this, we shall have a clear view, an overall view, concerning the degradation of the church and the recovery of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The captivity of the children of Israel was due to their degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because of their degradation, they were carried away to captivity in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church also became degraded and eventually was brought into captivity by Babylon the great, Christendom, which is a prostitute in the eyes of the holy God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The recovery of the church, therefore, involves a return from the capturing and divisive ground signified by Babylon.</S>
