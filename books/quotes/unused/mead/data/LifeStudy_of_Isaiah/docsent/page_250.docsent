   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE FORTY-NINE THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REVEALED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Isa 52:13 53:12; Acts 2:33a; 5:31a; Matt 13:54-57; 8:17; 1 Pet 2:24; Acts 8:32; Matt 26:63-64; 27:12, 14; Acts 8:33; Matt 27:26b; John 19:38-42; Acts 13:39; Eph 4:8-12; Luke 23:32, 34a</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to Isaiah 53, a chapter that is very familiar to many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The last three verses of chapter fifty-two, verses 13-15, and the first verse of chapter fifty-three should be put together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This portion of Isaiah's record is very difficult for people to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a portion was included in the holy Word because people's knowledge concerning Christ differs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Generally speaking, people either do not know Christ, or they know Christ in a natural way as some kind of great person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This kind of knowledge can be found in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are a number of Old Testament verses that speak concerning the different aspects of Christ's greatness, such as His majesty, His authority, and His power.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the previous message we mentioned three items in Isaiah 51 and 52 concerning the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first item is to know Christ as the arm of Jehovah, which refers to the strength, the might, and the power of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then, the second item is to know Christ as the reigning God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Surely these two are items of Christ's greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the end of Isaiah 52, verse 13 says, "Behold, My Servant will act wisely and will prosper; / He will be exalted and lifted up and very high."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may think that this refers to Christ's acting wisely to do great things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if we enter into this portion of the Word, we will realize that this is not the meaning here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First Corinthians 1:22-24 says, "For indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, in 1 Corinthians wisdom refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the wisdom mentioned here does not refer to the wisdom exercised in creating the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the context, the wisdom and power in 1 Corinthians 1:22-24 both refer to Christ as the deep things of God, that is, the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First Corinthians 2:10-11 says that only the Spirit of God can search the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The depths of God are the deeper items of Christ.</S>
