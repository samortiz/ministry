   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX LIVING IN THE NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS THE ULTIMATE ISSUE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE BOOK OF GALATIANS Scripture Reading: Gal 6:1, 7-8, 12-18; 2 Cor 5:17; Eph 2:15; 4:24; Col 3:10-11 AN OVERVIEW OF THE BOOK OF GALATIANS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Galatians 1 tells us how religion with its traditions is versus Christ and the church vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3-4, 13-14, 15a, 16a , and chapter 2 tells us that the law with its ordinances is in opposition to Christ as our life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>11-13, 19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapter 3 speaks concerning the flesh and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Having begun by the Spirit, we should not try to be perfected by the flesh vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, we must remain in the Spirit and deny the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moreover, the promise of the Spirit, which we have received, is the blessing of Abraham through the gospel that was preached to him by God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>8, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Following this, chapter 4 reveals that the flesh working together with the law produces children according to the flesh, and the Spirit working through grace produces children according to the Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>21-31 , who are sons of God and heirs through God, inheriting all the riches of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>4-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to be sons of God and heirs of God s riches, we need Christ revealed in us, Christ living in us, Christ put upon us, and Christ formed in us v. 19 . Christ, who is the Son of God, is being formed in us to make us sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In principle, this means that we become the same as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In ourselves we could never be the sons of God; we can only be the sons of the devil John 8:44; 1 John 3:8, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order for us to be the sons of God, we need to have Christ formed in our inner being to make us the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A genuine believer is a son of God, but he may not always bear the image of a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is because even though he has Christ revealed in him, living in him, and put upon him, he may not have Christ adequately formed in his entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this reason, Paul says to the Galatians, My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul s intent was that the Galatians would fully become Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only in this way could they be sons of God in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may illustrate this by a young man who is the son of a king and the successor to the royal throne.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The young man may not yet appear to be a proper heir of the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that the kingship still needs to grow and be formed within him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then one day, before he even ascends to the throne, everyone will be able to testify that he is already a king.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many in Christianity hold the teaching that every saved believer will enter into the coming millennium to be the kings in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if many were to be given the kingship outwardly, they would not have the inner growth, measure, or stature of a king.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need Christ to be formed in us until we are the same as He is in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Galatians 1 through 4 tells us that we need Christ revealed in us, Christ living in us, Christ put upon us, and Christ formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After this, chapter 5 speaks concerning our need to walk by the Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>16, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ today is the all-inclusive One dwelling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is one with our spirit, and we are one with Him as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we need to walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then chapter 6 tells us that as we walk by the Spirit, we need to restore a fallen brother in a spirit of meekness v. 1 . This is one example of our Christian service.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In our service to the Lord, we must do everything in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such a Christian life is a sowing life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whatever we do, whatever we say, and wherever we go is a sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we sow unto the Spirit and not to the flesh, we will of the Spirit reap eternal life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then Paul concludes this Epistle by telling people that he has nothing to do with the religious world and that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision are anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, what we need is the new creation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we walk by the Spirit and enjoy the riches of Christ in our spirit, we will spontaneously be a part of the new creation, which is the new man, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In verse 17 Paul says, Henceforth let no one trouble me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul did not want to be troubled with the Judaistic religion, circumcision, the keeping of the Sabbath, or any such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then he continues, I bear in my body the brands of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the ancient times, when a man was sold as a slave, the buyer marked him with a brand to indicate his ownership over him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For Paul to bear the brands of Jesus indicated that he was the slave of Christ Jesus Rom 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>From the first day that Jesus appeared to Paul, He branded him with the hot iron of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As a slave of Jesus, purchased by Him, Paul no longer cared for the things of the Judaistic religion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Finally, Paul closes Galatians by saying, The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Amen 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At this point there is no religion, tradition, laws, ordinances, or the flesh; there is only Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit living in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now we must walk and live in this spirit and sow unto the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then we will reap eternal life, the totality of which is the new creation, the new man, the church.</S>
