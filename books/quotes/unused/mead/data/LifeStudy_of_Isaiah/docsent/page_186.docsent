   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the restoration of life, the calf, the young lamb, and the fatling will be together, and a young boy will lead them about v. 6b .

Isaiah 11:9 says, "They will not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea."
