   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The problem today is that we cannot keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The law of God requires that we be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are not righteous, then we fail.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only by being righteous can we live.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But no man of the flesh is able to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>None among us can have righteousness before God through keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once man touches God's law, he will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul said in Romans 7:7 that even if God has only one law, man is not able to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul did not transgress all the laws.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He mentioned only one law, the one concerning covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the original language, covetousness is lust.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul said, "I am helpless.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The lust keeps coming back again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is impossible for me not to have lust."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He could not get the light of his bicycle to work, yet he had to travel in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For some, the problem is not that the light does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For them, they simply do not want to have the light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These people do not even want to light the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is annulling the law?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is when someone pleads with God saying, "O God, I cannot keep Your law today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please let me go on account of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have done my best.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Please do not punish me."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All who plead for the Lord Jesus to be lenient or for God to have mercy on them are annulling the law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, they do not want to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, they do not want the punishment of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They do not want to have a light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet at the same time, they want to avoid the fine of sixty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What about us today?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do we have our lights today?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we have the lights, then we can travel peacefully in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But none of us are able to have the light.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the only way is to pay the sixty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is what the Lord Jesus has done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the judgment that we have borne in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to say, "Praise and thank the Lord that we are already judged in Christ!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have been punished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has punished us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since the Lord Jesus has died, resurrected, and ascended, the salvation we receive now is equivalent to what we would obtain if we keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The ones who have the light are free.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The ones who have been punished are also free.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today if a man keeps all the laws, he will be justified and will be saved in the same way that we who have believed in Jesus are saved and justified.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Of course, we are not just saved when we believe in Jesus; in saving us, the Lord Jesus grants us many other things apart from the law as well.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul said in Romans 3:31, "Do we then make the law of no effect through faith?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, we establish the law."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, when we are saved through faith in Jesus, we have not made the law of no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since we have met the requirement of the law in us, the law has nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Never think that we should add the work of the law to our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For us to believe is like paying the sixty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For us to keep the law is like having the light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one in the whole world would have the light and pay sixty cents at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is unreasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why does one have to pay sixty cents and at the same time have the light?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If he is able to have the light, then he does not have to pay the sixty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If there is the word of faith, then there cannot be the law.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If there is the law, there cannot be the word of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No one can have faith and keep the law at the same time, for to do so would be to despise the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It would mean that one fails to see his utter weakness and filthiness.</S>
