<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS AND CO-WORKERS NEEDING TO SEE<br />
THE VISION OF CHRIST BEING IN US</h2>
<p>The elders and co-workers must have experiences of life, live in the spirit, and be able to supply life to others. Hence, the elders and the co-workers need a basic understanding of Christ being the life-giving Spirit in the believers. Second Corinthians 3:6 says, &ldquo;The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life,&rdquo; and verse 17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; First Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; Christians love the Gospel of John, but they neglect what the Lord Jesus said in chapter 14: &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter...even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you...In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (vv. 16-17, 20). Christ in us is the mystery that has been hidden from the ages and from the generations. The Lord Jesus briefly mentioned this mystery in John 14. When Paul came, he elaborated on this word in his fourteen Epistles and thus completed the divine revelation. Without Paul&rsquo;s Epistles the divine revelation would not be complete, nor would it have a center or a focus. The Epistles of Paul completed the divine revelation.</p>
<p>The elders and co-workers must see this vision. We often say that we have seen the vision of Christ and the church. This statement is too general. We must see that the completing word of the divine revelation is Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit to indwell us and to be our life so that we may have experiences of life. This is our vision.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCING, ADMONISHING, AND TEACHING</h2>
<p>Speaking concerning Christ, Paul says, &ldquo;Whom we announce, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom&rdquo; (Col. 1:28). In Greek <em>announce</em> has the meaning of &ldquo;declare.&rdquo; We first declare Christ, report Him; then we admonish and teach every man. First we declare, proclaim, and report to the whole universe, and then based on our report we admonish and teach every man. To admonish is to warn people that if their living, activity, or work is not Christ, it will be consumed by fire. In other words, it is to warn people not to walk apart from Christ. If we are not abiding in Christ, our walk will be consumed by fire (cf. 1 Cor. 3:13-15). Therefore, we must teach every man after admonishing him.</p>
<p>We should not think that Christ&rsquo;s being in us does not need to be taught. If we know this vision, we will teach the sisters according to this vision. We might say, &ldquo;Do not reason with your husband. Do you know that Christ in you is your life? When you reason with your husband, is it you reasoning, or is it Christ?&rdquo; Many sisters need such teaching. It is not sufficient to hear messages in the meetings; there must also be teaching. Only when the elders have been taught can they teach the middle-aged saints and also the teenage saints. The elders might say, &ldquo;Brothers, do not quarrel. This is not Christ. We need to live out Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The purpose of admonishing and teaching is to present every man full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28), that is, to bring every saint unto maturity in Christ and then to present the mature saints to God. For example, graduation ceremonies are held to present the students who have completed their studies to their parents. In order for their children to be educated, parents send them to school for several years. The school educates and matures the children to become useful persons. Then the principal and teachers present the educated children as gifts to their parents. Paul says that Christ is the hope of glory in the saints. We must announce Christ and then admonish every saint and teach every saint in all wisdom so that every saint may mature in Christ. Then we can present every matured saint to God the Father. This is what the elders should do.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CHRIST AND THE SELF</h2>
<p><em>Question: How do we distinguish between what is of Christ and what is of the self?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There is no need to continually ask whether something is of the self or of Christ. Such questions cause more confusion. We always alternate which leg we extend when we walk. Paying attention to which leg is extended first will make it difficult for us to walk. I am over seventy years old, but I still do not know whether I first extend my right leg or my left leg when I walk. As soon as we stop when we realize that something is not Christ, it is sufficient. If we do not know whether something is Christ, we should continue. As long as we are able to stop once we realize something is not Christ, then it is very good. It is difficult to determine whether something is Christ, but it is easy to determine whether something is not Christ. For example, suppose we want to dispute with the brothers. We know that to dispute is not Christ; hence, we should stop immediately. Sometimes being polite to people is not Christ. It is easier to determine what is not Christ than it is to determine what is Christ.</p>
<p>Here is another example. We are not aware of our stomach when we are healthy, but when our stomach is upset, we are aware of it. If we are not aware of our stomach, it is not sick; hence, we should pay no attention to our stomach and eat as usual. But if our stomach is upset, we need to pay attention to our diet. Similarly, whenever we act by the self to dispute or argue with others, we will have a sense, but when we walk by Christ, we will not have much sense.</p>
<p>Our problem is that often we know we are walking by the self, but we do not stop. This offends the Lord. The unique sin of an unbeliever is not believing in Christ, but the unique sin of a believer is not living Christ. We know that not living Christ is a sin, but we do not condemn it. There are twenty-four hours in a day, and eight hours are for us to sleep. Of the remaining sixteen hours we live by the self more than ninety percent of the time. We cannot deny this. When we live by the self instead of living Christ, we stiffen our neck and continue living by the self. The Lord is merciful; hence, He draws us and we pray. When we pray, we enter the spirit and stop living by the self but instead live Christ. We need to be saved from such a miserable condition of going in and out of our spirit.</p>
