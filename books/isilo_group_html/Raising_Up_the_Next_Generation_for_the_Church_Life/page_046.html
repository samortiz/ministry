<p>In verse 6 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Nor did we seek glory from men, neither from you nor from others, though we could have stood on our authority as apostles of Christ.&rdquo; To seek glory from men is a real temptation to every Christian worker. Many have been devoured and spoiled by this matter.</p>
<p>The Greek words rendered &ldquo;stood on our authority&rdquo; also mean &ldquo;asserted authority.&rdquo; A literal translation would be &ldquo;been able to be in weight,&rdquo; that is, been burdensome (see v. 9; 1 Cor. 9:4-12). To assert authority, dignity, or right in Christian work also damages it. The Lord Jesus, while on earth, gave up His dignity (John 13:4-5), and the apostle would rather not use his right (1 Cor. 9:12).</p>
<p>Apparently, seeking glory from men is not as evil as covetousness. However, it is more subtle. The fall of the archangel was due to the seeking of glory. He became God&rsquo;s adversary because of his glory-seeking. Even though he was a leading angel with a very high position, he was still seeking glory. That was the cause of his fall. According to the New Testament, anyone who seeks glory from men is a follower of Satan. The seeking of glory is a trap spread by Satan to snare Christian workers. Therefore, it is very important that all Christian workers learn to avoid the snare of glory-seeking. However, not many have escaped this trap.</p>
<p>How much we shall be used by the Lord and how long our usefulness will last depend on whether we seek glory from men. If we seek glory, our usefulness in the hand of the Lord is finished. The seeking of glory for the self always kills one&rsquo;s usefulness. Therefore, may we all, especially the young, be warned never to seek glory in the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT STANDING ON THEIR OWN AUTHORITY</h2>
<p>First Thessalonians 2:6 indicates clearly that the apostles did not stand on their authority as apostles of Christ. They did not assume any standing or dignity. They had to forget that they were apostles and serve God&rsquo;s people as slaves. They were not to remind others of the fact that they were apostles of Christ. Instead, they were to keep in mind that they were brothers serving believers. They were not to assume any standing or dignity.</p>
<p>Those who are believers and also those who are not believers may consider the leading ones, the elders, or the apostles as dignitaries. However, in the local churches there are no dignitaries. Instead of being dignitaries, we are slaves serving one another. Nevertheless, I know of certain ones who did not assume anything when they did not have a position or title. But as soon as they were given a position, perhaps in a service group, they began to assume dignity. This is shameful. We should learn of Paul never to stand on our dignity or assert authority.</p>
<p>A sister whose husband is an elder should not assume dignity because she is the wife of an elder. An elder&rsquo;s wife is not the &ldquo;First Lady.&rdquo; She is simply a little sister serving the church. Furthermore, her husband is not a dignitary; he is a slave. As an elder, he has been appointed to serve the church as a slave. We all should have this attitude.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s statement, &ldquo;We could have stood on our authority as apostles of Christ,&rdquo; indicates that even in the early days there was the temptation of assuming authority. People were the same in Paul&rsquo;s time as they are today. Then as well as now, there was the temptation to assume some kind of authority or standing. Paul, however, did not stand on his authority as an apostle in order to claim something for himself. By refusing to stand on his dignity or assert authority Paul is a good pattern for us all. If we follow this pattern, we shall kill a deadly disease germ in the Body of Christ, the germ of assuming a position.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHERISHING THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>In verse 7 Paul says, &ldquo;But we were gentle in your midst, as a nursing mother would cherish her own children.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;nurse,&rdquo; <em>trophos,</em> sometimes means a mother; hence, it may denote a nursing mother (see Gal. 4:19). Cherishing includes nourishing. Therefore, this word not only includes nourishing but also includes tender care.</p>
<p>Even though Paul was a brother, he considered himself a nursing mother. Surely, he had no thought of position, dignity, or authority. The thought of being a nursing mother is very different from the thought of dignity or position. What position does a nursing mother have? What rank, dignity, or authority belongs to her? Her dignity consists in nourishing and cherishing her children, in taking care of them in a tender way.</p>
<p>The word <em>cherish</em> is lovely, a word of utmost tenderness. Paul regarded himself as a cherishing one, not merely as one who serves. He certainly did not control the believers. Neither did he merely serve them. Rather, he cherished them. His care for them was full of tenderness.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Raising Up the Next Generation for the Church Life &nbsp; pg 46</div><br></body></html>
