Jehovah Delivering Israel<br>into the Hands of the Philistines Forty Years</H2><P>In the time of the judges, Jehovah delivered Israel into the hands of the Philistines forty years (Judg. 13:1; 14:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Attacking and Capturing the Ark of God</H2><P>Once the Philistines even attacked the ark of God and captured it (1 Sam. 4:3-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. David Slaying Their Champion Goliath</H2><P>At Saul's time the Philistines gathered their armies to fight against Judah, and David slew their champion Goliath (1 Sam. 17:1, 4, 45-49).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Jehovah Destroying the Philistines<br>by the Army of Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon</H2><P>Jeremiah 47:2 says that Jehovah would destroy the Philistines by the army of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon rising up as waters rising up from the north to overflow the land and all that fills it, the city and those who dwell in it (cf. Isa. 14:29-31; Zech. 9:6b).</P><P>In this message we have considered the two aspects of the world typified respectively by Egypt and Philistia. Around the church, typified by the people of Israel, are the Egyptian world and the Philistine world. The Egyptian world attracts those in the church by their making a living and the pursuing of worldly enjoyment. These distract the church people from God's economy and from God as the fountain of living waters. The aspect of the world typified by Philistia constantly opposes and troubles the people of God and the church and hinders God's economy.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_158.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_160.html">Next</a> </body></html>
