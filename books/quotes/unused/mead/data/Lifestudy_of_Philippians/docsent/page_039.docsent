   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FOURTEEN A DRINK OFFERING POURED OUT UPON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SACRIFICE OF THE BELIEVERS FAITH Scripture Reading: Phil 2:17-18; 2 Tim 4:6; Rom 15:16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2:17 Paul says, But if even I am poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and priestly service of your faith, I rejoice and rejoice together with you all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 2 Timothy 4:6 Paul also refers to himself as a drink offering: For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand lit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>. Since everything Paul covers in the book of Philippians is related to the experience of Christ, this must also be true of the drink offering referred to in 2:17.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If our experience of Christ has not come to the point where we have been constituted as a drink offering, we have not yet experienced Christ to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we experience Christ to an exceedingly high degree, we shall become a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>CONSTITUTED A DRINK OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The drink offering was additional to the basic offerings revealed in Leviticus chapters one through seven Num 15:1-10; 28:7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The basic offerings were types of various aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The drink offering was a type of Christ as enjoyed by the offerer, an offering that fills him with Christ as the heavenly wine and even causes him to become wine to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The apostle Paul became such a drink offering by so enjoying Christ that he could be poured out by the shedding of his blood upon the believers faith as a sacrifice to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering were the basic offerings, but the drink offering was not.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The five basic offerings covered in chapters one through seven of Leviticus are types of various aspects of what Christ is to God on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we read Numbers 15:1-10 and 28:7-10, we shall see that the drink offering was something additional.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If one of the basic offerings was offered without the drink offering, this was an indication that there was something lacking with the presentation of the basic offering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The one who offered the basic offering must have been rather poor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, the drink offering signifies that the offerer himself becomes the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, this does not mean that the offerer can be such a drink offering according to his own natural constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, he must enjoy Christ to such an extent that Christ fills him, saturates him, and permeates him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is the heavenly wine for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we enjoy Him by taking Him into us, we shall become filled with Him and thoroughly saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way we shall become the wine to be poured out as a drink offering upon the offerings we present to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With the typology in the Old Testament as a basis, Paul came to regard himself as a drink offering poured out upon the sacrifice and priestly service of the believers faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For years Paul had been drinking of Christ and enjoying Him so that he came to the point that he was filled with Christ and saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, Christ as the heavenly wine caused Paul to become a constitution of wine in his very being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was the reason Paul could consider himself wine poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice he offered to God as a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>FAITH CONSTITUTED</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>OF THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 2:17 Paul speaks of the sacrifice and priestly service of your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sacrifice of the believers faith means that the faith of the Philippian believers was considered by Paul a sacrifice offered to God by him as a priest Rom 15:16 , and his offering ministry was considered a priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The issue, the result, of Paul s ministry was the faith of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Faith in 2:17 is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It refers to much more than the act of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Faith here includes all that the believers have received and enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ultimately it includes what the believers themselves are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This faith was the result of Paul s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul s ministry resulted in the all-inclusive faith of the believers, the faith which Paul offered to God as a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be sure, the sacrifice of the believers faith was full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It included Christ as the basic offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we experience Christ in these different aspects and enjoy Him as these basic offerings, this experience and enjoyment become our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Experientially, the enjoyment of Christ as the basic offerings eventually becomes our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, this faith is constituted of the Christ we experience and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must not make the mistake of understanding the faith spoken of in 2:17 in a shallow, superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Faith is a constitution of our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As such, it could be viewed by Paul as a sacrifice to be offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The faith which can be offered to God as a sacrifice is a constitution of our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The amount of faith constituted in us is in proportion to our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more we enjoy Him, the more we have the faith which is constituted of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>During the years I have been ministering in this country, the saints have been enjoying the Christ ministered to them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They have experienced Christ and enjoyed Him in many different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As a result, within the saints there is a constitution, and this constitution is called faith.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is no better word to signify the enjoyment and experience of Christ in its various aspects than the word faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This was the word used by Paul in 2:17, and we cannot improve on it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul uses the word faith to denote the totality of our enjoyment of Christ and experience of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, faith is the total expression of our experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As we have pointed out, Paul regarded this faith, constituted of the believers experience and enjoyment of Christ, as a sacrifice which he could offer to God as a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although I by no means presume to compare myself with Paul, many times in prayer I have had the sense that the enjoyment and experience of Christ found among the believers is an offering which I can present to God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is among the saints in the Lord s recovery a kind of faith which is the constitution and totality of their experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This faith can be found in every local church in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The saints have a faith which is a constitution of their experience of Christ and enjoyment of Christ over the years.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a sign that the ministry has not been in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The ministry has resulted in a constitution which comes out from the saints enjoyment of Christ and experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In 2:17 Paul refers to this constitution as faith.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Based upon the principle in the Old Testament that the drink offering required a basic offering, Paul regarded the faith constituted of the believers experience of Christ as the basic offering upon which he could pour out himself as a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God in heaven must have been very happy with this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How pleased He must have been to see the faith as the basic offering and also to see the drink offering!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the side of the believers, there was faith; on the side of the apostle, there was the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What a marvelous scene!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>No wonder Paul could say that he rejoiced with them all!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Paul rejoiced to have his blood shed as a drink offering upon the sacrifice of the believers faith.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He not only rejoiced, but he rejoiced together with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To rejoice together with others is to share joy with them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The apostle shared his joy with the Philippians in his martyrdom over their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This implies a congratulation to them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I believe that the Triune God was also rejoicing with Paul at such a happy, joyful scene.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Both the believers faith as the basic offering and the drink offering are something which has been constituted over a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Faith does not grow and develop suddenly, for it is a constitution of the believers enjoyment of Christ and spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Likewise, a drink offering can only be produced out of our experience with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In order to become a drink offering, we need to be filled with the Lord and saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Only in this way can we have the spiritual constitution which makes us a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What a tremendous matter that sinners such as we can be constituted into heavenly wine for God s satisfaction!</S>
