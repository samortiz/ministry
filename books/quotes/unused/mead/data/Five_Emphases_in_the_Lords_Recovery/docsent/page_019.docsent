   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen the oneness of the Body of Christ, Christ, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we shall consider the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The oneness is of the church, Christ is for the church, and the Spirit is also for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that the Spirit is the Spirit of life and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit is the reality the reality of God, the reality of Christ, the reality of the word, and the reality of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit is the aggregate, the consummation, and the totality of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Father is the source of the Triune God, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the reality, the realization, of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have one God, but this one God has many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church also has different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church is the unique, one, universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In practice, however, the church is expressed as the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the New Testament speaks of the church in Jerusalem Acts 8:1 , the church in Antioch 13:1 , and the church in Corinth 1 Cor 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Revelation 1:11 speaks of the seven churches in Asia in Ephesus, in Smyrna, in Pergamos, in Thyatira, in Sardis, in Philadelphia, and in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In practice these are many churches, but all the local churches are the one, unique church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church has the local aspect, and it also has the universal aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Locally, the churches are many.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Universally, the churches are one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is the unique Body of Christ, and this one Body is expressed in many localities as the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING ONE WITH THE TRIUNE GOD IN LIFE, NATURE, ELEMENT, AND ESSENCE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ephesians 4:4-6 says, "One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These verses mention four persons: one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They also speak of three matters: one hope, one faith, and one baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The three persons of the Divine Trinity the one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father are all one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Father is in the Son John 14:10 , the Son is the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 , and the Spirit is the totality, the aggregate, and the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The one Body is the mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We believers were born of God, and we are children of God John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God is our Father in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To illustrate this, we may use the case of a father with three sons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since the father is a person, the three children are also persons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To say that the father and his three children are the same in being persons is correct, but there is only one father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His children do not share in his fatherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are all the same in being persons, but they are not all the same in the fatherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Among the four persons, only one is the father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The father is distinct; he is the unique father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The three children are the children of the father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are not the father, but persons of the father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In like manner, we have one God and Father, and this one God has many children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are not God in His fatherhood; however, we are God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As God's children we were born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have God's life, God's nature, God's element, and God's essence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way we are the same as God, but we are not the same as God in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since we have been born of God, we can say that we are divine in life, in nature, in element, and in essence.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church is the same as God in the divine life, in the divine nature, in the divine element, and in the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why Paul ranks the Body with the Spirit, with the Lord, and with God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All four are divine.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God the Father is divine; the Lord is divine; the Spirit is divine; and the Body is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Body is divinely human and humanly divine.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church is human, but it is divinely human.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church is divine, but it is humanly divine.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The standing of the church, however, is not in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The standing of the church is in divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The church is the Body of Christ because it has the divine life, nature, element, and essence.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul said, "One Body and one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Body has been regenerated with the Spirit as its essence.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This means that the church is humanly divine.</S>
