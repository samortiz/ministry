   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Caring for Problems</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In caring for problems there is no need for too many brothers to be involved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The work of preaching the gospel, caring for the gospel, and caring for the new believers requires the mobilization of almost everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Caring for problems, however, should not be carried out in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are brothers and sisters who have a spiritual measure before the Lord which is weightier than that of others, and it should be quite weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There need not be too many of this kind of brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not more than four or five of these brothers are necessary to address a particular need.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a brother has encountered hardship, these brothers then need to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there are some who have joyous occasions, these brothers should rejoice with them, help them, and pray with them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If there are some who are sorrowful over a death, these brothers should be sorrowful together with them, helping them and praying together with them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There may be some who have difficulties and conflicts in their family; these brothers need to resolve the problems for them, pray for them, and comfort them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Problem matters such as these or matters such as helping the poor can all be given to the brothers and sisters responsible for taking care of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the church, when brothers encounter problems, or if some special situations arise, you need to allow these brothers and sisters to make some arrangements concerning these problems among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever brothers and sisters hear that something has happened among some of the brothers and sisters, they need to immediately notify these brothers and sisters and allow them to find a way to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Send money to those in poverty; feed those who are hungry; clothe those who have nothing to wear; comfort those with difficulties; visit those who are in prison; pray for those who are sick; solve the problems of those who have family difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A Foolish Thought</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I want the brothers and sisters to know about a foolish thought.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not know when this thought began.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some people indeed have the thought that in the church life we should not encounter problems.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But please remember that problems have existed from the time of the apostolic church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since the time of the apostolic church, the church has always been a church of problems, not a church without problems.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You should never consider that a situation in which there are many problems implies an inadequate condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Please remember that not many days after the day of Pentecost, the problem of Ananias and Sapphira occurred in the church, and not many days after that, the problem of the Grecian widows happened.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later, Stephen was martyred, and Peter was thrown into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These kinds of things continued to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The history of the church since the beginning is one that is full of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only a worldly church will have few problems; the genuine church always has many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not know the source of this foolish thought.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is not one church that is always serene, without any difficulties or failures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There has always been blessing on the one hand and difficulties on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the time of the apostles, the church had the most difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Look at the seven churches in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The five that were damaged had little persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One church, the church in Smyrna, was not rebuked by the Lord, but Smyrna was a church that suffered martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One church, the church in Philadelphia, was praised by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord said to that church, "You have kept the word of My endurance'' 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There were many things that required the church there to endure.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To keep the Lord's word is not to keep the Lord's word of tranquillity, but the Lord's word of endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There were many things the church had to pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You should never think that if the church is peaceful and tranquil, going on steadily, then this is the unique proof of the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church may have many problems, but that does not mean that the Lord is not blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, the brothers responsible for caring for problems have to make arrangements to handle all the difficulties in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Caring for the Believers Who Have Moved Away</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>and for Those from Other Places</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The last item related to spiritual affairs is the care for the brothers and sisters who have moved away and for the brothers and sisters who have come from other places.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Regarding Brothers Who Move Away Writing a Letter of Recommendation</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not Being the Last Responsibility</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After a brother moves away, the writing of a letter of recommendation should never be the last responsibility, as is the situation today, where once a brother moves away, we simply write the letter and everything is over.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How is it going with him since he moved away?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How is the church where he is?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This may be how the brother is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The brothers in Foochow have suffered in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only letters of recommendation were written, and this is how some were lost.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This clearly is a failure of the work of a local church.</S>
