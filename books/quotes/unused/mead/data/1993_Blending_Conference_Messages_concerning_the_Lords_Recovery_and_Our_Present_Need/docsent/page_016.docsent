   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Ground of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The sixth crucial point of the major items in the Lord's recovery is the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The ground of the church is the oneness of the universal Body of Christ expressed on the ground of each locality of the local churches in which they are located respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ground is different from the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The ground denotes the site on which the foundation is laid and on which the building is built.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the divine revelation of the New Testament, the church ground is constituted of three crucial elements the unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ, the unique ground of locality of a local church, and the reality of the Spirit of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first element of the constitution of the church ground is the unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ, which is called the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ephesians 4:3 says, "Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to be diligent to keep this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This oneness is what the Lord prayed for in John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is a oneness of the mingling of the processed Triune God with all the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The oneness of the Triune God is in the name of the Father John 17:6, 11 , denoting the Father's person in which is the Father's life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 17:2 the Lord said He gave the eternal life to all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Father is the source not only of life but also of this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The oneness of the believers originates from the Father Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man is not the source of this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Father is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This oneness in the Triune God is also through the sanctification of the holy word John 17:14-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In John 17:17 the Lord prayed, "Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Father's word brings the reality of the Father to us to separate us, to sanctify us, from the world to God that we might be one in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This oneness is ultimately in the divine glory for the expression of the Triune God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Such a oneness of the Triune God in the Father's name with the life of the Father through the sanctifying word and in the divine glory has been imparted into the spirit of all the believers in Christ in their regeneration by the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This oneness is called the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is our inheritance and possession.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not need to strive for it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All we need to do is to keep this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This oneness has become the basic element of the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The second element of the ground is the unique ground of locality in which a local church is established and exists.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The New Testament presents a clear picture that all the local churches as the expression of the universal church, the Body of Christ, are located in respective cities.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, we see the church in Jerusalem in Acts 8:1, the church in Antioch in Acts 13:1, and the church in Corinth in 1 Corinthians 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Revelation 1:11 shows us the seven churches in Asia in seven respective cities.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The city is the ground on which the church is built.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, the many churches are simply the one universal church appearing in many cities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may use the illustration of the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is one moon but it appears in different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we are in San Diego, it is the moon in San Diego, and when we are in Taipei, it is the moon in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is the same moon appearing in many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is the same with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is one church appearing in many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The unique ground of locality preserves the church from being divided.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christians today are divided because of different grounds other than this unique ground of locality, the genuine ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In one city there should be only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The ground of locality protects and insures that a church in a particular locality will always be preserved in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the second element of the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The third element of the church ground is the reality of the Spirit of oneness, expressing the unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ on the unique ground of locality of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Spirit is the living reality of the Divine Trinity 1 John 5:6; John 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is by this Spirit that the oneness of the Body of Christ becomes real and living.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is also through this Spirit that the ground of the locality is applied in life and not in legality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And it is by this Spirit that the genuine ground of the church is linked with the Triune God Eph 4:3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These three elements the oneness of the Spirit, the ground of locality, and the reality of the Spirit keep the genuine oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>6 brothers</S>
