   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The matter of oneness is a common topic among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are one not because we have common concepts, similar interests, and the same goal, nor because we are doing the same kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Though there is a oneness that arises from the factors people have in common, this is not the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Any unity other than the genuine oneness is a oneness in division.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, there is a oneness to be found among Catholics, or Presbyterians, or those engaged in a Christian work; without some kind of oneness people could not work together.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE ONLY SOURCE OF ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Outside of Christ there is no true oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every true believer has Christ within.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Apart from Him no two human beings are truly one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no need to say that the Chinese cannot be one with the Americans, nor the French with the Germans; even the Yankees cannot be one with the Texans!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To come even closer to home, what husband and wife are one apart from Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is the only real oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>LIVING IN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord prayed, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, that the world may believe that You have sent Me" John 17:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The secret for believers to be one is for them to be in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christians do not have the genuine oneness because they are not living in Him, though positionally they are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>ONE BY BEING IN HIS GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the next verse, John 17:22, the Lord prayed further about the oneness: "And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What glory is referred to here?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is something in the universe that is called the glory of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The glory that the Father gave the Son, the Son has given to the believers for the very purpose of their all being one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whatever glory means, it is surely something just of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Glory is God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we are in the expression of God, we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Electricity is hidden until we turn the lights on.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The shining lights then become one in the glory, the expression, of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>IN THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To have the genuine oneness, you must be in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Positionally and doctrinally all believers are surely in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In experience, however, where are you?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Are you in the Triune God in your daily living? in your family life? in your relationship with your mother-in-law? when it's your turn to wash the dishes?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Most of the time, we must admit, we are in ourselves in our choice, our preference, our flesh, in jealousy, hatred, or pride.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While we may be aware that we need to be in the genuine oneness, we cannot attain this because we do not live in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Over these many years I have seen a good many saints who really loved the Lord come into the recovery, stay for a while, and then leave to become part of some division.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There were even some dear Christian co-workers on the mainland of China who went out from us to set up a division.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The simple reason for such a regrettable departure was that they failed to live in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are not in fear and trembling to live in Him day after day, the time may come when you too will cause a division.</S>
