   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE REGENERATION, SANCTIFICATION, TRANSFORMATION, CONFORMATION, AND GLORIFICATION Scripture Reading: Rom 8:15, 16; 15:16; 12:2a; 8:29, 30; 10:12; 8:4, 14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The matter of God's relationship with man is deep and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The grafting of the divine life and the human life into one portrays the most intimate of relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE UNION OF GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In human society the relationship between husband and wife is the closest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the grafting together of two lives is still closer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a branch is grafted to a tree, these two from that point on share a common life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That such a picture could illustrate God's relationship with man is beyond human thought.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our thought is that God is high and lofty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is to be revered as the Creator and worshipped as the Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On our side, we feel far off, small, and low; surely God and we can have nothing in common.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>GOD'S PREPARATORY WORK</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But God had the intention to become one life with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To accomplish this, He made preparations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man's creation was part of this preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He designed man so that His life could be joined with man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He created man in His image and after His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He breathed the breath of life into him, thus creating a spirit in him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This spirit is the organ for receiving God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It gives us a spiritual sense.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit" John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For us to contact anything, we must use the proper organ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have our five sense organs by which we can know the physical, material world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For seeing we must use our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are blind, however beautiful a scene is before us, we shall not be able to realize it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To perceive scent, we must use our nose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we have a cold and a stuffy nose, we shall not be aware of a sweet fragrance, even though others insist they can smell it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Similarly, our spirit is the organ by which we can contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who say there is no God are not using their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because they do not use the proper organ, to them God does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are not using the spiritual sense by which they could substantiate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such is the wonderful way in which we were made.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have God's image, His likeness, and a spirit with which to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus God prepared man to be joined to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God also had to prepare Himself for this union.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Finally He was ready.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He had passed through creation, incarnation, the thirty-three years of human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now He descended as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>TUNING IN TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both parties are now ready.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All that remains to be done is for us to turn back to Him and repent.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is waiting for us to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"O Lord, I believe in You.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I want You.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without You life is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Without You I am empty."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we pray this way, this marvelous Spirit will gladly enter our spirit and make us one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are like a radio with a receiver inside.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we turn on the radio and adjust the dial, we receive the sound waves and can hear the radio program.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The sound waves are in the air, but we do not hear them until we tune in to them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our spirit is the receiver; rather than exercise our mind or our emotions, we can exercise our spirit and contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All of us at one time or another have sensed that there must be a God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Deep within we have had an assurance that there is a Lord in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may not have expressed it in words, but we have had such a sense.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The source of this sense is our spirit; to impart such a feeling is one of its functions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may not have heeded it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may have been busy with our plans for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may have given ourselves to a career or made schemes to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Things about God, we may have told ourselves, are too abstract and incomprehensible; let's be practical.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You may be a student, working hard on your lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But one day you push the books aside.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why am I studying?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What is the meaning of life?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What does the future hold for me?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These questions come not from your mind but from the deepest part of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You reject them, refusing to be superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You turn back to your books, resolving anew to finish your schooling, to get a degree, and then go abroad for even further study.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then you will be able to marry a well educated person.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You keep your mind and your hands busy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the story of all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Finally a day came when we refused to pay attention to the dictates of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We had a longing to walk according to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In spirit we repented, we believed, and we called on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit entered into us, making the two spirits one and the two lives one.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When He moves in us, our spirit becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This divine life unites with our created life, making both one.</S>
