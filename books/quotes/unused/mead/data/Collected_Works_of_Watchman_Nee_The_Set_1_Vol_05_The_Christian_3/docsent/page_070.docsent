   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Our garment is our outward appearance before men.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must differentiate between the righteousness of Christ and the righteousness of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, we must not separate the two.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ as our robe of righteousness is a matter of our appearance before God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The righteous works of the saints are the righteousnesses practiced by the saints after they have believed and been justified.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are the white garments of the saints manifested before men and at the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If saints have only believed and been justified, but have not practiced righteousness, they may not need to feel ashamed before the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But will the world say that they are good men just because they have believed in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Will the judgment seat which bases its judgment on works consider such ones a glory to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As soon as a believer is void of white garments, the world will know about it, and Christ will also judge it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A believer who does not have the white garment is a believer who is naked before the world and Christ; he is a deeply shameful person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Among the present so-called believers, there are two kinds of errors.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first is to try desperately to perform righteousness and think that goodness before men means righteousness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second is to consider justification before God as all that counts and that nothing else matters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who look to their own work and who do not trust in the righteousness of the Lord Jesus will not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, those who trust in the righteousness of the Lord Jesus but have no practical righteousness will not be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But then, one should also be careful about the practical righteousness that comes after justification.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are white garments; they are not the work of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>White is the color of light, and light is the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the white garments are works that bear God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Leviticus must come before Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All those who have not seen God's holiness in the Holy of Holies cannot walk with God in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The result of having the white garments is to have the shame covered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that there is no more shame.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Christ comes again, many will be ashamed before His seat 1 John 2:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are the ones who had much strength and many opportunities to practice righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"And eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the third thing that these ones should buy with a price.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What they lack is spiritual sight.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Otherwise, they would not have become so self-contented.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They need a self-realization.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone who knows himself realizes that in his flesh there is no goodness dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only those who do not understand the corruptness and hopelessness of the nature they received from Adam think that they "have need of nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the heart is satisfied with the old creation, it must surely have grown fat!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These need the spiritual sight to know the holiness of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They have never realized how holy God is and how unapproachable, untouchable, and unimaginable is His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That is why they are satisfied with what they have.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are also lacking in the revelation concerning the Lord's coming and His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If they were not lacking in this, they would not have accumulated riches and would not have boasted of these riches, which bar them from the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They must yet see how they are in the position of the creature and how they must trust in the Creator for all gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the messengers in heaven have to trust in this way, how much more do we the sinners have to do the same?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we realize the position of God and of man, what other thoughts can we hold except to beg for grace and receive grace?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These are the ancient Pharisees!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"But now that you say, We see; your sin remains" John 9:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who know that they are blind will receive healing from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As He opened man's physical eyes with the clay and the spittle, in the same way He will now heal man's spiritual blindness with eyesalve.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But why would those who say that they are not sick look for the physician?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once their eyes are opened, they will have the self-realization.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This will save them from being astonished by their own blindness when enlightened by the flaming eyes at the judgment seat in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One famous writer once said, "The most precious spikenard eyesalves come from Laodicea, the champion of all cities in Asia."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, the Lord told them to buy eyesalve from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord sent Ananias to Saul so that he could receive his sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit Acts 9:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From that time on, Saul was to have a new sight, a sight of the Holy Spirit to discern all things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The talent, mind, and ability of Laodicea were all great, but it did not give any ground to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Apart from the Holy Spirit there is no spiritual sight.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>John told the little ones in the house of God, "And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know....And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him" 1 John 2:20, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Holy Spirit is the anointing, the eyesalve.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Unless we humble ourselves before the Holy Spirit and allow Him to reveal ourselves and God's coming glory to us, we will not be able to know.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Wisdom and prudence are useless here.</S>
