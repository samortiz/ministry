   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNOWING THAT HE IS RIGHTEOUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 29 John twice uses the word "know": "If you have known that He is righteous, you know also that everyone who practices righteousness has been begotten of Him."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first use of the word know is a translation of the Greek word eideta, from oida, perceived with a conscious knowledge, a deeper inward seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is for knowing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the second use of the word "know" is a translation of the Greek word ginoskete, from ginosko, the outward objective knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is for knowing man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word "righteous" in verse 29 refers to the righteous God in 1:9 and Jesus Christ the Righteous in 2:1.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this word to all the recipients, beginning from 2:28, the apostle turns his emphasis from the fellowship of the divine life in 1:3 2:11 and the anointing of the Divine Trinity in 2:12-27 to the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fellowship of the divine life and the anointing of the Divine Trinity should have an issue, that is, should issue in the expression of the righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>KNOWING THAT EVERYONE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>WHO PRACTICES RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>HAS BEEN BEGOTTEN OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to John's word in verse 29, if we know that God is righteous, we "know also that everyone who practices righteousness has been begotten of Him."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To practice righteousness is not merely to do righteousness occasionally and purposely as some particular act; it is to do righteousness habitually and unintentionally as one's common daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is the same in 3:7.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is an automatic living that issues from the divine life within us, with which we have been begotten of the righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, it is a living expression of God, who is righteous in all His deeds and acts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not merely outward behavior, but the manifestation of the inward life; not merely an act of purpose, but the flow of life from within the divine nature we partake of.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the first condition of the life that abides in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is all due to the divine birth, which is indicated by the word "has been begotten of Him" and the title "children of God" in 3:1.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John's writings on the mysteries of the eternal divine life place much emphasis on the divine birth 3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4, 18; John 1:12-13 , which is our regeneration John 3:3, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is the greatest wonder in the entire universe that human beings could be begotten of God, and sinners could be made children of God!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through such an amazing divine birth we have received the divine life, which is the eternal life 1 John 1:2 , as the divine seed sown into our being 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Out of this seed all the riches of the divine life grow from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is by this that we abide in the Triune God and live the divine life in our human living, a life that does not practice sin 3:9 , but practices righteousness 2:29 , loves the brothers 5:1 , overcomes the world 5:4 , and is not touched by the evil one 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>ABIDING IN THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>AND THE DIVINE BIRTH</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First John 2:28 3:10a indicates that we can abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have pointed out that certain pronouns used in these verses indicate that to abide in the Lord is actually to abide in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not a simple matter for us to abide in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can human beings abide in God?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To abide in God is different from walking with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Genesis 5 tells us that Enoch walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But what does it mean to abide in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here John does not speak of walking with God, but speaks of abiding in God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To abide in God means to dwell in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may find it rather easy to understand what it means to abide with God or dwell with God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But according to the natural mind it seems that it is impossible for human beings to dwell, to abide, in God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Abiding in the Triune God is a matter that involves the divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The third section of this Epistle emphasizes the divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have the words "begotten of Him" in 2:29 and the phrase "begotten of God" in 3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4, and 18.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By this we see that John repeatedly refers to our divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order for us to dwell in God, we need to realize that we have had a divine birth, that we have been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through this divine birth we have received the divine life, which is the divine seed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How wonderful that a divine seed has been sown into our being and that we have been born of God!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When a child is born of his parents, he automatically has a human life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may say that this human life came from the sowing of a human seed, that the child's being came from a human seed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This seed means a great deal to a child's living, for it causes him to be different from any kind of animal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because a newborn child has a human seed, the child can dwell in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He has been born of humanity, and he has a human life from that seed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, it is easy for the child to remain, abide, dwell, in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Actually, for a child to dwell in humanity is natural, spontaneous, and automatic.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He can abide in humanity because he has had a human birth and possesses a human life from the human seed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Suppose someone commanded a dog to abide in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A dog may pretend for a little while to stand upright like a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But eventually he will go back to standing on four feet and spontaneously live according to the dog nature within him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because a dog has not had a human birth, he does not have the human life, the human seed, to enable him to abide in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do you know what makes it possible for us to dwell in the Triune God?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can dwell in Him because we have been born of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is the wonder of wonders that human beings can be born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although God is divine and we are sinners, we have nevertheless been born of the divine Being.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Nothing could be greater than this.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This divine birth is not merely a doctrine or something experienced psychologically.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the contrary, this birth has actually taken place organically in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In John 3:6 the Lord Jesus says, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Praise the Lord that we have experienced such a birth!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This divine birth brings us a divine life, and the divine life is the divine seed which is now in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In this divine life we spontaneously abide, dwell, in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are already dwelling in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is no need for us to exercise ourselves to dwell in Him since we are already in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, we need to be careful not to allow this abiding in the Triune God to be interrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have been born of God, and God's seed abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>By this seed we are in God and can abide in God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is no need for us to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But we should not let our abiding in Him be interrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the reason John charges us again and again to abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In 3:24 John says that we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This indicates that the Lord's abiding in us and our abiding in Him is altogether in the Spirit.</S>
