Moreover, He was resurrected from death and became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45b). Therefore, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit.&#8221; If the Lord were not the Spirit today, He could not have an organic relationship with us. The Lord&#8217;s intention is not only to live by Himself but to enter into us that we may become His members to be His corporate Body for His expression. However, for Him to enter into us He has to be the Spirit. Both in Greek and in Hebrew the word spirit may also be rendered breath. The Spirit is like the breath, the air. This does not mean, however, that the Lord as the Spirit is no longer a person. As the Spirit, He is still God, and He is also man as a person. Today the God-man Jesus Christ is the Spirit. This is truly a mystery.<p>None of the religions on earth is like Christianity. The true power of Christianity altogether lies in the inner life; this is why Christianity is able to spread worldwide. We are insignificant people, but we can testify that since we believed into the Lord Jesus, we have had an intrinsic power in us that enables us to live out a transcendent life. This is the intrinsic power of Christianity and the story of the life of Christians. We may use sowing as an illustration. If you sow a stone into the earth, there will be no reaction. However, if you sow a seed into the earth, it will sprout after a short while. The soil of the earth may be thick and hard, yet the seed still will sprout and grow because it has the intrinsic life power. Once the intrinsic life power operates, it can break through the limitation of the hard soil. Likewise, within a Christian there is the life power. The source of this power is the Christ who is in us. Now He as the Spirit is with our spirit. If we pray in spirit for just ten minutes, the life power within us immediately begins to operate. This is what is lacking in religion. This also proves that the Jesus in whom we believe, the Lord upon whom we call, is not only the God-man but also the Spirit dwelling in our spirit.<h2 class=head2>Christ Being Our Wisdom: Both Righteousness and Sanctification and Redemption</h2><p>This Christ who is in us is wisdom to us from God (1 Cor. 1:30). Wisdom here does not refer to cleverness; it denotes righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Righteousness is to be proper, accurate, and without mistakes; this is mainly toward others. Sanctification is to be absolutely for God, without any human mixture; this is mainly toward God. Redemption implies that we cannot have wisdom, righteousness, and sanctification by ourselves but by Christ&#8217;s divine life; this is mainly for ourselves. Christ as the God-man is in us as the Spirit, and He is also our wisdom. The more we trust in Him and pray to Him, the more we have wisdom. Once we have wisdom, our walk, our conduct, will be proper, and thus we will have righteousness. Moreover, our actions and attitudes will be sanctified, wholly separated unto God. At the same time, Christ in us is our redemption to save us from anything in which we fall short. This is the excellent One within us. He is God, man, and the Spirit for our wisdom: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.<h2 class=head2>Christ Being Our Life</h2><p>As the Spirit, Christ is not only our inner power but also our life. Colossians 3:4 says that Christ is our life. We live and move on earth because we have life; once we die, we cannot move any longer. As Christians we have not only the human life but also the Lord Christ in us as our surpassing life. He is the Spirit to be our life, by which we may live and walk and be transcendent and excellent, as He is.<h2 class=head2>Christ Having the Unsearchable Riches</h2><p>Christ is God, man, and the Spirit. He is wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption. He is also our life. Hence, He is the all-inclusive One with the unsearchable riches. He is our kindness with justice, our morality, and our virtues. What He is, which far exceeds the kindness, justice, and morality taught by the Chinese sages, cannot be expressed by human language. How rich He is! Whatever we need, He is, and He is abundantly. If we need power, He is our power; if we need patience, He is our patience; if we need virtues, He is our virtues; if we need love, He is our love; if we need consolation, He is our consolation; if we need the leading of light in darkness, He is our light and leading. He is everything, and He is rich and all-inclusive in us. The apostle Paul saw this; therefore, he said that grace was given to him that he might announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel (Eph. 3:8).<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
