<h2 class="head1">SERVING UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>Watchman Nee: In the church there is no human authority; there is only the authority of the Holy Spirit. The church has been here on earth for a long time, but God has never entrusted its service to any human individuals. In the church not even the elders are the authority. You are not the authority. Any move in the church service should be the result of the direction of the Holy Spirit. Anyone acting or deliberating apart from the direction of the Holy Spirit is being rebellious and seditious. Perhaps you do not know how rebellious and seditious you were in the past.</p><p>Neither the elders nor the deacons have any authority in themselves. Authority is from the Holy Spirit. The church cannot tolerate any kind of rebellion. Any announcement or change must be carried out in the authority of the Holy Spirit. If the brothers and sisters have been dealt with by the Spirit in a deep way, they will know immediately if a church is in rebellion. We have absolutely no intention of building up an earthly organization here. Our hope is that the authority of the Holy Spirit would flow from the most mature brothers to the youngest one. Let me repeat: Neither the brothers and sisters nor the deacons and elders have any authority in themselves. Only the Holy Spirit has the authority.</p><p>There are two basic principles operating in the church&mdash;love and authority. Where there is a lack of love, the relationship among the brothers and sisters falters. Where there is a lack of authority, the relationship with the Holy Spirit falters. Horizontally there is love, and vertically there is authority. If the Head is not honored with His rightful authority, the church will not experience the blessing that flows from the Head. Therefore, even the smallest arrangement in the church must not be carried out presumptuously without the direction of the Holy Spirit. The brothers and sisters have to develop a habit of asking. They should ask the responsible brothers everything. In the end, the elders have to bring all the matters to God. The elders are not men with sharper and quicker mentalities. They are the ones who have learned more lessons and have spent more time before the Lord. They know God's heart more. They must be clear about God's will before they tell the brothers and sisters what to do.</p><p>Some people have been Christians for over ten or twenty years, but they still have not learned the habit of asking. I will tell you a secret. The Lord has given me the responsibility of examining the young brothers; I try to ascertain if they are suitable and qualified for the work. We examine many things. One of the things we examine is whether or not they have a habit of asking. If a man does not have the habit of asking, his self is not yet broken, and he will probably serve according to his self-will. He will build a yard only to tear it down again later. He may even do worse, tearing down the adjacent walls as well.</p><p>Unless the Lord's authority is clearly manifest among us, our service will be a mere rallying of the flesh. We will come together to build Babel, and the result will be nothing but total confusion. We should never despise the smallest work in the church or think that a work is so insignificant that there is no need to ask anyone about it. Even a work as mundane as cleaning chairs is special. We serve in coordination by submitting to the authority of the Holy Spirit; we do not serve according to our past concepts and habits.</p>
