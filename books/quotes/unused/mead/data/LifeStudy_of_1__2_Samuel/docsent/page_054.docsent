   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE TWELVE THE HISTORY CONCERNING DAVID 1 PREPARED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE A MAN ACCORDING TO THE HEART OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 SAMUEL 16 2 SAMUEL 1 1 CHOSEN, TRAINED, ANOINTED, TESTED, AND APPROVED Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 16 17</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Samuel 16 begins the history concerning David as one prepared by God as a man according to the heart of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chapters sixteen and seventeen show us how David was chosen, trained, anointed, tested, and approved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Chapter fifteen ends with a miserable situation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God had abandoned Saul, rejecting him from being king over Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then in the first verse of chapter sixteen, God sent Samuel to contact a young boy, who was perhaps only about fifteen years old.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This shows that while Saul was abusing the God-given kingship, God knew the whole situation and was doing something marvelous to prepare the right person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God went secretly to David, the great grandson of Boaz and Ruth Ruth 4:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God gave Saul the kingship for the purpose of building up His own kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Saul should have been God's acting king, reigning over the people for God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet he behaved as a king absolutely for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He usurped and even abused the gifts given to him by God the kingdom, the people, and the kingship in order to build up his own monarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But while Saul was openly abusing, God was secretly preparing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, God's preparation was completed in David, the youngest of Jesse's sons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>David was the eighth son, and in the Bible the number eight signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the scriptural sense, David was one in resurrection; hence, he was the one whom God could use.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>David was prepared by God to be a man according to the heart of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Otherwise he could not have been such a man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In a very real sense, he was created by God to be such a man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, he still needed to pass through the process of being chosen, trained, anointed, tested, and approved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be chosen is wonderful, but to be trained by God is to go through suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be anointed also is very good, but after being anointed we must be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second Samuel 5:4 tells us that David was thirty years old when he began to reign.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After David, a boy of about fifteen, was anointed by Samuel, he was tested for about fifteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In particular, he was bothered and troubled by Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually, David passed the test and was approved by God.</S>
