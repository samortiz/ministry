   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"No one puts a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment, for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made."</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Greek word here is agnaphos, formed with a, which means "not," and gnapto, which means "to card or comb wool"; hence, "to dress or full the cloth."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, the word means "uncarded," "unfulled," "unfinished," "unshrunk," "untreated."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This unshrunk cloth signifies Christ from His incarnation to His crucifixion as a piece of new cloth, untreated, unfinished, whereas the new garment in Luke 5:36 signifies Christ after being "treated" in His crucifixion as a new robe.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ was first the unshrunk cloth for making a new garment, and then through His death and resurrection He was made a new garment to cover us as our righteousness before God that we might be justified by God and acceptable to Him Luke 15:22; Gal 3:27; 1 Cor 1:30; Phil 3:9 .</S>
