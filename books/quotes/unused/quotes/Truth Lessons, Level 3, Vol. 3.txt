At the same time, we continuously experience God's redemption in forgiveness, cleansing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation
The eternal life that we have received leads us into the divine fellowship, and the divine fellowship leads us into the divine light
We also sense our need for God's forgiveness and the cleansing of the blood of Jesus, and we confess to the Lord
God, in His faithfulness and righteousness, then forgives us of our sins and cleanses us from all unrighteousness
Even if we only sin occasionally, rather than habitually, this sinning is adequate proof that we still have sin working within us
We will be able to say that sin is no longer with us only when our body is transfigured, that is, when our body is redeemed
John 1:9 says, 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
His word is the word of the truth of His gospel , which tells us that He will forgive us our sins because of Christ
The believers experience God's redemption not only in being forgiven of their sins but also in being washed, being cleansed
John 1:9 tells us that God cleanses us from all unrighteousness; this means that He washes us from the stain of our unrighteousness
The blood by which we are cleansed is the blood of a wonderful person-Jesus Christ-who has both humanity and divinity
Romans 6:22 says, 'Having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, eternal life'
By Christ being the sanctifying life, we are gradually being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will
In His prayer in John 17:17 to the Father, the Lord Jesus said, 'Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth'
His word as the truth, as the reality, works in the believers to sanctify them, separating them from anything worldly
God's nature is holy, and this holy nature is conveyed in His word, because God's word transmits the holy nature of God the Father
The word carries with it God's holy nature and dispenses this nature into our whole being, sanctifying us subjectively
Hebrews 12:10 says that God the Father disciplines us 'for what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness'
With regard to God, holiness is the attribute of His holy nature; with us, holiness is our sanctification, our being separated unto God
The implication here is that while we are pursuing peace with all men, we must pay attention to the matter of sanctification before God
Peter 1:15 says, 'According to the Holy One who called you, you yourselves also be holy in all your manner of life'
Peter 3:11 says, 'Since all these things are to be thus dissolved, what kind of persons ought you to be in holy manner of life and godliness
It is wonderful that His divine power has granted to us everything we need to live a holy life according to godliness
Unto honor is a matter of nature, sanctified is a matter of position, useful is a matter of practice, and prepared is a matter of training
Holy means not only sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything that is common
God sanctifies us wholly so that no part of our being, either our spirit or soul or body, will be left common or profane
After the believers are regenerated, they still need to experience God's redemption continuously in being forgiven, cleansed, and sanctified
By confessing our sins, we can restore our fellowship with God and experience God's redemption in being forgiven of our sins
We are also cleansed in the Spirit, the Spirit that is dispensed into us, cleansing us inwardly, subjectively, and dispositionally
The believers also experience God's redemption in being justified and in being reconciled, in the second step, to God
The righteousness of the believers who are found in Christ is Christ Himself, who is lived out of them to be their righteousness
The more we gain Christ and live in Him, the more this Christ, who is our righteousness, is expressed before God and men
To be justified by faith is for the receiving of the divine life ; to be justified by works is through living the divine life
Abraham's offering of Isaac and Rahab's receiving of the messengers and sending them out are works that issued from their living faith
The latter is the cause, bringing forth the former; the former is the effect, the outcome and proof, of the latter
Corinthians 5:21 says, 'Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him'
When Christ became our Substitute, dying for us, God considered Him not only as One who bore our sins but even as sin
In resurrection, Christ entered into us to be our life, and this life living in us constitutes us to be God's righteousness
When Christ took our place, He was made sin for us; now He is constituting us, making us God's righteousness in Him
We become not only righteous but even the righteousness of God we become not only righteous persons but also the righteousness of God itself
In this aspect He was made sin for us to be judged and done away with by God that we might become the righteousness of God in Him
These two steps of reconciliation are clearly portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle in the Old Testament
In the progressing stage in God's full salvation, the believers need this second step of reconciliation to God
The believers' second step of reconciliation to God is by God entreating them through the apostles as ambassadors of Christ
Ultimately, the second step of reconciliation to God is to make the believers the righteousness of God in Christ
We are reconciled to God in the second step and become the righteousness of God in our organic union with Christ
When we were saved, we passed through the process of forgiveness, cleansing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation
Now in our living as Christians, this process needs to be repeated continuously until the redemption of our body
Whenever they offered the burnt offering to satisfy God, they also had to offer the sin offering and the trespass offering
We need Christ to be these offerings because we are defiled by the natural life the old man the flesh the lust of the flesh and worldliness
Because of our sins, offenses, and our sinful nature, we need Christ as our sin offering and trespass offering
Throughout our entire Christian life, we need God's forgiveness, cleansing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation
While we are enjoying the triune dispensing of the processed Triune God, we need to continuously experience the redemption of God
In the believers' continuous experience of God's redemption, there is the need to be justified after being sanctified
The believers are justified not only out of faith but also out of works as the issue of the divine life by living out the divine life
The believers also become the righteousness of God in Christ by being constituted with Christ as the righteousness of God
When Christ took our place, He was made sin for us; now He is constituting us that we may be made the righteousness of God in Him
In this way, in our organic union with Christ we are not only righteous, but we become the righteousness of God itself
For the divine conformation, the believers enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation
In this lesson we want to begin to consider the dispensing in the divine transformation for the divine conformation
In Paul's time, the Judaizers and those influenced by them were bound by the traditional regulations of the law
Corinthians 318 indicates that the goal of transformation is to be transformed into the same image of the resurrected and glorified Christ
When we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, the Lord infuses and dispenses into us the elements of what He is and what He has done
As the seed of a carnation grows by its life essence and through its life power, it takes on a characteristic shape
Transformation is not a once-for-all matter; rather, it is a gradual process, from one degree of glory to another degree of glory
Before going to the cross, the Lord Jesus prayed, 'Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You'
In this prayer the Lord was praying that the Father would let Him enter into glory through death and resurrection
The believers, in their continuous experience of God's redemption, need to experience and enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity
To be transformed, we must remove the veil of our natural inward constitution by turning our heart to the Lord
With unveiled face, we also need to behold and reflect like a mirror the glory of the resurrected and ascended Lord
When we receive Christ, the Spirit of the Lord enters into our spirit, dispensing Christ as life into our spirit to regenerate us
Through this divine operation, not only is our deadened spirit enlivened, but God's life with its divine nature is put into our spirit
The Lord desires that this change in life would continue to spread into our soul so that our mind, emotion, and will would be transformed
He needs to spread continually from our spirit to our soul until every part of our soul is transformed into His image
We will have the Lord's image in our practical living because our soul will be completely permeated by His divine element
When the Lord Jesus spreads from our spirit into our mind, our mind is renewed and our soul undergoes a metabolic change
If our mind remains old, our soul will not be transformed, and we will remain unchanged in our mind, emotion, and will just like unbelievers
Once the mind is renewed, the emotion and the will are subsequently renewed because the mind regulates the emotion and influences the will
The more we turn to the spirit of our mind and conduct ourselves in the spirit of our mind, the more our mind will be renewed
Gold, silver, and precious stones signify the various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God
All these precious materials are products of our participation in and enjoyment of Christ in our spirit through the Holy Spirit
When we have the nature of God and the redemptive and life-secreting work of Christ, the result is the transformation of the Spirit
To experience the transforming work of the Spirit is to experience a metabolic change through the divine life within us
As plants, we first grow in God's cultivated land and then are transformed into God's precious building materials for God's building
While transformation involves a change in shape, conformation further involves molding this shape into a specific image, the image of Christ
There are two aspects to the divine sonship of Christ: the aspect of being the only begotten Son and that of being the firstborn Son
As the only begotten Son, Christ is unique, but as the firstborn Son of God, Christ is the first One among many brothers
Acts 13:33, quoting Psalm 2:7, indicates that Christ was begotten as the Son of God on the day of resurrection
Christ's being the Firstborn implies that He has many brothers and that He is the Firstborn among the brothers
The designation of the Son is related to the prototype; the conformation of the many sons is the working out of a mass reproduction
God has the Firstborn as the prototype, and now He wants a mass production to obtain many sons who have the image of the Firstborn
We have already been predestinated to be conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son so that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers
When Christ was the only begotten Son, He was unique, but God desired to have many sons who would be the many brothers of His Son
Through the processes of transformation and conformation we are becoming more and more like Christ, our elder Brother
He has the divine nature and the human nature; as His many brothers, we have the human nature and the divine nature
Because both He, the firstborn Son, and we, the many sons, are the same in the divine life and nature, He is not ashamed to call us brothers
In this way through the all-inclusive function of the divine life, we are gradually conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son
When we are regenerated, the Spirit of the Lord enters into our spirit, dispensing Christ into our spirit as life
The Lord desires that this change in life would continue to spread into our soul, transforming our mind, emotion, and will
The transformation of the soul is by the renewing of the mind; if our mind is renewed, our soul will be transformed
Through transformation by the renewing of the mind, we become precious materials-gold, silver, and precious stones
As the firstborn Son of God Christ is the prototype as the many sons the believers are molded into the image of Christ Gods firstborn Son
We are now in the process of transformation, conformation, and maturing to be the many brothers of God's firstborn Son
Philippians 3:10 speaks of being conformed to the death of Christ, indicating that we must take Christ's death as the mold for our living
The mold of Christ's death refers to Christ's putting His human life to death continuously so that He might live by His divine life
When our human living is conformed to the shape of this mold, we are dead to our human life yet live God's life
Christ's death is the mold in which we are being conformed to His image, the image of the firstborn Son of God
As we experience the process of transformation and conformation, we are being conformed to the death of Christ
Every day He was being molded by the cross, even when He was a child living in the home of a carpenter in Nazareth
In Matthew 16:24 the Lord Jesus said, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'
Bearing the cross means to remain in the killing of the death of Christ for the terminating of our self, natural life, and old man
We have been crucified together with Christ on the cross; our own life, the natural life, the old man, and our entire being have been killed
The meaning of bearing the cross is to join ourselves to the crucified Christ and remain with Him in His death
If we do not remain in Christ's death, we are forsaking His cross; if we remain in His death, we are bearing the cross
We need to have a clear vision: to bear the cross is not to suffer but rather to keep ourselves under the termination of death
The cross of Christ is a terminating death; as those who bear the cross, we keep ourselves under Christ's termination
If we have a clear vision concerning the fact that our old man has been crucified with Christ, we know this in reality
They who are of Christ Jesus' are those who have believed into Christ and have been baptized into Christ; therefore, they belong to Christ
The problems in our daily life do not come from the old man; rather, they come from the flesh with its passions and lusts
Based upon the fact that our old man has been dealt with by the death of Christ, we need to practically crucify our flesh
The crucifixion of the old man has been accomplished by Christ, but the crucifixion of the flesh must be executed by us
The second aspect-our crucifying the flesh-is the application of the first aspect-Christ's crucifying of the old man
The use of the perfect tense to describe this indicates that the crucifixion of our flesh should be the normal experience of the believers
We not only have a base objectively, but we also have the Spirit subjectively to enable us to execute the cross of Christ upon our flesh
The more we experience the Spirit, the more we are transformed and conformed to the image of Christ, God's firstborn Son
To crucify the flesh by the Spirit is to experience the death of Christ practically and not to live habitually according to the flesh
If we would be conformed to the death of Christ and thus conformed to His image, we should not live according to our habits
We have the genuine experience of the crucifixion with Christ in our putting to death the practices of the body by the Spirit
Every practice of the body must be put to death by turning our mind to the spirit and setting it on the spirit
To put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit means that we do not live habitually according to the flesh
In the dealing with the self, there is an objective fact that our old man, which includes the self, has been crucified with Christ
In order to deny the self, we need to see the divine revelation that our old man has been crucified with Christ
The old man in Romans 6:6 refers to our created and fallen being; the 'I' in Galatians 2:20 is what the old man calls itself
Galatians 2:20 says that this 'I' has been crucified with Christ; Romans 6:6 shows that the 'I,' who has been crucified, is the old man
When we see that our old man has been crucified with Christ, we are able to deny the self by not living in the 'I'
If we save our soul-life in this age, we will lose it in the coming age, that is, lose the enjoyment of the soul and thereby suffer
To identify ourselves with Christ in His death is to take up the cross; therefore, to take up the cross is also to lose our soul-life
After being organically united with Him through faith, we should remain on the cross, keeping our old man under the termination of the cross
The elements of the world include Jewish observances heathen ordinances and philosophy they also include gnosticism asceticism and mysticism
None of these can remain in the mold of Christ's death, because the death of Christ cuts off, kills, and annuls them
To be conformed to the image of Christ, we must be dealt with by the cross to be conformed to the death of Christ
To be conformed to the death of Christ denotes that the believers need to take Christ's death as a mold for their living
The mold of Christ's death refers to His putting to death His human life continuously so that He might live by the life of God
When the believers experience the process of transformation and conformation, they are being conformed to the death of Christ
Hebrews 10:19 says, 'Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus'
When we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies where we meet with God who is on the throne of grace
Since He is within the veil, we need to enter within the veil so that we may see Him and consider Him to receive His infusion
It is a tremendous thing to enter the Holy of Holies because the very God is sitting there on the throne of grace
Hebrews 10:20 indicates that we enter into the Holy of Holies through 'a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh'
Through the rent veil of the flesh and in the blood of Jesus, we can enter into the Holy of Holies to contact God for our enjoyment
Hebrews 416 says Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help
The throne of God is a throne of authority to the whole universe on which God sits to control and rule over the universe
Whenever we turn to the spirit, we enter into the gate of heaven and touch the throne of grace in heaven through Christ the heavenly ladder
When we are in a pitiful condition, His mercy reaches us and brings us into a situation where God is able to favor us with His grace
Luke 15:20-24 tells us that when the father saw the prodigal son returning, he had compassion on him; this mercy expressed the father's love
The father clothed him with the best robe and fed him with the fattened calf; this grace manifested the father's love
Verse 18 also points out that we must not follow the Lord according to our own ideas but according to His leading
After the Lord told Peter to follow Him, Peter referred to John and said to Jesus, 'Lord, and what about this man'?
The Lord was telling Peter that what would happen to John was none of his concern; he must follow the Lord and not pay attention to others
In the book of Hebrews and in typology, the camp signifies the organization of religion, which is human and earthly
In the book of Hebrews, both the gate and the camp signify the Jewish religion with its earthly and human aspects
Every religion is both a human organization and an earthly realm that keeps people away from God's New Testament economy
Any religion that rejects the Lord-Judaism, Catholicism, or Protestantism-is a camp, a human organization, given up by the Lord
The book of Hebrews instructs and charges us to come forward to the Holy of Holies and to enter within the veil
Enter within the veil and go outside the camp are important and very meaningful phrases in the book of Hebrews
The goal and ultimate consummation of this book is that we would all enter within the veil and go outside the camp
The more we are in our spirit, enjoying the heavenly Christ, the more we will be outside the camp of religion, following the suffering Jesus
Being in our spirit and enjoying the glorified Christ enable us to go outside the camp of religion to follow the rejected Jesus
Within the veil we behold the glorified Christ so that we may be attracted to follow the suffering Jesus outside the camp
The Holy of Holies enables us to take the pathway of the cross, and the pathway of the cross ushers us into the kingdom in its manifestation
When the believers go forth outside the camp to follow Jesus, bearing His reproach, they are following in His steps
Peter 221 says To this you were called because Christ also suffered on your behalf leaving you a model so that you may follow in His steps
The Lord Jesus has set His suffering life before us as an underwriting copy for us to copy by tracing and following in His steps
The Greek word for easy means fit for use hence good kind mild gentle easy and pleasant are in contrast to hard harsh sharp and bitter
The Lord Jesus submitted Himself to the will of His Father not wanting to do anything for Himself or expecting to gain something for Himself
We should not consider ourselves as anything or that we are higher than others; on the contrary, we should remain in a lowly state
In following Jesus we must not pay attention to others but must go outside the camp that is go outside of the human organization of religion
The Holy of Holies enables us to take the pathway of the cross, and the pathway of the cross leads us into the kingdom in its manifestation
When we are content to remain in a lowly state and not disturbed by any matter or thing, we enjoy Christ's rest
Paul does not speak of living for the Lord, by the Lord, or with the Lord; instead, he speaks of living to the Lord
To live to law means that we are under the law, led by the law, ruled by the law, and obligated to follow the law
The entire text of 2 Corinthians 4 and 5 shows that to live to the Lord means to live the kind of life that the Lord Jesus lived
When we live to Christ, we do not live by our outer man, by our flesh; rather, we live by the inner man, by our regenerated spirit
We may be active and aggressive for the Lord in a natural way, doing things for the Lord by our natural aggressiveness
Worldly people always live to themselves, but the love of Christ constrains us to live to Him and not to ourselves
To live to ourselves means that we are under our own restraint, leading, and control, mindful only of our own aim and goal
Paul did not seek to be well pleasing to the Lord by working but by living every aspect of his daily life to Him
The love of Christ constrains us; it presses us from every side and holds us to one aim, leaving us with no other way to take
Thank the Lord for the love of Christ that constrains us; we are constrained by the love of Christ to live to Him
To be constrained by the love of Christ means to remain in His death, which brings in the enjoyment of His resurrection
The believers' living to Christ proves that we are the Lord's and that Christ is our Lord, who died to purchase us to Himself
According to the context, the Spirit in verse 16 must be the Holy Spirit who dwells in and mingles with our regenerated spirit
The Christian walk must be totally by the Spirit, meaning that our walk must be regulated by the Holy Spirit within our spirit
In Galatians 5:25 Paul speaks again of walking by the Spirit: 'If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit'
The Greek word for walk in verse 25 means to march in military rank to keep in step and derivatively to walk in an orderly regulated manner
In the first walk we walk at large, but in the second walk we must walk as in the military-orderly and in step
These two spirits have become one, as seen in 1 Corinthians 6:17: 'He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit'
We have a wonderful mingled spirit, a spirit that has been regenerated by the divine Spirit and is indwelt by the divine Spirit
When the believers set their mind on the mingled spirit and walk according to this spirit, they are freed from the law of sin and of death
Every kind of life, including the satanic life and the divine life, has a law which is the innate ability of that life
The law of the Spirit of life is nothing less than the processed Triune God becoming the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us
In our experience the evil law is defeated, and in Christ we enjoy another law, the highest law, that is, the law of the Spirit of life
Romans 8:4 indicates that when we walk according to the spirit, the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in us
If we walk according to the mingled spirit, the righteous requirement of the law will spontaneously be fulfilled
We do not need to endeavor to obey the law, because the law of the Spirit of life automatically fulfills the demands of the law
When we walk according to the spirit, we have a moral standard that far surpasses the demands of the Mosaic law
When the believers walk according to the spirit, they do not satisfy the lust of the flesh; rather, they bring forth the fruit of the Spirit
We only need to live by the Spirit and walk by the Spirit, and then the Spirit will automatically bring forth the fruit of many virtues
He who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life'
In Galatians 6:8 the Greek word translated 'unto' has the meaning 'with a view to,' implying that a certain matter is our aim
To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the accomplishment of the Spirit's aim, that is, to have the Spirit as our aim
In God's New Testament economy, God, as the Spirit, has given Himself to us; now we should sow unto the Spirit, taking the Spirit as our aim
All our sowing reaps either corruption of the flesh or eternal life of the Spirit; hence, Paul warns us to take care of our sowing
In the second half of verse 8 Paul continues, 'He who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life'
The believers also enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by walking by faith, not by appearance, or sight
Our walk must be a living regulated by the Holy Spirit in our spirit; that is, the Holy Spirit within our spirit regulates our actions
Spontaneously we will fulfill the righteous requirement of the law having a moral standard that far surpasses the demands of the Mosaic law
As the issue of walking by the Spirit, the believers also do not satisfy the lust of the flesh but bring forth the fruit of the Spirit
The Spirit of truth, that is, the Spirit of the divine reality, has convicted the believers concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment
Finally, the Spirit of reality convicts the world concerning judgment, 'because the ruler of this world has been judged'
The judgment in 1611 is related to Satan the devil the author of sin the origin of death the father of sinners and the ruler of the world
God loves the world , and He has no intention of casting man into the lake of fire; this judgment is for the devil
If a person refuses to believe in the Son and remains a companion to Satan then God has no choice but to allow him to suffer Satans judgment
We are Christ's members, living in the organism of the Divine Trinity and participating in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity
The Lord indicated that the disciples were like a woman travailing in birth and that He was the child to be brought forth in resurrection
The believers were born as a newborn child through Christ's going and coming, that is, through His death and resurrection
On the day of resurrection the Lord returned to the disciples and breathed Himself as the Spirit of the divine reality into them
The newborn child is the aggregate of all God's children, or sons , who were born with Him in His resurrection to be His many brothers
The newborn child is the aggregate of all God's children who have been regenerated through Christ's resurrection
Christ and the believers, the vine with its branches, constitute the organism of the Divine Trinity in the divine dispensing
In this vine, this organism, the Triune God lives, expresses Himself, and dispenses Himself into the believers as the branches
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me
The branches of the vine need to abide in the vine; only when the branches abide in the vine can the vine be everything to the branches
Fruit-bearing takes place through the branches abiding in the vine and allowing the vine to abide in the branches
With the vine, the Father is glorified through the expression of the riches of the divine life in fruit-bearing
Without the fruit produced by the branches, the essence, substance, and life of the vine would be hidden and limited
Through living in the organism of the Divine Trinity, the believers participate in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity
In Adam, everyone in the world is born in sin; hence, to not believe in the Son is the unique sin that causes people to perish
In addition, the believers were born as the newborn child through Christ's going and coming-His death and resurrection
Through abiding in Christ the Son we experience and enjoy Him and by abiding in the Son with the Father we become the Fathers expression
Now we want to see that the believers are indwelt by the Spirit and have a share in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity
The Lord's breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples is the fulfillment of His promise that the Spirit of reality would abide in them
When we compare verse 17 with verse 23, we can see that the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-abides in us
We sense that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us because the Father and the Son with the Spirit dwell in us
The Spirit of reality, who is sent by the Son from the Father, comes not only from the Father but also with the Father
When the Spirit comes from the source, it does not mean that He leaves the source, but rather He comes with the source
Although there is distinction among the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the three are one; They cannot be separated, divided, or severed
The Spirit is the reality of Christ to make Christ real in those who believe into Him as their life and life supply
The Spirit is called the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father is and whatever the Son is are realized in the Spirit
The Lord went away through death to change in form, that is, to change from the form of the flesh to the form of the Spirit
After this change, the reality of Christ became the reality of the Spirit, and the Spirit became the Spirit of reality
In John 14:16 the Lord Jesus said, 'I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever'
The Greek word for Comforter is parakletos, meaning 'an advocate, one who is alongside to take care of our cause, our affairs'
In ancient times an advocate was a helper, an advocate, a lawyer, an intercessor, one who took care of someone's need and served him
John 14:16-20 reveals that the Comforter to be given would be the reality of the Comforter who was petitioning the Father
All that the Father has, He gives to the Son; and all that the Son has, the Spirit receives and declares to the believers
By this we see that the Son is the embodiment of the Father and that the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son
We have all three: the Father is the source, the Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son
The fullness of the Father is the Son's fullness, and the life and nature of the Father are the Son's life and nature
In John 16:14 the Lord Jesus spoke of the Spirit of reality: 'He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you'
All that the Father is and has are the Son's; all that the Son is and has obtained have been received by the Spirit
Verses 14 to 15 of chapter 16 reveal the dispensing of the Divine Trinity-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-into the believers
The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to become the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Divine Trinity reaching us
The Lord Jesus prayed in verse 1 of chapter 17: 'Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You'
His divine glory was concealed in His humanity, just as God's shekinah glory was concealed within the tabernacle
On the Mount of Transfiguration His divine glory was temporarily manifested to His disciples from within His flesh
Before the prayer recorded in John 17, He predicted that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him
In verse 24 the Lord said, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
After the Lord Jesus spoke of His glorification, He continued with the Father's house, the vine, and the new man
The glorification of the Son of Man is His dying to produce many grains in resurrection for the constitution of the vine
Not only so, the building of the Father's house equals the cultivation of the vine and also the birth of the new man
The organism of the vine with its branches is for the Son's glorification that the Father may be glorified in Him
The section from verse 23 of chapter 12 to the end of chapter 17 contains the real significance of the divine dispensing
In the divine transformation, we enjoy the divine dispensing for our conformation to the image of God's firstborn Son
The Lord promised this to the disciples in John 14:17 and fulfilled it in 20:22 on the evening of His resurrection
The Son came in the Father's name and is one with the Father; the Spirit is sent in the Son's name and is also one with the Father
The Spirit is called the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father is in the Son and whatever the Son is are realized in the Spirit
Ephesians 5:18 says, 'Be filled in spirit,' and Colossians 3:16 says, 'Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly'
Being filled in spirit is to be filled in our regenerated spirit, the human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God
The words of Peter in Acts 2:40 help us understand how be filled in Ephesians 5:18 is an active-passive matter
Just as God has done everything necessary for us to be saved, He has done everything necessary for us to be filled in our regenerated spirit
We need to empty ourselves completely and give all the room in our spirit, mind, emotion, and will to the indwelling Spirit
If we are filled by the Spirit in our spirit, we will have a proper Christian life, church life, personal life, and family life
We not only need to be filled in spirit by the processed Triune God; we also need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly
The word of the Lord must have adequate room within us so that it may operate and minister the riches of Christ into our inner being
Whenever we come before the written Word we should have the assurance deep within that we are contacting the Lord Himself as the living Word
When we receive the word of Christ, that is, Christ Himself, we should give the word the full freedom to make home in us
Ephesians 5:18 charges us to be filled in spirit by the Triune God; Colossians 3:16 tells us to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly
In Ephesians both the Spirit and our spirit are emphasized again and again; the word is even considered to be the Spirit
According to Ephesians 51820 and Colossians 31617 and the revelation in the New Testament the word is the Spirit and the Spirit is the word
John 11 says In the beginning was the Word and in John 2022 the Lord Jesus breathed into the disciples and said Receive the Holy Spirit
At the beginning of the Gospel of John, the Lord was the Word; at the end of the Gospel, He breathed out the Spirit
Another portion of the Scriptures which proves that the Spirit and the word of God are one is 2 Timothy 316 All Scripture is Godbreathed
The Spirit is the very essence, the substance, of the Scriptures, just as phosphorus is the essential substance in matches
Having the Word without the Spirit is to be lifeless, because apart from the Spirit, the Word is just dead letters
Just as our life and our physical body are one entity, forming a complete, living organism, the Spirit and the Word are one
That which makes the human body living and active is the invisible life within; that which makes the Word living and effectual is the Spirit
We should not be in either of these two extremes; we should be balanced, caring for the Spirit and for the Word
For the divine conformation we, the believers, need to be filled in spirit by the Spirit and let the word of Christ dwell in us richly
To be filled in spirit is to be filled in our regenerated spirit, our human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God
The Spirit is the consummated Triune God reaching man; God always gives the believers the Spirit with the Word
In 4:24 Paul says that we have 'put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality'
It is not individual but corporate , created of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles, and composed of all the believers of different races
In this portion of the Scriptures Paul indicates that our living should be like the living of Jesus, a living full of grace and reality
When we live reality and speak reality , we express God as our reality, and others receive God from us as grace to be their enjoyment
If we would be conformed to the image of Christ, that is, if we would learn Christ, we need both the principles and the details
If we are filled with grace then in place of bitterness wrath anger and clamor we will have kindness patience mercy forgiveness and love
What a difference it makes in our daily living when we are happy and satisfied through the enjoyment of God in Christ as grace!
The phrase the reality is in Jesus refers to the actual condition of the life of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels
In the ungodly walk of the Gentiles, the fallen people, there is vanity , but in the godly life of Jesus there is truth-reality
We, the believers, who are regenerated with Christ as our life and are taught in Him, should learn from Him as the reality is in Jesus
We have learned Christ according to the reality shown in the Gospels, that is, according to the life of the Lord Jesus
When the Lord Jesus lived on the earth, He always walked in reality, in the shining of the divine light, and in the expression of God
As grace and reality are the basic elements in Ephesians 4:17-32, so love and light are the basic elements in 5:1-33
After we have received God as grace and realized Him as truth in the Lord Jesus, we come to Him and enjoy His love and light
In 4:32 God in Christ is our pattern since God's grace and reality expressed in the life of Jesus are taken as the basic elements
The Father as goodness, the Son as righteousness, and the Spirit of reality as truth are all related to the fruit of the light
Love is the inner substance of God that can be sensed, and light is the expressed element of God that can be seen
Love and light should be the inner source of the believers' daily walk; this is the church life according to God's desire
We come to God to enjoy His love and light, taking Christ as the example for our living and walking in love and light as children of light
The fruit of the light is in goodness, righteousness, and truth; it is proof that we are walking as children of light
Such speaking, singing, and psalming are not only the outflow of being filled in spirit but also the way to be filled in spirit
Verse 20 says, 'Giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father'
We should give thanks to God the Father not only in good times but at all times, and not only for good things but for all things
Verse 17 says Whatever you do in word or in deed do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God the Father through Him
If we exercise our whole being to take in the Lord's word, ultimately we will be filled, occupied, and saturated by the living word
According to the context of the following verses in Ephesians 5, being in the fear of Christ is to fear offending Christ as the Head
A life of subjection is a life of being filled in spirit and of speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks
When we speak, sing, praise, and give thanks in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we are willing to submit ourselves to one another
If we are not filled, there will be no speaking, singing, psalming, or thanking of God; consequently, there will be no submission
Ephesians emphasizes the need of spirit-filled ethical relationships for the expression of the Body in the normal church life
If we live in union with Christ by letting His word saturate us, Christ will be expressed through our humanity
The relationship between wives and husbands is connected to the matter of being filled in spirit and letting the word of Christ saturate us
Since Christ is the Head of the church and the Savior of the Body, the wife should be subject to her husband as to the Lord
Ephesians 5:23 says, 'A husband is head of the wife as also Christ is Head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the Body'
In verse 24 Paul says, 'As the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything'
Wives being subject to the husband is the result of being filled in spirit by the Spirit and saturated by the word of Christ
Verse 29 says, 'No one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church'
The first part of the promise is related to prosperity in material blessing; it also refers to living in a peaceful situation
According to this commandment, prosperity and longevity are God's blessings in this life to those who honor their parents
Ephesians 6:4 says, 'Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord'
Raising children requires that the parents give them needed instruction related to human life, family life, and social life
Paul was probably referring to the Old Testament requirement that parents instruct their children with the word of God
In the apostle's time, slaves were purchased by their masters, and their masters had the right over their lives
In Colossians 4:1 he says, 'Masters, grant to your slaves that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven'
In the flesh some may be slaves and others may be masters, but in the eyes of the Lord there is no difference between slaves and masters
When we are filled with the word of Christ, we will be filled with joy so that we will sing and psalm to the Lord
For this, we need to have spirit-filled ethical relationships which come from Christ as our life, not from our natural life
When we are filled in spirit by the Spirit and saturated with the word of Christ, we will spontaneously live a proper human life
