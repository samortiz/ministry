   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE FINAL WARNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 22:6-21 I. THE MESSAGE OF THE ANGEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>REVELATION 22:6-11 A. Revelation 22:6</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"And he said to me, These words are faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show to His slaves the things which must quickly take place."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"These words" refer to the words in the previous verses concerning the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"These words are faithful and true."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Twice in this book the angel declares that these words are faithful and true 21:5; 22:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets" means that the Lord is the God of the spirits of those who are the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Note that the word "spirits" here is plural.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>See also 1 Corinthians 14:12, where "spiritual gifts" KJV should be translated "spirits."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word "spirits" in its plural form always refers to the spiritual gifts which build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These spirits are also spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>See also 1 Corinthians 14:32, where "prophets" and "spirits" are both plural: "The spirits of prophets."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here the spirits of the prophets in both the Old and New Testament times are included.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"The Lord, the God" here refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Compare this with Revelation 1:1: "And He..., sending it by His angel."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"He" here refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 22:6 the Lord God who sends His angel is likewise the Lord Jesus see also 22:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although beginning from 22:6 we have the epilogue, this verse brings us all the way back to the first chapter of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"To show to His slaves."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This book focuses on our individual responsibility before God as slaves, not as children.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"The things which must quickly take place."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some may think that over the past two thousand years God has delayed very long, but what is really long or short is determined by God's "clock," not by our concept of time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>B. Revelation 22:7</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"And behold, I come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this scroll."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The angel speaks in verse 6; the Lord Jesus speaks in verse 7.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The phrase "I come quickly" is mentioned three times in verses 6 through 21 vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>7, 12, 20 for emphasis, so that man would realize that "blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this scroll."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This book is given to man for him to keep; it is for him to put into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Chapter one says to read, hear, and keep, but here only keep is mentioned because, at this point, everything has already been read and heard.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now what remains to be done is keep.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>C. Revelation 22:8</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"And I John am he who hears and sees these things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And when I heard and saw, I fell to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John was moved by the Holy Spirit to see and hear these things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord had instructed him by His angel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now he has a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The "angel" here probably is the same angel in 19:9-10 and 21:9.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"I fell to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the second time John failed 19:10 records the first time .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John only fell down and was about to worship; he had not yet uttered any praises.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The angel stopped him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This shows that Christians should not involve themselves in any prostration which expresses an attitude of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>D. Revelation 22:9</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"And he said to me, Do not do that!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am your fellow slave and a fellow slave of your brothers the prophets and of those who keep the words of this scroll.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Worship God."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord forbids man to worship anyone other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Old Testament as well as in this book, the Lord often appeared as an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But after the millennium, He will no longer appear as an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>E. Revelation 22:10</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"And he said to me, Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this scroll, for the time is near."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This verse clearly indicates that this is a book of prophecy and that it should not be sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Daniel 8:26 and 12:9 say that what was written should be sealed because the book of Daniel is a book of signs.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It covers a long period of time, and it was to be sealed till the end of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The book of Revelation, however, exists at the end of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is here to help man understand and, therefore, should not be sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the parable of the nobleman who went into a far country, the Lord says that when He comes back, He will meet the same servants.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This indicates that the Lord will return soon Luke 19:12-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What does "seal" mean?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>From Matthew 13:10-11 and 13-17 we see that to speak in parables is to seal.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The phrase "Do not seal" here shows that this is not a parable, an illustration, or a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Revelation is not a book of signs or a sealed book, but an open book.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A serious mistake of the historical school of interpretation is to regard the book of Revelation as only a book of signs.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some in the futurist school also consider parts of this book to be signs.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Actually, this book has only about twenty-eight signs, fourteen of which are explained, such as the golden lampstands, the seven stars, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The remaining fourteen are minor points and are easily understood.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Besides these, there are no other signs in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Of what use would this book be if all the things in it were merely signs?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>"For the time is near."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Truly, the time is near!</S>
