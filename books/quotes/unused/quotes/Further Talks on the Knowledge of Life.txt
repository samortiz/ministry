Consisting of twenty-one chapters, this book focuses on the matter of life as the central goal of God in the universe
It also speaks of how God can be life to man and how man can live an overcoming life unto the maturity in life
If we are void of wisdom in our mind, we will not understand spiritual matters even if we have received a revelation in our spirit
Because of inadequate training in mechanical knowledge, however, a student may still not understand what he has seen
We need to see that even if a person has revelation, he may still not have understanding; he must first have wisdom
In order to see revelation and understand the significance of revelation, one must first be equipped with wisdom
While revelation can be seen instantly, wisdom requires preparation over a long period of time; this is the reason we need training
Formerly, when we had problems and needs in our service, we often could not find the way to deal with the problems and meet the needs
When the Holy Spirit enlightens us and gives us an inspiration or a revelation, we will be able to understand it readily
If someone has not received training, he will not be able to understand anything when a factory is opened to him
On the third day, there was plant life, which is the lowest life, a life without consciousness, without feeling
In other words, once human life was created, God's image was with this human life, and God's authority was also committed to this human life
The plant life was produced by the light of the first day, and the animal life was produced by the light of the fourth day
When we come to the tree of life in Genesis 2, we may not realize the kind of life that is referred to by 'the tree of life'
Him refers to the Word in verse 1, which says, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
He also caused the fish of the sea, the cattle of the earth, and the insects and wild animals to come forth according to their kind
The first mention of life in the Bible is in Genesis 2 then Psalm 369 says With You is the fountain of life In Your light we see light
We see a wonderful principle in the Bible life is always spoken of in conjunction with light life accompanies light and life is in the light
Psalm 133 speaks of the brothers dwelling in unity, and at the end it says, 'For there Jehovah commanded the blessing: / Life forever'
The life'; 14:6 says, 'I am the way and the reality and the life'; and 10:10 says, 'I have come that they may have life'
John 511 says This life is in His Son therefore he who has the Son has the life he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life
Although some people say that the Bible speaks of this and others say that the Bible speaks of that, in reality the Bible is a book on life
In the first picture the created life was put in front of the uncreated life so that the former might receive the latter
John went on to say concerning the Son, 'He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life'
The next verse continues, 'But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive'
At that time, because Jesus was not yet resurrected, the Spirit was not yet; however, when Jesus was resurrected, the Spirit came
When we put John chapters 4 and 7 and Romans chapter 8 together, we see that after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit is life
He continued, 'Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves'
We see that there is only one way, one method, for God to mingle Himself with us, and this way, this method, is life
In John 6:27 the Lord Jesus said, 'Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life'
Our need to eat food and drink water signifies our need to eat and drink God, that is, to take God into us by eating Him and drinking Him
In John 6 the Lord told us to work for the food which abides unto eternal life, not for the food which perishes
If we study John 6 carefully, we will see that the Lord came to earth for one purpose-to enter into man and become man's life
After food is taken into us, it is not only mingled with us, but it also becomes our element, our blood and flesh
If God did not come to be our life in this way, He would have no way to mingle Himself with us and work Himself into us
We all know that the entire Bible is about life, but when life is spoken of, eating and drinking are spoken of as well
If God were not our life, He could not be digested in us, joined to us, and mingled with us to become our inward constituents
Since God being our life by being digested, mingled, and constituted into us is a central matter, we need to see more concerning this life
The Son, having passed through His human living on the earth was crucified and resurrected to become the Spirit of life
John 20 says that in the evening of the Lords resurrection He came to the disciples and breathed into them saying Receive the Holy Spirit
The real nature and principle of life is that it is ever-living, ever-existing, indestructible, unchangeable, and incorruptible
He needed a second step, which was to go to the cross so that His flesh would be broken, just as the rock was cleft in the Old Testament
John 7:38 says, 'He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water'
Verse 39 continues, 'But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive'
The Spirit, who is the Lord Himself, has entered into those who believe into Him to become the living water of life in them
In terms of the nature and significance of life in the universe only Gods life is life because only Gods life is eternal and incorruptible
The life in the Father was manifested in the Son among men and realized as the Spirit to enter into man and be experienced by man
The Spirit is the Spirit of life , through whom man can receive life; moreover, the mind set on the Spirit is life
The most that we have are ethics, morality, and philosophies which teach us to be humble, meek, patient, and forbearing
When the Lord Jesus was manifested in the flesh God was manifestedGreat is the mystery of godliness He who was manifested in the flesh
These two verses show that the incarnation of the Lord Jesus is the manifestation and expression of God as well as life
John 1:1 says, 'In the beginning was the Word'; this speaks of the very beginning and says that the Word was God
Since we are begotten of God, His being our life is His begetting of us, and His begetting of us is His regenerating of us
When we think of the fact that God has begotten us, do we have a deep sense that we should jump up and praise God?
In this story, dead and exhaustible water became endless and inexhaustible wine; this is the changing of death into life
To be regenerated is to be born again following our original human birth; it is to have the life of God in addition to our human life
The source of life is the Father, the expression of life is the Son, and the entering in of life is the Spirit
Chapter 1 says that those who received the Lord were begotten of God, and chapter 3 says that they were born of the Spirit
Chapter 1 speaks of being begotten of God, chapter 3 speaks of being born of the Spirit, and in chapter 4 we see that 'God is Spirit'
Over the past two thousand years, Christianity has never seen such a revelation concerning the Spirit begetting the spirit
If we are not clear about these basic points, it will be very difficult for us to understand the fellowship of life
Life is in our spirit, the mingled spirit, which is the mingling of the Spirit of God with our human spirit to be our life
Now if we go to chapter 20, we will see that the Lord 'breathed into' the disciples and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
May these words be deeply engraved in our heart and be thoroughly apprehended in our mind so that they may shine forth as light within us
If our love does not give people the feeling of the presence of God and the flavor of God, then it is merely good behavior, a human virtue
We should not think in this way rather we should touch these virtues with our spiritual sense and smell them according to our spiritual nose
If we cannot sense the element of God and smell the flavor of God, then only man's good behavior is being manifested, not life
All our goodness, virtues, and merits cannot substitute for God, because anything that is not of God is not life
All our goodness and virtues are life only if they have the flavor of God; likewise, they are life only if they have the flavor of Christ
Life is the Triune God Himself-the Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the entering
When we put these four verses together, we see that in order for God to come to be our life, He must regenerate us
If God were only God and not the Spirit, He would have no way to enter into us and beget us, and neither would He be able to be our life
If God were not the Word, He could not come among us, and if He were not the Spirit, He could not come into us
He became the Word so that He could be manifested among us, and He became the Spirit so that He could enter into us
God's begetting of us is the Spirit's begetting in our spirit; therefore, God comes into our spirit to beget us
John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and that our contact with Him must be in spirit; we must worship and touch Him in spirit
In order to be our life, He enters into our spirit as the Spirit to beget us; hence, all our contact with Him must be in our spirit
If a man has only life, if he has only a spirit and a soul but not a body, people will not be able to contact and touch him
Similarly, without the words of God, the Spirit of God is without a 'body,' so it is hard for man to touch Him
In consideration of our weakness and in order that we may touch the Holy Spirit in a solid way, God gives us the Word
The Spirit of God cannot be separated from the words of God, just as the spirit and soul of a person cannot be separated from his body
There are many words of God in the Bible, and as long as men open their heart to receive these words, the Spirit will enter into them
When we come to John 7, we see that the Spirit who enters into man will flow out of man's innermost being as rivers of living water
Like a seed, the word of the Lord is tangible, but within it is the intangible life of God; wherever it is sown, it will blossom
When the word of God, which can be compared to a seed, is sown into the field of the heart of man, the life of God will grow
Although life is hidden in the Lord's words, the Spirit must be in the words in order for the words to have life
Without the Lord's Spirit, the Lord's words are without life; the Lord's words must have the Lord's Spirit to have the Lord's life
Verse 6 says That which is born of the Spirit then verses 15 and 16 say that those who are born of the Spirit have the eternal life of God
In chapter 4 the Lord spoke with the Samaritan woman about the matter of the living water which issues from the eternal life
The Lord particularly said, 'God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness'
To touch life by drinking the living water of life, one must contact and worship God, who is Spirit, by being in spirit
In verses 50 and 51 the Lord said that He is the bread which came down out of heaven, indicating that He is man's food
They wondered how the Lord could give His flesh for man to eat and how man could have life by eating His flesh
In John 1224 the Lord said Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies it abides alone but if it dies it bears much fruit
For the grain of wheat to bear much fruit is for it to bring forth many grains, that is, for it to enter into many grains
It contains a record only of His becoming flesh, passing through death, and making a turn to come into us and live in us
In chapter 7 the Lord linked resurrection the Holy Spirit and glorification The Spirit was not yet because Jesus had not yet been glorified
In the beginning the Lord's life was intangible, but one day, the Word, who was in the beginning, became flesh and tabernacled among us
Chapter 14 says that when the Spirit of reality comes, He will abide with us and be in us; this abiding is an eternal abiding
In summary, from the Gospel of John we see that the Lord in us is life, that He became the Spirit so that He can live in us
All these items are the functions of life, and they are also the resurrected Christ as the content of life in us
If we would know the content of life, we need to know these six points; nearly all the contents of life can be found in these six points
When the Spirit of resurrection enters into man, He convicts man concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment
Concerning sin is related to Adam, concerning righteousness is related to Christ, and concerning judgment is related to Satan
The Holy Spirit shows man his sinful condition in Adam, and then He shows man that he can be justified in Christ
We were sinners in Adam, but we can be transferred into Christ and be justified rather than following Satan and coming under God's judgment
The Holy Spirit convicts us inwardly concerning these three points so that we may repent and confess our sins for our regeneration
The purpose of the Lord's prayer in John 17 is to ask God to fulfill the story of life spoken of in the previous chapters
In chapter 18 the Lord was betrayed and judged, in chapter 19 He died and was buried, and in chapter 20 He was resurrected
In resurrection He came into the midst of the disciples, breathed into them, and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
Because the Lord was resurrected and He became the Spirit, the disciples could receive Him as easily as breathing
If we would simply inhale Him as in breathing, He would immediately come into us to be our life; in resurrection, He becomes so available
In chapter 20 the Lord's breathing into the disciples seems to be a small matter; actually, it is a great matter
The story of life and all spiritual reality are in the Spirit, and the Spirit, like air, is always available to us
Once we breathe in the Holy Spirit, we have all the stories of life, such as the Lord's incarnation and His death and resurrection
All the content of life, the aspects of life, and the spiritual stories in John 1 through 20 are included in the Holy Spirit in chapter 20
All we have to do is breathe Him in pray to Him change our concept repent confess our sins and worship Him and we will instantly obtain Him
We simply need to have a small amount of spiritual breathing, and the Holy Spirit will come into us immediately
Chapter 1 speaks of the Word that was in the beginning, and chapter 6 speaks of the words which the Lord has spoken to us
It shows that the Word in chapter 1 is the Lord Himself and that the words in chapter 6 are something that comes out from the Lord
The words in chapter 6 are Christ who has become the Spirit; they are Christ on the one hand and the Spirit on the other
The great Word in chapter 1 is God manifested among us as life, but He still cannot enter into us to be our life
We see the function of the Word and the words: the former manifests Him among us as life, and the latter enters into us as life
The 'great Word' is displayed for us to see in chapter 1, but the 'small words' are for us to eat and enjoy in chapter 6
The Lamb we see on display outside of us has become 'meat' on the table for our enjoyment; these are the different functions of the word
He not only has been manifested among us as life; now He can be eaten, received, and digested by us to become life in us
When the Lord was manifested, He was shown and displayed, but He could not be enjoyed by us because He had not yet become our life
In other words, in the Spirit of resurrection are God, Christ, incarnation, death, resurrection, and humanity in resurrection
The Spirit of resurrection is Christ in another form; therefore, when the Spirit is in us, Christ is living in us
Many stories about the Lord Jesus cannot be understood by unbelievers or comprehended by those who read the Bible merely with their eyes
Everything concerning Christ-what He was, what He did, and what He said-is made clear to us by the Spirit in this third function
The Spirit in us makes all that God is in Christ real to us; this is shown in chapter 16-God in Christ has come to be everything to us
If we do not have the Spirit of resurrection in us, God as life would only be terminology, mere sayings to us, but not a reality
The totality of these six points is the work that the Spirit of resurrection does in us, and this is also the content of life
Concerning sin, the Spirit shows people that they will be condemned if they remain in Adam and do not believe in the Lord
Concerning righteousness, the Spirit shows people that they can be justified by believing in Christ because God has accomplished redemption
Concerning judgment the Spirit shows people that they will be judged in the future if they follow Satan because Satan has been judged by God
When people see these matters concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment, they are convicted to repent and receive the Savior
The Spirit enters into them to regenerate them, and from this time onward, the Spirit carries out these six things continuously within them
Without even speaking of the Christians who are not among us many saints who meet with us have a shallow and limited knowledge of the Spirit
In the Gospel of John we can see that life and the Spirit, the Spirit and life, are one; they are joined together and cannot be separated
The Spirit spoken of in Romans 8:16 is a mingled spirit, that is, the Spirit on God's side and the spirit on man's side mingled as one
When we focus on the story of the spirit, we should not focus merely on the Spirit of God or the spirit of man
To experience the Spirit is to experience God in Christ as our life; in other words, it is to experience the Spirit operating in us
To experience the Spirit is to experience God in Christ as our life, that is, to experience the Spirit operating in us
There are two reasons that man must be regenerated: one reason relates to a higher purpose, and the other to a lower
We must be regenerated because we do not have the life of God; only by regeneration can we have the uncreated, eternal life of God
We must have the eternal life of God because it is God's intention to make us the same as He is with His image and likeness
Regeneration means to be born again, to be born of God, that is, to obtain the life of God in addition to our human life
The meaning of regeneration is to be born again of God to be regenerated is to obtain the life of God in addition to our original human life
Our apprehension of this spiritual truth must be clear, and when we speak of regeneration, we must make this point
When we receive the Spirit, we receive Christ and God because God is in Christ, and Christ has become the Spirit
All its inward capabilities and functions issue from its life, and all its outward activities and expressions also originate from its life
Whatever He does and expresses, whether it is goodness, righteousness, kindness, or forgiveness, is also derived from His life
The fullness of the Godhead and the nature of God Himself are contained in the life of God because the life of God is the content of God
God is love, and His ways are righteous; consequently, God's love and righteous ways can be ours because the life of God is in us
When the Lord Jesus entered into death, all of its power tried to hold Him, but He broke through the holding power of death and arose
The Bible shows that God has two kinds of power: one is the great power of creation, and the other is the great power of resurrection
God's great power of creation calls things not being as being, and His great power of resurrection gives life to the dead
One involves the hand of creation, and the other involves the resurrection life, which is also the life of God
Through regeneration, God has wrought His life into us, which means that He has wrought His great resurrection power into us
Just as God is able to overcome death, we also are able to overcome death because of the great power of this life within us
As far as His power is concerned, the great power of this resurrection life can overcome death and surpass every negative thing
Because the life of God has entered into us, the law of life that is contained in this life has also been brought into us
When the life of God enters into us, it brings the natural law that is contained in it, and this law becomes the law of life within us
Since we have gained the life of God through regeneration, we have also gained the law of His life through regeneration
Because the laws which are written in us are the natural abilities and natural laws of the life of God, the Bible calls them laws
Taking away our heart of stone and giving us a heart of flesh means that He gives us a new heart by renewing our old heart
Our heart is the organ of our inclination and affection; it represents us with regard to our inclination, affection, delight, and desire
When God regenerates us, He renews our heart and makes our heart a new heart with new inclinations, new affections, and new delights
God renews our heart and gives us a new heart through regeneration because He wants us to incline toward Him, adore Him, and desire Him
The Spirit of God enlivens our spirit by putting the life of God, which is the element of God, into our spirit
The first point involves the absence of the element of God, and the second point involves the defilement and corruption by Satan and sin
On one hand, He uses the blood of the Lord Jesus to cleanse the defilement of our spirit so that our spirit becomes clean
On the other hand, He puts His life into our spirit through His Spirit so that our spirit may have His element
The heart can function to love God and thirst for God, but it does not have the ability to contact God or touch Him
Our new heart enables us to have new delights and inclinations and new feelings and interests toward God and the things of God
Our new spirit, however, enables us to have new contact and insight and new spiritual ability and function toward God and the things of God
When our heart loves God, our spirit touches Him, and when our heart delights in the things of God, our spirit understands them
He also put His Spirit into our spirit, causing His Spirit to dwell in our new spirit, which has been made alive
He is the indwelling Spirit, the Comforter, the Spirit of reality, the Spirit of life, the seal, the pledge, and the anointing
In the Old Testament, God only caused His Spirit to come from without to work upon man; He did not cause His Spirit to dwell within man
After the Lord's death and resurrection, God has given His Spirit to us and caused His Spirit to dwell in us as the indwelling Spirit
He is able to reveal both God and Christ to us from within so that in Christ we may enjoy the fullness of the Godhead
The Lord said in John 14:16-17 that He would ask the Father to give us the Spirit, who would dwell in us as another Comforter
The Greek word for Comforter is the same as the word Advocate in 1 John 2:1, which means 'an advocate by the side'
In John 14:16-17 the Lord said that the Spirit who would come to dwell in us as another Comforter would be 'the Spirit of reality'
God in His salvation has regenerated us so that we might receive His life, have His nature, and thereby be like Him entirely
Although His Spirit puts His life in us and enables us to know, experience, and live out His life, this life is Christ
When we grow in His life into His image and become like Him we grow into the image of God and become like God because He is the image of God
His dwelling in us as our life means that He will cause us to grow and become like God and have the image of God through the life of God
The innate ability of life, the natural capability of life, or we may say, the law of life, regulates us from within according to God
Because the life of God is the highest life, the innate ability and the natural law within God's life are the strongest
According to the innate ability of our new heart, our heart now inclines toward God, loves God, and desires God
When God regenerated us, He renewed our heart, causing it to incline toward God, delight in God, desire God, and love God
The nature of our new spirit is living; our new spirit is our old, deadened spirit which has been renewed and enlivened
In this way our deadened spirit became a new and living spirit this new living spirit has been restored in its function and use toward God
On the other hand, if we have a willing heart but an unexercised spirit, we still will not be able to contact God
We need to be trained in different aspects related to the spirit, because this involves matters that are not so simple
God's renewing of our heart is for our heart to be softened, and His renewing of our spirit is for our spirit to be enlivened
When we stamp something onto a piece of paper with a seal, the impression on the paper is exactly the same as the impression on the seal
There is now a mark upon us because we have been sealed by the Holy Spirit with all that God is; this mark is God Himself as a seal upon us
Some people ask, 'How does the work of the Spirit in us differ from the work of Christ in us and the work of God in us'?
A painter coats chairs and tables repeatedly with paint, and in the end, the chairs and tables have the gloss and color of the paint
In the New Testament we cannot find the word moving in relation to the Spirit; however, the New Testament does speak of the anointing
When we anoint someone, it may be likened to applying paint on him, which eventually causes a certain element to be added into him
They do not have much spiritual growth because after they are 'moved' by the Spirit, they remain who they are, and the Lord remains the Lord
No one could make an imitation of the anointing oil; it had to be prepared absolutely according to the way shown by God
If the Holy Spirit anoints him in his speaking, not only will those who hear gain something, but the speaker will gain something even more
When the Holy Spirit anoints him inwardly in his speaking, he receives the Spirit and he receives more of the element of God
After speaking, God will be increased in him, and the more he speaks, the more the element of God will be added into him
Strength is in contrast to weakness, satisfaction to emptiness, liveliness to depression, brightness to darkness, and rest to pain
Being right or wrong, which is according to the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, is a fallen thought in Christianity
The sense of life within us is not related to right or wrong; rather, it guides and proves us according to peace
It is a matter of whether we are doing them according to the leading of the Holy Spirit in us or according to ourselves
When we do things according to our inner sense, do we touch God and life or do we sense darkness and depression?
Being right or wrong is altogether a fallen thought that belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
The sense of life involves whether our speaking is in God or outside of God and whether we are touching God in our speaking
The inner sense of life still tests and proves whether our prayer is in spirit or outside the spirit and whether it touches God
If we pray outside of God and outside of the spirit, we are praying in death, and this prayer will be dry, depressed, weak, dark, and empty
If we pray in our spirit however our prayer will be a prayer in life and we will feel lively comfortable strong bright satisfied and at ease
Even those around us will sense strength, liveliness, satisfaction, brightness, and comfort when they hear our prayer
We must be clear that good things as well as bad things are related to death; both right things and wrong things are related to death
That you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ'
At the beginning of 1 John 1, the apostle John says that he reported the life of God so that we would receive the fellowship of this life
The life of God rests in the Holy Spirit of God, and the life of God enters into us and lives in us through the Holy Spirit
Even though the fellowship brought to us by the life of God is derived from the life of God, it comes to us by means of the Holy Spirit
The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is a mingling; it mingles God with us and brings us into God through fellowship
The fellowship of the Holy Spirit, the fellowship of life, causes us to become one with God, to be mingled with God
Any one portion of the blood in our body is not the blood of simply that one part or the blood of the whole body; it is flowing blood
The continuous movement of the dials on the electric meter shows that electric current is flowing continuously
The life within us is connected to God who is on the throne in heaven, to Paul, to Brother Nee, to myself, and to you
We are all connected to one another, just as electricity in a light bulb is connected to the electricity in another light bulb
The function or use of the fellowship of life is to inwardly supply us with all that is in the life of God, with all that is in God
Since this life is the content of God, even God Himself, it supplies us with the content of God and even God Himself when it flows in us
As soon as the fellowship of life is interrupted, the sense of life causes us to feel a loss of the supply of life
When the fellowship of life is not interrupted, however, the sense of life causes us to feel the supply of life
Whether we are living in the fellowship of life and have the supply of life depends entirely on the sense of life
The more we live in the fellowship of life, the keener is the sense of life and the more we will sense the supply of life
Consequently, the most that this defiled and damaged goodness can provide is a consciousness of good in the conscience
A saved person, a normal Christian, in contrast to an unbeliever, has an additional sense-the divine sense of God's life
The better a person is, the stronger his inner sense will be, and the more evil a person is, the weaker his inner sense will be
It is easier for an unbeliever to commit sin than it is for a believer, because within a believer there is a strong sense to resist sin
Even if a car is traveling at a high speed, as soon as a driver steps on the brakes, the car will quickly come to a halt
Man's inner sense of life is indeed a great thing; the stronger the inner sense of life, the more operative it will be
If a person does not know how to use the brakes properly, it is certain that he will eventually have an accident
Similarly, if we do not take care of and follow the inner sense, it is possible for us to do all kinds of bad things
On one hand this fellowship is with us referring to the apostles and on the other hand it is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ
The life of God depends on the Holy Spirit, and it is through the Holy Spirit that this life enters and lives in us
Even though the fellowship of God's life is derived from the life of God, it comes by means of the Holy Spirit
On one hand the life of God enters into us through the Holy Spirit on the other hand the Holy Spirit causes us to experience the life of God
The Spirit of God moves, requires, and urges us within, causing us to have the fellowship which comes from the life of God
If we desire to have the fellowship of life, we must not only have the life of God but also live in the Spirit
The life of God is the source of the fellowship of life, and the Spirit is the means of the fellowship of life
Although the life of God gives us the fellowship of life, it is the Spirit who causes us to practically enjoy this fellowship of life
The fellowship of life supplies us with all that God is, but we know whether we are in this fellowship by the sense of life
Since life is in the Spirit, we need to know how to touch the Spirit in order to practice the fellowship of life
If we do not know how to touch the Spirit, we will not be able to touch the fellowship of life that is in the Spirit
After many years of seeking and studying we eventually realized that the most important manifestation of the Spirit in us is the inner sense
The taste of salt and the taste of sugar are invisible to us; we can only discern them by exercising our sense of taste
If we put a glass of warm water next to a glass of cold water, how can we tell which one is warm and which one is cold?
Others may speak casually and frivolously, but he is dignified and steady; others may dress sloppily, but he is neat and clean
The stronger a person's life is, the more he will live according to the inner sense, and the more normal his living will be
The fellowship of life requires us to touch the Spirit, but in order to touch the Spirit, we must touch the inner sense
For us to have the fellowship of life, we must touch the Spirit, and for us to touch the Spirit, we must touch the inner sense
When we speak concerning touching the Spirit, the Spirit we are speaking of is the Spirit of God mingled with our spirit as one spirit
Now, however, the Spirit of God has entered into our spirit, and we can definitely say that the Spirit is in our spirit
The soul is a distraction to the spirit; hence, to touch the spirit, we must be delivered from the soul and reject the soul
Because our soul is composed of the mind emotion and will to reject the soul is to reject the distractions from our mind emotion and will
Whenever we get out of the Spirit, the fellowship will be cut off, because for us to touch the fellowship, we must touch the Spirit
At these times, we should learn to touch the sense of the Spirit in us, follow the Spirit, and pray according to the sense of the Spirit
When we pray according to our thoughts even if we are praying for good and godly things we will feel weak depressed dark empty and in pain
When we have these feelings within, we are praying in the Spirit, and we are in the fellowship because we have touched the Spirit
In other words, fellowship is of life, and life is in the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is in our spirit
Since these five items are of life, the sense they produce can only be called the sense of life, not the sense of anything else
The main purpose of the Triune God in us is to be life to us, and the function of this life is the law of life
From these verses, we see that the Spirit is related to anointing, Christ is related to living, and God is related to operating
The Spirit's anointing us is to anoint us with God Himself so that the element of God can increase in us by being added into us
When Romans 8 speaks of the Spirit it indicates that life is related to the Spiritthe Spirit of life and the mind of the Spirit is life
The Spirit of life is called the Spirit of life because the element of the Spirit is life; life is the content of the Spirit
The law of the Spirit of life' in Romans 8:2 shows that the Spirit is not only related to life but also to law
We see electric lamps emitting light, but the light is not electricity itself; it is a manifestation of electricity
Life is a manifestation of the Spirit, and the law of the Spirit of life is also a manifestation of the Spirit
Gradually we realized that the Spirit like electricity is intangible so we can know the Spirit only through the manifestations of the Spirit
The first is life; the second, law; the third, peace; and the fourth, death, which is in contrast to life and peace
Although we cannot know the Spirit by the Spirit Himself, we can know the Spirit through these four manifestations
Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit; this means that the two spirits have been mingled together
There are three elements in the Spirit of life: the Spirit of God, the spirit of man, and the life of God; the three are one
When we mix syrup into water, the sugar element in the syrup is also mixed into the water; thus, the syrup becomes sweetened fruit juice
When this life in the three-in-one spirit gives us the sense of the presence of God, it gives us a sense of the Spirit
When we live in our mind rather than our spirit, we lose the fellowship, because fellowship is only in the spirit
Only by living in our spirit can we touch the fellowship, because fellowship is of life, and life is in the spirit
We must learn the basic lesson of turning from the mind to the spirit, from the emotion to the spirit, and from the will to the spirit
We must learn these three 'turnings': turning from the mind, turning from the emotion, and turning from the will to the spirit
When our emotion is active and wants to control our being, we need to turn to our spirit so that our emotion loses its ground
A person who lives in and by the spirit is a spiritual person; he can comprehend, discern, and understand the spiritual things of God
When Romans 8 speaks of death, it emphasizes its connection to sin; hence, to be freed from the flesh is to be freed from sin
In order to be delivered from sin we need to be delivered from the flesh in order to be delivered from the flesh we must live in the spirit
If we live in the spirit, the spirit will free us so that we can be delivered from sin; this is the center of the book of Romans
When Romans 8 speaks of the flesh, it emphasizes the connection of the flesh to sin and the flesh being a matter of committing sins
When 1 Corinthians 2 speaks of the soul, however, it does not mention the problem of sin; rather, it speaks of knowing spiritual things
Corinthians 2 speaks of understanding spiritual things, knowing the things of God, serving God, and touching the things of God
A soulish person in 1 Corinthians 2 is not a person who does not sin but one who does not understand the things of the Spirit
Although he does not live by the flesh, neither does he live by the spirit; he is living in the place in between, that is, in his soul
The focus in Romans 8, however, is on being delivered from sin, and the focus in 1 Corinthians 2 is on understanding spiritual things
In Romans 8 being spiritual is versus being fleshly; in 1 Corinthians 2 being spiritual is versus being soulish
A person who lives by his soul may be good, proper, and nice, but he does not understand or desire spiritual things
Their assessment of themselves and others is based on the ethical standards of good or evil and right or wrong
They may have a clear mind and be very rational, but they are unclear in their spirit and dull in their feeling
They know how to behave and how to handle things, and they are also intelligent, efficient, diligent, and thoughtful
They are often indifferent to spiritual things and are not only slow in understanding them but also slothful in pursuing them
Others can sense their goodness, but they cannot sense the spirit; they can see their virtues, but they cannot smell the flavor of God
If we meet a person who is directed by the mind, the most prominent part of his being will be his mind, his thought, and his intellect
Whether they are directed by the mind the emotion or the will they are soulish as long as they are directed by any of these three faculties
His innermost sense should have the most important position, the leading position; it should direct his mind, emotion, and will
In other words, his inner sense is the dominating factor, and his mind, emotion, and will are merely supportive
Since man is an emotional being, some saints who work for the Lord use emotions to touch people according to their emotion
It may be especially difficult for him to talk with us because it seems that he does not have a good feeling about us
Out of concern that this may not be enough to move him, we will add a deluxe edition of Streams in the Desert and a hymnal of selected hymns
According to our emotion, we may have a feeling to give people a Bible, Streams in the Desert, or a hymnal because they are good books
At some point, however, we may sense that we are only in our emotions rather than loving one another and fellowshipping in the Lord
If we say that we are short of strength and can be touched only by the problems of one brother, this shows that we are in our emotions
When we contact the saints in our emotion, there may be a deep feeling which makes us uneasy as our spirit rises up to protest and object
Problems with the mind are evident mainly among the brothers because they often have a strong will and logical thinking
When brothers desire to do a certain thing, they can argue one way or another, and both ways can seem reasonable
Although the way seems reasonable according to observation and analysis, deep within us we can sense that something is not right
When he is about to speak, he may sense within that something is not right, even to the point of needing to change to another topic
At this moment, he should not follow his original consideration and decision; instead, he should follow the sense in his spirit
If he ignores the inward sense and follows his original consideration, he will be denying the spirit and living in the soul
Although we will have thoughts in our mind and feelings in our emotion about a certain matter, we still need to turn to our spirit
We should not let our emotion, mind, and will dominate our being; rather, we should let the sense in our spirit be the leading factor
In order to touch the fellowship and learn to fellowship, we need to turn our being from the mind, emotion, and will to our spirit
A certain saint may decide to go to Bangkok but even though this decision has been made he should be willing to let go of it and not insist
As he turns to his innermost part, prostrating himself before God and quieting himself, he should not think about Bangkok or his decision
He will learn how to turn from his will to the spirit to touch the feeling of the spirit in this matter specifically
The word consume comes from 2 Corinthians 416 which says Though our outer man is decaying yet our inner man is being renewed day by day
In verse 7 the apostle Paul says, 'We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God'
Earthen vessels does not refer merely to our body but to us; this treasure refers to God and His life, that is, Christ and His life
The outer man being consumed means that our self is being consumed; that is, our mind, emotion, and will are being consumed
A brother may have a great intellect, a strong mind, and clear thinking, but all of these can frustrate the pneumatic Christ in him
Before he was dealt with by God, his thinking was always sharp, and his clear mind could reason out everything
He thinks that he will be successful if he does things in a certain way, yet it turns out to be a complete failure
Such a dealing tears down his mind to the extent that when he encounters another matter, he does not dare rely on his mind
At one time his legs could run very well; moreover, he had a mind that was able to think of many ways to fight and supplant
Such ones do not know how to touch the feeling of God, nor do they know how to live in the spirit rather than in their mind
When they encounter similar situations in the future, their spirit will spontaneously occupy the leading position
In the same principle, God strikes our emotion to the extent that it fails us, and we no longer have any confidence in it
At such a time, our spirit will spontaneously occupy the leading position and have preeminence over our emotion
In 2 Corinthians 4712 Paul says We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us
For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh
When God raises up an environment so that we are pressed on every side and cast down, the death of Jesus begins to operate in us
If God desires this sister to grow in spirit, He must stretch out His hand to deal with her emotional love for her daughter
Paul says that the putting to death of Jesus operates in us so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our body
Suppose a brother is facing many difficulties: his family suffers much affliction, and even the brothers and sisters around him trouble him
His outer man was torn down by God through sufferings so that his inner man, the spirit in him, could grow and be renewed
He still encounters failures and difficulties as God raises up sufferings from every side to trouble, afflict, wound, and strike him
When God's breaking work is almost complete, he will realize that there is very little element of God in his so-called gospel work
It is not possible to discern the spirit from the soul merely by listening to a message or by praying for a certain amount of time
God's hand must come in to strike and break us until there is nothing left to be stricken and broken and until we are hopeless
We must wait until Gods hand comes to strike and break us so that we can realize that what we think is of the spirit is actually of the soul
We often have a wrong concept that if we love the Lord and please Him, we will not have sufferings and will have only peace and prosperity
The more a person loves the Lord, is simple toward the Lord, pursues the Lord, and lives in the Lord, the more he seemingly suffers
Doctrines can never edify people; rather, a person who is broken and torn down by God can edify people and minister to them
After a person is repeatedly smitten, broken, and torn down by God, his mind, will, and emotion are bankrupt and no longer have any power
These three lives-the life of man, the life of Satan, and the life of God-exist simultaneously within a saved one
Before his fall in the garden of Eden, Adam was created by God; thus, God's creation was the first great event
Tempted by Satan, man then ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and became fallen; thus, he received Satan's life
A third great event, however, happened to the believers; this great event is salvation through which God's life enters into the believers
These three great events within a believer have brought in three different lives: the created human life, Satan's life, and God's life
The three prepositions-from, through, and into-in these three simple sentences involve many complicated stories
God desires man for the accomplishment of His will, and Satan wants man for the fulfillment of his evil intention
God's intention was for man to eat the fruit of the tree of life and thus obtain His uncreated life and be joined to Him
The created life of man is in man's soul, the fallen life of Satan is in his body, and the uncreated life of God is in his spirit
When man fell, he ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which signifies Satan, and received it into his body
The body as the outer, physical part of man is visible and tangible, and it enables us to contact the external, physical world
Although the spirit consists of the conscience, intuition, and fellowship, fellowship is not related to a sense
The created life is in our soul, having sense organs related to the mind and emotion, which are known simply as self-consciousness
Satan's life is in our body, which includes the five senses of seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and touching
The life of man was originally innocent and simple without knowledge of sin because after man was created he was very good in Gods eyes
In the garden of Eden Adam had only one life, that is, the created human life, and he led a good and upright living
After the fall of man, man began to have two kinds of life-man's life and Satan's life, that is, the created life and the fallen life
In response to Satan's temptation, man took in the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and was corrupted
Consequently mans inner being has become a place where man and the devil are mixed and mans living is a mixed living of man and the devil
A saved person has three different lives: man's life, the devil's life, and God's life; hence, he can have three different kinds of living
God desires that we eat of the tree of life, but Satan entices us to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
We have seen clearly that there are three different lives in us-the created life, the fallen life, and the divine life
Not every heart of love is God Himself, but when God is lived out, love is definitely lived out, because God is love
We must reject not only the evil life of Satan but also our good life in order to live in the divine life of God
We also need to learn to reject our life of doing good in the same way that we reject Satan's life of doing evil
If an unsaved person tried to deny himself and to reject Satan, he would have nothing to live by and thus could not live
If a believer rejects Satan and denies himself, God will still have ground in him, and God will be lived out from within him
When we lose our human life, the evil life of Satan with which we have been involved will be lost automatically
Hatred toward the brothers is the manifestation of Satan's life, but our intention to love the brothers is a manifestation of our own life
When we reject Satan's life and also our own life, we are standing in the place of death, putting ourselves to death by the Holy Spirit
Christians need to arrive at a point where they have been put to death, being able to neither commit sins nor do good
When we do not know love or hatred and cannot do good or do evil, God is lived out, and God's life will come out from within us
We must have these two levels of rejection so that God's life, the life on the third level, can be lived out of us
Learning the fellowship of life is not about living a life of goodness but living the life of God, the life of Christ
When we touch the fellowship of life, we are not in the realm of evil or in the realm of good; we are in Christ
In order to learn to fellowship and to deny ourselves, we must deny ourselves in relation to not only evil things but also good things
We need to ponder all these matters point by point and calmly remain in a spirit of prayer to touch the proper way of life
The other three are inside of us-the law of good in the mind, the law of sin in the members, and the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit
Since we have three different lives within us, we have three laws corresponding to these three different lives
Nothing good dwells,' many Christians, both in the East and the West, conclude that absolutely nothing good dwells in us
With every life there is a law, and the law of a particular life always corresponds with the nature of the life
Since the nature of our good life is good, the function and nature of its law are also good; hence, this law is the law of good
Although our good life has been damaged and defiled because of the fall, it cannot be damaged and defiled to the point of obliteration
Sometimes we cannot do the good that we desire, because even though we have the good life, this life has been damaged and made powerless
In the light of God, we can see that the good we live according to the life of God is absolutely different from the good in our created life
If we did not have any element of good before we were saved, we would all be like poisonous snakes and fierce beasts
In the past, they applied their forbearance to their social life; now they apply their forbearance to their coordination and service
Very often, we simply apply spiritual terms to the goodness of our natural life and regard it as being spiritual
We are not able to discern between the goodness that comes out of our natural life from that of the life of God
If another person who is gentle in his temperament and proper in his character becomes a Christian, he will bring glory to the church'
Because the nature of the life of God that enters into our spirit is life, the nature and functions of its law are also life
The created life of man is in the soul, the fallen life of Satan is in the body, and the life of God is in the spirit of every believer
Each of these lives has its own law: the law of God's life, the law of man's life, and the law of Satan's life
These four groups of three-three parts of man, three persons, three lives, and three laws-require our proper understanding
The second law is the law of good; its nature is good, and it matches the nature of the law of God outside of us
Today we not only have the law of good that comes from the life of man but also the law of sin that comes from the life of Satan
The law of sin in our members rises up to oppose the law of good in our mind and causes us to fail continually
Whenever the law of God demands, the law of good in us echoes its approval, but at the same time, the law of sin interferes
Those who are not saved can never keep or fulfill the law of God because they do not have the law of the Spirit of life
When the life of God comes in, it comes with a higher and stronger law, that is, the law of the Spirit of life
They still endeavor to do good and improve themselves; they think that through more prayer they can become stronger so that they can do good
On the one hand, they cultivate the element of goodness in their soul, and on the other hand, they try to restrain the lusts in their flesh
These are the two efforts in religious and moral cultivation; these are also the methods used by man for the improvement of behavior
God's salvation is not to make us good men but to make us God-men who live out God-God mingles Himself with us and lives out from us
Precisely speaking, God is Spirit, so those who worship Him must worship in spirit, that is, they must contact Him in spirit
These matters are being explained in great detail so that we may learn the lesson of spiritual fellowship in a proper way
Their living and work, their message and prayer, and their contact and conversation with others are all according to the inner sense
To obey the inner sense is to obey the law of life, to obey the law of life is to obey the Spirit, and to obey the Spirit is to obey God
Ultimately, what we live out, what we express, and what people touch and sense from us will be life, which is God Himself
When God comes to shine on us and give us revelation, we need to stop our being; we need to stop our desire and effort to do good
In this way, the law of the Spirit of life within us will operate and manifest its functions, and we also will be full of spiritual feelings
When God created man, He gave him only the created human life; He did not give man His life which is the uncreated life of God
God created life for man, but He did not give man His own life; however, He prepared a spirit in man as an organ to receive Him
If we did not have a stomach, it would be impossible for food to enter into us; hence, God created a stomach so that we can receive food
Regardless of whether we are speaking of God Himself or the life of God, He is the Spirit, and His life is the Spirit
To speak of the spirit being deadened does not mean that the spirit no longer exists; rather, it means that the spirit has lost its function
The main point concerning God's creation of man is that God created a spirit within man in order for man to receive Him
The most important point concerning God's salvation is the enlivening of our spirit so that we can receive Him
In other words, our deadened spirit is not only enlivened, but the element of God's life has also been added to it
Is it correct to say that salvation means recovering what Adam lost, that is, recovering man to his original condition before the fall?
Our condition is even better because we have a treasure that Adam did not have-we have the life of God and the Spirit in us
At the time of the Lord Jesus' coming back, that is, at the time of our rapture and transfiguration, our body will be completely renewed
Our body is a body of sin and death because when man took in the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, his body was involved
God's salvation is from the inside to the outside, spreading from the spirit to the soul and then from the soul to the body
If we desire to be in Satan's work, we do not need to do anything because we are already headed in the outward direction of the fall
The source and initiation of the law of life is God's life, but the law of life enters into us through regeneration
The significance of the law of life relates to the innate ability of life; that is, it is a natural law produced by the life in us
If a tree is dead, it will not be able to fulfill any outward demand to be living, to grow leaves, to blossom, or to bear fruit
The outward law of letters was given by God on Mount Sinai; however, the situation was different on Mount Golgotha
With regard to this designation, there is a special relationship between this law and God's life and the Spirit
When referring to God's life the stress is on His nature, and when referring to His person the stress is on the Spirit
In the spirit, there are the conscience, intuition, and fellowship, and in the soul, there are the mind, emotion, and will
Stated in more detail, our inner being consists of six parts-conscience, intuition, fellowship, mind, emotion, and will
The mind is the thinking part of the soul, the emotion is the feeling part of the soul, and the will is the deciding part of the soul
According to the record in the Bible, these four parts-the mind, emotion, will, and conscience-are related to the heart
The heart is a combination of the soul and the spirit, including all the parts of the soul and one of the three parts of the spirit
When His life enters into our spirit, it produces a law, and this law spreads out from our spirit into every part of our being
There is a law in our conscience, in our mind, in our emotion, in our will, in our fellowship, and in our intuition
There is only one law, but when this law operates and reaches a certain part of our inner being, it becomes the law of that part
When electricity, which is uniquely one, is transmitted into a microphone, it becomes the electricity of the microphone
He desires to spread outward from our spirit into our soul to renew the soul; this renewing work is carried out by the law of life
The law of life is the operation of the Spirit, a function of the Spirit; it is a function of the operation of the Spirit in us
Whenever we set our mind on worldly and sinful things, the law of life within us causes us to feel uneasy because we have violated that law
If our consumption of food, however, goes against the operating law in our stomach, our stomach will begin to ache
If we would simply set our mind on God, on the spirit, and on spiritual things, our mind would be stable, focused, and submissive
If we cooperate with this law and set our mind on God and on spiritual things, our mind will be focused, calm, stable, and sober
When one cooperates with the regulation of the inner law of life, he will love God when the law of life requires him to love God
If we resist and reject it, we will become unpredictable and capricious, acting one way in the morning and another way in the evening
When the law of life reaches one of the inner parts of our being, the function of that part will be manifested
The moment our living is not so proper and not so pleasing to God, there will be a sense within our conscience
The conscience of secular people is dull because the law of life is not manifesting its proper function in them
Similarly, when the law of life reaches the thoughts in our mind, it causes us to meditate on God and on spiritual things
The base of the law of life is in our spirit, and subsequently, it moves outward from our spirit to reach every part of our soul
God takes our spirit as the base and spreads outward from our spirit through the law of life to reach every part of our soul
We can open our heart and let the law of life operate, and we can also close our heart and frustrate the law of life
In itself the law of life is unable to move; however, when our heart is open to God, the law is able to operate in us
When the Spirit is locked in our spirit, there is absolutely no way for Him to regulate the various parts of our soul
We must continually open our heart and allow the Spirit, the life of God, to spread to our soul; this is to be revived
We must exercise to open up our heart when we speak, fellowship, sing, and testify in the meetings, for only then can the Spirit be released
When we decide to take this way and have this kind of living, it is very crucial that we continually exercise to turn to our spirit
We must still turn our love, our affection, and our being from our emotion to our spirit to touch the sense of the spirit
If our spirit agrees and is at peace, we should express this love, but if our spirit disagrees, we need to stop ourselves
When we are making a decision about a certain matter, we first should turn to the spirit, put aside our decision, and touch the inner sense
If the inner sense is at ease, we can accept it, but if the inner sense is not at peace, then we should let it go
If we are those who always stay in an outward realm, most of our feelings will be outward when we get down on our knees to pray
When we get down on our knees, however, we must learn to draw ourselves back to our spirit and pray when there is a move within
We need to die in our dealings with the saints, we need to die to our preferences, and we need to die even in our Bible-reading and prayer
God will also raise up the environment to match our inner learning so that we will have the discipline of the Holy Spirit in us
We must realize that this kind of zealous, godly, religious life of self-improvement is merely soulish and man-made
In order for the law of life to operate in us, we need to fulfill two requirements: loving God and obeying the initial sense of life
Electricity is transmitted through power to light a lamp, but there are no emotions in the transmission of electrical power
In response to a deeper, higher, and greater experience of His powerful life, we love Him more and we have more feelings toward Him
Ephesians 3:17 says, 'That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love'
His indwelling us is love; therefore, that Christ may make His home in your hearts equals that love may make His home in your hearts
On the other hand, it shows that the indwelling of this resurrection life, which is Christ Himself, is a matter of love
The end of Ephesians 3 says that the power of the law of life that operates in us is according to God's love within us
As soon as we are regenerated and have the life of God, the law of this life causes us to have a certain sense
Strictly speaking, there is not a second sense, because God's leading is always in His initial sense, which is His only sense
When God gives us a sense, we simply need to obey it; we need to be faithful without any twisting, arguing, or reasoning
We should never think of our own benefits, wondering, for example, whether we will suffer loss if we obey by mistake
If we are able to love and are willing to obey, the law of life will spontaneously operate in us and manifest its function
Eventually, the Lord opened our eyes to see that the death in Romans 6 can become a fact only through the law of life in Romans 8
If we try to use our own effort to believe and reckon that we are dead, we will be ineffective and destined to fail
Chapter 8 shows that our co-death with Christ in chapter 6 can be a reality only through the law of the Spirit of life
The germ-killing element in medicine kills germs through the circulation of blood; germs are not killed by our 'reckoning'
The white blood cells and the red blood cells in our blood are for killing germs and for bringing in the supply
When the law of life operates, it spontaneously kills and removes all the things that should not be in us, cleansing us
We need to exercise more to live in the fellowship of life, pray more, meditate more, and open to the Lord more
The growth of life involves the fellowship of life inwardly so that we can have genuine growth and transformation outwardly
If a Christian has not seen this and has not touched the inner fellowship of life, whatever he does will be ultimately in vain
The relationship between Him and us, and us and Him, must be living and should not be merely in letter or regulations
Man only had to act according to these regulations in order for God to be God to man and for man to be His people
It is true that God is our God, but if we cause the law of life to stop working in us, we will be people of God in name only, not in reality
If we do not let the law of life regulate and operate in us, God cannot be our God, and we cannot be His people
John 2 speaks of the anointing, that is, the revelation of the Holy Spirit, which also enables us to know God inwardly
Knowing God through the law of life is to know God through His life; knowing God through the anointing is to know God through the Spirit
John 17:3 and Ephesians 1:17 also speak of our inward knowledge of God with a difference in emphasis on life and the Holy Spirit
His nature is the same in one person as it is in another; His nature fifty years ago was the same as it is today
Since God's nature is love, there is a commandment according to this nature: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself'
The law represents God's nature, and the prophets represent God Himself; God's nature is fixed, but God Himself is flexible and living
Our knowledge of God through the law is rigid and fixed, but our knowledge of God through the prophets is living and unpredictable
He should seek the leading of the Spirit as the anointing ointment within him; the Spirit anointing within him is the Prophet
The Spirit who inspired people to be prophets in the Old Testament is now the Spirit as the anointing ointment within all of us
The Spirit who inspired people to be prophets has entered into us today as the anointing to be our Prophet personally and directly
In the New Testament the Holy Spirit, the anointing ointment, has entered into us personally and directly to be our Prophet
The law in the Old Testament represents and declares the nature of God's life, which is love, light, holiness, and righteousness
Today the nature of God's life has entered into us directly, so there is no longer any need for an outward law to declare it to us
In the Old Testament everything was a shadow, a type, a representation, but in the New Testament the reality has come
Today the Spirit of revelation, typified by the prophets, is in us, and the Spirit gives us revelations directly
In the Old Testament the blood that was shed for the expiation of sins was through a type, whether it was a lamb or a bull
In the Old Testament the law was a representation; in the New Testament God's life in us is the reality of what is represented by the law
When life comes, there is no need of the law of letter; when the Holy Spirit comes, there is no need of prophets
The knowledge that the law of life gives us is different from the knowledge that we receive from the anointing
The Holy Spirit will never give him a sense in response to such a request because the anointing is based on the law of life
Before pursuing the growth of life, we must first understand what the growth of life is and what are some of our mistaken concepts
Evil and good though different come from the same realm the same kingdom because both belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Their expression of piety is man-made and not the result of the work of the Holy Spirit in them through the life of Christ
In normal circumstances, the donkey could only make sounds, but because of a special need, it was able to speak as a man
Even though the believers in Corinth were enriched in all knowledge and gifts, Paul said that they were still fleshy
Corinthians 12 through 14 deals with the matter of gifts, but chapter 13 speaks of love, which is a matter of life
The love that is manifested through the dealing of the cross is the outflow of Christ, the living out of Christ
We still need the breaking of the cross in order to allow the Holy Spirit to constitute us with more of Christ
In giving messages and preaching the gospel, a Christian may be quite powerful and moving, but this does not mean that he has grown in life
The increase of the element of God means that more of God Himself has been mingled with us and received by us to become our element
The more we love Christ and pursue Christ, the more the measure of the stature of Christ will increase within us
The growth of life, on the negative side, refers to the decrease of the human element and also to the breaking of our natural life
Such improvement does not cause our human element to decrease; instead, it causes our human element to increase
If we desire to grow in life, our gifts must be stripped by God, and our shell of godliness and piety must be knocked down and broken by God
Our knowledgeable mind, our gifts, and our power must be shattered by God so that the Holy Spirit will have a way to be released
If there is a decrease of himself, then God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit have surely gained ground in him and have increased in him
If he kept these things, relying upon his inborn strength, natural merit, and accomplishments, he could not know Christ
Verse 7 is limited to inborn strength, natural merit, and accomplishments by human effort, but the scope in verse 8 is broader
Through faith Christ can live out righteousness from within us, and this righteousness causes us to know Christ
We need to stop our effort, stop our work, and stop all our doing good, being zealous, serving God, and loving others
Having the righteousness that is through faith in Christ, which is the righteousness through faith in God, causes us to know Christ
In verse 9, however, he stopped his efforts to do good, stopped his zealous service, and had 'faith in Christ'
Many saints have the virtue of humility but do not know Christ at all, and they love God and others but do not know Christ
When they love others, their love does not cause them to experience Christ, because their love comes out of themselves
Or eight years ago after the War of Resistance had been won we were in Shanghai and a zealous man who was quite famous came among the saints
We had done much, yet we still did not have much Christ, and we had run much, yet we only knew Christ a little
He asked us what we had done to gain so many people, because even the alley was full of people during our meetings
He had heard that we were having a revival and that the number of people was very large, and he therefore came to consult with us
No matter what we said, nothing entered into him because the only thing that occupied him was how to work; he could not stop himself
Those who are unable not to work for God are unable to work for God; those who are unable to stop for God are unable to move for God
Christ will be in our mouth but not in our experience, and He will be spoken of in the messages we give but will not be in our living
In contrast, our word and subject may be Christ, but the source and process of our preaching are merely ourselves
We may work and be zealous, but if we never stop ourselves, Christ will not be present during the whole process
He was zealous for the God of his fathers and blameless in the law, but he had never stopped and he did not know Christ
In Philippians, however, he could say that he counted as loss, as refuse, the things that were gains to him on account of Christ
Once a person stops, Christ can act, move, and reveal all His riches in him, allowing him to know Christ practically in experience
Verse 10 says, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
He was intelligent and sober-minded, rich in emotion, being able to weep as well as smile, and strong in His will
The basic principle of death is that of completely putting ourselves to death so that the will of God can be carried out
The cross has a deeper and higher meaning related to Christ's willingness to put Himself to death so that God could have a way
Even though He was such a sound person on earth, He was always putting Himself to death, always denying His mind, emotion, and will
He denied everything of Himself so that God could come out of Him and have a free way to supply the needs of many
Christ denied and rejected everything of Himself whether it was His mind emotion or will so that God could come out of Him and supply others
The death of Christ involves nothing less than putting such a sound humanity to death so that God can have a way to come out
The mold of Christ's death refers to the continual putting of oneself to death so that God can have a way to come out
In Philippians 3, however, he was learning the lesson of putting himself into the death of Christ to be conformed to Christ's death
All these things were only of himself; whether they were related to his mind, emotion, or will, it was all out of himself
At that time, he lived entirely in himself without anything of the death of Christ; he did not have the mold of Christ's death in his living
They can also sense that there is a deep, clear, and distinct seal of death in our intelligence, emotion, and will
Although we have an intelligent mind, a rich emotion, and a strong will, we refuse to use them and even dare not to use them
In our mind, emotion, and will there is a very deep mold, which is the seal that has been imprinted on us by the death of Christ
Paul was standing in death, putting to death all the things that were gains to him; he no longer allowed himself to live in these things
Learning to live in the fellowship of life does not mean that we need to continuously pray behind closed doors
As such, we will live according to our thinking, and we will let our thoughts be loose instead of holding them back
When we desire to adjust our mind, it will not respond because we have indulgently and loosely lived in our mind much of the time
In our living, we must continually learn the lesson of allowing the Holy Spirit to apply the death of Christ in our mind
In our daily living and contact with people and matters, we need to let the death of Christ do a killing work in our mind
The Holy Spirit conquers our mind, overcomes our emotion, and subdues our will through the things we encounter
In coordination with His work through the outward environment, the Holy Spirit also works within us to put us in the place of death
Real growth before the Lord involves the breaking of our self, and it involves being put to death little by little
When the natural man has been dealt with severely enough by God, he will not rely on his soul but rather learn to live by the spirit
As she was about to board the boat, people were rushing to get off the boat while others were rushing to get on the boat
When everything around us is peaceful, we may be like Mary, who sat calmly at the Lord's feet and listened to His words
If a man who is full of emotion has been broken in God's hands, he can remain calm and unhurried even when he hears that his child is sick
When our emotional 'filament' has been broken by God, we will surely remain unhurried inwardly no matter what news we hear
There was a brother who complained that he had no way to pray because of the noise related to living with four other brothers
When we were really alone in our room, our mind often wanders to New York, Washington, London, Shanghai, and Tokyo
If the 'filament' of these distractions was broken, we would be able to pray even if there were people quarreling around us
While the experience of casting out demons is not very deep, the lesson that this brother learned before the Lord was deep
On one occasion, a woman was possessed by a demon, and her husband asked the brother to come and cast the demon out
While they were praying, the woman possessed by the demon took a pair of scissors and started to make a noise with the handles
The demon-possessed woman, however, continued to make noise with the scissors as she walked back and forth beside the brother
The noise and disturbance at the scene were truly extreme, but this brother was able to continue to pray and be restful before the Lord
There is nothing that can help us with this apart from allowing the cross to deal with our mind in our daily situations
May the Lord have mercy on us so that we will learn the lesson of the cross and be kept in the way of fellowship with the Lord and of prayer
To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
It seems as if there is a contradiction and inconsistency between the word spoken in Philippians 3 and the word in 1 Thessalonians 4
Thessalonians 4:16 says that all those who believe in the Lord and who are saved will be resurrected at the Lord's return
When an unbeliever dies, there is no hope, but when a believer dies, we have hope because we will be resurrected when the Lord returns
According to Darby's New Translation, resurrection here refers to an extraordinary resurrection, not an ordinary one
All the students who passed their exams will graduate but only the top three will be recognized as outstanding with awards prizes and honors
We need to emphasize that in order for someone to be conformed to the mold of the Lord's death, he must know Christ's resurrection
No one can be conformed to the mold of the Lord's death without having sufficient knowledge of the Lord's resurrection
Those who are conformed to the Lord's death are those who know resurrection, and those who know resurrection are those who know Christ
The more we participate in and have fellowship with Him in His sufferings, the more we are conformed to His death
All that belongs to God is in Christ: love is in Christ, holiness is in Christ, light is in Christ, and power is also in Christ
In order for Christ to give us all the fullness of the Godhead which dwells in Him as our enjoyment, He must be our life
Christ being our life is a matter of resurrection, and His coming to be our life means that He desires to be lived out from us
The soil is broken apart by the sprouts coming out through the power of life within the seed; the soil splits, and the sprout grows
Once He enters into us, the power of resurrection constantly pushes us and demands that we give Him a way to grow
John 12:24 says, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
The resurrection power within us demands that we put ourselves to death; it also pushes us and puts us to death
The soil cannot break itself open; rather, it is the power of the resurrection life in the sprout that pushes on the soil and breaks it open
We can be working for the Lord like Saul of Tarsus, using our eloquence, talent, zealousness, and capabilities
The resurrection life of Christ within us demands that we die, and the power of resurrection within us pushes us into death
If Paul did not pursue that for which he had been laid hold of by the Lord, he would not have been able to lay hold of it
For him to pursue meant that he pursued to pass through death so that all that is in God could become his enjoyment
We must walk by this rule whether we are sanctified or not, whether we are experienced or not, whether we are childish or weak
The rule is to be conformed to the mold of Christ's death and to allow His power of resurrection to open a way for God to pass through us
Once this way is opened and everything of God has become our enjoyment, we will be able to progress rapidly in His life and mature early
We should all pursue the out-resurrection, that is, pursue that for which we have been laid hold of by the Lord
