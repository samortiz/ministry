   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BILDAD'S CONCLUDING WORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chapter twenty-five is a record of Bildad's concluding word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His final word was brief.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From his previous speakings Bildad might have learned the lesson that the way to lose the case and to appear foolish is to speak too much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This might have been the reason that his concluding word was so short.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. Saying That God Has Dominion</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, Bildad said that dominion and power are with God, and He makes peace in high places v. 2 . Then Bildad asked if there was any number to God's armies, and if there are any upon whom His light does not arise v. 3 . Bildad's word here was not according to the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nevertheless, like Job, he was showing off.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. Saying That No One</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Can Be Righteous before God</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verses 4 through 6 Bildad returned to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Bildad asked how a man can be righteous before God, how a person born of a woman can be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Concluding that this is impossible, he said, "Behold, even the moon has no brightness,/And the stars are not pure in His eyes./How much less a man, a maggot;/And the son of man, a worm!" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was the last word of Bildad in the book of Job</S>
