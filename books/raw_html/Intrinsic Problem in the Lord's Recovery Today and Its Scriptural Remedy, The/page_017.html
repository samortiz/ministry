 <h2 class="head1">X. THE TEST OF THE CORINTHIAN BELIEVERS<br />
EXAMINING PAUL AS TO HIS QUALIFICATION<br />
FOR BEING AN APOSTLE&mdash;1 COR. 9:3</h2>
<p>Paul made a defense for himself with the signs of his apostleship, and he took a strong stand concerning all his rights as an apostle (vv. 1-14; 2 Cor. 12:11-12). But for the sake of the spreading of the gospel, he had not used all the rights of his apostleship (1 Cor. 9:15-23).</p>
<p>It seems that Paul was vindicating himself in taking care of this case, but he did it in this way not for his own gain, but for the profit of the church, which would have suffered a great loss by doubting his qualification for being an apostle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XI. THE TEST OF THE BELIEVERS PARTAKING<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S TABLE UNWORTHILY&mdash;<br />
1 COR. 11:19-22, 27</h2>
<p>In dealing with this problem, Paul said that parties, sects, are unavoidable among the believers, that those who are approved may become manifest among the believers (v. 19). This was the reason Paul gave for such things happening in the churches established by him. This kind of trouble is a sifting that shows whether or not we are approved. The word <em>approved</em> can also be translated <em>experienced.</em> Our being approved indicates that we are experienced and thus, that it is not easy for us to participate in any kind of party.</p>
<p>This is the way in the experience of life to deal with such a case of trouble that indicates the shortage of growth in the spiritual life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XII. THE TEST OF SOME BELIEVERS IN CORINTH<br />
 SAYING THAT THERE IS NO RESURRECTION<br />
OF THE DEAD&mdash;1 COR. 15:12</h2>
<p>I do not believe that anyone among us has ever said that there is no resurrection of the dead. Therefore, in this sense we might be a little better than the churches established by Paul. In facing this test, the apostle corrected the heresy by unveiling the truth of resurrection (vv. 12-57) and by testifying to the fact of resurrection by the power and effectiveness of the resurrection of Christ (vv. 3-11). In 1 Corinthians 15:10, Paul said, &ldquo;...not I, but the grace of God.&rdquo; The grace of God is the resurrected Christ. Christ in resurrection is the grace of God. Thus, Paul testified to the fact of resurrection not only by the power but also by the effectiveness of the resurrection of Christ, which he himself had experienced.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s way of taking care of this test of heresy was excellent; but it requires the adequate knowledge of the divine truth in the New Testament teaching and the sufficient experience of the reality of the divine truth. Hence, we need to endeavor to get into the divine truths and to experience the reality of the divine truths that we may be able to take care of this kind of problem for the churches&rsquo; profit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XIII. THE TEST OF THE DISOBEDIENCE<br />
OF SOME OF THE CORINTHIAN BELIEVERS&mdash;<br />
2 COR. 10:2-10</h2>
<p>In facing such a test, the apostles first fought the spiritual warfare to overthrow the strongholds in the believers&rsquo; minds and to take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ (vv. 3-5). Then the apostles eventually would punish all disobedience among the believers (v. 6). Paul did not say that they would take revenge on persons, but that they would punish the disobedience of the disobedient ones.</p>
<p>To take care of such a case related to the spiritual warfare requires the spiritual insight to see thoroughly that the source of such a case is not in man but in the evil power of Satan and needs the ability in the divine life to fight against the evil source.</p>
