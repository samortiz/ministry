<h2 class=head2>Every Church Being Part of the Lord’s Body</h2><p>Every church is worth seeing because they are the churches of the Lord. These are the parts of His Body and they are worth seeing. Even the physical feet of the Lord Jesus were worthy of being loved by that sinful woman (Luke 7:37-38). She honored His two feet with her hair. The hair is the glory of a woman (1 Cor. 11:15), the top part of her body. With her top part she wiped the Savior’s feet, the lowest part of His body, loving Him with her glory. Even His feet were worthy of her tears. In like manner, even the weakest churches are worth seeing because they are a part of His Body. If you did not have an improper, subconscious concept, you would never say that the churches in a certain region are not worth seeing. Also, you would never attempt to get people to move from other localities to your locality.<h2 class=head2>No Church Being Our Church</h2><p>We must learn to know our flesh. I want to impress you and I want it to remain in your memory that no church belongs to you or to me. The churches are God’s churches, Christ’s churches, and the saints’ churches. No churches should be regional. All the churches should be catholic, universal. Strictly speaking, even the work you have done or are still doing is not your work. I do not consider what I am doing as my work. This is the Lord’s work and I am just a small servant. By His mercy and grace He uses me to do certain things. This is not my work but His work. I am a slave of the Lord and a slave of you all. I am a slave even of all the weaker ones. I am not the master. I cannot say this is my work. The most I can say is that this is my service. Regardless of how much you have done and how wonderful what you have done is, remember that it is not your work. You should not keep what you have done in “your pocket” as your work. You should not hold what you have done all the time in your hand.<p>When I left Chefoo in 1944, nothing of the work or of the church was in “my pocket.” Everything was in the hands of the brothers. In the same way, when I left Shanghai in 1949, Brother Nee sent a cable, and I went to the airlines to get my reservation. Three days later I took the plane and went away. Nothing in Shanghai was in my hands and I did not need to do anything. Also, when I left Los Angeles I never said a word to the brothers because nothing there was in my hands.<p>The leading brothers in Anaheim can testify that I do not know much about the church in Anaheim. I am just a brother attending the meetings. Sometimes, of course, the brothers would ask me about things and I would fellowship with them. This is all I do. Also, sometimes the brothers would pass on the financial statement to me. The Lord knows that I never read one. I leave it on my desk for a few days, and then it goes into the wastepaper basket. This does not mean that I was disgusted with that financial statement. This means that I do not consider that as my business. I do not want to know how much money the church in Anaheim receives and spends. This is not my business. This is why I have so much mental energy and time to concentrate myself on the holy Word. This is the main reason why I can do so much work. I do not scatter my mind or my energy to care for anything that is not within the limit of my responsibility.<h2 class=head2>The Lord’s Blessing and Our Usefulness</h2><p>To serve the Lord and to be under His blessing is not a simple thing. Thank the Lord that the work, thus far, has been under His blessing. This is not due to me. This is due to His mercy which makes “this little servant” do his best to be pure and to be clean. The trouble among the Christians through the centuries has been impurity. Most Christians are doing good things. You cannot say that the Christians are doing bad things, but what about the purity? Whether or not you will be so useful in the Lord’s hands for the long run and whether or not you will bring in the blessing for a lasting time does not depend on what you can do. It all depends on how pure your heart is. Therefore, ambition must be excluded and pride must be put under your feet. There should be no ambition, no thought for position, no pride, no self regard, and no self honor.</p>
