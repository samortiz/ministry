   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE WRITING ON THE WALL</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verses 10 through 29 we have Daniel's interpretation of the writing on the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. Daniel Being Recommended,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Called, and Brought before the King</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Daniel was recommended, called, and brought before the king vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>10-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The queen mother recommended Daniel, saying that an excellent spirit, knowledge, insight, the interpretation of dreams, the declaring of riddles, and the solving of problems were found in him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She went on to say, "Let Daniel now be called, and he will declare the interpretation" v. 12b .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. Daniel's Answer to the King</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The king told Daniel that if he could interpret the writing and make its interpretation known, he would be clothed in purple, would be given a chain of gold around his neck, and would rule as the third ruler in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In his answer to the king, Daniel said, "Let your gifts remain with you, or give your rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing for the king and make the interpretation known to him" v. 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before reading the writing and interpreting it, Daniel reminded Belshazzar of the experience of Nebuchadnezzar recorded in chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Daniel regarded what happened to Nebuchadnezzar as a lesson not only for Nebuchadnezzar but also for all his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason, Daniel referred Belshazzar to his forefather's lesson in a rebuking tone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nebuchadnezzar had been severely disciplined by God and, after he had learned the lesson, offered praise to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Belshazzar should have learned something from this lesson, but he did not care about it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, Daniel said to him, "You his descendant, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this; but you have exalted yourself against the Lord of the heavens....The God in whose hand is your breath and to whom all your ways belong, you have not honored.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then that part of the hand was sent from before Him, and this writing was inscribed" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Belshazzar was not expecting such a rebuke.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verses 25 through 28 we see Daniel's interpretation of the writing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the writing that was inscribed: "MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN" v. 25 . This is Daniel's interpretation of the matter: MENE God has numbered Belshazzar's kingdom and brought it to an end; TEKEL he has been weighed in the scales and found to be lacking; and PERES his kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and the Persians vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>26-28 .</S>
