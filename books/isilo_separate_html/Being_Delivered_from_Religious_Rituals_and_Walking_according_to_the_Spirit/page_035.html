<p>Christians meet for the expression and exhibition of Christ. Although we say this, we still want to attend a Sunday service and listen to a sermon. According to our natural concept, the purpose of a Christian meeting is to worship God quietly and listen to a sermon. This is what religion teaches. Christians go to a chapel to render such worship to God, and then a pastor gives a sermon with some teachings. This is the practice in religion. It is not what God desires.</p>
<p>The types in the Old Testament show the worship that God desires. Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible, the Pentateuch. The main content of these books concerns how to worship God. Moses did not say that to worship is to kneel down and prostrate oneself. He did not use such terms in his books. Rather, he said that worshipping God consists of presenting offerings. When we worship God, we should bring offerings to God so that He can enjoy the offerings with us. This is worship. The offerings are types of Christ. Hence, the worship that God wants from us is for us to exhibit Christ. When we all bring Christ, we worship God.</p>
<p>Three times a year in the Old Testament, at the Feast of the Passover, the Feast of Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles, the children of God gathered together before God and worshipped Him. They did not worship for an hour. They worshipped for seven to eight days. Their worship was based on God&rsquo;s commandment, that is, His ordination, His requirement. God did not say, &ldquo;When you worship Me, prepare your heart and be somber and full of sincerity. When you come to My temple, you should be quiet and prostrate yourselves before Me.&rdquo; There are no such commandments in the Pentateuch or in any other books of the Bible. In the Pentateuch Moses said that the children of Israel had to bring offerings when they worshipped God. They could not appear before God empty-handed (Deut. 16:16).</p>
<p>The offerings were the produce of the land of Canaan. Some Israelites brought offerings from the herd or the flock, some brought grains, some brought fruit, and some brought new wine, oil, or flour. These were the produce of the land of Canaan. In order to gain the produce of the land, the Israelites had to labor on the land of Canaan for at least a year. They had to till the land, plant seeds, turn the soil, and water the plants, or they had to tend cattle. Eventually, there was a harvest. The Israelites put aside one-tenth of their harvest. This was the best portion of the land. When it was time for the Feast of the Passover, the Feast of Pentecost, or the Feast of Tabernacles, they brought the best portion of the land to God (12:17-18; 14:23).</p>
<p>God does not want us to worship Him by praying somber prayers, bowing down, or even being quiet. He wants us to bring offerings of Christ to Him. After we bring our offerings, we still need to learn how to offer them. We need to learn how to offer Christ as the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, the wave offering, and the heave offering. Some portions of the offering are for us to enjoy, some portions are to be enjoyed with the other saints, and some portions are for God to enjoy. When we bring our offerings and enjoy them in this way, God is satisfied, others are satisfied, and we are also satisfied. This is our worship to God. The worship that God wants is for us to offer Christ to Him.</p>
<p>God does not want us to devoutly sing a hymn of praise and kneel before Him. This is a religious ritual. God does not want it. God wants Christ from us. Christ is our good land. We should regularly labor on Him. As long as we labor on Christ, we will have experiences of Christ. Then when we come to a meeting, we should bring our experiences of Christ&mdash;the produce of the good land&mdash;for God to enjoy, for others to be supplied, and for us to be satisfied. In this way, we enjoy Christ together with others before God, and we also enjoy Christ together with God. Thus, God has the worship that He desires.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WORSHIPPING IN THE NEW TESTAMENT<br />
BEING IN SPIRIT AND TRUTHFULNESS</h2>
<p>To prophesy is to use our living, strong, and fresh spirit to speak forth the Christ we have experienced. Religion may not consider this to be worship, but this is true worship to God.</p>
<p>In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; <em>Truthfulness</em> denotes Christ, and <em>in spirit</em> refers to our strong, fresh, and living spirit. The Lord Jesus said that true worship is in our spirit and in truthfulness. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must do so in spirit, not in the Holy Spirit but in their human spirit. They must also worship in truthfulness, which is the Christ they have experienced. This does not refer merely to singing hymns or to praising, much less to bowing down or kneeling. It is entirely a matter of having a strong spirit to exhibit Christ. This is worship.</p>
<p>It seems as though Paul did not say much concerning worshipping God, but the prophesying he spoke of is true worship. The worship that God desires is for us to bring our experience of Christ so that both God and man can be satisfied. God desires that His Son would be appreciated among men. This is one of the commissions that the church has on earth. The church must display Christ for others to appreciate. The more people there are who appreciate Christ, the more God is satisfied. This is the way to worship God.</p>
<p>Our meetings do not emphasize singing, praising, praying, giving a sermon, or listening to a sermon, because God wants us to appreciate Christ. In our meetings we display Christ with the demonstration of the spirit by prophesying. This is the principle of our meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Since our meetings are the exhibition of our daily living, they are based on our living and supported by our living. Our meetings should not differ from our daily living; they should match each other. We should daily live in our spirit, exercise our spirit, and use our spirit to contact Christ who is the Spirit. When we fellowship with Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him, we will have rich experiences of Christ. Then when we come to the meetings, our spirit will be strong, released, uplifted, and fresh, and we will be able to sing, pray, testify, or read the Bible. Whatever we do should be in our spirit. In such a demonstration of our spirit, the content of our speaking will be the Christ we have experienced. This is our speaking for Christ, our prophesying.</p>
<p>Our present need is to have a change in concept. We also need the skills that enable us to function with others. We need to be trained so that we know when to call loudly and when to be quiet. As soon as we hear another person speaking, we should listen. When a person speaks, he should speak clearly so that others can hear him. These points require practice. We should be flexible in our practice; otherwise, we will have a method, a regulation.</p>
<p>We can no longer depend on the methods we used in the past. A method deals with only one need, but there are many needs in a meeting. We must open to the Lord in every meeting and not follow the procedures we used in the past. In order to do this, we must practice. If we want to follow the Lord in this age, we must have a change in concept and learn the skills that are needed in order to meet in spirit and in truthfulness.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> </body></html>
