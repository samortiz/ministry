   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE FIFTY-FOUR LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SEED BY INCEST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As I have pointed out many times, nearly all the seeds of the divine revelation are found in the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A seed is a primitive form of something.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although its size is small and its form is simple, once a seed has been sown into a field, it will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As it grows it takes on another form.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First it is a sprout and later it is fully developed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the final form of its development is different from that of the seed, all the principles and major aspects of it are found within the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we would understand Genesis 19, we must consider it as a seed which has its growth, development, and harvest in the following books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the record concerning Lot and his daughters in Genesis 19:30-38 is a negative seed, concerning such an ugly thing as incest, it serves the positive purpose of giving us a strong, sobering warning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>5 The Seed by Incest</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this message we must see the portrait of a most ugly thing incest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Genesis 19:30-38, probably the first recorded case of incest in human history, is part of the section on living in fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we consider this matter, we must cover six points: the family, the father, the mother, the daughters, the seed, and the far-reaching and unsearchable mercy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Firstly, we have the family, the group, and secondly, we have the father, the leader of this group.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thirdly, we have the mother who was the leader's helper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The leader of any group needs help.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The proper helper in a family is the wife, and in the Bible a wife is called a helpmeet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In figure, the wife in a family signifies a helper in life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This concept is according to the principles of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consider the example of Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abraham had a family for God's purpose, for Abraham alone could do nothing for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He needed a helper in life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although he turned to Hagar for help, she was not a helper in life but a helper in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sarah was the unique helper, the one who had the function in life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without her, Abraham could never have brought forth Isaac for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church today is a spiritual family in which there also is the need of the proper function in life to bring forth "Isaac" for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we shall see, at a certain point, Lot's family group lost its function in life because the wife became a pillar of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She should have been salty and maintained a good flavor, but due to her worldliness she lost the function in life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In figure, becoming a pillar of salt indicates the loss of the function in life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although there was a group with a leader, there was no wife with the function in life, only a pillar of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is true of many Christian groups today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although these groups have leaders, they do not have the proper wife with the genuine function in life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because Lot's family had lost its function in life, it had improper members the daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am not happy to call the members of Lot's group daughters, for the word daughters is a good term.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What kind of people were they?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Were they daughters or wives or mothers?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I simply do not know what to call them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you call them daughters, you must say that they were incestuous daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although they might have been mothers, they were incestuous mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I feel ashamed to even speak of what they did.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After lying with their father, the first daughter encouraged the second to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How shameful!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These were the members of Lot's group.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many Christian groups today also have such improper members.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They, like Lot's daughters, desire to have the seed but do not care for the proper means.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They may say, "Let us go to win souls," but they win souls through the way of spiritual incest.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 19:30-38 we have the group, the leader, the helper in life, the members, and the seed by incest.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But praise the Lord that eventually the far-reaching and unsearchable mercy of God is seen in one of the descendants who came out of this incest.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Ruth, a Moabitess, a descendant of Lot through his daughter, became the great grandmother of David and an ancestress of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Is this not the far-reaching and unsearchable mercy of God?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, when we hear of this, we should not say, "Let us do evil that good may come."</S>
