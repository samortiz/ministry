   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST, THE NEW WINESKIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we must see more concerning Christ as the new wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us read I Corinthians 12:12, "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We read in this verse not only that the members composed together are the one Body, but that this Body is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We always consider Christ as the Head; we have considered little, if at all, that Christ is also the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How, practically speaking, is Christ the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because the Body is composed of so many members who are filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is in you, Christ is in me, Christ is in him, and Christ is in every one of us we all have Christ within.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul, in I Corinthians chapter 1, says that Christ is not divided.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Christ in you is one with the Christ in me, and the Christ in us is one with the Christ in all other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So Christ is the Body composed of so many members who are filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the new wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The new wineskin is simply the church life to contain Christ as the new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes people condemn us by saying that we speak altogether too much about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But I do not think that we can ever talk too much about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I believe we will need eternity to exhaust it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some say that whether we have the church or not, whether we are in the church or not, we can still enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But I do question whether you can fully enjoy Christ without the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without the church you may enjoy Christ here a little and there a little, but you can never enjoy Christ in a full way, neither can you enjoy Him constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you do not agree, stay away from the church for a month and see what the result will be.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many years ago a young brother came to me saying, "Brother Lee, I simply do not like the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Look at all those elders I don't like them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Look at the leading sisters I don't like them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Look at all those brothers and sisters I don't like them."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I replied, "All right brother, you don't like the elders, neither do you like the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What about yourself?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He said, "Well, I'm not so good either, but I'm a little better than they are."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He continued, "Why should I come to the church meetings it's just a waste of my time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It would be much better for me to stay at home to pray and read the Bible."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So I said, "All right brother, go and try it for a while and see what will result."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you know what happened?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For the first two weeks he did pray and read his Bible, but after that the Bible reading stopped, though he still prayed a little.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After another week, the prayer ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then he began attending the movies, and later went even deeper into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without the wineskin, how can you keep the wine?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not consider that you yourself as an individual are the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No, you are just a part of the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How can a glass contain water if it is cut into pieces?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How can the pieces contain the water?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not consider that you are somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You are nobody.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You are just a member of the Body; you are just a minute part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is true, some amount of blood is in my little finger, but this little finger is just a part of the entire body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you sever it from the body, the flow of blood in the finger immediately ceases.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead of containing the blood, the finger will lose the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From the day you leave the church life, you begin to lose Christ, the new wine starts to run out.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Check with your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In so saying I do not infer that every meeting of the church life is so marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes the church meetings are not so high.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But even the experience of some low meetings is good for you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether a glass is held as high as the ceiling or as low as the floor, it is still a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whether it is up or down, it remains a container.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus always goes with this glass: when the glass goes higher, the Lord Jesus goes higher.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the church meetings go down, sorry to say, the Lord Jesus goes down with them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He must go with us, because He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nothing but the church life can contain the very Christ you enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not think the church is a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some who are reading this book are in places where there is as yet no church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I believe that your experience, though it be on the negative side, will support my word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I fully sympathize with you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No doubt many of you are greatly concerned that there is no container, no wineskin, in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You see, we need the new wine, and we also need the new wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must also realize that the wineskin is not only the container of the wine, but also the means for us to drink the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many of us can testify that whenever we came into the church meeting, we discovered that that was really the place where we could drink Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It was there that we began to drink the Lord as never before.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church life is not just a container, but a vessel from which we may drink.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Praise the Lord, we have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The church life is not us; the church life is the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If I come here and leave my Christ at home, and if you come here just by yourself, that is not the church life, that is a kind of social club.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Anything without Christ in it is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, if you come with Christ and I come with Christ, immediately this very Christ is the corporate container to contain Himself and dispense Himself for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The church life is not a religion or a set of teachings, forms and rituals, but Christ lived out from you and me.</S>
