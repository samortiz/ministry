   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINISTRY OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SPIRIT AND OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In short, the New Testament ministry is the content of the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The content of the twenty-seven books from Matthew to Revelation is the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This ministry speaks of Christ being the mystery of God and of the church being the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two are the great mystery, Christ and the church Eph 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This New Testament ministry is the ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness 2 Cor 3:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To say that this ministry is of the Spirit means that this ministry is entirely of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He has passed through all the processes and is consummated as the Spirit; hence, this ministry is of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This ministry cannot be separated from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the New Testament the Spirit is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is eternally triune; but before His incarnation, death, and resurrection, He was not yet processed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was the Triune God, but He was not the consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was perfect but not consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, the perfect Triune God needed to pass through some procedures and processes in order to be consummated by the addition of a few elements.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Triune God was perfect in eternity past, but He had only the divine element, divinity, without the human element, humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He had not passed through the process of human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When He stepped out of eternity, entered into the world, took the human shell, the flesh, and partook of humanity to become a proper man, another element was added into Him; that is, humanity was added to divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moreover, He was in the womb of Mary for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was a great process for the Triune God to be conceived in a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After He was born, He passed through thirty-three and a half years of human living and experienced all the hardships of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Triune God, the eternal, infinite, and omnipotent God, entered into a human womb, spent nine months there, was born as an ordinary man, and passed through human life in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then according to His eternal plan, the will that He purposed in eternity, He went to the cross, was crucified according to the prophecies in the Old Testament, and accomplished an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the negative side, the Lord s all-inclusive death solved every problem, and on the positive side, His divine life was released.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the cross He was not only the Lamb who took away sin John 1:29 and the bronze serpent that judged Satan 3:14 but also the grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This aspect is not related to sin and Satan but to the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He, as the grain of wheat, died to release the divine life and bore much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As chosen, redeemed, and regenerated ones, we are the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We constitute His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After passing through an all-inclusive death, He stayed in death for three days and then rose from death and ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In resurrection His body was transfigured into a spiritual body, and He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After passing through these processes, He is the perfect and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the Lord s resurrection the triune name the Father, the Son, and the Spirit was used for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Matthew 28:19 the Lord told His disciples in resurrection, Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Spirit spoken of in the New Testament is included in the simple divine title the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord was in the flesh, on the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles He stood and cried out, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But this He said concerning the Spirit John 7:37-39a .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If anyone comes to Him and believes into Him, his thirst will be quenched, and he will receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John, however, says that the Spirit was not yet at the time the Lord cried out v. 39b . This means that the Spirit was not yet completed, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Jesus glorification refers to His entering into resurrection from death Luke 24:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The glorification of a grain of wheat occurs once it falls into the ground, dies, and begins to grow out from the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then it bears much fruit and displays a glorious form.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Glorification is multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ was a single grain, but now He has many grains; this is glorification as well as multiplication and propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From this we see that the Spirit as the all-inclusive Spirit represents the mysterious God who possesses divinity and humanity, who has passed through human living, accomplished an all-inclusive death, entered into resurrection, and became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is able not only to redeem us but also to enter into us to be our life and mingle Himself with our spirit to be our nature and person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the New Testament ministry is the ministry of the Spirit, belonging to the Spirit.</S>
