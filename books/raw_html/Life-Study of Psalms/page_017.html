<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Human Concept in Psalm 1<br>Being That the Man Who Delights in the Law of God<br>Prospers in Everything, but the Experience of<br>the Psalmist in Psalm 73 Being the Opposite</H2><P>The human concept in Psalm 1 is that the man who delights in the law of God prospers in everything. But the experience of the psalmist in Psalm 73:1-7, 13-17, and 23-26 is the opposite. He was godly and, no doubt, he delighted in the law of God; yet he suffered a lot and the ungodly prospered. Eventually, he was instructed, in the sanctuary of God, to take only God Himself as his portion, not anything other than God.</P><P>The godly psalmist in Psalm 73 was bothered. He was delighting in the law, but he suffered greatly while the evil ones prospered. He was bothered until he entered into the sanctuary of God, that is, into God's house. Then he became clear. There under God's revelation, he was instructed just to have God Himself as his portion. Eventually he declared that he had no one in the heavens nor anyone on this earth except God, his eternal portion (vv. 25-26).</P><P>If the Lord wills, we will study the minor prophets in this upcoming summer training of 1992. Then in the winter we hope to study Job. In the book of Job, there is a big controversy. Job suffered greatly. His family, his property, and his health were destroyed (Job 1:13&#151;2:8). Then Job's three friends came to speak with him. What they spoke was nonsense. They told Job that he must have been wrong in something. Otherwise, God would not punish him in this way. Job contended with them by saying that he was wrong in nothing. These three friends spoke to Job one by one again and again throughout the book of Job. Job, however, would not be subdued by them. Eventually, God came in and stopped everyone's mouth. God's speaking to Job opened his eyes. Job said, "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye seeth thee" (Job 42:5). Job heard about God, but he never saw God. After passing through his sufferings, he saw God. If someone who loves the Lord is suffering, his suffering is not basically a matter of his being right or wrong. What God is concerned with is our having more of God in our inward being.</P><P>About three or four years ago, I went to see my eye doctor for a check-up. He has been taking care of me since 1975, and he performed surgery on my eyes to remove cataracts. I told him that my eyes were bothering me, and I asked him why. He responded by saying, "These are Job's sufferings." By this he indicated to me that my suffering was without any reason and that he could not help me any more. Job's sufferings always come from God's assignment. Every parent expects to have good children, and they may wonder why their children are bad. A brother may wonder why his wife is not as nice as other wives, and a sister may wonder why her husband is so incapable. These are Job's sufferings. Today I am still experiencing Job's sufferings.</P>
