   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE RENEWING OF OUR MIND A. Do Not Be Conformed to This Age</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 12:2 says, And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind, that you may prove by testing what the will of God is, that which is good and well-pleasing and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul tells us not to be conformed to this age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not be molded by this age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is this age?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The age is the present, practical world life, which is the opposition to and substitute of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The entire world is a Satanic system, a system constituted by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Greek word for world, cosmos, denotes an organization, a system.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan has systematized every person and every item of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This world system is composed of many ages.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just as the universal church is composed of many local churches, so the world is composed of many ages.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every local church is a part of the universal church, and every age is a part of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Each age has its modern fashion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The English word modern is an equivalent of the Greek word rendered age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Greek words translated as Do not be conformed to this age may be translated as, Do not be modernized.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, to be modernized means to be fashioned, conformed according to the present age.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since an age, being the present, practical world life, is a part of the world system, you cannot be in the world without being in one of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You cannot touch the world unless you touch one of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, in order to forsake the world you must also forsake the age.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The changes in the age of the world system can be illustrated by the changes in ladies hairdos.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sixty years ago, especially in the Western world, it was common for women to arrange their hair into a high tower, the higher the better.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I became familiar with this because the Western ladies purchased hairnets that were imported from North China where I lived as a boy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suddenly the orders began to specify small hairnets.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I wondered about the reason for the change.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually I learned that the age had changed and that the modern style had altered.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Each age has its fashion and style.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sixty years ago the Western ladies fashioned their hair into a high tower.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later short hair became common, and the so-called bobbed hair became popular.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In recent years the young people have adopted the so-called hippie type hairdo of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a young man allows his hair to grow long, it proves that he has been modernized.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The world opposes the church, and the ages oppose the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we mean business to have the church life, we must give up the age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since the present age opposes the church life, we cannot follow the age and be fashioned according to it and still truly experience the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A person who is possessed by the modern age may attend the Sunday meetings, but he cannot practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we want the Body life, the practice of the church life, we must not follow this age nor be conformed to it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the reason that Paul told us not to be conformed to this age.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>B. Be Transformed by the Renewing of the Mind</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not be conformed to the age, but transformed by the renewing of our mind Eph 4:23; Titus 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To be conformed to the age means to adopt the modern fashions outwardly; to be transformed is to have an organic element wrought into our being to produce a metabolic change inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The mind in Romans 12 is different from the mind both in Romans 7 and Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Romans 7 the mind was alone, acting independently.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Romans 8 the mind was dependent, being set on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, I doubt that the mind in Romans 8 has been transformed or renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Simply to set our mind on the spirit is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The mind should not only be dependent, but also renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Romans 12:2 tells us that we need a renewed mind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The mind is renewed not only by outward teachings, but by the element of Christ being added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the Lord Jesus spreads Himself from our spirit into our mind, our mind will be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By the renewing of our mind our soul is metabolically changed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way we experience transformation in our soul, a necessity for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we intend to practice the church life, we need to experience such a transformation in our soul by the renewing of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>C. To Test and Prove the Will of God</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need the renewal of our mind and the transformation of our soul that we may prove by testing what the will of God is, that which is good and well-pleasing and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What is the will of God?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The will of God is to have the Body life, the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not apply the mention of the will of God in 12:2 to your personal human situation, to the matters of marriage, employment, or housing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some people pray, O Lord, I am going to buy a new house.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What is Your will?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How many bedrooms and bathrooms should it have?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How much should I pay for it?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Lord, I want to know Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Forget about praying in this manner, for the more you pray and seek the Lord s will in this way, the more you will find yourself in darkness and out of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The will mentioned in 12:2 is to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The house that you purchase, the job that you have, and the person that you marry should all depend on the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even the clothes that you wear should depend on the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you are right with the church life, you will know what you must do.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Everything must be for the church life, for to have the church life is the unique will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is good, well-pleasing, and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>And this is for the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The presenting of our bodies, the transforming of our souls, and the renewing of our minds are all for the Body life.</S>
