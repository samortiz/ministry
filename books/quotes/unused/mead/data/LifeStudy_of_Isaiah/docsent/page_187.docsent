   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this message we want to continue our fellowship concerning the revelation of the all-inclusive Christ in Isaiah 11.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have seen that in Isaiah 4 there are four items typifying Christ, and these four items form two pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first pair is Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth, and the second pair is Christ as a covering canopy of glory and an overshadowing tabernacle of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Isaiah 11 there are also four items typifying Christ, and these four items form two pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first pair of items is Christ as a twig from the stem of Jesse and a branch from the roots of Jesse.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second pair of items is Christ as a banner to the peoples and a standard to the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Isaiah 11 is altogether a chapter on the coming restoration of life, especially the restoration of the returned nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In these messages we are not studying the future fulfillment of Isaiah 11.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are studying the principle of the restoration of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The twig and the branch come up in life, and this life is full of restoring power, deepening power, growing power, and fruit-bearing power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A twig coming out from a dried and dead stump is a strong indication of the restoring power in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The branch signifies that this life has the deepening power, the growing power, and the fruit-bearing power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This life brings in the Spirit, and this Spirit carries out God's administration where we see a full restoration of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Wherever Christ as life grows in freshness and depth, there is the Spirit with His riches, there is the government of God in righteousness and justice, and there is the restoration of life.</S>
