   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PUTTING THESE MATTERS INTO PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN A LIVING WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should promise the Lord that we will bring one person to Him each year.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may even sign and date a piece of paper to this effect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This will help us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do this, we can be assured that we will bring one or two persons to the Lord, but if we do not make such a promise, we may not bring one person to the Lord even in two years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I do not like to force anyone, but I am concerned, especially for the young brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more I pray, minister, and teach as one of the Lord s servants, the more I have learned not to put my trust in people; we are just not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, as I have been speaking about the outreach, I consider whether or not the young ones will put this into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What will be the help if all this training becomes mere talk?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some may say that we should let the Holy Spirit do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy Spirit will do His work, but we have to cooperate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we are cooking, have we ever said, I have to pray and let the Holy Spirit start the fire ?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is we, not the Holy Spirit, that starts the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I look to the Lord that after the young brothers and sisters receive this training, they would put it into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the past when I held trainings with the young people in the Far East, I told them that if they truly meant business to be trained, they should sign a paper saying that they accept all the regulations and rules of the training.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After they signed, I treated them strictly as trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I gave them some assignments, and they did them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This truly helped them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the same principle, we should put all the matters about which we have been speaking into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do not, they will mean little to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The young brothers and sisters should do some homework on the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They can go to a concordance or another kind of help to select all the best passages concerning life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then they should read, meditate, and consider them, try to use them, and check themselves as to whether or not they have the experience they speak about.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They should deal with the Lord, learn these things, and try to experience these things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then they should also keep their word before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They should say, Lord, I have the burden, and I have told You that within one year I will bring at least one person to You.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When they pray about this and put it into practice, they will be burdened to care for two or three particular persons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then to be sure, some persons will be brought in.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have been influenced too much, even spoiled, by the background of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must make a turn and start to preach the gospel in a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then all the new ones who are brought in will go on in the same way that we practice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do not do this, we will have the old way of gospel preaching through a minister, preacher, evangelist, or campaign, not through the living members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The best way for the gospel to be preached is day by day through the living members.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then after a certain time, perhaps one or two months, the church will need to have a baptism, because ten, twenty, or even forty people will be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When more new ones are saved, the church will have another baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether or not we have this turn depends on us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must practice this living way of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I hope that we will bring these matters to the Lord and make a decision before Him to put them into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not make excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can always gain someone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When D. L. Moody was young, he made the decision to preach the gospel to at least one person each day.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once after he had gone to bed, he realized that he had not preached the gospel that day, so he rose, dressed again, and went out to the street.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He could not find anyone, but eventually he saw a policeman and told him, Sir, you must believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The policeman was bothered but impressed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The next day he found out about Moody and went to talk with him, and eventually he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are many policemen on the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should go there and catch them.</S>
