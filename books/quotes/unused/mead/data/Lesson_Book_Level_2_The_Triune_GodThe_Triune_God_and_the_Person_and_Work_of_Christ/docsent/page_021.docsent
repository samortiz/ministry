   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this lesson we will look at Ephesians chapters two and three.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 2 shows us a wonderful two-way traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It shows God coming to us, then us going back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE TWO-WAY TRAFFIC OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>EPHESIANS 2</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ephesians 2 starts by showing that we were fallen into sin and death and that we were even walking in the realm of sin and death vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But God, because of His great love, came to enliven us, to raise us up from the dead, and to exalt us and seat us in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But He did not do this directly He did it through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without Christ there is no way for God to enliven us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He raised us up and seated us in the heavens in Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the means, the element, and the sphere for God to enliven us, to raise us up, and to seat us in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Outside of Christ God has no way to work out these three matters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God did it, but He did it through a channel, through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As God's channel, Christ did many things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All He did can be summed up in the matter of His blood v. 13 . The blood is the sign of Christ's marvelous death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After Christ accomplished so much by His all-inclusive death, He came to preach the gospel v. 17 . How could He preach the gospel to us after He was crucified and buried? The answer is that He resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b . When Christ as the Spirit preached such a gospel, we heard and accepted it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What then did we receive?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We received the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What started with God's love has come through Christ, the channel, and has reached us as the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This, however, is not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Triune God ultimately wants to bring us into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So, 2:18 continues, "For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These verses show us that when we receive the Son in His preaching, we receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit then brings us back to the Father through the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Father came to us through the Son in the Spirit, and now the Spirit brings us back to the Father, through the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What a wonderful two-way traffic!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We enjoy the threefold dispensing of life by the Triune God.</S>
