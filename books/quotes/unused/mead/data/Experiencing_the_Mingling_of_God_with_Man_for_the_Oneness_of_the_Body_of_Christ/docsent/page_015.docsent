   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING THE MINGLING BY EATING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we have such a pure heart, we will have the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God Matt 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Having a pure heart will enable us to be in the presence of God and to see God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, being in the presence of God and seeing God are one thing; taking God in is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is one thing to be at a table in the presence of food, and it is another thing to actually take in the food.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today many Christians talk about the presence of God in the Old Testament sense, but the New Testament shows us something deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The New Testament shows us that the Lord Himself lives within us and that for us to live is Christ Gal 2:20; Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only is the presence of the Lord with us, but the Lord Himself lives within us and is even mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you merely had the presence of a piece of bread, would you be satisfied?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No, you would tell the bread, This is not good enough for me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I must take you in and digest you in order for you to be the very element of my being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your presence being with me is not good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I must take you in and digest you in order for you to become my element.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the New Testament blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many of us are still used to praying, Lord, grant us Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have done this as well, but after praying in such a way, I would tell myself, What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You do not merely have the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord today is food to you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You can take, eat, and digest Him, and He can be mingled with you, become a part of you, and become the very element of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just as tea is mingled with water, the Lord today is mingled with us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord is being mingled with us as our life and content, and we are the vessels as His containers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There needs to be a change in our thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must realize that we were not meant to do anything for Him; we were meant to enjoy Him and apply Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must remember that we are nothing but containers of the Lord and that the Lord should be our content.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our mind is a container for the Lord s mind, and the Lord s mind should be the content of our mind Phil 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The same is true of our will and emotion; our will is simply a container that must be filled by the will of the Lord, and our emotion is a container that must be filled with the emotions and love of the Lord Acts 16:7; Phil 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every part of our being is a container.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Just as our spirit is a container, our mind, will, and emotion are also containers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must let the Lord fill us and occupy us in every part of our being Eph 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must let Him fill our mind, will, and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we will have the mind of Christ, the will of the Lord, and the love and emotion of the Lord, as well as having the Spirit of the Lord in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our whole being will be saturated by and with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we want to be in the divine mingling, we must forget about our doing and working.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, we must pay our full attention to the matters of eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Day by day we should be eating and drinking Christians, not doing and working Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, when we come to the meeting and sit down, we often consider what we should do in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, we should not think about what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, we should contact the Lord, feed on the Lord, and drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should give up the thought of doing something and simply contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should say, Lord, thank You that once again I have the opportunity to contact You.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some people enjoy having a cup of coffee for refreshment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In a similar way, we should remind ourselves to take a cup of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should always take the chance to take in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we are going to visit a brother, we should not consider what to say or what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should simply contact the Lord, feed on the Lord, and drink the Lord, and then something will flow out as living water as the issue of our contact with the Lord, not of our doing or working.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even when we are ministering the word, we must forget about what we are doing and simply keep ourselves in contact with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While we are ministering, we should be feeding on the Lord and drinking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, while a lamp is shining, it is simultaneously being supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a lamp could speak, it would tell you, I do not know how to shine; I only know how to enjoy the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The shining is simply an issue of the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I do not have to worry about the shining; I simply abide in the electrical current and enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must forget about our doing and working and instead learn how to enjoy the Lord, eat the Lord, and drink the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is not a doctrine but a spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must learn how to love Him with our heart and enjoy Him with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord has given us a new heart and a new spirit and has put His Spirit into our spirit that we may enjoy Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must ask the Lord to create a new heart in us, a heart that is clean and pure, and to give us a right spirit that we may exercise our spirit to contact Him Psa 51:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By doing this we will constantly be filled with the Lord and occupied by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then our whole being will be transformed into the image of the Lord, the Lord will be formed in us, and we will be conformed to the image of the Lord 2 Cor 3:18; Gal 4:19; Rom 8:29 .</S>
