   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE GOD AS THE LIFE OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have previously seen how our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should pay particular attention to the fact that the apostle was very concerned for our body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ordinarily we think that Christ's life is for our spirit and not for our body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But actually, after our spirit receives the Holy Spirit, God's salvation goes to our body also.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If God intended for the Holy Spirit to dwell only in our spirit so that only the spirit would benefit, why did the apostle not say, "Your spirit is a temple of the Holy Spirit," rather than saying, "Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit"?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By now we should be clear that the fact of our body being the temple of the Holy Spirit is more than a special privilege; it is also an effective power.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit not only strengthens our inner man and enlightens the eyes of our heart, it also makes our body healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have also seen that the Holy Spirit gives life to our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is not waiting until we die before He resurrects us; even today He is imparting life to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the future He will resurrect our corrupted body, but today He gives life to our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The power of His life enters into every cell of our being and causes us to experience His life and power.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No longer do we believe that our body is a pitiful prison; rather, in it we see God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are now going forth to experience the words, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is now the source of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He lives in us today as He lived in His body of flesh in those days.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should be more clear about these words: "I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This abundant life supplies all the needs of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The apostle told Timothy to "lay hold on the eternal life" 1 Tim 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this instance, however, Timothy did not need eternal life to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, is not "eternal life" the life that is "really life" in verse 19?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Does not the apostle mean that Timothy should experience eternal life in this age and that this life is powerful enough to overcome all the effects of death?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are not ignorant of the fact that our body is a body of death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But we must know that we need life to swallow up the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Within our body are two forces: death and life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, there is the breaking down, and on the other hand, there is the replenishment by food and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The breaking down leads us close to death, while the supply of food and rest maintains our life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>An oversupply makes the body produce an "excess" because the force of life is great; overexhaustion makes the body weak because the force of death is also great.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is best to keep the forces of life and death in balance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The weariness that a believer feels in his body is in many ways different from that of ordinary people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His exhaustion is not merely in the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since he walks with the Lord, bears the burdens of others, has compassion for his brothers, works for God, intercedes before God, fights against the power of darkness, and buffets his body, food and rest alone cannot replenish the loss of strength in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why many believers, who were very healthy before they were called to the work, feel weakened not long afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our contact with the spiritual realm and all of our spiritual life, work, and warfare are beyond what our physical body can bear.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our contact with sins, sinners, and evil spirits dries up our body's resources so that we become unable to meet many needs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, if a believer relies on only natural means to replenish his physical needs, he will not make it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need Christ's life because this alone can satisfy our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should realize that if we rely on material food, nutrition, and medicine, we are looking to the wrong source.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only the life of the Lord Jesus can meet all the needs of our spiritual life, work, and warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He alone can replenish the strength we need to fight against sins and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only when a believer really knows what spiritual warfare is and how to wrestle in spirit with the enemy, will he know the preciousness of the Lord Jesus as life to his physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every believer must see the reality of his union with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord is the vine, and we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just as the branches are in union with the vine, so are we in union with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through their union with the vine, the branches receive the life flow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Does not our union with the Lord Jesus result in the same?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we limit this union to the spirit, our faith will not consent to such a restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our Lord has called us to realize the practicality of our union with Him; He wants us to believe and receive His life flow into our spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are cut off from the Lord, we will lose not only peace in the spirit but also healing in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If our union with the Lord is continuous, His life will fill our spirit and also flow into our body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Unless we truly share in the life of the Lord Jesus, we will neither be healed nor obtain health.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today God is calling His children to have a deeper union with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For this reason, we need to see that though these things transpire in the physical body, they are spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Receiving God's healing and strengthening is not a physical experience but a spiritual experience, even though it occurs in the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Such experiences are nothing less than the life of the Lord Jesus being expressed through our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Just as the life of the Lord Jesus resurrected our dead spirit in the past, it now enlivens our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God wants us to learn how to allow the resurrected, glorious, and ever-overcoming life of Christ to be manifested in every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He wants us to renew our strength from Him day by day and hour by hour.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is our real life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even though our physical body is still animated by our soul-life, we should not live by it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, we should depend on the life of God's Son which gives life to our members in a way that the soul-life cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should pay attention to the word "life."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All of our spiritual experiences come from this wonderful thing called "life" which richly enters into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God simply wants us to realize that Christ's life is our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Matthew 4 shows us that God's word is life to our physical body: "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God" v. 4 . This clearly points out that God's word can sustain our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>According to the natural way, man must live by bread; but when the word of God proceeds with its power, man can live by it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Here we see two ways of living: the supernatural and the natural.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>While God does not tell us not to eat, He wants us to know that His word can give us life that bread cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When bread cannot produce the effect that we expect, His word can give us the life that the bread fails to provide.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some live by bread, while others live by the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The former sometimes fails, but the latter never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God puts His life into His word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Just as He Himself is life, so also is His word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we take His word as a teaching, creed, and moral standard, it will not have any power toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God's word should be digested by and united with us in the same way that bread is.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hungry saints realize that God's word is their food.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When they receive it by faith, the word becomes their life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God said that His word can sustain our life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore, when natural food fails, we can believe God according to His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We will then see that God is life not only to our spirit but also to our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Today our failure to realize that there is a rich provision in God's Word the Bible for our physical body is a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We limit God's promises to our spiritual life and forget about our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But actually, the need of our physical body is no less than our spiritual needs.</S>
