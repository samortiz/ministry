<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. JEHOVAH TURNING THE CAPTIVITY<br>OF THE TENTS OF JACOB AND<br>HAVING COMPASSION ON HIS DWELLING PLACES</H2><P>Jehovah will turn the captivity of the tents of Jacob and will have compassion on his dwelling places (30:18a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The City Being Rebuilt on Its Mound, and<br>the Palace Being Inhabited after Its Own Manner</H2><P>The city will be rebuilt on its mound, and the palace will be inhabited after its own manner. Out from them will come thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry (vv. 18b-19a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The City of Jerusalem Being Built unto Jehovah</H2><P>In 31:38-40 Jehovah declares that days are coming when the city of Jerusalem will be built unto Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Word That Will Be Said<br>When Jehovah Turns Again Israel's Captivity</H2><P>When Jehovah will turn again Israel's captivity, they will say in the land of Judah and in its cities, "Jehovah bless you, O habitation of righteousness, / O mountain of holiness" (v. 23). Here habitation of righteousness refers to Jerusalem, and mountain of holiness, to Mount Zion. Judah and all its cities will dwell together in it, the farmers and they who wander with the flocks (v. 24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Jehovah Satisfying the Weary Soul<br>and Filling Every Languishing Soul</H2><P>Jehovah will satisfy the weary soul and fill every languishing soul (v. 25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Jehovah Sowing the House of Israel<br>with the Seed of Man<br>and with the Seed of Beast</H2><P>Jehovah will sow the house of Israel with the seed of man and with the seed of beast (v. 27). This indicates that the living of everything will be rich in life. Jehovah also said that as He has watched over them to pluck up, to break down, to overthrow, to destroy, and to bring evil, He will watch over them to build and to plant (v. 28).</P>
