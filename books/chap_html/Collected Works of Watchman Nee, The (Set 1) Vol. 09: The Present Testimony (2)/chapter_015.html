<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE NEW COVENANT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(5)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 32</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 26:28; Heb. 8:6-12</H1><P>We have previously seen that God is a God who makes covenants with man. We have also seen that instead of uplifting Himself to an untouchable position, God has lowered Himself to our position, so that we can enjoy the same rights as He has. We see that God has uplifted us. He has allowed us to deal with Him and ask of Him according to the covenant. God allows us to demand that He execute everything for us. Since this is the case, we can rise up and exercise our faith to hold onto God.</P><P>We have seen that in the original language, a covenant is both a covenant as well as a testament or a will. Covenant and will are the same word in the original language. Hebrews uses the word covenant many times. It first tells us that Christ is higher than the prophets, angels, Moses, Joshua, and Aaron. All this is very wonderful. But this is not the goal of the book. These teachings are indeed in Hebrews, and Bible expositors have done a commendable job on expounding them. But we see that Hebrews has one specific goal: to put the new covenant before us. This is repeatedly emphasized from chapter six to thirteen. Although this book mentions the blood, Aaron, Moses, and the sacrifices, all these things are mentioned in relation to the covenant. The goal of chapters six through thirteen is to tell us what the new covenant is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE COVENANT<br>AND THE TESTAMENT</H2><P>Who is the One who made the new covenant with us? Is it the Lord or is it God? It is God, not the Lord. The Lord Jesus shed His blood to accomplish the new covenant. But the One who made the covenant with us is God. He is the other party. Why is the covenant also a testament? The covenant is something that God has made and, therefore, is a covenant. The covenant is something that the Lord Jesus left to us at His death and, therefore, is a will. A covenant does not require the maker to die before it becomes effective, but a testament requires the testator to die before it becomes effective. It is universally agreed that when a man is still alive, his testament will not be put into effect. Therefore, we see that God made a covenant with us, while the death of the Lord Jesus has left us the testament. On the one hand, the Lord has redeemed the inheritance with His blood. On the other hand, He has left us the new covenant as our inheritance.</P><P>Hebrews 9:15-17 says, "And because of this He is the Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. For where there is a testament, the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established. For a testament is confirmed in the case of the dead, since it never has force when he who made the testament is living."</P><P>Hebrews 10:16-17 says, "`This is the covenant which I will covenant with them after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws upon their hearts, and upon their mind I will inscribe them,' He then says, `And their sins and their lawlessnesses I shall by no means remember anymore.'"</P><P>Please note that Hebrews 8 tells us that God has made a new covenant. He said, "I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them..for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them" (vv. 10-11). Chapter ten is merely a reiteration of the words of chapter eight.</P><P>Chapter nine tells us that the Lord Jesus Christ is "the Mediator of a new covenant." A more accurate translation should be "the Executor of a new covenant." The Lord is the One who executes the new covenant. Verse 10:16 says that God is the One who has covenanted the new covenant. As far as the new covenant is concerned, God is the Maker of the covenant, while as far as a testament is concerned, Christ is the Mediator. Now we will list the items included in the new covenant:</P><P>(1) Cleansing <b>}</b>	Salvation<br>(2) Knowledge <b>}</b> Victory<br>(3) Life and power <b>}</b> Victory</P><P>The covenant includes three main parts. Cleansing is in respect to sin. Knowledge is in respect to the knowledge of God, and life and power are in respect to victory. As far as making a covenant with us is concerned, God cleanses us, God grants the knowledge of God to us, and God gives us life and power. As far as a testament is concerned, Christ has willed cleansing to us, and Christ has willed the knowledge of God to us, and Christ has willed life and power to us.</P>
