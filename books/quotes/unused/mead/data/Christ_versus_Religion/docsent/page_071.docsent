   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN CHRIST VERSUS RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE EPISTLES Scripture Reading: Rom 2:29; 7:6; II Cor.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>3:6; Gal 1:12-16; 2:1-5, 11-14; 5:1-4, 25; 6:15; Eph 4:11-16; Phil 3:2-14; Col 2:8-9,16-17, 20-22; 3:11; Heb 7:16.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the verses which we have noted above, we have begun with Romans and ended with Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means we have covered almost the entire section of the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In all these letters we will see how much Christ is versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>IN ROMANS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the letter to the Romans we have selected two verses, one in chapter 2 and one in chapter 7.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In chapter 2 we read that what we need is nothing outwardly religious, but something inwardly in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter..." v. 29 . In other words, this verse tells us clearly that we should be in spirit, not just in the letter of the written Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This word is written by the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose there were not such a word in the Bible and I should say that you must be in the spirit and not care so much for the letter of the written Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I believe you would stone me to death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hallelujah, Paul the Apostle took the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not my teaching; this is my quotation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am just a little follower; the Apostle Paul is my protection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you would stone anyone, you must stone him first.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do have scriptural ground to say that what we need is something in the spirit, not anything merely in the letter according to the written Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Who can argue?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please do not misunderstand me: I am not saying, nor have I ever said, that we should not care for the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am saying that we must have something in the spirit, not merely according to the letter of the written Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What we need is the living Christ, not merely the black and white letters of the written code.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the principle of Christ versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have seen that the very Christ whom we enjoy today is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit, and that He, the life-giving Spirit, is made one with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit" I Cor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we say that we need to be "in spirit," we mean in this wonderful, mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this spirit we have the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Anything that is in spirit is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Merely to be in the letter of the written Scriptures is to be religious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who are such do not care for Christ; they only care for the written code.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have seen in the four Gospels the living Christ standing before those religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But they only cared for the letter of their Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In John chapter 7, in Christ's very presence, they asked, "What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hath not the scriptures said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>41-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On one hand they held their Bible, and on the other hand they were in the presence of the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They cared for their Bible, but not for the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do you think the situation of today's Christianity is any different?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>More than forty years ago I was with a group of Christians who spent much time with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I have never seen any like them who were so familiar with the letter of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One among them was even called "the living concordance."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At a certain time some among us began to have some living experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We heard the Lord speaking within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the news reached the leading one of that group, an old brother with extensive knowledge of the Bible, he was exceedingly surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He asked, "How could this be?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's Word from Genesis to Revelation has been absolutely completed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you would hear anything from God, you must study the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After completing the Bible, God never speaks to people any more."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This was their concept.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For anyone to hear a living word of God apart from studying the Bible was in their eyes as heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I was somewhat troubled by the attitude of such a leading and elderly brother.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But something within strengthened me to such an extent that I not only testified, but proclaimed that it is absolutely proper for the Lord to speak to people today in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This kind of situation exposes the state of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They care for their Bible, but they do not care for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They care for the doctrine concerning Christ, but they do not care for the living, instant Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Romans 7:6 says, "But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now we know what the word "letter" here refers to it is the written Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today we must serve the living Lord with newness in the spirit, not according to the oldness of the written Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I can say this boldly, because I am a little follower of this most bold one, the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now we serve not according to the oldness of the written code, the written Bible, but according to the newness of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Because in the spirit is Christ, while in the written code is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is Christ versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What is it to be religious?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To be religious is simply to be sound, scriptural, and fundamental, yet without the presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we lack His presence, regardless of how scriptural we are, we are simply religious.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Paul in these two verses of Romans laid a solid foundation for Christ versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today our service, our work, and even our life must be altogether in the spirit, not merely according to the letters of the written Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I know that when I say this I run a risk.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I will be charged with the heresy of turning people away from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But I simply refer you to these two passages of Scripture, Romans 2:29 and Romans 7:6.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Everyone must admit that the word "letter" in these passages refers to the written Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There can be no argument.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Christ is versus religion; Christ is versus the written code.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We may have the right quotation from the written code, yet miss Christ, just as the Pharisees and scribes in ancient times.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must be alert not to pay that much attention to the written code.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we do, it is altogether possible and extremely probable that we will miss Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The only way of safety is to behold "with unveiled face the glory of the Lord" II Cor.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>3:18 .</S>
