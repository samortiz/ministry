   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LETTER FROM BROTHER DAVID HSU</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To my dear brother in the Lord, Brother Nee:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I really am like a wounded soldier who has fallen near the line of battle in a remote border region.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am both fearful and sober!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The sound of the battle is close.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although the battle is not yet fierce, my boldness for battle has already vanished.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This has caused me to become nervous.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am afraid that I will shame the Lord's name!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not know what more I can do than to look to Him for these days.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Oh, I am so weak and ignorant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am also in such a solitary, cold, and remote situation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I do not know to what extent I will fail!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have gone to a high place a few times and looked out to see the environment around me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is as if the wind and snow in the wilderness have pierced my skin; I shiver with cold and shake.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I look at my inward faith, which is so weak that I have almost been disappointed to the point of retreat.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Oh, if His love had not given me a little warm strength and encouragement, I would have fallen into the disqualified crowd long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My cry is, "Lord, all else is up to You; just grant me one thing: to hold on and endure to the end of the road so that even if I die it will be in glory!"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There have been a few times that it seemed as if I had no hope to continue working, so I asked God "not to send me."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I never received any answer, however.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the contrary, I felt as if the burden were heavier.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>So I dare not move loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brother, think about it; this environment is so difficult to bear!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What sickness is it?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is the same with my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I only feel the "need," but when I kneel down, I "cannot" open my mouth; I can only sigh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is as if I have the burden to pray, but I do not have the unction to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes I do not even have the burden to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Is it the separation of sin?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Is it the attack of the enemy?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From the time I left Shanghai until now, I have not broken bread once, nor have I prayed with brothers in the way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The brothers I have met have either had their faces toward the world or their hearts toward another spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Oh, this condition makes me cry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although it is possible to remember the Lord alone, it is not as meaningful as when brothers "dwell in unity"!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I can say that the former is less than one ten thousandth as meaningful as the latter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I returned to Ting Hai this time because my mother is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There was a group of so-called Christians who asked me to preach to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I preached the gospel to them in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There was much grace, so they felt very satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the cross gradually became manifested, no one was willing to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was as if they did not even have the heart to pursue the crown behind the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Man's heart is only to receive the blessing, not the Lord who gives it!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to their opinion, "Being spiritual is important, but the flesh is also needed."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Oh, what kind of a saying is this?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But thank the Lord, those with ears really heard.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There was a "pastor" among them who was touched by the Lord in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He saw that his work in the past was just straw and wood.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He also saw that we should only honor the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He has set his heart and his will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now he just desires the time of the Lord's glorious appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May the Lord keep him and allow him to realize his desire to go to the conference in Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is a brother with a good foundation and talent.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is also the product of Shanghai and Kiangsu.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When I worship with my mother in Ting Hai, we can only weep.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She left the sisters in Shanghai, and if she does not return to Shanghai, she will never while she's on earth have the chance to take the cup again.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May the Lord's truth prosper in the whole earth so that the unwarranted loneliness and remoteness of His children can be reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Tomorrow, if the Lord is willing, I will take the 8:15 train to Shaoshing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There I will learn again from the Lord how to give Him the first place in the work and obey Him in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After the conference in Shaoshing, I will perhaps go to Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Maybe I will be able to partake of the table of love.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May the Lord who loves us protect you in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>May your spirit, soul, and body be hidden under the blood so that you may not be attacked by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>May the Lord bring the heavenly messages to earth through Christ and His Spirit so that you may have more revelation to tell all your brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>May the Lord cleanse your mouth and heart so that His all may flow through freely without frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I can only exercise my function as a member through prayer to bind and command the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Please forgive me for writing so much in a letter without order or politeness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is a little of what has flowed out from within.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have never spoken much.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hence, there is the need of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May you be satisfied in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>David Hsu,</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The twenty-fourth</S>
