   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The genealogy of Christ includes all kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From the lives of all these persons, we can discover certain principles which govern our association with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, we shall consider Tamar.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Tamar conceived through committing incest with her father-in-law Gen 38:6-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fault was on the side of her father-in-law, Judah, who admitted that she was more righteous than he Gen 38:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although Tamar may be held responsible to a certain extent, she was righteous, and she had a heart for the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The significance today is that if we care for Christ and are seeking Him, any way we can truly gain Him is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Following this, is Tamar's son, Pharez v. 3 . Tamar conceived twins Gen 38:27-30 . At the time of delivery, one boy, Zarah, tried to come out first, but he did not succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Pharez preceded him to be the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, the first became the last, and the last became the first.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Pharez inherited the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This proves that it is not up to man's endeavoring; it is up to God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We proceed to Rahab v. 5 . Rahab was a harlot in Jericho Josh 2:1 , yet she became a grandmother of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How could this be?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To answer this question, we need to find the principles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The entire population of Jericho was destroyed except Rahab, her family, and her possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She was saved because she turned to God and God's people Josh 6:22-23, 25; Heb 11:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Next is Boaz a type of Christ, and Ruth is a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Boaz redeemed Ruth; he also redeemed the birthright for her.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Boaz redeemed his kinsman's inheritance and married the man's widow Ruth 4:1-17 ; hence, he became a notable forefather and great associate of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a brother and a Boaz, you should daily take care of others' birthright enjoyment of Christ, not only your own.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We come now to Ruth 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Ruth belonged to the tribe of Moab Ruth 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Moabites were forbidden to enter the congregation of the Lord, even to the tenth generation Deut 23:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But Ruth was seeking God and God's people Ruth 1:15-17; 2:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This reveals a most prevailing principle: no matter who we are or what our background is, as long as we have a heart which seeks after God and God's people, we are in a position to be accepted into the birthright of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We continue with Jesse vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jesse is a person who brings forth Christ, who branches out Christ by being rooted in Christ see Isa 11:1, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is our source, and Christ is also our issue.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We move on to David the eighth son of his father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Bible the number eight signifies resurrection, a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>David was the last of the generations of the fathers, and also the first of the generations of the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To have the rich enjoyment of Christ, often requires us to be the end of one situation and the beginning of another situation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After David committed murder and adultery, he repented.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>David repented and God forgave.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Altogether we have three items here: transgression, repentance, and forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we put all three together, the result is Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church is always built up by this kind of person, Solomon, the issue of man's transgression and repentance plus God's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>27-36</S>
