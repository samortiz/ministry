<h1 class="title">THE SECOND LINK&mdash;DEATH</h2>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rom. 5:12; 6:23; Ezek. 18:4</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Death comes from sin, and hence is joined to sin<br />
<span class="normal">The more sin a man commits the faster he dies.</span></li>
<li>There are four steps in death
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The spirit is dead, lacking any sense of morality, and without knowledge of God.</li>
	<li>The body will die.</li>
	<li>The soul will be cast into Hades.</li>
	<li>At the end of the world, the body, soul, and spirit will be reunited to be thrown into the lake of fire.</li>
	</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">THE THIRD LINK&mdash;JUDGMENT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Heb. 9:27; Rev. 20:11-13</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>There is a coming judgment<br />
<span class="normal">All the iniquity and unrighteousness that a man commits in his lifetime cannot be erased merely by death. There will be a judgment.</span></li>
<li>In His word God said that man will suffer His judgment</li>
<li>The future judgment is after a man&rsquo;s death<br />
<span class="normal">The death of a man is not his end, but the beginning of a second stage.</span></li>
<li>The future judgment will be according to man&rsquo;s deeds today</li>
<li>The future judgment is altogether just and righteous<br />
<span class="normal">It will be the judgment before the great white throne.</span></li>
<li>Unless a man believes in the Lord Jesus today, in that judgment he will stand condemned</li>

<li>Hell as God&rsquo;s jail
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When someone commits a crime he is judged and then put into jail.</li>
	<li>The universe is governed by God.</li>
	<li>When man transgresses the law of God, he must be put into God&rsquo;s jail.</li>
	<li>This universal jail is called hell.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Hell being the lake of fire
