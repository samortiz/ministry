<h1 class="title">TEACHERS&rsquo; TRAINING<br />
(2)<br />
LEARNING TO TEACH GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY<br />
IN AN EXPERIENTIAL WAY, AND<br />
CONVERTING DOCTRINE INTO EXPERIENCE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 2:4; 3:15; 2 Tim. 1:6-7; 2:2, 15, 22, 25</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>When you help the young people, do not give them a lot of doctrines; instead, give them something practical:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We should not put too much emphasis on doctrines, not only when we have personal contact with them but also when we are preaching the gospel or giving messages to them.</li>
	<li>Because young people have many practical problems, we need to spend some time to study the problems of the young people in their practical living; then what you speak is practical and related to the practical matters that you have touched in their lives.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In teaching the truth to the young people, we need to learn how to teach God&rsquo;s economy in an experiential way&mdash;1 Tim. 1:3-4; 2 Tim. 1:6-7; 2:2, 22:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The teaching in the New Testament is focused on God&rsquo;s economy; however through the centuries there have been many teachings that have not been on God&rsquo;s economy; we must learn from history not to teach anything other than God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;1 Tim. 1:3-4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Greek word for <em>economy</em> means &ldquo;household law&rdquo; and implies distribution; this word denotes a household management, a household administration, a household government, and, derivatively, a dispensation, a plan, or an economy for administration (distribution); hence, it is a household economy&mdash;v. 4; Eph. 1:10; 3:9.</li>
		<li>There are many other matters in the Bible, such as the law, history and the prophecies, which can become distractions to us; some are distracted from God&rsquo;s economy through their readings of the Psalms or Proverbs.</li>
		<li>As we teach in the Summer School of Truth, we should not have any burden, any view, or any vision other than God&rsquo;s economy; in our teaching we should know only one thing&mdash;God&rsquo;s economy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order for us to be those who are competent to teach God&rsquo;s economy and fulfill our commission, we have to be on fire; this is the reason Paul reminded Timothy to &ldquo;fan into flame the gift of God,&rdquo; which was in him&mdash;2 Tim. 1:6; 2:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God has given us two precious things&mdash;His divine life and His divine Spirit; now we need to fan the gift of God into flame:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The first step in fanning the gift is not to exercise; the first step is to open all the &ldquo;doors&rdquo; and &ldquo;windows&rdquo;; we need to open our entire being&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will, our entire soul, our heart, and even our spirit.</li>
			<li>Those who teach in the Summer School of Truth must open their entire being so that the &ldquo;draft&rdquo; may come in; the Spirit is in us already, but we need to fan the fire, the Spirit, into flame.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>If our being is closed, we need to call on the name of the Lord Jesus; as we call on the Lord, we open not only our mouth but also our spirit and our heart; then the draft will come in, and that will fan into flame the eternal life and the eternal Spirit within us&mdash;v. 22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we would go to our class in the Summer School of Truth with a flame, we must be a person of prayer; if we are such a person, we will bring a spirit of prayer, an atmosphere of prayer, to our class.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Once we have an atmosphere of prayer, we are now ready to teach, not in a doctrinal way but in an experiential way; by doing this we will turn our teaching from doctrine to experience; this experiential fellowship will deeply impress the young people:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We should not ask our students merely to remember and recite all the points related to the lesson; that would be to teach in a doctrinal way:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we would teach in an experiential way, we should help the young people to realize their situation and condition.</li>
		<li>We must learn in our teaching to touch others experientially; we must apply every point of our teaching to their personal, practical situation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we teach a class in the Summer School of Truth, we should not take the way of giving messages or lectures; instead, we need to have personal talks with the young people, teaching every point experientially:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Every point of the lesson should be presented in a way that will create an experiential impression; apply every point to their actual situation.</li>
		<li>As we are talking with them, we should be watchful over each one, paying particular attention to their expressions; this will help us to know the needs of our students.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If you want to stir up a praying spirit in the person with whom you are speaking, you yourself must be a person who is full of the praying spirit; adequate prayer will accomplish at least three things: it will impress the young people in an experiential way with the points of the lesson, stir up the praying spirit within them, and cause them to become living.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to teach in an experiential way, we must convert every point in the lesson from doctrine into experience; after making such a conversion during our time of preparation, we should then speak to the young people about each point in the way of experience:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The more we speak in this way, the more they will be unveiled; they will see a vision that will expose them, and spontaneously they will be ushered into the experience of the very matter we have been presenting.</li>
	<li>If we teach in the way of merely imparting doctrines from the printed materials, we will do nothing more than impart some knowledge to the minds of our students; as a result, they will gain nothing in an experiential way:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The knowledge they gain may damage them; later, on another occasion, when they hear that word, they might say, &ldquo;I know this already; I heard all about it in the Summer School of Truth.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>We must not damage the young people by giving them mere knowledge; in order to profit them with the truth, we must always teach them in an experiential way.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Before we begin to teach the young people in the Summer School of Truth, we ourselves need to receive Paul&rsquo;s inoculation and be filled, soaked, and saturated with the truth&mdash;1 Tim. 2:4; 3:15; 2 Tim. 2:15, 25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The word <em>truth</em> has been wrongly understood by many readers of the Bible because they regard truth as a matter of doctrine; in the New Testament <em>truth</em> refers not to doctrine but to the real things revealed in the New Testament concerning Christ and the church according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;1 Tim. 2:4; cf. 1 John 1:6.</li>
	<li>The element of the inoculation against the decline is the structure of the divine truth; the structure of the divine truth is the Triune God plus His redemption, which becomes our salvation.</li>
	<li>The general subject of the first series of lessons in the Summer School of Truth is God&rsquo;s full salvation; the full salvation of God is actually equal to the truth, because the Triune God with His all-inclusive redemption is the structure of the truth.</li>
	<li>As we prepare ourselves to teach, we should not merely put our trust in the lesson book; we need to immerse ourselves in the truth concerning God&rsquo;s full salvation.</li>
	</ol></li>
