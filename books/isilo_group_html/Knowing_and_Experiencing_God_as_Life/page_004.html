<p>Some believers do not turn to their spirit when they pray. Some believers pray according to their mind and their preference, and they do not touch their spirit. Such believers pray in the outer man; they do not turn to their spirit in order to pray. As a result, it is difficult for them to touch the Lord.</p>
<p>When we pray, we must turn away from outward things to our spirit. We close our eyes when we pray in order to stop our person. We do not want to turn to the outward things, nor do we want the outward things to distract our inner being. When we turn to our spirit in order to touch God, our prayer will not follow our thoughts or emotions; rather, our prayer will follow the sense in our spirit. Then as we pray one sentence at a time, we will touch God, and our prayer will be solid. This is the way to absorb the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Eating the Lord through Reading the Bible</h2>
<p>It is also easy to touch the Lord when we turn to our spirit and read His Word. Even if we do not understand some words, we can still touch the Lord in our spirit. We might forget what we read, but the Lord has entered into us. Sometimes we are touched by a word or a phrase. We might not understand the words, but we sense that they are precious, and we receive them. These words convey the Lord and His riches to us. When we receive these words, we also receive the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Eating the Lord to Live and to Grow</h2>
<p>When we pray and read the Word in this way, we will feel satisfied within, just as if we have eaten a meal. Prayer is to contact the Lord, and reading the Word is also to contact the Lord. When we contact Him through prayer and reading the Word, we receive Him. When an electric stove is plugged into an electrical outlet, electricity will immediately flow into the stove. After five minutes the stove will become red hot because of electrical heat. The electric stove is contacting and absorbing electricity. Similarly, when we pray and read the Bible, we contact and absorb the Lord. We eat the Lord by absorbing Him.</p>
<p>When we eat the Lord, His element will increase within us. As long as we will spend a little time in the morning, during the day, and in the evening to turn to our spirit and pray or read the Bible, we will touch, contact, and eat the Lord. What we receive will become our inner supply, our bread of life. It is by and through this inner supply of the bread of life that we can live on the earth.</p>
<p>A good example is an electric fan, which turns continuously by means of an electric current. When we switch off the fan, electricity cannot flow in, and the fan will stop turning. This is an example of how we can live before God. If we contact the Lord, absorb Him, receive Him, and allow Him to enter into us to be our life supply, we will be able to live by Him and express Him.</p>
<p>In order to live in Him, we must daily spend time to turn to our spirit and to read the Word. We can spend ten minutes, twenty minutes, or even better, thirty minutes to read the Word. We must find some time to spend before the Lord. He is in the Word and also in the Spirit. When we touch the Spirit and touch the Word, we touch the Lord. The more we contact Him, the more we will absorb Him and the more we will receive an inward supply, because He is our nourishment. Just as we live and grow by eating food, when we take the Lord as our nourishment, daily we will live by Him and also grow.</p>
<p>John 6:57 and 63 speak of the same thing. In verse 57 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo; The disciples did not understand this word. Therefore, in verse 63 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; The Lord is in His words, and He is in the Spirit so that we can receive Him. To receive the Lord in His words and in the Spirit is to eat Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING BECAUSE THE LORD LIVES</h2>
<p>In John 14:19 the Lord said, &ldquo;Because I live, you also shall live.&rdquo; This refers to the Lord Jesus living in us through His resurrection. The Lord&rsquo;s death was His going, and His resurrection was His coming. In His death the Lord left the disciples, but in His resurrection He entered into the disciples. Hence, we who believe into Him also live, because He has entered into us and is living in us. For this reason, in verse 20 the Lord said, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; This verse is concerning the union between the Lord and us. In order to live before the Lord and to allow Him to be life in us, we should not only turn to our spirit in order to contact and eat Him through His Word; we also need to maintain the condition of being joined to Him. No matter what we are doing, we must be in the Lord and He must be in us.</p>
<p>According to our experience, we are often not in the Lord when we do something or when we speak. It seems as though we leave Him or that He leaves us. Such a feeling is a warning, telling us that our condition is not right. Hence, we must quickly correct our situation and restore our condition; we must restore our experiential union with Him. We should be able to say, &ldquo;It is the Lord doing this with me, and it is the Lord speaking with me.&rdquo; If we can live in this condition every day, we will be those who take Christ as life and live by Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Knowing and Experiencing God as Life &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
