   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PERFECTING THE SAINTS TO ARRIVE AT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MEASURE OF THE STATURE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST AND</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>TO SUBMIT TO THE HEAD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to be clear concerning the building in Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 13 clearly says that the building is for us to arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God so that we have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, as we perfect the saints, we cause them to know the Son of God and to have the increase of the stature of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We perfect the saints with the tree of life, the living God, and with the resurrected Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, there must be no lack in our knowledge and experience of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not experience the tree of life, breathe the living God, and know and appropriate the riches of Christ, the Son of God, we will not be able to build others with these items.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The number of messages that we can give does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What matters is how much we can dispense the riches of Christ into the saints, give them the tree of life to eat, and help them to breathe the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This requires us to experience these things first; otherwise, how can we lead others to know and enjoy these things?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 15 says that we should lead all the saints, ourselves included, to hold to truth in love and to grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In other words, perfecting is not only a matter of life but also of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To grow up into Him indicates the aspect of life, and to grow up into...the Head, Christ indicates the aspect of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In all things means that in every item of our daily life we live in Christ, we breathe God, we eat the tree of life, and we enjoy the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Formerly we were outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After our salvation we may be in Christ in certain things, but in other things we are still outside of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we need to grow up into Christ in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is growth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In all things we should breathe, eat, drink, and enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the end, we submit to Christ s authority in whatever things we have grown up into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is because the One into whom we grow is the Head of the church and our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our work should be according to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to learn to always enjoy and absorb God, live in His life, and enjoy His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we grow into Him in one item after another, we submit to His authority as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because we bring everything under the ruling, the authority, of the Head, when we labor to perfect and lead the saints, we will spontaneously lead them to grow up into God, that is, to enjoy and absorb God in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the saints are joined to God in all things, they will spontaneously bring every matter under the authority of the Head and submit to the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the kind of work that we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our work is to perfect the saints so that they can be built, function, and be responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The content and element of our work, however, must be God, the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, who is the Son of God, and the life and authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The issue of such a work will make the church the Body of Christ and will cause the church to build itself up in love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE TWO ASPECTS OF OUR WORK</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The brothers and sisters who serve in the localities must know that in our service and labor there must be the elements of God and the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These elements cause our work to be solid.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should never be satisfied and proud because we lead many people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not be satisfied because we are able to deliver good and interesting messages that supply the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Neither should we be satisfied because we lead the saints to be in one accord, to love one another, to zealously pursue the Lord, and to serve in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These are not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These things are good according to the concept in Christianity, but we should not be satisfied with these things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our work is to help the saints to enjoy God, know the Son of God, and grow unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In everything we lead the saints into the life and authority of the Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must be impressed with this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the same time, we perfect and build up the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then the saints in the locality where we labor will not only know how to absorb and enjoy God, to grow in Christ, to touch the divine life in everything, and to submit to God s authority, but they will also be perfected and built up to be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They will be a supply so that the Body of Christ can be built up in love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether we remain in the locality or leave, there will be a corporate entity that is full of God, has a measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, and is full of the life and authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There will also be a good coordination, and many will be perfected and built up to exercise their function to do the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whether we stay in that locality, are raptured, or leave, the church will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the work that we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, we must be delivered from our old concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may have the concept that the place where we labor is our field, as if the church is our personal enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must drop this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We do not have a personal field, and no church is our personal enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The content of our work must always cause the saints to gain God; in everything we must lead the saints to breathe God, to enter into the life of Christ, and to submit to the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our work must also perfect and build up the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we labor in this way, it will not matter whether we stay in a locality or leave.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There will always be a group of believers who are built up in a solid way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the kind of work that we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we do not work in this way, we will either become a resident pastor or a traveling evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we labor in only one place, we become resident pastors, and if we travel to different localities, we will be traveling evangelists.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Every day I pray, Lord, I do not want to be a resident pastor or a traveling evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When people ask me what I do, I say that I am neither a resident pastor nor a traveling evangelist; I just work according to my portion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In simple terms, my portion is to impart God into the saints and perfect them so that they can be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we can all do this, it will not matter whether we stay or leave.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What matters is the content of our work and how we work.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whether we stay in one place or travel to many places is insignificant if we work God into others and perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the crux of all our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christianity is in a poor condition, but we have received mercy from the Lord to see the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God has brought us to a high mountain to see the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He has brought us also to the wilderness to see the condition of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The contrast between the New Jerusalem and Christianity gives me a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Furthermore, the situation in our meetings and the condition of the serving ones make my burden heavier.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May the Lord have mercy on us and show us a clear vision that surpasses the condition of Christianity and meets His need.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then our work will be of value in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Otherwise, we will merely be resident pastors and traveling evangelists.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we truly see a vision, our work will excel; it will not be low.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We will be neither a resident pastor nor a traveling evangelist; rather, we will be ministers appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We will have a portion, and we will work according to our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must see these two crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>First, we must minister God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Second, we must perfect and build up the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we neglect both or either one of these points, our service is not up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Instead of being a worker in the present age, we will merely be a preacher in traditional Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>These two points are serious: on the one hand, we minister God, and on the other hand, everything that we do is to perfect and build up the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we can grasp these two points, the churches will have a future, and our work will be of value and surpass the situation in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Instead of being traditional Christians in Christianity, we will be workers in the present age who have a clear vision of what the Lord desires to do in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must be strong and always impart God into others and lead them to enjoy the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We must also perfect and build them up.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Then the place where we labor will have the increase of God, it will not lack the building, and there will be the continuous perfecting and building up.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>A vessel will be built up that can bring in and contain God s blessing and distribute it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is what we should do today.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must understand that the Lord did not raise us up to fight with other believers concerning the interpretation of the truth or even concerning spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The Lord raised us up and blessed us for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We should fight the good fight and engage in spiritual warfare for the building up of the church.</S>
