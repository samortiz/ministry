        <h2 class="head1">THE WORD BECOMING FLESH</h2>
<p>The Word becoming flesh means that God and man were joined as one. Our words express and represent us. Likewise, the Word of God expressed and manifested God (John 1:1). The word <em>flesh</em> points to the physical body of fallen man. The Bible often refers to fallen man as flesh because fallen man lives according to his flesh (Rom. 3:20; Gal. 2:16; 1 Cor. 1:29). Therefore, the flesh refers not only to the physical body of fallen man but also to man after the fall. The Word becoming flesh means that the manifested God became a man of flesh in the likeness of a sinful man. By doing so, God entered into sinful man and became one with sinful man. However, He had only the likeness of sinful man and not the sin of sinful man. When the Word became flesh, God was manifested in the flesh (John 1:14; 1 Tim. 3:16). The Word is God, and the Word becoming flesh is God being manifested. This manifestation is in the flesh, that is, in humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING THE LIKENESS<br />
OF THE FLESH</h2>
<p>Although the Word becoming flesh is God being manifested in and joined to fallen man, the Lord Jesus had only the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3). The Lord Jesus was without the sin of fallen man, just as the bronze serpent in Numbers 21:6-9 had the form of a serpent but not its poison. The bronze serpent is a type of Christ, the incarnated God (John 3:14). Although Christ came in the likeness of the flesh of sin, He did not know sin (2 Cor. 5:21). He became a man with the human nature, but He did not have the sin in the fallen human nature.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BORN OF A WOMAN</h2>
<p>Christ did not have sin, because He was born of a woman and not of a man (Gal. 4:4). Every person who is born on earth is of the seed of man. Only Christ is not of the seed of man; He is of the seed of a woman (Gen. 3:15). Christ is not of the seed of Adam, and He does not have Adam&rsquo;s sinful life. The Lord&rsquo;s humanity was conceived in the womb of a chaste virgin through the Holy Spirit. He did not possess Adam&rsquo;s sinful nature, because He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a woman (Luke 1:34-35; Matt. 1:20-23). Although Christ was not touched by man&rsquo;s sin, He had a genuine human nature and was in the likeness of men.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BECOMING IN THE LIKENESS OF MEN</h2>
<p>Christ existed in the form of God, but in order to accomplish redemption and be joined to man, He laid aside the form of God and put on the likeness of men, even taking the form of a slave (Phil. 2:6-7). According to His outward form, He was a man. Consequently, the Jews, who saw and knew Him according to His outward likeness, insisted that He was merely a man. They refused to believe Him when He said, &ldquo;I am the Son of God&rdquo; (John 10:33-36), and people regarded Him only as a man from Nazareth, that is, as an ordinary man born of human parents (1:45; Matt. 13:55-56). Even His disciples recognized Him as a man, because He was a genuine man (8:27).</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GENUINE MAN</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus was a genuine man. There was nothing about Him that caused people to doubt that He was a man. The Bible refers to Him as a man (1 Tim. 2:5), and the Lord Jesus also referred to Himself as the Son of Man (Luke 19:10; Matt. 16:13, 27; John 3:14). Even though He is God and the angels minister to Him, He was made a little inferior to the angels (Heb. 2:9). This means that He was in the likeness of men, in the likeness of those whom He would rescue (v. 14), possessing the human life and nature and partaking of flesh and blood. He was made like us in all things, but He was without sin.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAST ADAM</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45). Adam is a type of the Lord Jesus (Rom. 5:14). Adam was a man, and the Lord is a man. Adam was the first Adam, the first man, but the Lord Jesus is the last Adam, the second man (1 Cor. 15:47). Just as Adam was the head and representative of all human beings, who were in him as his descendants, Christ is the Head and Representative of all the people who are in Him. Adam is one with those who belong to him, and he is the same as them in all things. Christ is also one with those who belong to Him, and He is like them in all things except in the matter of sin.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING GOD YET MAN</h2>
<p>Although the Lord Jesus was made like us, yet without sin, He is not only a man; He is also God. He is God yet man. He is God, but He became a man. He is a genuine man, and He is the true God. He possesses the human life and nature, and He also possesses the divine life and nature. He bears the image and likeness of a man, and He also bears the image of God. While He lived on earth, His outward form was that of a man, but inwardly He was also God. People saw His human life and nature, but He was filled also with the divine life and nature. He expressed the human image and likeness, but hidden within Him was God&rsquo;s image. Outwardly He had &ldquo;no attracting form nor majesty,&rdquo; but inwardly He was full of God&rsquo;s glory and beauty (Isa. 53:2; Col. 2:9; Heb. 1:3). He descended out of heaven, but He was still in heaven (John 3:13). He spoke of Himself as the Son of Man (1:51), and He also spoke of Himself as the Son of God (9:35-38). He even said that He was one with the Father (10:30). He was manifested among men as a man, but He also let people know that He was equal with God and that He was God (5:17-18; 10:33).</p>
<p>The Lord lived a human life on earth, and He was found in fashion as a man. Hence, people believed that He was a man. At the same time, however, He executed God&rsquo;s authority, exercised God&rsquo;s wisdom, and manifested God&rsquo;s glory so that people could see that He was the very God. At the wedding feast in Cana He changed water into wine. Then people realized that He was God the Creator, who can create something out of nothing (2:1-11; 1:3; Rom. 4:17). In a boat on the Sea of Galilee He rebuked the wind and the sea, bringing in a great calm. Then the disciples realized that He was God, who rules over all things (Mark 4:35-41).</p>
<p> Until He took Peter, James, and John to a high mountain, they thought that the Lord was a man just like them. When He was transfigured, and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light, they realized that He was one with the God of glory (Matt. 17:1-8). In the matter of paying the temple tax, Peter considered the Lord only in His status as a man and a law-abiding citizen. But when He directed Peter to get a stater from the mouth of a fish in order to pay the temple tax, the Lord showed Peter that He was God to whom all things belong (vv. 24-27). When the Lord wept in front of a sorrowful crowd by Lazarus&rsquo;s tomb, people saw Him as a genuine man, full of human emotions. When He later cried out for Lazarus to come out from the tomb, people saw that He was the ever-living God, who gives life to the dead (John 11:25-44).</p>
<p>When the Lord prayed in agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, and His sweat was like great drops of blood, His sufferings as a man were apparent (Luke 22:39-46). When the Roman cohort and the attendants from the chief priests and Pharisees came to arrest Him, however, He identified Himself with the words &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; (&ldquo;I Am&rdquo; is the meaning of the name Jehovah, as in Exodus 3:14.) This caused those who came to draw back and fall to the ground (John 18:1-8). He manifested Jehovah, the One who has authority. He was Jesus the Nazarene whom they sought to arrest, but He was also Jehovah, the self-existing and ever-existing great I Am. Outwardly He was in the lowly, humble likeness of a man, but inwardly He was filled with the glorious image of God. The glorious image of God was concealed within His lowly and humble likeness of a man, just as the glory and beauty of the gold in the tabernacle was hidden within by rough and tough porpoise skins (Exo. 36:19). Nevertheless, His actions revealed God&rsquo;s image and glory through the veil of His flesh. He was a genuine man and the true God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
