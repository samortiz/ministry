   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE PERFECT MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For us to experience Christ, we must receive a revelation concerning His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must see the two major aspects concerning the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first aspect is that He is the complete God, and the second aspect is that He is the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is both the complete God and the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In brief, He is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do have a wonderful Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is not only wonderful as the complete God, but He is also wonderful as the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE PERFECT MAN</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this chapter we will see seventeen items concerning Christ as the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not have a clear vision concerning Christ as these seventeen items, we cannot know Christ in full.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Conceived of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>in a Human Virgin</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This perfect Man, Christ, was conceived of the Holy Spirit in a human virgin Matt 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The conception of a person is the constitution of that person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ was constituted of the Holy Spirit in a human virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we saw in the previous message, the Holy Spirit is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we touch any One of the Three, the Father, the Son, or the Spirit, we touch the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Both Matthew 1:18 and 20 and Luke 1:35 tell us that Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the very Christ was conceived of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was conceived of the Holy Spirit, yet in a human virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word Holy refers to the Spirit, indicating the complete God, and the word human refers to mankind, since a virgin is part of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that Christ was conceived of the complete God in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the conception of Christ, there were two essences the essence of God and the essence of man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On one hand, Christ was conceived of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This involves the essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the other hand, He was born of a human virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This involves the essence of man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, Christ is constituted of the essence of God and the essence of man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Among mankind there has been no other one like this.</S>
