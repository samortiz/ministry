   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FELLOWSHIP BY BROTHER HSU FROM TAINAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The problem of the church in Tainan is exactly the same as other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our supply to the brothers and sisters is very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In recent days we have begun to feel that our vessels are too small; if we take care of one item, we cannot take care of another item.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not visit those who have not come to the meetings for a long time, and our supply to those who come to the meetings regularly is very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our daily church life, although we try our best to have good fellowship with the saints and give them a good leading, we are unable to supply them adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We feel that our vessel is too small, and we do not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE MORE WE EXPERIENCE THE BREAKING,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE MORE WE ARE ENLARGED</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we desire our small vessels to be enlarged, we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man is limited, but the Lord is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord can turn our limitedness into unlimitedness; this requires our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Several have had this kind of experience; they had a great turn in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, some people are not naturally eloquent, and they always stammer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, after they pray before the Lord in tears, marvelously, they become very fluent when they stand up to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the one hand, we should admit that we are limited and that our vessels are too poor; on the other hand, we should pray and look to the Lord that He would enlarge us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everyone who has some real experiences in the Lord has experienced being enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our experience of the Lord involves enlarging; it does not cause us to become proud, but it causes us to be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more a person has experience and learning in the Lord, the more he is enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The basic principle of being enlarged is to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The extent that a person is broken before the Lord determines the extent to which he has been enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A person is narrow because he is not willing to be broken, and a person s unwillingness to be broken causes him to become narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more intense the breaking, the more a person is enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a fixed principle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we lead the brothers and sisters, we should give them the feeling that our service is like fire burning in the thornbush.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the vision Moses saw: fire was burning in the thornbush, but the thornbush was not consumed Exo 3:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fire was burning in the thornbush, but the fire was not using the thornbush as fuel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The thornbush was Moses, who represents us, and the fire is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When God uses a person, it is God who is burning in the person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, he is not destroyed or consumed by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, in our service, we should not look at our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more we look at our condition, the more we will feel like a thornbush; that is, we will feel that we are no match for Egypt and that we cannot stand before Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to see that we are in God s hands, that it is He who is using us, and that it is His holy fire burning in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is His grace and His might; everything depends on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Moses was called, the first vision he saw was the fire burning in the thornbush.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only then did he have the second vision in which he saw that he was fully leprous within 4:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Anyone who has a desire to serve the Lord must have these two visions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to see that we are a thornbush, which is useless, but this should not discourage us, because the fire can burn in the thornbush.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This vision shows that no vessel is great enough to satisfy God s demand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moses was a remarkable person, but in God s vision, he was just a thornbush.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Israelites could be saved by the fire that was burning in the thornbush, not because of the thornbush itself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When Moses stood before Pharaoh, it was a scene of the fierce fire burning in a thornbush, and Pharaoh could not withstand it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is something that all serving ones should have; we should not continually turn to look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first few chapters of Exodus show a beautiful scene of a person who is nothing, who is just a thornbush, but who could not be defeated by anything of Egypt because of the fire burning within him.</S>
