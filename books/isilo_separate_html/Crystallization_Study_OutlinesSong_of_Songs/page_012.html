<h1 class="title">Becoming a Terrible Army and the Shulammite</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S.S. 6:4b, 10b, 13</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Becoming a terrible army&mdash;6:4b, 10b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since the overcoming believers have become the sanctuary of God and the heavenly bodies, they also become a terrible army:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>An army fights the battle for God&rsquo;s kingdom in the degradation of God&rsquo;s people to be the overcomers answering the Lord&rsquo;s call&mdash;Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21.</li>
		<li>A terrible army signifies that these overcomers of the Lord terrify God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, and become terrible in the eyes of God&rsquo;s people.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&quot;With banners&quot; indicates that the overcomers are ready all the time to fight, and it is also a sign of victory.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Becoming the Shulammite&mdash;6:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Shulammite</em> is the feminine form of <em>Solomon,</em> indicating that now the overcomers have become the same as Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Shulammite was a country girl.</li>
		<li>Now, as a counterpart of Solomon, she has become the same as Solomon in life, in nature, in expression, and in function for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>This signifies that:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The overcomers were sinners.</li>
		<li>Now, in the maturity of Christ&rsquo;s life, they have become the same as Christ in life, in nature, in expression, and in function for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
