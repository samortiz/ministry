   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 4 DAY 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2 Cor 5:17 So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The old things have passed away</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rom 6:4 Walk in newness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Clearance of the Past</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After a person is saved, his old way of living and his old conduct of the past should come to an end. Before he received salvation, he was a sinner living in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was also a man of the old creation, behaving in the way of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But now, having been saved, he has become a man of the new creation with the life of the new creation; as such he should have a new beginning, a new start, and live a new life spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Old Testament, when the children of Israel were saved by their keeping of the Passover, they immediately left Egypt, forsaking all Egyptian ways of living and fully ending, concluding, all the Egyptian things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From that day, the life they lived was new, the way on which they walked was new, and all the things they did were new.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The things of the past and the living of the former days were completely ended.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a distinct type of the clearance of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although the Bible contains no plain teaching concerning the clearance of the past, it does include some passages that are pertinent to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to these passages, we may extract the following four points: 1 the relationship between the clearance of the past and salvation, 2 the basis of the clearance of the past, 3 examples of the clearance of the past, and 4 the extent of the clearance of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First , the clearance of the past is not a requirement for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is because God's salvation is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No matter how grievous or deep our sins might be, they are all under the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no need for us to do or add anything before we can be forgiven by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's forgiveness is based upon the precious blood of the Lord Jesus, and it is also the issue of our repentance and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because of our enjoyment of God's salvation, God's life in us causes us to have a change in our mood, taste, and feeling toward the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even our taste toward daily necessities, such as eating and clothing, is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we spontaneously put an end to our old way of living, that is, we clear away the things in our living which have evolved from the past to the present, no longer allowing them to persist or continue.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a clearance is an issue of our enjoyment of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence , if we, the saved ones, desire to have a better Christian life, to walk properly on the way of the Lord, and to witness for the Lord, our past life must be brought to an end.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second , the clearance of the past is not according to the demand of outward regulations but according to the moving of the Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>80 The religions of the world are built on their various religious codes, and their followers live and behave according to these rules.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the Lord's salvation is not like that.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The salvation of the Lord, through the regeneration of the Holy Spirit, gives us a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because we have a new life, the divine life, we can now live and behave in the presence of God through the sense of this life and through the moving of the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, the clearing of the past is based on the move of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit will move within a regenerated person and cause him to sense certain things from his past that need to be cleared, for such things are not compatible with his new life as a believer in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>81 Furthermore, this clearance is not a regulation in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church has no such regulation or requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, the life we have obtained is holy, and the Spirit in us is moving and working.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, the Spirit will definitely require us, by the holy life within us, to remove all idols and things pertaining to idols , demonic and dirty things, to restore what we owe , and to cut off the old way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our responsibility is to follow the leading of the Spirit and to allow Him to move freely.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>82</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
