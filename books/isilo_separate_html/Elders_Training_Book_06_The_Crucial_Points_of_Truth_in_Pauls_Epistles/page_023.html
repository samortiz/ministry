TO CREATE ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>This crucial point is covered in 2:11-22. Christ broke down the middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles by abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances. When He was crucified on the cross, all the ordinances were nailed there. The law spoken of in 2:15 is not the law of the moral commandments, but the law of the ritual commandments, such as the ordinances of circumcision, keeping the sabbath, and eating certain foods.</p>
<p>When Christ died on the cross, He not only dealt with sins, the old man, Satan, and the world; He also dealt with the ordinances. On the cross Christ abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances. Therefore, by His death on the cross, Christ dealt with five categories of things: sins, the old man, Satan, the world, and the ordinances. We cannot be all right until the ordinances have been dealt with. The ordinances, the different ways of living and worshipping, had to be abolished by Christ on the cross so that He could create in Himself the one new man.</p>
<p>The new man, which is the church, is corporate and universal. There are many believers, but there is only one new man in the universe. All the believers are the components of this one corporate and universal new man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIVERSAL BUILDING AND THE LOCAL BUILDING</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 2:20-22 is the revelation of the building in two aspects&mdash;the universal aspect and the local aspect. Universally the church is uniquely one, and the church in a particular locality is locally one. In verse 21 we see the universal aspect of the church: &ldquo;All the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.&rdquo; Then in verse 22 we have the local aspect: &ldquo;You also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; Therefore, the holy temple refers to the universal aspect, and the dwelling place of God to the local aspect.</p>
<p>All the local churches are part of the universal church, not something in addition to it or apart from it. All the local churches added together equal the universal church. This means that apart from the local churches there is no universal church. Hence, the building of the local church is the building of the universal church. All the local churches have just one building. The church in Anaheim does not have one building, neither does any other church have one. However, our natural concept of the building is that there is a different building in each locality. In this universe there is just one building with a universal aspect and a local aspect. No matter how many churches there may be on earth, there is still just one building with these two aspects.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The first great crucial point in Ephesians 3 is the mystery of Christ (v. 4). The mystery of God in Colossians 2:2 is Christ; whereas the mystery of Christ is the church. God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God. Christ is also a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express Him, is the mystery of Christ. The church, which is mentioned in 3:10, is the mystery of Christ. In order to see the definition of the mystery of Christ, we need to study verses 3-11 of chapter three.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Apostle Paul preached, not the doctrines, but the riches of Christ. The riches of Christ are what Christ is to us, such as light, life, righteousness, and holiness. These riches are unsearchable and untraceable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ETERNAL ECONOMY OF GOD<br />
TO PRODUCE THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>This crucial point is in 3:9-11. To fully understand this crucial point you also need to study 1:9-11.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal economy is according to His hidden purpose. His purpose is to dispense Himself into His chosen people. Hence, there is the dispensation of the mystery of God. This mystery was hidden in God from the ages (that is, from eternity) and through all past ages, but now it has been brought to light to the New Testament believers.</p>
<p>The church is produced from the unsearchable riches of Christ as revealed in 3:8. When God&rsquo;s chosen people partake of and enjoy the riches of Christ, these riches constitute them the church, through which God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom is made known to the angelic rulers and authorities in the heavenlies. Hence, the church is God&rsquo;s wise exhibition of all that Christ is.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
