<p>God is embodied in His Son for our enjoyment. This is a fact, which is definite and practical; it is not vague. God created us with a spirit, and His Spirit of glory dwells in our spirit. We have the holy Word in our hand and the Holy Spirit in our spirit. Whenever we read the Word, the Spirit moves in us. We cannot receive the inspiration from the Spirit by reading a newspaper. At the most, the report of an event may touch our emotions. When we read the Word, however, we are inspired by the Spirit. When we read the Word, the indwelling Spirit responds. When the Word without enters into us, it becomes the Spirit, and when the Spirit comes out of us, He becomes the word. The two always respond to one another. Whenever we read the Bible, the Spirit moves, and when we pray the words that we have read, they enter into us. The Bible and the Spirit coordinate with each other. When we touch one, the other responds. We know the Lord by the Bible, and we touch Him by the Spirit.</p>
<p>All God&rsquo;s children need to see that God wants us to enjoy Him. In order to enjoy Him, we must read the Bible with a calm heart. This is the first step. Next, we need to exercise our spirit and turn what we read into prayer. It is best to pray according to the light that we receive from reading the Bible. If we do not receive any light while reading the Bible, we can repeat the words in the Bible with a praying spirit.</p>
<p>In Matthew 8:1-3 the Lord Jesus healed a leper when He came down from the mountain. A brother who receives light while reading this portion might say, &ldquo;Lord, if You had remained on the mountain, that leper could not have been healed. You are a Lord who comes down from the mountain.&rdquo; Such a prayer is full of light. If the brother did not receive this kind of light, after reading verse 1, he might say, &ldquo;Dear Lord Jesus, thank You for coming down from the mountain.&rdquo; This is very easy. Or he can read the Bible with a praying spirit. This will also exercise his spirit. Therefore, it is not difficult to exercise our spirit when we read the Word.</p>
<p>As long as we are willing to practice, we will learn. This kind of pray-reading is not difficult. The Word explains who the Lord is so that we may know Him; hence, we need to read the Bible. Furthermore, the Lord is the Spirit so that we can touch Him with our spirit. The Spirit and the Word echo one another. When we read the Word, the Spirit moves in us; and when the Spirit moves, we should turn the Word into prayer. We use our eyes and our mind when we read. When we pray, it seems as though we are using our mouth, but the Spirit comes. Although our prayer might not begin with our spirit, if we continue to pray, we will exercise our spirit. When the Spirit moves, we should pray according to the inspiration of the Spirit. Or we can turn the words in the Bible into prayer. May we practice this.</p>
<p>If a seeker of the Lord is willing to spend some time to exercise his spirit according to this fellowship, he will definitely be transformed daily. This is more effective than listening to messages. This is not to say that listening to messages is not helpful. God has arranged for us to meet as the church and for some to minister the word so that we can hear His speaking. However, we should not use only our mind when we listen; we should also exercise our spirit. We need to touch the Word, and we also need to touch the Spirit. The words that we read must be turned into prayer; that is, we need to contact and digest the words with prayer.</p>
<p>It is normal to pray while listening to a message. If we cannot pray in a detailed way, we should continually look to the Lord. Immediately after the message, we should have a time of prayer. Then we would not only listen to the Lord&rsquo;s word with our mind, but we would also touch the Lord with our spirit. As a result, the words we heard will become spirit and life in us, and we will enjoy the Lord in a practical way.</p>
<p>Every message and fellowship should be brought into the spirit of prayer so that we can touch God and be genuine persons, because our spirit is genuine. When we touch God in our spirit, we become genuine persons. When we fellowship with God in our spirit, we become sincere persons. When we fellowship with God in our spirit, we become sanctified persons. When we touch Him in our spirit, we become upright persons who are filled with Him. We will also be filled with the Spirit, and we become persons who can overcome sin, the world, temptations, seductions, greediness, sicknesses, the self, the flesh, naturalness, and individualism. Furthermore, we become persons who can be built up together with other saints and can be coordinated as one Body to be His glorious dwelling place. The building up of the church can be accomplished by those who pray with their spirit. The building up of the church depends on our spirit of prayer.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Spirit and the Building of God &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
