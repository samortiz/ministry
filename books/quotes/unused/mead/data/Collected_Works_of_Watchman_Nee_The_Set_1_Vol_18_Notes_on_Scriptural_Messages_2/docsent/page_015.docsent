   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>You may dream about how your future will be so beautiful and restful.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But after a while, you will find that the promises of the world are all unusable currencies.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Time after time, the world only brings you discouragement and disappointment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Time after time, the world puts you into a dream; everything is just a mirage and a dry place without grass.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>O brothers and sisters, a godless life is an unsatisfied life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A life outside of God can never be satisfying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mephibosheth, who ran away from David, was living in a place without grass.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A sinner far away from God is also living in a place without grass.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What did David do when he heard that Mephibosheth was living in a place without grass?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thank and praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar" v. 5 . Fetch in the original text is "bring." Romans 3:11 says, "There is none who seeks out God." Luke 19:10 says, "For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost." Some people think that because we are so evil we should surely seek after God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since we are so fallen, surely we should seek after God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But this is not how things work!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God had to wait for us to seek Him before He saved us, we would probably never be saved because we would never seek after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If Mephibosheth had had to seek after David, he would not have had any boldness to seek after him because his grandfather was David's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He also did not have the ability to seek after David because he was lame.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Mephibosheth did not seek after David, but David sent men to fetch Mephibosheth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We did not seek after God, but God sent His Son to seek us and bring us back to His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On Mephibosheth's side, he dared not seek the king because his grandfather was the king's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In addition, he was not able to seek the king because he was lame.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may think, "Perhaps someday I will become better, seek after God, and earnestly plead to Him to forgive my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps then I will be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But it was not Mephibosheth who sought after David, but David who fetched Mephibosheth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible says God wants you, calls you, and sends men to tell you that He wants you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Romans 10:6 and 7 say, "But the righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?' that is, to bring Christ down; or, Who will descend into the abyss?' that is, to bring Christ up from the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These verses tell us that no man can go to heaven to ask the Lord to die for him and that no man can go to Hades to ask the Lord to resurrect from death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The following verses say, "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart...for with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>8, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Mephibosheth did not need to make an effort.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The king sent people to fetch him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there is a man here who is not saved, it will not be because God does not save him, but because he rejects God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What did David say to Mephibosheth after he fetched him?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And David said, Mephibosheth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And he answered, Behold thy servant!"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>2 Sam 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here is the most pleasant music!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"Mephibosheth."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>David did not say anything more when he saw Mephibosheth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He did not say, "Mephibosheth you are here"; he did not say, "Saul's grandson Mephibosheth"; he did not say, "Jonathan's son Mephibosheth"; he did not say, "Who are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"Mephibosheth."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Have you ever considered, when David said, "Mephibosheth," what kind of feeling was in his heart, and what was the tone of his voice?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Underneath this word was a beating heart, a heart that expressed God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"Mephibosheth" shows that God does not hate man, that He wants man, and that He loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every time a man calls out another man's name but does not say anything more, a third person will not understand the meaning, but the one whose name is called can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have spoken about the story of Mary the Magdalene.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She thought the Lord was a gardener.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When she asked the gardener where Jesus was, the Lord did not answer, "I am not the gardener," or "I did not take His body away," or "You are a woman; how can you get the body?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord only said, "Mary!"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As soon as she heard this very familiar voice, she said, "Rabboni!"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We know that when someone calls another by name only, there must be considerable meaning behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On that day David saw his enemy's grandson, and he only said, "Mephibosheth."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This shows that David's heart was not only without hatred, but also full of compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a pity that Mephibosheth did not know David's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When he went to David, his heart might have been beating fast, and he might have been thinking, "Today I am going to see the king of Judah; maybe he will kill me."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When he saw David and heard him call, "Mephibosheth," he should have known that David had only compassion and no bad intention toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But with a heart full of fear, he said, "Behold thy servant."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He might have thought, "Formerly I was a king's grandson; now I humble myself to be a servant.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Perhaps by this I will gain David's favor, and he will not kill me."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I must tell you that no one can please God by relying on himself becoming a servant.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then David testified of God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He said to Mephibosheth, "Fear not: for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually" v. 7 . Brothers and sisters, everything is now ready.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I do not know how many among us realize that God loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Perhaps someone has worked for many years and still does not know that God loves him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we only knew that God loves us, our lives would be changed greatly.</S>
