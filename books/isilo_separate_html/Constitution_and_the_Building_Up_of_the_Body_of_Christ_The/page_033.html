Its Way</H2><P>The way of the believers' growth in life is also revealed in the writings of Peter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. By Drinking the Milk of the Word</H2><P>As revealed in Peter's writings, the believers grow in life by drinking the milk of the word (1 Pet. 2:2a). Every word in the Bible is a bottle of milk. The milk for our growth in life is in the holy Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. By Enjoying the Grace of Christ<br>and the All Grace of God</H2><P>The believers grow in life also by enjoying the grace of Christ and the all grace of God (2 Pet. 3:18; 1 Pet. 5:10). The grace of Christ is just Christ Himself distributed to us through His redemption for our enjoyment, and the all grace of God is simply the processed and consummated Triune God to be our life supply in all aspects. God is a God of many aspects, and every aspect of God is grace to us. Whenever we contact God, call on Him, drink Him, eat Him, and breathe Him in, we receive grace.</P><P>The way for us believers to grow in life is to drink the spiritual milk of the word, to breathe in Christ as our grace, and to take in God in His Divine Trinity as the all grace to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Its Progression</H2><P>Peter's writings also unveil to us that the believers' growth in life has its progression. When we are growing, we are progressing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. From Babyhood Growing into the Priesthood</H2><P>In the progression of our growth in the divine life, from babyhood we believers grow into the priesthood (1 Pet. 2:2, 5). We need to go on in our growth from the nursing babyhood to the serving priesthood. Whenever we pray, we function as priests. By our praying we can grow out of our babyhood into the priesthood. This is the progression in our growth in life.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
