   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO JEWS OR GREEKS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul mentioned Jews and Greeks in Galatians 3 because the Jews were a proud people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They considered all Gentiles to be dogs and pigs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you were to give money to the poor among the Jews, they would not take it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They considered themselves to be the only people who were chosen of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Their racial consciousness was extremely strong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was impossible to make Jews and Greeks one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But after they believed in Christ and received Him, they entered into the baptismal water.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The part that distinguished Jews as Jews could not come out; only the part which is Christ could come out.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Baptism is a test; it shows whether a person is in Christ or not.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you still hold onto your national distinctions?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do you still hold onto the distinction between slaves and free men?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the time of the Roman Empire, slaves did not have any freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There was a vast difference between slaves and free men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet all those who are baptized into Christ have become one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are no more distinctions between the nationalities and races and between slaves and free men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>NO SLAVES OR FREE MEN</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Shanghai a brother works for me as my cook.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At home I call him by his name, but in the meetings I call him a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once I asked him to come to me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He said, "Mr. Nee..." I interrupted him and said, "In Christ there cannot be servants and masters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You should not call me, Mister'; you should call me, Brother.'"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There was a sister in Shanghai who had an unsaved husband.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The winter before last, they decided to pray to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The wife prayed first, and then the husband also prayed and became a member in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I told the husband when he was baptized that from the time they were married until this day, they were husband and wife; however, from this night forward, their relationship in Adam was terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They had become one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once I met a brother in Canada, and I asked if his father was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He told me that his father was a brother and that they had become one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In another meeting, I had to stand up to introduce my uncle, and I called him my brother.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In a family, there are different family ties.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in Christ and in the church, there are no family ties.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have all become one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have often said that we call our children our children at home, but in the church we call them our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Kaifeng, Honan province, many government officials believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I was invited once to preach to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When a local brother introduced them to me one by one, he addressed them as Officer So-and-so.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I turned around and told him that we have all been saved from Adam into Christ and that we were all brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Two of the brothers were heads of some government departments.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some time ago they came to Shanghai and had a meal with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A brother was about to address them as Officer So-and-so, but when he saw me, he corrected himself immediately and said, "I am sorry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I made a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They are Brother So-and-so."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through death we have been delivered from Adam, and through resurrection, we have entered into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Christ we are all God's sons and dear brothers to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>NO MALE OR FEMALE</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Christ there is also no distinction between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Bible only speaks of God's sons.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sisters, what are you?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through God's only begotten Son, you have all become sons.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the flesh you are female, but you have received the life of God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This life is the life of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, even the sisters are sons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A brother once said that the brothers should be called male brothers and the sisters female brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is right.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Second Corinthians 6:18 says that we are sons and daughters of God, but this portion is not talking about our relationship in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, there is no contradiction between that portion of the word and Galatians 3:28.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are all sons of God in Christ, and there cannot be male or female.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is a glorious fact.</S>
