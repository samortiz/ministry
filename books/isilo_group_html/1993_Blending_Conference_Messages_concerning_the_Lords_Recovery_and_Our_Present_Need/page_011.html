All things cohere in Him. That means He is the holding center, the hub, of the entire universe. Scientists know there is some power that holds the universe together, but they do not know what it is. But we know more than all the scientists. Our Christ is the holding center that holds the entire universe together. Furthermore, He is the holding center that holds us together. Take Christ away from us and we fall apart. Take Christ away from the churches, and the churches fall apart. He is the hub, the spokes, and the rim&#151;the centrality and universality&#151;of God's economy.</P><P>The all-inclusive Christ is also the God-allotted portion to the saints (Col. 1:12). He has been allotted to us as our God-given portion. This allotted portion refers to the type in the Old Testament with the allotment of the good land to the children of Israel. Each of the tribes was given an allotted portion of the good land. This was their inheritance. Our good land is the all-inclusive Christ. He is our allotted portion, our designated inheritance.</P><P>The good land meant everything to the children of Israel. It was a land of milk, honey, water, cattle, grain, and minerals. Everything they needed for their existence came out of this land, and the temple was the result of the enjoyment of this land. This shows that when we enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as our God-allotted portion to be everything to us, the built-up church is the result. He is the all-inclusive land to us for the building up of the church.</P><P>He has been allotted to us as our redemption (Rom. 3:24; Eph. 1:7). He is our Redeemer. There were many requirements laid on us because we became lost, so Christ repossessed us at a great cost. He became our Redeemer to take away our sin and our sins (John 1:29) and to bring us back to God so that we can accomplish His New Testament economy.</P><P>Finally, He is our life, our life-supply, and everything for us to participate in His riches for our enjoyment. Not only so, as we are enjoying Him as all these riches, we are constituted with His divine element. By eating Him and by participating in His riches, we become Him. What you eat is what you become (John 6:57). As you eat Christ, you become Christ. We are constituted with His divine element to become His members to live Him and express Him.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>1993 Blending Conference Messages concerning the Lord's Recovery and Our Present Need &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
