   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Philippians 3:4-6 Paul presents a clear picture of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After saying that he had reason to trust in the flesh, Paul proceeds to list seven aspects of the flesh: being circumcised the eighth day, being of the stock of Israel, being of the tribe of Benjamin, being a Hebrew of the Hebrews, being a Pharisee as concerning the law, being a zealous persecutor of the church, and being blameless according to the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may think that the flesh is something bad.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These seven items, however, are not bad.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul was circumcised on the eighth day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Certainly this was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was born of the stock of Israel, not of pagans.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, he was of the tribe of Benjamin, not of Reuben or Simeon.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Bible Benjamin is dear, precious, and lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul was also a Hebrew of the Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the law of God, he was a Pharisee, and according to zeal for God, he persecuted the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul was not indifferent towards God, but loved Him, lived for Him, and even persecuted the church for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Finally, according to the righteousness which is in the law, he was blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was perfect, complete, and without defect.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, all these items are aspects of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In fact, they are the constituents of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Apart from Paul's words in Philippians, we would not consider such things as part of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the flesh includes everything natural, whether bad or good.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the meaning of the flesh in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As long as something issues from our natural being, it is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we know this, we are blessed, for we shall not have any trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, we shall reject ourselves utterly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But after we reject ourselves, we shall enjoy Christ as the wonderful, heavenly leftovers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not try to adjust yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As flesh, we simply cannot be adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead of adjusting ourselves, we should repudiate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do this, we shall experience Christ with full enjoyment, enjoying Him in all we do and say.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>COUNTING ALL THINGS LOSS AND AS DUNG</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After giving us the definition of the flesh in verses 4 through 6, Paul says in verse 7, "But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss on account of Christ" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>. Surely things such as circumcision, being of the stock of Israel, and being of the tribe of Benjamin were a gain to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if he had kept all these things, there would have been no room in him for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, if a bottle is filled with dirt, there is no room for air to get in. First the dirt must be emptied out and then the air will fill it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Likewise, if we still hold on to certain good aspects of the flesh, there will be no room in us for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, on account of Christ, Paul counted as loss all the aspects of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verse 8 Paul says, "But surely I also count all things loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them dung, that I may gain Christ" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>. Paul seemed to be saying, "I have already counted as loss seven items on account of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now I also count all things in the whole universe as loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this universe there is such an excellency as the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this verse Paul says that he counts all things dung on account of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the usage of the Greek word in ancient times, the word translated dung refers to dog food.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It can also be rendered as refuse, garbage, trash.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the eyes of such a seeker after Christ as Paul, everything else was dog food, refuse, trash.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The dogs mentioned in verse 2 feed on the dog food spoken of in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we feed on Christ, the food of the children of God.</S>
