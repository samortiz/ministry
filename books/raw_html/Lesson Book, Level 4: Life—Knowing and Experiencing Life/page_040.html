THE NEED TO BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>In the past ten lessons, we have shared with you some basic knowledge concerning life and some basic experiences of life for the growth of life. You must have noticed one common factor—the Spirit. The only life, the real life is zoe, which is divine, eternal, and indestructible. Without the Spirit, we do not have zoe. God is life, yet without the Spirit, the unapproachable God cannot be our life. Christ is life, yet without the Spirit, the Christ on the throne in heaven cannot be our life. Without the Spirit, God cannot flow into us to be our life. Without the Spirit, we do not have life in our human spirit. Without the Spirit, we do not have the law of life in us; thus, we cannot be freed from the law of sin and death. Without the Spirit, we have no light and will live in darkness. Without the Spirit to increase the elements of God in us, we will never have the growth of life. Even the beginning of our Christian life—regeneration—is the entering in of the Spirit into our human spirit. The sense of the Spirit is our sense of life. The flowing of the Spirit in us is the fellowship of life. Though we may be clear that we need to be consecrated to the Lord who has purchased us, the motive of our consecration—love—is poured out through the Spirit (Rom. 5:5). The power we need to preserve our whole being is the Spirit.<p>Therefore, we must be filled with the Holy Spirit every day, all the day, from the time we are regenerated to the time of our rapture, in the days of our youth and in our old age. Whether we are up or down, in or out, hopeful or hopeless, happy or sad, we need to be filled with the Spirit. Being filled with the Spirit affords us the power, the strength, and the authority to overcome every hindrance to life. Being filled with the Spirit is basic to our Christian life, is normal in our daily life, is necessary to our experience of life, and is crucial to our growth of life. It is a miracle that man may be filled with God, yet it is so normal for a Christian to be filled with God. It is as normal as regeneration. Being filled with the Spirit therefore is a miraculous normality. It is fully needed and required for us to go on.
