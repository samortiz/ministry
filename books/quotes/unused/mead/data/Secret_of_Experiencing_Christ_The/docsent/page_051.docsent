   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEGATIVE THINGS IN PHILIPPIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Compared with those in Galatians and Ephesians, the negative things in Philippians are small matters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Instead of such things as the religious world, ordinances, the vanity of the mind, and Satan, we have murmurings, reasonings, rivalry, vainglory, and anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rivalry</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Certain ones, especially the Judaizers, were in rivalry with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They were those who announced Christ "out of rivalry, not purely" 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is also rivalry among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Recently I heard that a certain Christian friend of mine, whom I have known for more than twenty years, said, "Witness Lee's ministry is spreading throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must stop him!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a statement comes out of rivalry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rivalry gives rise to persecution, and persecution causes affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to Paul's word in 1:17, those who announce Christ out of rivalry thought "to raise up affliction in my bonds."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their intention was to increase Paul's afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, even though Paul was suffering, he was not defeated by his afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He could say, "According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death" 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 2:3 Paul exhorts the saints to do "nothing by way of rivalry nor by way of vainglory, but in lowliness of mind counting one another more excellent than yourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not think that in the church today there is no rivalry for vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When a brother hears a certain person ministering the Word in a rich way, he may say to himself, "Wait for a few years, and I will surprise you with my rich speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My speaking will be much better than this."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is an example of the rivalry for vainglory which may be hidden within you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 2:4 Paul goes on to say, "Not regarding each his own things, but each the things of others also."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The things here denote virtues and qualities.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not regard only our own virtues and qualities, but those of others also.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead of thinking so much about our own virtues, qualities, abilities, and attainments, we should regard the things of others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In keeping with Paul's word, we should even count others more excellent than ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we consider others in the church, we should think of them as better than ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Murmurings and Reasonings</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 2:14 Paul says, "Do all things without murmurings and reasonings."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Elsewhere I have pointed out that murmurings, which are of the emotion, are found mostly among the sisters, whereas reasonings, which are of the mind, are found mostly among the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, I sometimes have problems with both murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I may murmur inwardly over the small portion of food my wife may serve me at dinner, especially when I compare my portion with that of others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I also may reason inwardly when my wife points out that a certain food is good for me and that I need to eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do you not also have problems with the "bugs" of murmurings and reasonings?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all are bothered by these things.</S>
