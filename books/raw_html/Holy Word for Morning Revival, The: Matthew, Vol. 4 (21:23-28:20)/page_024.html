<p class="bold">WEEK 19 — DAY 2</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 26:6-16</h2><p class="bold">6 &nbsp;Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the <sup>1</sup>leper,</p> <p class="bold">7 &nbsp;A woman came to Him, having an alabaster flask of ointment of great value, and she poured it on His head as He reclined at table.</p> <p class="bold">8 &nbsp;But when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, Why this <sup>1</sup>waste?</p><p>9 &nbsp;For this could have been sold for much and given to the poor.</p> <p>10 &nbsp;But Jesus, knowing it, said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a noble deed to Me.</p> <p>11 &nbsp;For the poor you have with you always, <sup>1</sup>but you do not always have Me.</p> <p class="bold">12 &nbsp;For in pouring out this ointment on My body, she has done it 1for My burial.</p> <p class="bold">13 &nbsp;Truly I say to you, Wherever <sup>1</sup>this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, <sup>2</sup>what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her.</p> <p>14 &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>At that time one of the twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</p><p>15 &nbsp;And said, What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver Him to you? And they weighed out to him <sup>1</sup>thirty pieces of silver.</p> <p>16 &nbsp;And from then on he sought opportunity to deliver Him up.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>6<sup>1</sup> A leper signifies a sinner (8:2 and note 1). Simon, a leper, must have been healed by the Lord. Being grateful to the Lord and loving Him, he spread a feast (v. 7) in his house for the Lord and His disciples in order to enjoy His presence. A saved sinner would always do this.</p><p>8<sup>1</sup> The disciples considered Mary’s love offering to the Lord a waste. Throughout the past twenty centuries thousands of precious lives, heart treasures, high positions, and golden futures have been “wasted” upon the Lord Jesus. To those who love Him in such a way He is altogether lovely and worthy of their offering. What they have poured upon Him is not a waste but a fragrant testimony of His sweetness.</p><p>11<sup>1</sup> We must love the Lord and grasp the opportunity to love Him.</p><p>12<sup>1</sup> Mary received the revelation of the Lord’s death through the Lord’s words in 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19; and v. 2 of this chapter. Hence, she grasped the opportunity to pour upon the Lord the best that she had. To love the Lord with our best requires a revelation concerning Him.</p><p>13<sup>1</sup> In the foregoing verse the Lord spoke of His burial, implying His death and resurrection, accomplished for our redemption. Hence, in this verse He called the gospel “this gospel,” referring to the gospel of His death, burial, and resurrection (1 Cor. 15:1-4).</p><p>13<sup>2</sup> The story of the gospel is that the Lord loved us, and the story of Mary is that she loved the Lord. We must preach both—the Lord’s loving us and our loving the Lord. One is for our salvation, and the other is for our consecration.</p><p>14<sup>1</sup> At that time indicates that while one of the disciples was expressing her love to the Lord, loving Him to the uttermost, another was about to betray Him. One was treasuring the Lord, and at the same time another was delivering Him up.</p><p>15<sup>1</sup> I.e., thirty shekels of silver, the worth of a slave (Exo. 21:32).</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Along with Simon, Mary also probably thought that this was her last chance to do something over the Lord’s body to anoint Him for burial. In a very real sense, Mary buried the Lord Jesus before He was crucified.…I believe that the others like Peter, James, and John did not receive the Lord’s prophecy concerning His crucifixion properly. According to the Lord’s testimony, Mary certainly received His word regarding this, for the Lord testified that in pouring out the ointment, she had done it for His burial. This was a sign that Mary understood what the Lord had prophesied concerning His crucifixion.
