<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF THE FULFILLMENT<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S WORDS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:20-22; 4:12-16; Matt. 24:35</h1>
<p>The fellowship in this chapter is mainly to remind us of what the Lord has spoken in a promising and prophetic way concerning building up the church as the dwelling place of God in Matthew 16:18 and Ephesians 2:20-22 and as the Body of Christ in Ephesians 4:12-16. There is the need of the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s words in the Scriptures.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
AS THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, &ldquo;On this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; &ldquo;This rock&rdquo; does not refer to the Lord&rsquo;s person directly but to the revelation concerning the Lord&rsquo;s person. The revelation concerning the Lord&rsquo;s person is the very foundation, the very rock, on which the Lord is building up His church. This is for the dwelling place of God. In Ephesians 2:20-22 the Apostle Paul tells us that the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Actually, this does not mean that the church is built upon the persons of the apostles and prophets but upon the revelation that the apostles and prophets have received of the Lord. Thus, both Matthew 16 and Ephesians 2 tell us that the building up of the church is based upon a revelation concerning Christ which is the foundation, or rock, for the building up of the church of Christ as the dwelling place of God.</p>
<p>The church as the dwelling place of God is built upon the revelation of Christ&rsquo;s divine person that the Father gave Peter (Matt. 16:16-18). Christ&rsquo;s person is mainly in two aspects, indicated by the titles &ldquo;the Christ&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Son of the living God&rdquo; in Matthew 16:16. In Matthew 16:16 Christ is mentioned in a definite and an emphatic way as &ldquo;the Christ.&rdquo; This refers to the very Christ prophesied of and promised in the Old Testament and expected by many seeking saints to come at the beginning of the New Testament age (see Luke 2:25, 36-38). &ldquo;The Christ&rdquo; refers to His commission that God has given Him and means &ldquo;the Anointed One.&rdquo; God appointed Him as the Anointed One, the One anointed by God with a definite commission to carry out. Thus, His designation as &ldquo;the Christ&rdquo; refers to His work, His ministry, and His commission to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. &ldquo;The Son of the living God&rdquo; refers purely and solely to the person of Christ, to the very essence and substance of Christ. In these two titles are Christ&rsquo;s person, Christ&rsquo;s very divine essence, and Christ&rsquo;s commission, Christ&rsquo;s ministry, Christ&rsquo;s work, to build up the church with His essence. Christ is the commissioned One to do a work for God, which is to build up the church with His very essence, the divine essence of God, as the building material.</p>
<p>The church as the dwelling place of God is also built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ as the cornerstone (Eph. 2:20). The revelation concerning Christ and the church was given at the beginning of the New Testament age to the apostles and prophets and mainly to the Apostles Paul, Peter, and John. The New Testament is composed mainly with the writings of these few prominent apostles and prophets, and their revelation is considered as the foundation upon which the church is built. In their revelation, the church is in two aspects: the universal aspect and the local aspect. In the universal sense, the church is the temple of God (Eph. 2:21). The church is the holy temple in the Lord, that is, in Christ universally. The entire church, not just in one place but in the whole universe, is the temple of God, which will be consummated in the New Jerusalem. The entire city of the New Jerusalem will be the temple of God, the consummation of God&rsquo;s dwelling place in this universe.</p>
<p>In the local sense, the church is built up as a dwelling place of God in our spirit (Eph. 2:22). This dwelling place is within the spirit of the believers. After being regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit, our human spirit is now the very dwelling place of God. God today on this earth dwells in our spirit, making us a part of His house, which is the local church. God has the local church as His dwelling place in our spirit, and He has the universal church as His universal temple, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_080.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_082.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 81</div><br></body></html>
