   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REWARDS FOR LOSING OR SAVING THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord said that whoever desires to save his soul will lose it, and that whoever loses his soul for His sake will find it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For both the losing of the soul and the saving of the soul we shall be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 27 says, For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each man according to his doings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we deny the self, take up the cross, and lose the soul, we shall receive one kind of reward.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But, if we save the soul, we shall receive a different kind of reward.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One way or another, at the time of the Lord s coming, we shall be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This reward, however, is not strictly a matter of the future.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is proved by verse 28: Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord will come in two ways, in His coming in the future and in His coming in His transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord s transfiguration on the mountain was a form of the coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In both types of comings there is a reward according to our doings, according to whether or not we deny ourselves, take up the cross, and lose the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>SAVING THE SOUL BEING TO PLEASE THE SELF</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to understand this matter of the saving or losing of the soul in the light of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We also need to remember that the subject of the last half of Matthew 16 is the building of the church, and that we should not isolate verses 21 through 28 from verses 16 through 19 since these verses are concerned with the way to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose the brothers living in a brothers house have seen the vision concerning Christ and the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They realize that the Lord desires to recover the church life for His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the living situation in the house may not be very encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps no one is willing to do the dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because of the discouraging situation, some of the brothers may consider moving out of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if they move out, they will be saving their souls to have an easy way for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One brother may actually move from that house to another house, where, after a few weeks, he learns that the situation is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then he moves to a church in another part of the country, concealing the reason for his move under the cloak of seeking a better church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By making this move, he is saving his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When he arrives in the new locality and moves into a brothers house there, he finds the situation even worse than the one he left.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At this point, disappointed with the church life, he may decide to leave the church entirely.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If he does this, he will be saving his soul to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By this we see that to please the self is to save the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>USING THE THIRD KEY</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now we need to see what it means to lose the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the process of the building of the church, we should not save our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, we must always lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not move from one brothers house to another to seek a better situation to make things easier for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every brother is God s will, and you need to bear each brother as a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If others will not wash the dishes, then you should wash them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if you feel sorry for yourself because you are the only one to wash the dishes, the gate will be opened for Satan to come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He will tempt you to move out of the brothers house.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When such a temptation comes, you need to use the third key, the key of losing the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you use this key, you will say, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Tomorrow I shall wash even more dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Satan, don t talk to me anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more you talk to me, the more dishes I will wash.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am willing to lose my soul to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After a short period of time of losing the soul, there will be a transfiguration in the church, and in this transfiguration you will be rewarded positively.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the church life and in all the meetings you will have the highest enjoyment of the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But those who have been saving their soul will be rewarded negatively during this time of transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord s interest today is with the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But how can we, as fallen human beings, be built up together?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is difficult even for a husband and wife or for parents and children to be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all want enjoyment for ourselves and react against anything that touches our sense of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Apart from the losing of the soul, it is impossible for the church to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If someone offends you, you may be unwilling to forgive him simply because you enjoy being able to condemn him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because forgiving him is not enjoyable to you, you have no interest in forgiving him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is true not only in the church, but also between husbands and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sisters, once your husband has offended you, you may enjoy holding on to that offense.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Holding on to it and refusing to forgive him affords you psychological pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the saving of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you save your soul in this way, you cannot have a proper family life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In order to have a proper family life, we need to lose our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our soulish enjoyment must go.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you are willing to lose your soulish enjoyment, you will be rewarded one day when the Lord comes into your family.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At that time, the Lord will save your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You were willing to lose it, but when the Lord comes in, He will save it and cause you to have great enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For the building of the church there is the crucial need that we all learn to lose our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not keep any enjoyment for your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Rather, lose it for the Lord s sake.</S>
