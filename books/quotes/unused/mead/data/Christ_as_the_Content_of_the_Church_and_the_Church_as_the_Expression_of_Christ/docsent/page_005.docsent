   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now we come to the last part of Romans chs.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>12 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This shows us that we will be built up together as the Body of Christ, the church, to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We express Christ because Christ is wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have been not only justified but also translated out of Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because Christ has been wrought into us, what we have and what we are is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have been sanctified, that is, saturated and permeated by and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we live by and in Him, so we become His image.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As those who are conformed to His image, we become His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then we are built together, not in ourselves but in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is like the wooden boards of the tabernacle being framed and built together in the overlaying gold.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are built together not in ourselves but in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From chapter twelve through sixteen, we see the real expression of Christ in the functions of the different members.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The functions are the gifts, which are the expression of the grace deposited into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans 12:6 says that we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is because the gifts are the outward expression of the inward grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The inward grace is Christ deposited into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ has been wrought into us as a deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have a portion of Christ within us as the grace, and this grace expressed is the function, the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, all the gifts are the expression of the inward grace, which is Christ deposited into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The gifts mentioned in Romans 12 are absolutely different from the miraculous gifts in 1 Corinthians 12.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The gifts in Romans 12 are the expressions of the inner grace, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The inner, deposited grace is expressed outwardly, and this outward expression is the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This gift is manifested in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As those who are justified by God, we should be sanctified daily by being overlaid with His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we are under the process of transformation and are being conformed to Christ's image.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have a certain amount of Christ within us as grace deposited into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Perhaps a certain brother, out of the measure of Christ within him, has a burden to give hospitality to many traveling saints 12:13b .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the saints come to his home, he spontaneously serves them, takes care of them, and displays love, which is Christ expressed through him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This hospitality is a gift, and this gift is an expression of the inner grace which is Christ deposited and wrought into him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let us consider the experience of another brother, who is being gradually sanctified, overlaid with the divine nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A certain amount of Christ has been wrought into him, so gradually he has the burden to give material things to others v. 13a . In his giving you can sense the flavor of Christ, the reality of Christ, and the presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This giving of material things is an expression of inner grace, so this gift expresses Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Another brother who has been justified and sanctified to a certain extent may have the heart to always show mercy to others v. 8b . But others do not sense that he is merely a merciful person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In his showing of mercy, others sense the flavor and the tenderness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even this showing of mercy is an expression of the inner grace, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way the members are built together and express Christ in many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We become a living Body expressing Christ in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is expressed in the way His members minister, serve, show mercy, give material things, show love v. 9a , and give hospitality to meet others' needs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because we have been justified and sanctified, Christ has been wrought into us to a certain extent, and we have a certain amount of Christ as the deposited grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Gradually, something will come out of this inward grace, and this coming out is the outward gift, the function, with the expression of Christ in our gift.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, the whole book of Romans shows us that Christ must be wrought into us as our life and content and the church must be the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this book, which is a full record of the Christian life, there is the expression of Christ and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is not the expression of any doctrine but of Christ, who is the Redeemer and our portion within to be wrought into us to conform us to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The grace is deposited into us that it may become the very outward function, and this outward function is the expression of Christ in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever and wherever we come together, we come as such an expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are not here to express anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are not standing for anything but Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have a real burden that all the dear brothers and sisters would be helped to realize this one thing to know Christ as the life and content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to experience Christ to such an extent and learn to minister Christ as the life, the content, and everything to the church.</S>
