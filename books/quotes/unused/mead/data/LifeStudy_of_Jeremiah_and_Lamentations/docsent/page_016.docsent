   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>JEHOVAH MAKING A NEW COVENANT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL Putting His Law within Them</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The last portion we will consider is 31:33 and 34.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"This is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares Jehovah: I will put My law within them and write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And they will no longer teach, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for all of them will know Me, from the little one among them even to the great one among them, declares Jehovah, for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In speaking of the new covenant that He would make with His elect, God said that He would put His law within them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not the law of letters it is the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If God's law were not the law of life, He could not put His law into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The law that God puts into us is the law of His own life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The law is actually the life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that God puts Himself into us as life, and this life is the law that He puts into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's life, which is God Himself, is a law that regulates us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Just as a cat is regulated by the law of the cat life and a human being is regulated by the law of the human life, so are we regulated by the law of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Writing His Law upon Their Hearts</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 33 God, speaking of His law, says that He will "write it upon their hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God not only puts His law within us, but He also writes it upon our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To write here means to inscribe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God writes His law upon our hearts by moving from our spirit into our heart to inscribe what He is into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that in the new covenant God does not ask us to do anything, for in the new covenant He does everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They Being His People,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>and All of Them Knowing Him,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>from the Little One among Them</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even to the Great One among Them</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Under God's new covenant, Israel will be His people, and He will be their God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we, the believers in Christ, are God's people, and He is our God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 34 God says, "All of them will know Me, from the little one among them even to the great one among them."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To know God does not simply mean that we know that God is triune and that He is holy and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To know God is to live God, and to live God is to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, we may hate, but God loves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, if we know God, we will live Him by loving others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Also, God is compassionate.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To know Him is to live Him as the compassionate One.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is something that the elders in particular need to do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A compassionate elder is an elder who knows God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, God is considerate.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To know Him is to live Him as the One who is considerate.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can know God in such a way only because He has put His life into us, and this life is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This life is our inner life law with its capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As believers in Christ, we all, from the little one to the great one, have this capacity to know God by living Him.</S>
