   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>John 5:40 says, "Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is not that God will not give life to you; it is that you are not willing to have life!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, while you are sitting here, if you have just a little desire to be saved, a tiny will to have eternal life, a tiny sensation to be released from sin, or a small wish to go to heaven, you will have it because God wants and wishes you would be this way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you ask, you will have life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What does God want?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God wants all men to have life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not be afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no problem on God's side; the problem lies on your side.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once there was a man who met a gospel preacher in London.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He said to the preacher, "Are you the one who preached in Paris before?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you know that I have believed in Jesus?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The preacher said, "It is very good that you have believed."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The man then said, "I believed in Jesus because of one word that you said."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The preacher asked, "Which word was that?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He said, "You said that heaven's door is latched on the outside."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Oh, the door latch of heaven were on the outside!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You can only blame yourself if you do not enter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the door latch of heaven were on the inside, you would not have any way to enter even if you wanted to enter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then if God was happy, He would open it; but if He was not happy, He would close it, and you would have to knock on the door from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the door of heaven is latched on the outside!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has no problem; it all depends on your willingness to enter in.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Finally, let me tell you a story.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There was a professor at Oxford University in England who was a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He had many sons, and they all studied at Oxford.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every evening his house had a family worship meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His fourth son, the worst one, always found some excuse to skip the family worship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He would either leave right before the meeting started or would come home right after the meeting ended.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day he came home, and the meeting was not yet finished.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The whole family was praying.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He thought, "Let me go and see what they are praying."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He became angry after he heard his mother's prayer; she said, "O God, my fourth son is a prodigal somewhere outside.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He likes to play around and spend money, and he has no fear of You."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The son became angry and said in his heart, "My mother did not pray for my oldest brother or my other brothers; she only prayed for me!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I cannot stay in this house any longer!"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He immediately ran upstairs and packed all the things in his room.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He took some of his father's money and left a note to his parents, saying, "Since you do not consider me good enough to be your son, I do not want to be your son.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am leaving.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Goodbye."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then he left the house.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, he stayed in a big hotel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When his money was about to run out, he moved into a friend's house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The friend said, "You can stay in my house, but not for long.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though we are classmates, your father is my teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It would not be good if he found out about this."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, he had no alternative but to move out of his friend's house into a small hotel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His money began to run out, and he soon did not have enough for food, clothing, or shelter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then he decided to go home.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since it was too embarrassing to go home during the day, he waited until a little past midnight before he went home.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He tried to climb through the window when he arrived, but all the windows were closed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Reluctantly, he tried the front door.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To his surprise the door opened when he pushed; it was not even latched.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He ran upstairs directly to his own room.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When he pushed open the door, he was surprised to see his father sitting there, facing the door.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was still quite stubborn and immediately thought of something, saying, "Why is someone so careless?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The front door is not even locked."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His father took off his glasses and held the son's hand and said, "My son!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Ever since the day you left home for over a year the front door has never been closed."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Brothers and sisters, this is a father's heart!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The door was not left open for a month or half a year; it was left open all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is a father's love!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many times we think that we are sinners and that God may not want us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But friends, let me tell you that He has never closed the door.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is no problem on God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All the problems are on your side.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If there is a sinner who will come to God and say, "I am a sinner; I have misunderstood You, but You are still willing to accept me," he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord Jesus once spoke a parable about the prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When he was a great way off, his father saw him, had compassion on him, ran, fell on his neck, and kissed him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This expresses God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God is calling you home today.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Jesus has died for you, and the Holy Spirit has come.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>No one sitting here needs to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You do not need to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But if you do not accept the Lord, there is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I hope you can remember that God is love!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you will say to God, "I am a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I am willing, and I want to accept You," you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then God will rejoice, and you will also rejoice together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God is love!</S>
