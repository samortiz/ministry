   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the days when Saul was trying to bind all who called on the name of the Lord, it was hard for the believers to hide themselves, because it was their habit to call.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He said, "We are going to O Lord.'"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even such a little one had the impression that the saints are the "O Lord" people.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is because the word, the living word, is near us, in our mouth and in our heart, just like the air, the breath, that can be taken into our being vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>6-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The air, the breath, is always in our mouth.</S>
