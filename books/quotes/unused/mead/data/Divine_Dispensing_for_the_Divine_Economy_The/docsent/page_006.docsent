   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 1 reveals the Father's choosing and predestinating, the Son's redeeming, and the Spirit's sealing v. 13b . The sealing of the Spirit can be likened to a seal with ink being pressed upon a sheet of paper.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It never dries.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit's sealing saturates the sealed ones through the dispensing of the sealing ink unto, or for, the day of the redemption of their body Eph 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The redemption of our body is the transfiguration of our body Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Until the transfiguration of our body, the sealing of the Spirit will go on continually to saturate and permeate our entire being.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The issue of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity through the Father's choosing and predestinating, the Son's redeeming, and the Spirit's sealing is the church Eph 1:22b .</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>of the Resurrected and Ascended Christ</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church as the issue of the divine dispensing is through the transmission, the dispensing, of the resurrected and ascended Christ Eph 1:19-22a .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's power was wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ was raised from among the dead in Hades to the throne of God in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything was subjected under His feet, and He was made Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word to in verse 22 implies a transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whatever God has wrought in Christ is transmitted and is being transmitted to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That the Church May Be</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>the Body of Christ for the Corporate</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Expression of the Processed Triune God</S>
