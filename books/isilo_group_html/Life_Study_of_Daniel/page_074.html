As we will see, the vision in Daniel 12 covers things in the last three and a half years of the present age, things in the kingdom age, and things in eternity.</P><P>We have emphasized the fact that the great human image in Daniel 2 is the basic principle and controlling factor of Daniel's prophecy. This human image destroys and devastates the temple four times. The first time was by the head, Nebuchadnezzar (1:1-2); the second was by Antiochus Epiphanes, a descendant of one of the four generals of Alexander the Great's Grecian Empire (8:9-14); the third was by Titus, a prince of the Roman Empire (70 A.D.); the fourth will be by Antichrist (12:7, 11), part of the ten toes of the restored Roman Empire. Eventually this great human image consummates in fighting directly with God. Antichrist, the ten kings, and their troops will fight against Christ directly (Rev. 19:19). However, Christ with His bride will gain the victory by defeating Antichrist and His armies (Rev. 19:20-21).</P><P>The contents of the vision in Daniel 11:2&#151;12:13 concern the destiny of Israel from the last part of the kingdom of Persia to the last three and a half years of the present age, even including the kingdom age and eternity. As we come to Daniel 12, we need to realize that in this book there is a gap in the chronicle of history from the ending of the ruling of the four successors of Alexander the Great (from about the second half of the last century B.C., the time the Roman Empire rose up to take the place of the kingdom of Greece as the world power that will end the present age) to the last three and a half years (v. 7) of the present age. In this gap is the church age of mystery.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_073.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_075.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Daniel &nbsp; pg 74</div><br></body></html>
