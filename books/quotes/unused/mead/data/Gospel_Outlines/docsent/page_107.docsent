   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject One Hundred Six THE NEED OF THE BLIND Scripture: John 9:1-11, 35-41 Man is born blind The Lord met a person who was born blind.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Blindness is the absence of sight.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A blind person cannot see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although man s outward eyes can see, his inward eyes are blind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man does not know from where he came, nor where he is going.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man does not know what life is all about, nor what is his relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord is the light of the world Blindness is synonymous with darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As darkness prevents man from being able to see, so also does blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord is the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only the Lord can dispel man s darkness; that is, only the Lord can resolve man s problem of blindness and cause man to regain his sight.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only the Lord can dispel man s darkness and restore his sight.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How the Lord causes man to see That day the Lord spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed the eyes of the blind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The spittle signifies the words which proceeded out of the mouth of the Lord, and clay signifies man who was made out of the dust of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The words entering into man and mingling with man through the moving and anointing of the Holy Spirit enable man to see clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That blind person went to wash in the pool of Siloam.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Siloam means sent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To be sent, one must first believe and obey.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whatever the Lord says to you, you must believe and obey.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So here the washing includes both believing and obeying.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Washing also signifies baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you believe now, you should also be baptized now.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The baptismal is the pool of Siloam.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To wash in the pool of Siloam means that you believe and are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the time the Lord asked him to go and wash in the pool of Siloam, it did not seem very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There were many places with water in Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why must it be the pool of Siloam?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This commandment is to test and see if you are willing to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you obey, your eyes will be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord not only healed the blind person so that he could see, but also led him to realize that the Lord was the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So the real eye opening is to realize that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The words at the end of chapter 9 can be included in this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may mention briefly that although the Pharisees had eyes to see, they were blind.</S>
