   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINISTRY OF MENDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John's Gospel is not a book of teachings or gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Gospel of John and in Revelation as well, we do not see the teachings or the gifts, but the life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John's ministry was a ministry of the mending of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are many holes in us; there are many broken things which need to be mended.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more gifts we have, the more holes we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Gifts bring in the breaks, the divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can only be mended by the ministry of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Corinthians speaks of the matter of divisions and shows that the cause of the divisions was the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1 Corinthians Paul says that the Corinthian believers were behind in no gifts 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They had all the gifts; they paid too much attention to the gifts and overused the gifts; therefore there were divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They needed the ministry of mending, and the Apostle Paul ministered to them in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Chapter 13 of 1 Corinthians is the ministry of mending, the mending by love in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The breaks and holes must be mended by love in life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Though we may speak in tongues and speak even the language of the angels, if we do not have love in life, we are just as sounding brass, a sound without the life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How different this is from a branch in the vine or a grain of wheat they both quietly live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is by life that the building is realized.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us take for example two local churches: in one church, the brothers seek to go on in the way of the grains and the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They live quietly, take Christ as their life, abide in Him, and allow Him to abide in them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the other church the brothers take the way of gifts, speaking in tongues every day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After three years have passed, you will see a great difference between these two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The gift-centered group will either be dispersed or dissolved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the group centered and living in Christ will continue to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are not opposing the speaking in tongues, but we are much concerned lest we waste our time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can never have a proper building of the church by teachings or by gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The only way is to live by the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It may seem slow, but it is steady and it will hit the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The only way to obtain the goal of the proper church life is to go on steadfastly in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE MAJOR NEED TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We live today in an environment full of confusion and division.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In such a situation the building up of the church desperately needs the mending ministry of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Life which issues in building is the central message of the entire Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Firstly in Genesis 2 and lastly in Revelation 22, we see the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Oh, we must realize and practice this secret of life!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By regeneration another source of life, Christ Himself as the Life-giving Spirit, has come to live in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we must learn to live in the spirit, living by Christ rather than by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we thus abide in Him, we sense the need for the church life, and as we continue abiding, we will have the church life in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The spontaneous issue will be the real building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we will be the enlarged tabernacle, the corporate expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Wherever we are located, we will be together with other Christians as the living and proper church, a real expression of Christ, a real glory to God, and a real blessing to those who are seeking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In a certain sense we do need the teachings and occasionally we need the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the central requirement for the building up of the church today is the mending ministry of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is in this ministry that we experience Christ as our life and as the tabernacle, the dwelling of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By this ministry we will have the enlarged tabernacle as the very expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am convinced that it is God's intention to have such a building on this earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By taking Christ as our life we will all become a real, practical, living part of this greater tabernacle.</S>
