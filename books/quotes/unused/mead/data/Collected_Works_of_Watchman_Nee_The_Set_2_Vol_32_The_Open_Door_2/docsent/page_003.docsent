   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since Brother Weigh and Brother Chen returned to K'un-ming, I have conducted a few Bible studies with the brothers and sisters in Shi-Ping concerning the subject "Standing Fast in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church in Shi-Ping has been suffering some disturbance lately.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thank the Lord that the disturbance taught His children some lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On May 13 I went to Ku-Jiu for the second time and conducted a seven-day Bible study.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because of the rain, we could not engage in any outdoor evangelistic work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During the day, we did some personal visitations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The railway company here has a Mr. Wong and Mr. Fung, who have become desirous of the truth as a result of Brother Kung's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A group of brothers who are materially poor have been dealt with in the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now they are reading the Bible and praying in the house of Brother Ruan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the twenty-third of this month, I went by train to Mong-Tze, and I will spend a week for the work here.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the daytime I preach outdoors, and in the evening I have Bible study meetings in a Gospel Chapel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This chapel was rented by a few believers who have invited me to use their place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Greetings in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A weak brother in the Lord,</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May 25 at 28 Da-Jing Street, Mong-Tze</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Returning from Jien-Shui to Shi-Ping,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yunnan Province</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On May 30, after returning from Mong-Tze to Shi-Ping, I conducted a few more days of Bible studies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Later, because of my burden for Jien-Shui, I left Shi-Ping and went there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Prior to my arrival, Brother Kung in Ku-Jiu asked the midwife of the Jien-Shui Health Clinic, Miss Kuo Chia-ai, to recommend a place for me to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After my arrival, it was recommended that I stay in the guard house of a mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I felt an unspeakable pressure upon me as if I were sick.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The guards were talking about bandits who had raided the city the previous day at a location not far from where I lodged.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I wanted to go home.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suddenly, I felt that I should pray, and I rejected all these thoughts in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thank the Lord that He released me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Later, I visited Miss Kuo a member of a Methodist church and met with the director of the clinic, Mr. Chou Je-min a native of Anhwei province and an Episcopalian . He was willing to give me an opportunity to conduct a Bible study in his clinic.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first night I preached the gospel at the guard house.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The second night we moved to the department building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We had a Bible study every evening until the thirteenth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As soon as we awakened some to seek after the Lord, people came from Mong-Tze and spoke to Director Chou for the purpose of chasing us away.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thank the Lord that Chou was not affected, and we conducted another Bible study on the fifteenth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the sixteenth we returned to Shi-Ping.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I really hope that the Lord will send you to work together with me in Yi-Nan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Please pray for us.</S>
