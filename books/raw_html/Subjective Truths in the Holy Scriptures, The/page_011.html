<h2 class=head2>The Significance of the Numbers</h2><p>We are speaking not of the anointing of oil but the anointing of ointment. The oil consists of only one element, the olive oil. The ointment, however, is one element, the olive oil, plus four kinds of spices. If you study the type carefully, you will discover several points. First, in number the spices are four. In the Bible, the number four signifies creatures. According to our creation, we are all number fours; we are the four living creatures. Second, these four spices are all plants. In biblical typology, plants refer to the Lord’s humanity. Since four refers to creatures and plants refer to humanity, this tells us that the four kinds of spices refer to the created man. The created man is mingled with the number one. The one single element is the olive oil; it is unique. In the Bible, the number one denotes the unique God. Here in this type we see that the created man is mingled with the unique God to become five.<p>In the Bible, five is the number for responsibility. Look at your hands. One thumb plus four fingers can bear responsibility to do many things. However, if the thumb or any of the four fingers is missing, it is hard to accomplish anything. God without man has no way, and also man without God has no way. “Four,” the created ones, plus “one,” the Creator, become “five.” This five is very good. Today, the condition of some people is such that God is “one” and they are “four,” but the two have not become “five.” However, today we are all number fives. Hallelujah! Originally we were number fours, but now, since there is the number one added into us, we have become number fives. I am really happy that today I am number five because I have God so that “I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me” (Phil. 4:13). We were originally the created men, but now the Creator God has been added into us.<h2 class=head2>The Significance of the Ingredients</h2><p>Furthermore, we see that originally the holy anointing oil was solely oil, but with the addition of the four kinds of spices, the ingredients in it increased and it became an ointment. All the four kinds of spices signify the created man, and each item is full of significance. The Lord Jesus is myrrh. This refers to His being a Man who was sweet in His suffering and in His death. He suffered His whole life on earth; He was obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross. Both His suffering and His death were so sweet. This is myrrh. He was a Man who suffered and who died. He was a sweet suffering One and a sweet dying One. He truly is the sweet myrrh.<p>He is also the fragrant cinnamon, which is a very good seasoning. Westerners often use cinnamon in their cooking because it is such a good seasoning. The Lord’s human living with His behavior is really a seasoning, and it causes our human life to be full of fragrance. When you add the Lord Jesus into you, you will become fragrant cinnamon.<p>He is also calamus. According to the meaning in Hebrew, calamus is a reed that grows out of a marsh or a muddy place. This signifies His resurrection. He was not only a Man who died but also a Man who resurrected. He grew out of the marsh of death.<p>Finally, He is cassia. According to the ancient Jews, cassia has the power to repel snakes and poisonous insects. In ancient times, the sanitary conditions were not very good. There were many poisonous insects, but if cassia was placed in the room, all the poisonous insects, and the snakes in particular, would not come. This signifies the resurrection power of the Lord Jesus. The resurrection power of the Lord Jesus repels the devil, snakes, and scorpions.<p>Therefore, you can see that these four spices signify the Lord Jesus who suffered death, who was fragrant and sweet, who resurrected, and who drove away the devil. This One was added to the unique God. In other words, before the incarnation, death, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God had only divinity—the unique olive oil. However, after His incarnation, death, and resurrection, He compounded His humanity, which was a dying and sweet humanity, with divinity. He also compounded His resurrection and the resurrection power that drove away the devil with divinity. Today this Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit. Today in the Spirit of God, there is not only divinity but also humanity. There are also the power of the Lord Jesus’ suffering, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection, which is the power to drive away the devil. Therefore, this is not merely oil but an ointment; this is not merely the Spirit of God but “the Spirit.” Before the Lord’s death and resurrection, the Spirit was not yet. After the Lord’s resurrection, the Spirit came into being. Today this Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit.
