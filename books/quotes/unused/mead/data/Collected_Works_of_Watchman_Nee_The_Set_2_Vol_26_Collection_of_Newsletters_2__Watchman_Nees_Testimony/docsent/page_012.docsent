   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AN OLD LETTER FROM DAIREN, MANCHURIA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear Brothers Ho and Huang:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have a small question that I hope you can answer for me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Miao Wan Hsiu of the meeting here asked about the matter of registering the church with the government.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was in Shanghai, Brother Liu Tien Min of Shantung also wrote a letter asking about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Unfortunately, I did not pay attention to how the brothers answered him at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, I can only ask you brothers to answer the question again.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The condition here is certainly different from that in Shantung and inner China.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Parts omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Chang Chen Ming</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>January 28</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Answer</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Chen Ming:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We received your letter a long time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Please forgive us for not answering sooner.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the local government requires the meeting to register, we should obey.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, we cannot register a name because we may not have names.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can explain to the local officials that we have a Christian meeting at a certain address and then tell them who the responsible ones are.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Peace!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Answered by,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Witness</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>P.S. According to the brothers from Ch'ang-ch'un, the meeting there has already registered with the authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A few of the responsible brothers went to the authorities and explained to them the nature and origin of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They also promised the authorities that they would be completely responsible for that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have heard that not only were they able to do this without difficulty, but the authorities even complimented them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A LETTER FROM BROTHER WITNESS LEE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>FROM SHANGHAI TO FUKIEN</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Mr. Nee:</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I received your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I thank you for the thorough teachings it gave me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I hope you will be willing to teach and correct me often.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thank the Lord, He really blessed Brother Luan's work in Chefoo this time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brother Chao Pi Cheng sent a letter that said, "The condition of this conference was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers T'ien P'ing Fang and Chang Tze Chieh were helped much by this conference...The sisters' work and fellowship is much better than before.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The brothers and sisters seem to be a little revived."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brother Chao Ching Hai sent a letter, saying, "We thank God because He has heard our prayer and the prayers of all our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He bound Satan for us; therefore, we were not bothered by him in this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He also caused us to see the Lord's victory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After we received your telegram that Brother Luan would be coming to Chefoo by the Tung Chou Steamer, the children in every home got sick...Some became sick from falling off the heated beds; some became sick from falling out of their strollers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The rest were mainly sick with fever.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They were all very ill...But through the desperate prayer of the brothers and sisters, all the sick children were well by the time of the first meeting...In this conference, God truly blessed us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We really see a revival in our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We truly thank and praise our dear Father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He also preserved His servant, Brother Luan, so that he was very healthy physically...Many brothers and sisters who love the Lord in the denominations came to attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the seats in the meeting hall were filled every meeting, and we even added chairs in the corridor...Mr. Hsu Chu Lan, the leader of the home table meetings, was very touched.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He bought many of our books...He said he would definitely be able to go to Hangchow to attend the conference there."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brother Chang Tze Chieh sent a letter, saying, "During this conference the devil attacked strongly, but in the end he was defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>During the daytime, it rained often, but every evening it cleared up at meeting time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After the meeting was over, it rained all day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There were thirteen days of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Brother Luan testified twenty-two times to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One day he spoke for eight hours including the time he spoke to outsiders.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we were singing hymns, his voice was hoarse, but during the prayer, his strength increased...We really thank and praise God that His presence is so good!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The atmosphere in every meeting was very living one meeting was not so good ; the flavor of the meetings gives us sweet longings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brother Luan said many times that it was because some took up the responsibility to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I was edified very much during this time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>May you brothers thank the Lord much!"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yes, we really should thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May He preserve what He has done there through our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I already answered the letter to the brothers in P'ing Yang and put the news into the Collection of Newsletters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A few days ago, I felt that I should leave the city, but I do not know where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After receiving your letter today, maybe I should go to P'ing Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, I will wait for the Lord to give me the message and then make the arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Please pray much for this.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There are great difficulties in the matter of visitation among the brothers in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Brothers Tu and Wu do not have much time, and I do not have much either.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I hope Brother Chang returns soon.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are now paying attention to the matter of the brothers' fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It seems that recently the brothers have risen up.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We see it in the table meeting and their prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I really need help and prayers now.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Peace!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Your brother,</S>
