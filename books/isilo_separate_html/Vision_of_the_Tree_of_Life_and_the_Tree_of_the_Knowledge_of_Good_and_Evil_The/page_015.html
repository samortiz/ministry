<p>The last section of the Old Testament is the books of the prophets. The prophets were God&rsquo;s spokesmen. In other words, the prophets were people who expressed God. The Spirit of Jehovah fell upon every prophet (Ezek. 11:5). This means that every prophet was joined to God. The prophets did not have the concept of good and evil. The prophets&rsquo; thought of God was related to Jehovah God coming upon them.</p>
<p>The books of history mainly speak of the evil aspect of the tree of knowledge. However, in the books of history God brought out a group of people who enjoyed Him as the tree of life. The books of poetry present the good aspect of the tree of knowledge, but in these books God compelled a group of people to enjoy Him as their life, signified by the tree of life. The books of the prophets are neither concerning the evil aspect nor the good aspect of the tree of knowledge. The books of the prophets present a few people who enjoyed the tree of life and thus became God&rsquo;s spokesmen. The prophets were filled with God. They lived neither by the evil aspect nor by the good aspect of the tree of knowledge. They were delivered out of the tree of knowledge to live by the tree of life. They were mingled with God and filled with God. As a result, their speaking was God&rsquo;s speaking.</p>
<p>For example, Hebrews 2 quotes Isaiah and says, &ldquo;Behold, I and the children whom God has given to Me&rdquo; (v. 13). This word was spoken by the prophet Isaiah (Isa. 8:18), but in Hebrews it is presented as a word spoken by Christ Himself. This indicates that Isaiah&rsquo;s speaking was Christ&rsquo;s speaking. Another example is the word spoken by the prophet David in his suffering, which was also spoken by Christ in His suffering: &ldquo;My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?&rdquo; (Psa. 22:1; Matt. 27:46). When David spoke this, he was not a king but a prophet. All the prophets were filled with God. We can also touch God in the book of Daniel. When we read this book, we can sense that he was a man in God who was filled with God. Daniel was a man who breathed in God. Therefore, the prophets were people who left the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in order to be in the enjoyment of the tree of life.</p>
<p>The most important thought of God that was expressed through the prophets is that God is the Husband of His people and that His people are His wife (Isa. 54:5-6). God cried out to His people repeatedly, &ldquo;Return unto Me&rdquo; (44:22; cf. 55:7; Jer. 3:1; Joel 2:12). When we read these verses, we think that God wants His people to depart from evil things and to return to Him in order to do good things. Such a concept is of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. However, this is not God&rsquo;s thought. God&rsquo;s desire is for His people to leave everything that is not God and return to God. The prophet Isaiah says, &ldquo;Your Maker is your Husband; / Jehovah of hosts is His name... / For Jehovah has called you, / Like a wife who has been forsaken and is grieved in spirit, / Even like the wife of one&rsquo;s youth when she has been rejected, / Says your God&rdquo; (Isa. 54:5-6). Jehovah said through Jeremiah, &ldquo;My covenant which they broke, although I was their Husband&rdquo; (Jer. 31:32). Jehovah also declared, &ldquo;It is said, / If a man divorces his wife / And she goes from him / And becomes another man&rsquo;s wife, / Will he return to her again? / Will not that land be / Utterly polluted? / But you have committed fornication with many lovers. / Yet return to Me&rdquo; (3:1). In the book of Ezekiel the most heartbreaking thing to God was that the people of Israel had other lovers besides Him (ch. 16). This means that man does not enjoy God. Similar words are found in the book of Hosea: &ldquo;In that day, declares Jehovah, / You will call Me My Husband / And will no longer call Me Baali&rdquo; (2:16). This thought is in all the books of the prophets: God is standing in the position of a husband and calling His wife, who has forsaken Him, to return. The prophets are not saying that the husband-forsaking wife must do good in order to be right. It is not a matter of good or evil but of the wife enjoying and being joined to her husband. The prophets were a group of people who were filled with God, enjoyed God, and lived in God. Their ministry and their commission were to call those who did not enjoy God and had forsaken God to return in order to be joined to God and enjoy God again.</p>
<p>When the prophets called God&rsquo;s people to return to Him, they spoke considerably concerning God coming to be man&rsquo;s Savior (Isa. 19:20; 43:3; Jer. 14:8; Hosea 13:4). The calls to the God-forsaking people to return to their God in order to be joined to Him and enjoy Him were prophecies that expressed the need of God&rsquo;s people to enjoy Him as their Husband. These prophecies were also concerning His coming one day to become man&rsquo;s Savior, that is, to be born of a virgin and be given the name Immanuel, which means &ldquo;God with man&rdquo; (Isa. 7:14). The prophets spoke of Christ&rsquo;s birth, which was God&rsquo;s coming. God came to be the Bridegroom and be joined to man. This was also spoken by John the Baptist, the last prophet. He said, &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom&rdquo; (John 3:29). This indicates that God became flesh to be the Bridegroom. John introduced Christ as the Lamb and as the Bridegroom (1:29; 3:29). Christ came not only to be the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world but also to be the Bridegroom who marries the bride. Hence, John testified that Christ is the Bridegroom, the Husband, spoken of in the Old Testament. He came to marry His redeemed people so that they would be joined to Him.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus began His ministry, He too said that He was the Bridegroom. He said to the Pharisees, &ldquo;The sons of the bridechamber cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them, can they? For as long a time as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast. But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast in that day&rdquo; (Mark 2:19-20). The consistent thought in these verses shows that God is the tree of life in order to be joined to us so that we would be completely freed from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>The thought of God freeing man from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is clearer in the Epistles. Romans 7 speaks clearly and thoroughly concerning the good and the evil of the tree of knowledge; both the good and the evil are apart from God. Chapter 8 says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death&rdquo; (v. 2). The law of sin and of death is the law of the tree of knowledge. When the tree of life comes, it delivers man from the tree of knowledge. A believer is someone who has been delivered from the tree of knowledge in order to live by the tree of life.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ&rdquo; (11:2). Here again is the thought of Christ being our Husband. In Ephesians he says that Christ wants to be joined to man, that the people who are joined to Christ are His counterpart, and that Christ is their Husband (5:25, 31-32). Finally, at the end of Revelation the holy city, New Jerusalem, comes down out of heaven. This city is a wife, a bride, whom Christ will marry (19:7; 21:2). Furthermore, the tree of life will be enjoyed in this city (22:2).</p>
<p>The line of the tree of life is in the Bible. The Old Testament is divided into three major sections. One section is on the evil aspect of the tree of knowledge, another section is on the good aspect of the tree of knowledge, and the last section is concerning a group of prophets who were delivered from good as well as from evil to live exclusively by the tree of life. They were joined to God, lived in God, and were filled with God. Hence, they became God&rsquo;s spokesmen, expressing God&rsquo;s thoughts, and their ministry was to call the people who had turned away from God to return and to enjoy God and thus be delivered from everything outside of God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
