<h2 class="head1">THE LACK OF INCREASE</h2>
<p>Since October of 1984 I felt greatly burdened for the Lord&rsquo;s move on this earth, and I felt very clearly that the Lord was leading me to go back to Taiwan. I was so clear that we needed to have a new start in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The recovery has been to some extent, however, polluted and marred. It has been very much weakened. An unhealthy body always is weakened. I do not think that any of us would say that in the past fifteen years the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been healthy. We all admit that it is not healthy. The fact that we have not had much increase is an evidence of this. In these fifteen years in South America, in Central America, in Africa, in Europe, and in Australasia more localities have been taken by the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, but the total number in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is too small. There is no place that we can see the impact that we saw from 1949 to 1955 in Taiwan. The recovery in Taiwan at that time was like a fighting army. In many aspects and in many directions, God&rsquo;s enemy was being defeated in those years. Within those six years the increase went from about four to five hundred people up to forty or fifty thousand. The real impact was there. Now wherever the recovery has gone in the past fifteen years in South America, Central America, Europe, Australasia, and Africa, we never saw such an impact. Furthermore, the impact was weakened on the island of Taiwan, and the impact was reduced here in the United States. How about the impact? How about the morale?</p>
<p>The main factor that caused me to feel led by the Lord in October of 1984 to go back to Taiwan was the lack of the increase. It is altogether wrong to be in a condition where the rate of increase is so low. I said a strong word to the brothers from Canada in a winter training in Irving, Texas. I told them that the recovery has been existing in that country of approximately twenty-five million people, yet after more than twenty years there are only less than eight hundred saints meeting there. This is a shame and is an indicator that we have nearly no morale. In the United States there are close to one hundred churches, and the number of saints has increased at a very low rate. On the other hand, some other Christian groups, especially in the Far East, have gone up very much in number in recent years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO RECOVER THE MORALE</h2>
<p>This helped me to realize that although we are holding the proper ground, possessing many divine truths, and enjoying all the divine riches, we have lost the morale. We have become a weak person with germs. How can a person be strong with some germs affecting his body all the time. No one can deny the fact that we are weak. As a result, I am greatly burdened. I not only have to be faithful to the Lord and faithful to the churches, but I also have to be faithful to myself. I sacrificed my whole life for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I have passed through different kinds of sufferings in my ministry for the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This is why I must speak the truth regardless of whom I would offend. I must do something to kill all these germs. This is the reason why I have called for three urgent elders&rsquo; trainings from 1984 through 1986.</p>
<p>When I went to Taiwan in October 1984, I revolutionized every bit of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I annulled nearly all the oldness. I do not care for intimate, natural friendship. In my whole being there is no capacity for such a thing. I have to be faithful to my Lord. I have to be faithful to so many saints who gave up their futures and came to this recovery. They came to this recovery at least ninety percent due to my ministry. If the recovery remains like this, I feel I owe much to all these dear ones who gave up their futures to come this way.</p>
<p>The Lord started something new in Taipei, and I originally had no intention to start something among the churches in the United States. Instead, I intended for the churches in the United States to wait for a time so that they could see something as a model in Taiwan. I do not want to have a start when so many old poisons remain. Because I realized that the poisons still remain in the United States, I felt burdened to call this urgent training.</p>
<p>I cannot fellowship with you at this point about these four crucial points&mdash;the home gatherings, the truth lessons, the full-time workers, and the spreading of the gospel. These are the life pulse of the Lord&rsquo;s move today. Before I can make the present situation among us clear by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I would not say a word about these four points. The army is here, but the morale has been lost. We must get the morale back before we talk about the army. With today&rsquo;s situation the way it is, it is hard to fight as an army. We can never win the battle with an uncertain sounding of the trumpet.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY AND THE CHURCHES</h2>
<p>Whether or not a certain church takes the ministry does not decide whether that church is a genuine local church. The title of this message does not say &ldquo;no uncertain sounding of the trumpet in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery&rdquo; but &ldquo;in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry.&rdquo; I am not talking about something in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, but I am talking about the ministry. The citizens of the United States may say many things to criticize the government and the commander in chief of the Armed Forces. But when you get into the army and become a soldier, you lose your right to say anything. It is possible to argue, debate, and even fight in the Senate, but even when the senators get in the army and become soldiers, they have to be quiet. There is no uncertain sounding in the army. The ministry is not like the Senate. The ministry is not a Congress for anyone to come here to express his opinion. The ministry has no capacity for that. The ministry is altogether filled up with a fighting spirit. I do not control any church. All the saints who have left the denominations, the divisive sects, and stand on the proper ground are a local church in their locality. They can express their opinions, but they may have nothing to do with this ministry.</p>
<p>Paul told us that all who were in Asia turned away from him (2 Tim. 1:15). The believers in Asia who had formerly received the apostle&rsquo;s ministry now forsook him. They did not lose their status as local churches due to the fact that they gave up Paul&rsquo;s ministry, but in fighting the battle, Paul&rsquo;s ministry could not depend upon them. For Paul&rsquo;s ministry they could not be counted on. To say that the ministry cannot depend upon a certain church does not mean that that church has been cut off from being a local church. It is still a local church, but we must realize that the ministry is a fighting unit. In this fighting unit there is no capacity and no time for your opinion.</p>
<p>I mean business for the Lord&rsquo;s interest. I have sacrificed my entire life for the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. I gave up everything to take the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Now I must be faithful to myself. Furthermore, through my ministry on this globe, thousands of saints have come into the recovery, so I must be faithful to them. Many of the saints have given up high degrees to follow the Lord in His recovery, yet it seems what they are in is tending to be disappointing. This burdens me. Some of the saints became what they are in the Lord one hundred percent due to my ministry, and I do not want my ministry to waste their time. I have to do something to insure their investment of their whole being into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. They have given up their future in the world, but they can not have much encouragement in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I have to be faithful to the Lord, faithful to so many of you who have been very much affected by this ministry, and faithful to myself. For this reason, this ministry cannot allow anyone to pretend to be in it and yet still say something different. This does not mean that I ask you to stay away from your local church or that your local church is no longer a local church. What I am fellowshipping about is the impact of the ministry for the fighting of the Lord&rsquo;s interest in His recovery.</p>
<p>Whatever I would say concerning the home gatherings, the full-timers, the truth lessons, and the spreading of the gospel is not for anyone who does not feel good about my ministry, who is dissenting to my ministry, who is pretending to be here under the ministry yet actually is not. I still love all the dear saints who may fall into this category and still count them as brothers in Christ, but we need to have an army full of impact, and this army has no capacity and no time for anyone to express any kind of opinion. We are fighting a battle. The army began the fighting already in Taiwan. Now we want to see this army increasing to fight the battle not only in the United States but also in Canada, in Central America, in South America, in Europe, in Africa, in Australasia, and in the entire continent of Asia. This is what I want to see. I am not talking about the churches, I am talking about the ministry. The ministry is one thing, and the churches are another thing. These two things can be differentiated in the Epistles written by Paul. Paul&rsquo;s ministry is one category, and the churches are another category. Paul never tried to force all the churches to follow him in his ministry, but Paul surely had a ministry for the churches.</p>
