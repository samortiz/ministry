   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HOME MEETINGS BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FOUNDATION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christianity has been on the earth for two thousand years, but the gospel still has not been preached to all the corners of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even though Christianity has been in Taiwan for several hundred years and the island has convenient transportation and communication, there are only about three Christians among every hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During the past eight months, we baptized twenty thousand new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the brothers and sisters receive the burden to care for the home meetings, these twenty thousand new ones will be fed and cared for.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have made calculations and budgets to gospelize Taiwan in the near future.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to gospelize Taiwan, however, we must labor on the home meetings, because the home meetings are the key to the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are at a crucial stage, and we must consider how to care for the households of the newly baptized saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to study our past practices and consider how we will allocate and use our time in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should also consider whether our care for the home meetings will be appropriate and effective.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These are the issues that we must consider.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In one of the churches in central Taiwan, the new believers who went from the home meetings to the meetings of the church have remained.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, all the new ones learned from the saints; the new ones are leading other people to believe in the Lord and are establishing home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Recently we received a letter from the northern part of Italy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The writer said that after reading our books and watching our videos, the believers there were helped to have home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At present there are eleven people meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They learned that we began the new way of door-knocking to preach the gospel, and they began to practice door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a result these eleven people gained eleven more through door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This locality started with eleven people who began to meet in a home because they did not have a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, the locality was raised up through home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The two thousand new households are the result of two terms of the training.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This proves that our way is correct and that door-knocking is effective.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we can take good care of these households, we will receive the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, we must pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must attend the training, and we must use two or three evenings a week to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are willing to pay this price, we will be blessed and our households will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we live a normal human life according to our God-created nature, we will receive the blessing; our family will be blessed, our friends and relatives will be blessed, and even the entire society and the entire country will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May we all receive this burden and rise up to be proper Christians according to our God-created nature, not only by going to big meetings to listen to one man speak but also by establishing home meetings in the homes of the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the only way for the church to have a solid foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>PRACTICAL FELLOWSHIP AND ADJUSTMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to fellowship concerning a few practical matters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The responsible brothers from each meeting hall should meet together to fellowship concerning how to carry out these points.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The elders can then fellowship with the saints in each meeting hall concerning how to enter into this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should lead the saints according to their age.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The elderly brothers and sisters can meet together specifically for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The brothers and sisters who are between the ages of twenty-five and forty-five should knock on doors and lead the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church in Taipei is not a small church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the arrangements and leading are done properly, the church will accomplish many things, but if the arrangements are done poorly, we will waste our time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to coordinate together and work together in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not expect to succeed in two or three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It will not be easy for the trainees and the brothers and sisters in the church to find the time to coordinate together, because the brothers and sisters have jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to consider this and experiment until we find a way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have a large city and two thousand new households; therefore, we should not waste our time or our manpower.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These matters require that the brothers and sisters in each meeting hall coordinate and work together.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must follow the leading and arrangements of the elders and the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>BEING A WEIGHTY PERSON IN THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Door-knocking to preach the gospel and having home meetings are noble activities.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this reason we should not do them according to our old ways but according to the instructions of the training.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we go out, our appearance must be proper and our clothing should be simple but neat.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our clothing should not be luxurious, nor should we wear bright colors.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our clothing should cause people to respect us and to consider that we are weighty people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then people will feel peaceful and welcome us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Otherwise, our appearance can hinder us from entering their door.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must also be serious people so that we are not despised.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First Timothy 4:12 says, Let no one despise your youth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This means that we should be weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To be held in high regard requires weight.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The weightiness of a Christian depends on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we have the Lord in us, we are weighty; if we do not have the Lord in us, we will lack weightiness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The young people can be weighty because the Lord is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If they love the Lord and fellowship with Him often, they will be weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our purpose is not merely to knock on doors in order to bring salvation to others, or to have home meetings in order to bring grace and truth to the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In addition, we must be cultivated persons.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Being cultivated, however, does not mean self-improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We cannot improve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to fellowship with the Lord daily and have set times to touch the Lord, confess our sins, and pursue the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We also need to follow the Spirit, deny the self, not seek our own benefit, and bear the cross daily in order to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord is the living Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we live by the Spirit, we will grow and become weighty persons.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We also need a knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Truth and life are two aspects of the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When the truth enters into us and is digested in our experience, it becomes life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We cannot neglect the truth; hence, we must read the Bible often and know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Life and truth make us weighty persons.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In addition to knocking on doors and having home meetings, our appearance and speech must be weighty, and we must grow in life and be equipped in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord, the divine life, and the truth are in us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Consequently, the words we speak will have value.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Many people seemed light rather than weighty before their salvation, even though they were well educated and had a high position in society.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After believing in the Lord, however, they began to pray, read the Bible, grow in life, and be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Now they are proper and weighty in their appearance, speech, and relationship with others.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is not the result of human teachings; rather, this is the issue of the increase of the Lord within them.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Every day we need the spiritual exercise of touching the Lord, dealing with Him, giving Him room within us, following Him, bearing the cross, and studying the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we do this every day of the year, we will become weighty persons regardless of our age.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We will be weighty when we speak and when we shake hands with people.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Even the unbelievers will sense that we have something within that makes us weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is the difference between believers and unbelievers; what we have within us is expressed outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We are not in a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>According to Hymns, #268, we are channels for God s Spirit to flow through us into others.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we visit the new ones in their homes every week, what is deposited into them will be with them for the rest of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Even if we answer their questions with a few simple sentences, our answer will remain in the deepest part of their being.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They may ask a simple question about dealing with their parents; if we are weighty, even a simple response will give them a deep impression.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Our response will change their human life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is what we must give people when we contact them through door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We must be prepared to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We cannot learn to be weighty, nor can others teach us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Being weighty requires a daily exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We exercise to daily fellowship with the Lord and to avoid committing sins and transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We thoroughly confess every sin and transgression to the Lord so that we can be cleansed by His blood, filled with the Holy Spirit, walk according to the Spirit, and live a life of bearing the cross instead of living to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We must also read the Bible often and learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In this way we will become weighty persons.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Our being weighty will influence our home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I am concerned that we are not weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This can cause people to find some excuse not to meet with us.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>They may even ask us not to come again.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We should not receive these words as doctrine; we should receive this burden and pray concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If we want the Lord to spread His recovery and increase the church, we must be weighty people who walk on this pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The home meetings are not a light matter.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We are presenting ourselves to others, and they see what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Being weighty depends on a habitual daily exercise before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We should never despise the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Even if we do not know how to use Life Lessons, what we are is placed before the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If we are proper and weighty, their entire household will be blessed because they see a pattern that can benefit even their children.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The new ones will become weighty people who fear God, believe in the Lord Jesus, speak the truth, and are proper.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>They will even welcome us for the sake of their children.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This type of work is worthwhile and long lasting.</S>
