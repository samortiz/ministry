   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Beauty of the New Creation 4:1-5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 1 through 5 say, "Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armory, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because of numerous past experiences, the King repeats the words that he said in the past: "Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The King can safely say this to her because she has all these experiences behind her.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since she has passed through the experience of 3:6 and since she has a complete union with the King, she no longer retains the praises for her own use.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the King can safely praise her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are seven items of the King's praise in this section.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These praises show the outward expressions that a person has after he is completely joined to the Lord and after he understands the cross and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, these praises reveal the condition of a new creation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Doves' Eyes Signifying Spiritual Insight</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first thing a person has when he advances spiritually is spiritual insight; he can discern spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The doves' eyes denote singleness as well as spirituality because the Holy Spirit is likened to a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the eyes are single, there is spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But there is a great danger if we lack a veil for our spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word "locks" in this verse is translated "veils" in Darby's New Translation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A veil is something that covers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Being behind the veils means that even though a person has spiritual insight to discern spiritual matters, he does not allow others to see what he has in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One may have the eyes of a dove, but be lacking in veils.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is very easy to give away lightly what one sees.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In addition, the eyes that are within the veils are not seen by ordinary men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that one's eyes are veiled from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The world does not know that such a one has spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To the world, his eyes are just like the eyes of any ordinary man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The believers' foolishness and mistakes lie in carelessly divulging to the world the things that they have seen through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should realize that we will know very little about the power and the work of the Holy Spirit if we do not have spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more Spirit we have, the more we will have doves' eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot be completely isolated from the dove and still have doves' eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All true light comes from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many times, however, this light should be veiled before the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the first point concerning the beauty of the maiden.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rarely do we consider spiritual insight to be something for the Lord's delight.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But we have to see that even our spiritual insight is something for His appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hair Signifying Consecration and Obedience</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hair is only briefly mentioned in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With Samson, hair signifies consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Keeping his hair signified that he reserved all that he had for God's use.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why he was powerful Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our consecration before God determines our power before men.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The amount of consecration we have before God and the degree of the perfection and purity of the consecration determines the amount of power we will have before men.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A sanctifying consecration is the basis of all strength.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Another significance of hair in the Bible is covering.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A woman's hair and the Nazarite's hair convey this sense.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It means standing in the position of obedience, covering up that which is of man, that which is natural and fleshly, and allowing God to be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Most goats are white.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Mount Gilead is a place with many goats and much grass Jer 50:19; Micah 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Goats are used in the Bible as sin offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The hair of the maiden is as a flock of goats beside Mount Gilead.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a symbol; it means that she is well fed and ready to be offered up as an offering.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Where is our consecration and obedience manifested?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is manifested at the place where we receive God's feeding and food.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Both the feeding and the food are for the purpose of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is where our power lies, and this is where our obedience lies.</S>
