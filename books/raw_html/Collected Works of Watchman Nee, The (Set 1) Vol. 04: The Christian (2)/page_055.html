<P>The word "faithful" is pistos in the original language. It means to persevere and to remain unchanged. This is in opposition to the looseness in Ephesus. Faithfulness is a matter of time. It is not difficult to be stirred up and become excited in an instant. But it is not easy to remain steady for a long time and to regard ten years as a day. It is possible for one to maintain his love for the Lord and his standard according to the Lord's word in calm and peaceful days. But it is rare and precious for one to act as "he had always done" as Daniel did (Dan. 6:10) and to be unmoved when confronted with swords, persecutions, and chains from non-Christians. To begin well is indeed commendable, but to continue well is more praiseworthy. The Lord is the faithful One, because He is the unchanging One. What He has promised He will never change. His promise stands and remains for as long as He Himself stands and remains. If there is no possibility for Him to perish, then His promise must necessarily be eternally efficacious and unchanging. If God's promise to us is unchanging, how can our promise of consecration to Him be broken? We should be faithful as God is faithful. If He has not changed, how can we change? It is indeed pleasing to the Lord to love the Lord in our youth. But it is more pleasing to the eyes of the Lord to be ripe with age and yet still not be an "old prophet" (1 Kings 13:11).</P><P>To be faithful is to have the heart of a virgin. It is to remain chaste for the Lord. To be faithful to the Lord means to be single-hearted for the Lord. It is right for us to work, to labor, to suffer, to sacrifice, to love, and to serve. Yet the most crucial question is for whom are we really doing these things? Why are we doing all these things? What the Lord considers is not simply the works, but the motive behind our works. Why are we doing all the works? The Lord does not care for the greatness of the outward works. He only questions the purity of the inward motive. If there are other mixed goals besides being for the Lord in the motive of our work, we cannot be considered faithful. Neither a craving for fame, gain, or praise from man, nor a work out of pity, or an outright absence of purpose in our work can gain us the Lord's pleasure. To be faithful in our work is a matter of the heart rather than anything else. To be faithful in our work does not mean to work hard. Rather, it means that the motive of our work is for the love of the Lord. This is the most crucial question. In that day, the judgment of our work at the judgment seat will be for the most part, if not fully, according to this standard. Every work that is not done for the Lord will be burned. Those who will gain a reward are those who have a pure and clean motive. The Lord wants us to be faithful and to be "faithful unto death." To be faithful unto death means that we should be faithful even at the time we die. Death is the last moment of our life. Although not all of us will necessarily die, and although it is possible for some of us to remain until the Lord comes back, such is the Lord's charge: to be faithful unto death, that is, to be faithful unto the end. The day of the coming of the Lord is nearer day by day. The path we are treading may be the last few miles. "For in yet a very little while the Coming One will come and will not delay. But My righteous one shall live by faith; and if he shrinks back, My soul does not delight in him" (Heb. 10:37-38). Hence, "Hold fast what you have that no one take your crown" (Rev. 3:11). This one "has" something already; he already has his crown. But there is a condition for keeping his crown, which is to be steadfast and to be unchanging. "And let us not lose heart in doing what is good, for in the proper season we will reap if we do not faint" (Gal. 6:9).</P><P>Moreover, "unto death" is not only a matter of time. It also means to be faithful even at the cost of death. Death is the greatest temptation and the last trial. If we are willing to accept the sinful terms of Satan, he is willing to promise us life. However, if we will serve the Lord faithfully, we will lose our life. To be faithful is to die, and to compromise, to withdraw, to succumb to man's will, and to lower God's standard is to live. If one is faithful to the Lord and is willing to forsake everything, his end is death. Those who are open to private intercourse with Satan in secret and who are willing to bow down before him on the mountain, when no one is around, will surely be spared from death and will be granted the blessings of this world. But those who will serve the Lord faithfully will have to sit down and count the cost. At present, the anti-religious tide is rising everywhere. We do not know where this will lead in the future. However, if the time comes for us to pour out our blood on our faith and on the words of our testimony, are we fully prepared? When our lives are threatened, will we be able to preserve our faithfulness? How do we feel when we hear the Lord say: "For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it" (Matt. 16:25)? Now is the time for us to prepare ourselves to be a martyr. So often we think that time is plentiful and the battle has just begun, and that we should save our useful body for future use. However, if we avoid the testimony of this crucial moment, but try to save our body for greater use by the Lord later, our future work before the Lord may amount to nothing. Martyrdom is the greatest work. The supreme testimony is to be faithful unto death. The blood speaks better words than the mouth. The voice of the blood is louder than any other voice, and its power greater than any other power. The Lord wants all of us to be martyrs, if not physically, at least psychologically. If we are prepared to shed our blood and to die for the sake of our faith and for the keeping of His word, and if we would not dodge to sacrifice our faithfulness, will we not be more than prepared when trials less dreadful than death come upon us? Although the Lord has not ordained that every one of us be martyrs in our body, He desires that we have the spirit of those who will not deny the Lord or disobey His word even unto death. If we encounter misunderstandings, rejections, oppositions, persecutions, and even execution for the sake of being faithful in serving the Lord, and if we are not mindful of these things, we are being faithful unto death. If through serving the Lord faithfully, we lose our worldly friends, parents, wives, wealth, fame, glory, joy, and life, and would accept these losses happily, we are being faithful unto death. How difficult this is! Does not the flesh tremble at this thought? Yet the power of the Lord is strong enough to sustain His saints.</P>
