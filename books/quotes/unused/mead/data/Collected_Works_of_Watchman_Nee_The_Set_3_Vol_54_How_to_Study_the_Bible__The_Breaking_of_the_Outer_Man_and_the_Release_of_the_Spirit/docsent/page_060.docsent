   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR THE BREAKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE ALABASTER FLASK</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible speaks of ointment of pure nard John 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's Word purposely uses the adjective pure.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is ointment of pure nard, something truly spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Unless the alabaster flask is broken, however, the ointment of pure nard cannot be released.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is strange that many people appreciate the alabaster flask.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They think that the flask is more precious than the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many people think that their outer man is more precious than their inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the problem facing the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may treasure our own wisdom and think that we are quite superior.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Another person may treasure his emotions and also think that he is quite outstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many people treasure themselves; they think that they are much better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They think their eloquence, their ability, their discernment, and their judgment are better.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But we are not antique collectors; we are not admirers of alabaster flasks.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are those who are after the aroma of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the outer part is not broken, the inner part will not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will have no way to go on, and the church will have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We no longer should be so protective of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Holy Spirit has never stopped working.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many people can testify that this work has never stopped in them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They face one trial after another, encounter one incident after another.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Holy Spirit has only one goal in all of His disciplining work: To break and dismantle the outer man so that the inner man can break forth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the trouble with us is that we murmur as soon as we suffer a little hardship, and we complain as soon as we suffer a little defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord has prepared a way for us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is ready to use us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As soon as His hand is upon us, however, we become unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Either we argue with Him, or we complain about everything to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From the day we were saved, the Lord has been working on us in many different ways for the purpose of breaking the self.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may or may not know it, but the Lord's goal is always to break our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The treasure is in the earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who needs to see your earthen vessel?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church lacks the treasure, not the earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The world lacks the treasure, not the earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the earthen vessel is not broken, who will find the treasure within?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord works in us in so many different ways for the purpose of breaking the earthen vessel, the alabaster flask, the outer shell.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord wants to prepare a way to bring His blessing to the world through those who belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a way of blessing, but it is also a way stained with blood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Blood must be shed, and wounds are unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How crucial the breaking of this outer man is!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Unless the outer man is broken, there cannot be any spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are consecrated to the Lord for His service, we have to be prepared to be broken by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot excuse ourselves or preserve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to allow the Lord to break our outer man completely so that He can have a free way through us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all have to find out God's intention for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is unfortunate that many people do not know what the Lord is doing in them or what the Lord intends for them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May every one of us know the Lord's intention for us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Lord opens our eyes, we will see that everything that has happened to us throughout our lives is meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord never does anything in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After we realize that the Lord's goal is to break our outer man, we will realize that everything that has happened to us is significant.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord is trying to achieve one goal: To break and dismantle our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The trouble with many is that before the Lord is able to move even a finger, they show signs of displeasure already.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must realize that all the experiences, difficulties, and trials from the Lord are for our highest good.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We cannot ask for anything better; they are the best.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If anyone goes to the Lord and says, "Lord, please let me choose the best," I believe the Lord will tell him, "I have given you the best.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What you are facing every day is for your highest good."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord has arranged everything for us for the purpose of breaking our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We can put our spirit to full use only as our outer man is broken and our spirit is released.</S>
