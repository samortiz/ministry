<h1 class="title">CONCERNING THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h1>
<p>In the past, according to our concept of the church life, we did not focus on the children&rsquo;s work. However, with the development of human society and culture, there has been more social and educational emphasis put on children. If children&rsquo;s education is not developed, it will be difficult to have a healthy society. For this reason, more and more scholars and experts are beginning to pay attention to children.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING OF THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>I entered the church life in 1932, and a church was raised up in my hometown in July of the same year. The following year there was the need for a children&rsquo;s meeting. We did not know anything and were simply groping around. At the time, our purpose in beginning a children&rsquo;s meeting was mainly to care for the saints who brought their children to the meeting. It was simply a child-care service. Later, I moved to Shanghai where the children&rsquo;s meeting was more developed. When we began the work in Taiwan, we also began the children&rsquo;s work because the number of children among us was increasing.</p>
<p>This is also the principle in America. The children&rsquo;s work there is more important than any other work. In America before a child turns twelve years of age, his family has quite an influence on his life. Families there manage children as if managing a machine. A child does whatever his parents say. I have been received by many American families and was never bothered by the children under twelve. For example, one family who offered me hospitality had their children take a nap at one-thirty in the afternoon or simply stay in their bedroom. The children were also sent to their bedrooms at six-thirty in the evening. The children could even jump in their rooms, but they were not allowed to shout. This allowed us to have dinner with the parents without any disturbance. Neither was there any interruption in our fellowship when we returned from the meeting. However, it was entirely different when I stayed with a Chinese family. At ten-thirty at night the children were still running around and very noisy. This often did not allow us to have good fellowship.</p>
<p>Since American society pays much attention to the children, when we began the work in America, we studied extensively the best way for children to participate in the meetings. According to the American custom, when parents go out, they never leave their children alone at home. Therefore, most American parents bring their children to the meeting, and the children even sit next to the parents. When the children squirm a little, the mother stops them. As a result, all the children sit quietly. However, this way of handling the children gives them an unpleasant feeling, and eventually they do not like to attend the meetings when they grow up.</p>
<p>Based on our study, we decided to watch the children for the saints. Children&rsquo;s meetings began with the intention of babysitting the children. Gradually, the matter of preparing teachers came in, and we compiled material. The work progressed like a snowball that grows bigger and bigger as it rolls down a hill. Sometimes the children&rsquo;s work needed more than fifty serving saints to prepare the material, teach the lessons, and care for the children. Many saints joined the children&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>When I returned to Taipei in 1965, I saw that there were quite a number of children. According to the brothers, from 1966 to 1967 there were about four thousand children in the meetings. However, currently there are not more than five hundred children in the twenty halls in Taipei. This situation can be likened to the sun going down. For this reason, I often reminded the brothers to pay attention to the children&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>From our experience we feel that the children&rsquo;s work is very important. The children&rsquo;s work should not simply be babysitting in order for the saints to come to the meetings. Due to their circumstances, the saints need to bring their children to the meeting, and there is the need to take care of the children for the saints. However, the children&rsquo;s work has another function, that is, to cultivate and nurture our next generation. This is worthy of our careful consideration and examination.</p>
<p>Today several young brothers are elders in various halls. In 1949 when we began the work in Taiwan, the parents of these brothers were not married. They were brought together by us. Thirty years later, their children have grown and are serving in the church, bearing important responsibilities. Similarly, last November I was in the Philippines and was greatly surprised, because a new generation of serving ones has replaced the older generation; a younger generation has been raised up. The co-workers, elders, and my translators were young brothers who were born after 1950. This situation shows that the children&rsquo;s work is very important.</p>
