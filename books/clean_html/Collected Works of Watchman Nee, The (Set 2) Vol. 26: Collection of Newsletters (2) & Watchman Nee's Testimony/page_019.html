<h2 class="head2">1. The Condition of the Meeting in Nan Hsi<br />(Generally Called Sze Hsi)</h2><p>Nan Hsi used to belong to the China Inland Mission. In 1928 it left the system of denominations. All the brothers were in one accord in meeting in the Lord's name. However, the denomination would not let go because this locality is in a crucial location. They used the method of stubborn entanglement to keep them connected with the denomination. In 1930 the brothers finally were able to completely cut off their relationship with the denomination. Now the meetings are in a building on a mountain plateau. It is a quiet place in the midst of a noisy region. The meeting hall has its back to the mountain and faces a stream. The water sparkles as it flows by. The natural setting is very charming. The meeting hall is very pretty, and it has a lawn. It is very elegant and quiet. It is an ideal place for the believers to meditate and fellowship in spirit. There are more than thirty people in the meetings who have already partaken of the table. There are another twenty or more who come to hear the messages but have not yet taken the table. There are seven newcomers. In all there are about seventy people in the meetings. Every Lord's Day five brothers take turns giving the messages and bearing the responsibility for the meetings. They are Pao Ts'ung Hsien, Pao Tze Ching, Pao Kuei Ju, Ho Ping Wen, and Ho Tao Huang. Sometimes Brother Lai is home and he also helps with the messages. There are two sisters, Pao Lin Hsiang and Pao Mei Hsiu, who also work among the sisters, teaching them to read a little and to sing hymns. I am now living here. If I do not go out, I help them sometimes. However, some of the brothers and sisters are distracted by their business and are busy making money. Some must bear heavy responsibilities at home and have many family affairs to handle. At this time, no one has stepped forth to solely answer to the Lord. Brothers and sisters, please pray for this matter. Ask the Lord to raise up His people to be absolutely for Him. We have hoped for this for a long time.</p><h2 class="head2">2. The Beginning and Condition<br />of the Meeting in Hsia Ch'iao</h2><p>The meeting here split off from Nan Hsi after the latter left the denominations. They used to go to Nan Hsi to meet. Some brothers and sisters were from Hsi Yuan. Although it was only ten miles to Nan Hsi, they had to walk along the edge of the stream. The road is steep and narrow, and when it rains, the stream overflows its banks, so they had to walk on the mountain path in the water. It was very difficult for the sisters. If there was a meeting in Hsia Ch'iao, they would only need to travel less than half the distance to Nan Hsi. The brothers prayed for this matter. Later, everyone discussed it and felt that it was the Lord's will. In 1931 they began to split up and meet in Brother T'ang Li Ch'ing's home. He willingly consecrated his house to the Lord. At the time they began meeting, the total number in the meeting was a little more than ten, including both men and women. Later, they were blessed by the Lord, and the number increased gradually. Brother Li Ch'ing is now responsible in the table meeting and for the message. He takes responsibility for the affairs of the meeting, because he is very single for the Lord. His wife is also very much in one accord with him. They very gladly give hospitality to the saints. They only need help in the matter of edifying the brothers, because he does not have much gift for speaking. Brothers and sisters, please pray for them.</p><h2 class="head2">3. The Beginning and Condition<br />of the Meeting in Ke Ling</h2><p>This meeting originally belonged to the China Inland Mission. In 1929 they turned this way. There were several reasons for their turn. First, several brothers in the meeting had read The Christian and had seen the light concerning the truth of the church. Second, Brother Chen Fang was among them, and he taught them something concerning the matter of the church while doing an edification work. Third, the fellowship between the brothers in this locality and in Nan Hsi was very close, as close as lips are to teeth. When they were still in the denominations, the brothers here would discuss important decisions like the hiring of teachers or other matters with the brothers in Nan Hsi. They would bear the responsibility together. Therefore, when the Nan Hsi brothers left the denomination, it spontaneously affected them here. The other reasons for turning from the denominations are difficult to enumerate. There are fifty brothers and sisters who already take the table. There are another fifty or so who come to hear the messages but who have not taken the table yet. There are also a few newcomers. Altogether, there are more than one hundred people in the meetings. Every Lord's Day morning there is an edification meeting. In the afternoon, they break bread to remember the Lord. Six brothers, Wang Yeou Kao, Wang T'ien Kuan, Wang Hsing Ch'ing, Wang Hsu Yuan, Wang Shou Tiao, and Wang Mu Ch'uan, bear the responsibility for the messages and the affairs of the meeting. There is also a brother named Wang Chu Yeou who used to be a teacher in the China Inland Mission but left the denomination in March of this year. Sometimes he also helps to preach a message in this locality if he is not traveling. On the surface, this meeting looks as if all the members obey the Lord and meet in the Lord's name. The number of those who have been inwardly revived, however, is very small. As for the rest, some are young in life, and it is difficult to say whether or not some have life, because they are just obeying. Brothers and sisters, please pray for this matter. I really hope that the Lord would bless them so that the entire congregation could be revived.</p>
