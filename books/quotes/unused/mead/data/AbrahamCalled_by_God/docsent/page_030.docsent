   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE STRIVING OF THE BROTHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After passing through the experience in chapter twelve, it might be easy for Abraham or for us to say, "Praise the Lord, I have learned the lesson!"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But some tests are needed to prove whether or not we have truly learned the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One test is the striving of the brother 13:5-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Abraham had become rich by trying to sell his wife, and these riches caused him some trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He became too rich.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lot also acquired riches, and the land was too small to bear them both.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 13:6 we are told that "the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So there was "strife between the herdmen of Abraham's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle" 13:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This became another trial for Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many times the second trial comes out of the blessing of the first trial.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may say, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I was walking out of Egypt, I didn't have the face to thank the Lord, but now after three months I can praise Him for His goodness to me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He preserved my wife and has given me all of these riches."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you say this, you may soon find yourself in trouble, for the second trial will come from the blessing of the first trial.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Chapter thirteen indicates that Abraham had learned a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This time he did not fail; he was prevailing because he had learned the lesson in the first trial.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you read carefully, you will see that in this case the fault was not with Abraham but with Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Abraham learned the lesson of not striving for himself and of having no choice for himself but of trusting in God's care.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He knew that he was in the hand of God and under the care of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no hint in chapter thirteen of any kind of failure on the part of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was completely successful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou will take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left" 13:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Abraham seemed to be telling Lot, "Lot, we are Hebrew brothers, the only Hebrews in the land.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All of the others are Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are looking at us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There should be no strife between us, for that would be a shame to the God in whom we trust.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lot, look over the land and choose the place where you would like to be.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I will not strive or have any choice."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Deep within, Abraham must have said, "My choice is with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have learned the lesson by going down to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now I know that I am under the care of my God and that under Him everything is mine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I don't need to choose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I will let Lot make his choice."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lot made his choice, departed from Abraham, and "pitched his tent toward Sodom," not caring about the wickedness of Sodom 13:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was not a small thing for Abraham to be left without Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Abraham did not have a son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His nephew, Lot, a very close relative, was just like a son to him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I believe that Abraham treated Lot as his own son.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>So when Lot left him, he was alone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But at this point God appeared to Abraham again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Egypt, God dealt with Pharaoh in the plagues, but He did not appear to Abraham because he was in the wrong position.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Egypt, Abraham was in God's keeping grace, but he did not have God's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now in chapter thirteen Abraham was not only in God's keeping grace but, having come back to the original place, was also in the right position.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, he did not strive for himself or choose for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As a result of the discipline he underwent in Egypt, he learned that his future and everything were in the hand of God and that he was under God's care.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>So God appeared to him and said, "Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever" 13:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Abraham told Lot to take his choice of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then God came in and seemed to tell Abraham, "I do not allow you to choose.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am giving all the choices to you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Look northward, southward, eastward, and westward all is yours.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You gave the choice to Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now I am giving everything to you."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must learn from this never to strive for ourselves in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let your brother have all the choices.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you give the choice to your brother, God will come in and give all the choices to you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This time in His appearing God confirmed the promise concerning the good land in 12:7 and the promise concerning the increase of his seed in 12:2.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our prevailing over any trial always confirms God's promises to us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This happened to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Moreover, Abraham's prevailing over this trial ushered him to the peak of his experience of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He removed his tent and came to dwell in Hebron 13:18 where he dwelt for most of the remainder of his time in the fellowship with God 18:1 .</S>
