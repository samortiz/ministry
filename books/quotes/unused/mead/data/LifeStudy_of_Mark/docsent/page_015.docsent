   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FIVE THE CONTENTS OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR S</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOSPEL SERVICE 1 Scripture Reading: Mark 1:14-45</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you consult the outline of the Gospel of Mark printed in the Recovery Version, you will see that this Gospel is composed of six main sections: the beginning of the gospel and the initiation of the Slave-Savior 1:1-13 ; the ministry of the Slave-Savior for the spreading of the gospel 1:14 10:52 ; the preparation of the Slave-Savior for His redemptive service 11:1 14:42 ; the death and resurrection of the Slave-Savior for the accomplishment of God s redemption 14:43 16:18 ; the ascension of the Slave-Savior for His exaltation 16:19 ; and the Slave-Savior s universal spreading of the gospel through His disciples 16:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the foregoing messages we have considered the beginning of the gospel and the initiation of the Slave-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With this message we shall begin to consider the ministry of the Slave-Savior for the spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen that the Slave-Savior was initiated into His ministry by two steps the steps of baptism and testing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1:14 10:52 the Slave-Savior carries out the ministry into which He has been initiated, a ministry that is for the spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the third message of this Life-study we saw that the gospel is the fulfillment of the promises, prophecies, and types in the Old Testament and the removal of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both the fulfillment of the promises, prophecies, and types and the removal of the law are a living Person, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ Himself is the fulfillment, and He Himself is the removal of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What, then, is the beginning of this gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The beginning of the gospel is actually the ushering in of this living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For us today, Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as we have Him, we have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not have promises we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not have prophecies we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not have types we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not strive to keep the law, because Christ is here, and we have Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In our spiritual dictionary the unique word is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now that we have seen what the gospel is, we need to go on to consider the contents of the gospel service revealed in 1:14-45.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to this section of the Gospel of Mark, the contents of the gospel service include five items: preaching the gospel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>14-20 , teaching the truth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>21-22 , casting out demons vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>23-28 , healing the sick vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>29-39 , and cleansing the leper vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>40-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In simple terms, the contents of the Slave-Savior s gospel service are preaching, teaching, casting out demons, healing, and cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is possible to read 1:14-45 a number of times without realizing that these verses portray the contents of the gospel service.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let us now go on to consider what 1:14-20 records concerning the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL In a Despised Region</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Mark 1:14 says, And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John s imprisonment was a sign of the rejection of the gospel, especially in the region of honor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence the Slave-Savior left that region and returned to the despised region for His service of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although John the Baptist ministered in the wilderness, not in the holy temple in the holy city, his ministry was nevertheless in Judea, not far from the holy things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Due to the people s rejection of John, the Lord Jesus came into Galilee to begin His gospel service, far away from the holy temple and the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This occurred sovereignly to fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah 9:1-2.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Galilee was a place with a mixed population of both Jews and Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, it was called Galilee of the nations Gentiles and was despised by orthodox Jews John 7:41, 52 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The gospel service was initiated by the ministry of the Slave-Savior s forerunner 1:1-11 in Judea, the region of honor.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But it continued by the ministry of the Slave-Savior in Galilee, the despised region, for a period of about three years 1:14 9:50 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Mark narrates nothing of the Slave-Savior s ministry in Jerusalem and Judea during this time, as John does in his Gospel John 1:29-42; 2:13 3:36; 5:1-47; 7:10 11:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Mark does not narrate anything of the Slave-Savior s ministry in Judea until He left Galilee for Jerusalem the last time Mark 10:1 to accomplish His redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then the gospel service continued by His ministry on the way to Jerusalem and in Jerusalem and its vicinity 10:1 14:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It was concluded with His redeeming death, His life-imparting resurrection, His ascension for exaltation, and the continuation of His gospel service by His disciples preaching to all the creation 14:43 16:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Apostle John, however, in his Gospel narrates events in Jerusalem and Judea before the time of Mark 10 that are not included in Mark s Gospel see John 1:29-42; 2:13 3:36; 5:1-47; 7:10 11:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to Mark 1:14, Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Slave-Savior s preaching was to announce God s glad tidings to the miserable people in bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His teaching vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>21-22 was to enlighten the ignorant ones in darkness with the divine light of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His preaching implied teaching, and His teaching implied preaching Matt 4:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the first thing He did in His ministry, and it was the all-embracing structure of His evangelical service Mark 1:38-39; 3:14; 6:12; 14:9; 16:15, 20 .</S>
