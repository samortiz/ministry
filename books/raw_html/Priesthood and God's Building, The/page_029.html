        <h2 class="head1">BEING CALLED IN THIS AGE</h2>
<p>In this age God is shining the light to show us His heart&rsquo;s desire. He is sounding out a call for people to respond to His desire. He desires to gain a group of people who will contact Him, fellowship with Him, and allow Him to saturate and flow through them, thereby reflecting His glory, expressing His image, and representing and reigning with His authority. God needs such a group of people in this age. He needs such Christians. He needs such workers. He needs such people to serve Him. Apart from this, God cannot gain the earth.</p>
<p>The church is not built up just by speaking messages. The church is built up in those who contact God, fellowship with God, and allow God to saturate and flow through them for His expression. Such ones live in the Holy of Holies, touch the throne of God, and allow the living water from the throne to flow through them and be expressed in order to bear God&rsquo;s authority. Such a living spontaneously and practically builds up the church as a corporate entity in the life of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GAINING PRIESTS IN EVERY AGE</h2>
<p>From the time God created man, He has been able to gain some who serve as priests in every age; that is, He has gained some who draw near to Him, allow Him to fill and saturate them, and express Him, bearing His image and representing His authority. These royal priests included Abel (Gen. 4:4), Enoch (5:22), and Noah (6:8-9). Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and Moses also were such persons. Moses is a prime example of one who served as a priest. He fellowshipped with God on Mount Sinai for forty days (Exo. 24:15-18). He drew near to God, lived before God, and allowed God to saturate him; God&rsquo;s glory shined through him. When he came out from the presence of God, his face reflected God&rsquo;s glory (34:29, 35). At the same time, he was full of God&rsquo;s authority and manifested the reality of the kingship.</p>
<p>Daniel was a prophet, but with him there was also a significant measure of the priesthood. He prayed and lived before God (Dan. 6:10). He thoroughly fellowshipped with God, and God was able to flow through him freely. Consequently, he was full of God&rsquo;s authority. Even though he was thrown into a lions&rsquo; den, his authority shut the lions&rsquo; mouth (vv. 16-22). Daniel was a priest of God as well as a king of God.</p>
<p>As New Testament apostles, Peter, James, and John were also priests. They came forward to God to pray, saying, &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo; (Acts 6:4). They were priests before God. Although they were unlearned fishermen from Galilee, they also exercised kingly authority when they stood up and spoke (1:15; 2:14). They were priests expressing God, and they were kings representing God.</p>
<p>Even when Paul and Silas were put in prison, their prayer and singing made their prison like the Holy of Holies (16:19-25). Even in prison they fulfilled their function as priests. Furthermore, Paul truly had the standing of a king when he stood and made his defense before King Agrippa, who was only an earthly authority; those who were judging Paul were instead judged by him (26:1-29). It is amazing that a man being judged could judge the judges. This shows that he was full of God&rsquo;s authority. He was a priest with kingly authority.</p>
<p>Throughout the ages, God is after people who can be priests to bear His image and kings to exercise His authority. God desires to gain priestly kings and kingly priests.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EMPHASIZING PREACHING TOO MUCH</h2>
<p>In Christianity today too much emphasis is placed on the function of the prophet, a preacher of the word. Stanza 4 of <em>Hymns,</em> #848 says, &ldquo;Through the weakness of their spirits / Preaching doth predominate.&rdquo; This describes today&rsquo;s abnormal situation in which the function of preachers, as ministers of the word, is dominant among Christians. I am heavily burdened because God desires priests and kings for the fulfillment of His purpose. Prophets are supplementary in this regard. In the Old Testament, prophets were not needed when the condition of God&rsquo;s people was normal. They were needed primarily when His people were weak, childish, foolish, and in darkness.</p>
<p>When the children of Israel came out of Egypt, Moses represented the kingship, and Aaron represented the priesthood. Among them there were no prominent prophets. Although Moses was also considered to be a prophet, his service in this capacity was far less significant than the authority that he bore for God. Moses&rsquo; sister, Miriam, also was a prophetess, but her function did not compare to the priesthood of Aaron and the kingship of Moses.</p>
<p>This does not mean that there is no place for prophets or ministers of the word in the church. It means that the prophethood is supplementary and remedial. In the Old Testament the prophets were needed when the children of Israel were in desolate situations. Elijah and Elisha were raised up to speak to the children of Israel when the temple was closed, the priestly service had ceased, and the kings were in disarray. When David lived properly before God, there was no need for prophets, but when David stumbled, there was a need for Nathan and Gad to serve as prophets (2 Sam. 12:7-15; 24:10-14). When David committed a sin, a prophet was needed. When he had a problem, the remedy came through a prophet.</p>
<p>Today all the churches are looking for ministers of the word. This situation is not normal. Some responsible ones in the local churches say, &ldquo;We are good in every respect except for the lack of ministers of the word.&rdquo; The fact that we are looking for ministers of the word proves that we are not as good as we think. When the standard of the kingship in the church is not adequate and the function of the priesthood is lacking, the need for ministers of the word is not a positive development. If there is a manifestation of kingly authority and priestly function among all the saints, there is much less of a need for ministers of the word. From beginning to end, the Bible speaks of God&rsquo;s desire that man would be a priestly king. Everyone in the church should be a priest. If every brother and sister in a local church is a priest who draws near to God, is saturated with God, and allows God to flow through, there would be much less of a need for ministers of the word.</p>
<p>In a certain district meeting, there are many college-age brothers and sisters, and for a period of time, their meetings were quite low. They all felt that they needed more leading in the word. However, in a meeting with these young people, I said, &ldquo;You need to rise up to serve and function in the meetings.&rdquo; The young saints received this word and responded in a very positive way. Their district meetings quickly changed in a positive manner because these young saints began to function in the meetings. In the meetings they pray one after another, and the elderly saints have to exercise to follow them. Since they have risen up to be priests, I do not believe that there has been much thought about the need for ministers of the word because there is no lack in their meetings.</p>
<p>Before speaking of spiritual gifts in 1 Corinthians 12, Paul said that the Gentiles serve dumb idols (v. 2). Idols are dumb, and the more a person worships idols, the less he speaks. Then, in contrast, Paul said that the God whom we serve is a speaking God; He is not dumb (v. 3). When God inspires us, we sing a song. When God inspires us more, we shout Hallelujah. When God inspires us even more, we declare, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; Our worship of the Lord should not be in silence. We should speak, sing, pray, and even shout. Most of the gifts in 1 Corinthians 12 are related to the utterance of words, such as speaking in tongues and speaking words of wisdom, words of knowledge, and words of prophesying (vv. 8, 10). These are types of speaking.</p>
<p>If we truly fulfill our priesthood by praying, drawing near to God, fellowshipping with God, and allowing God to flow through us every day, it will not be possible for us to be silent and inactive when we come to a meeting. If we open our mouths in the meeting and pray in the meeting, the meeting will not need to rely on a few individuals who speak as prophets.</p>
<p>In Christianity today the ministry of the word is too prominent, and the authority of the kingship and the function of the priesthood are not very distinct. This is the situation among us as well. Sometimes in the meeting, the saints will sit quietly without making any noise. Although it seems harsh to say, it is almost as if everyone were in a tomb. Some open their mouth at home but do not open their mouth in the meetings. In such a meeting the kingship and the priesthood are lacking, and only the ministry of the word has prominence.</p>
<p>Before we recently began to meet for the purpose of blending in spirit, the meetings would begin at seven-thirty, and some would rush to leave when it was only eight-thirty. Now the meetings can go to nine-thirty, and some saints still do not want to leave. This is because more saints are functioning as priests. Today most of God&rsquo;s children have lost God&rsquo;s original commission; they do not function as priests and instead rely on others as prophets to minister the word to them. In 1 Corinthians 13:8, Paul says, &ldquo;Whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless,&rdquo; but Revelation 22:3-5 tells us that the priesthood and kingship are eternal. When the Lord Jesus comes again, the need for prophets will pass away, but the overcoming saints will be priests and co-kings with Christ for eternity. In the New Jerusalem everyone will be a priest serving God and a king reigning with Him. When the people of God are childish, full of problems, and weak, there is a need for prophets to minister the word, but when the people are strong, bright, and mature, there is not much need for prophets.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
