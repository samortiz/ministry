<h2 class="head1">DETAILS CONCERNING<br />THE HIGH AND DREADFUL WHEELS</h2><p>Let us now proceed to consider a number of details concerning the high and dreadful wheels.</p><h2 class="head2">The Wheels Being at the Side<br />of the Faces of the Living Creatures</h2><p>The wheels were at the side of the faces of the living creatures (Ezek. 1:15). This indicates that if we would have the Lord&rsquo;s move, we must first live out the Lord, expressing Him. If we live out the expression of Christ, we will have the wheel of the Lord&rsquo;s move.</p><h2 class="head1">The Wheels Being upon the Earth</h2><p>In verse 15 we are told that the wheels are upon the earth. Do not expect that the move of the Lord will be in the heavens. God has angels to carry out His move in the heavens. What He needs is a move on earth. God needs a move in the United States and in many other countries.</p><h2 class="head1">The Wheels Having the Appearance of Beryl</h2><p>Verse 16a says, &ldquo;The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the color of a beryl.&rdquo; According to Daniel 10:6 beryl was the appearance of the Lord when He was moving. This indicates that within the move of the wheels is the appearance of the Lord. Wherever the wheel goes it brings the appearance of the Lord. If the wheel moves to a certain place, it will bring the appearance of the Lord to that place. If a wheel is with you at school or at work, it will bring the Lord&rsquo;s appearance there. Others will be able to see the beryl, the appearance of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">The Wheels Having the Same Appearance</h2><p>Verse 16b says, &ldquo;They four had one likeness.&rdquo; Here we are told that all four wheels have the same appearance, the same likeness. This indicates that the move of the Lord has the same likeness and appearance in every church. All the moves bear the same appearance of the Lord. Therefore, the likeness of all the wheels is the same.</p><p>If the church in one locality has a likeness, an appearance, which is different from the likeness of the church in another locality, something is wrong. The saints in a particular church may think that they need to build up their own local distinction, that they need to build up something typically and uniquely local. This is contrary to Ezekiel 1, where we are told that all four wheels bear the same likeness.</p><p>We should not think that the wheel moving in the United States should bear one appearance and that the wheel moving in other countries should bear a different appearance. In every place and in every country the wheel must bear the same appearance. This does not mean that all the churches should follow one particular church. Rather, all the local churches should be mutual followers of one another (1 Thes. 2:14).</p><h2 class="head2">The Wheels Going in Four Directions</h2><p>&ldquo;When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went&rdquo; (Ezek. 1:17). The wheels went on the four sides&mdash;in four directions&mdash;not turning as they went. This indicates a move in coordination, without any turns.</p><h2 class="head2">The Wheels Being Dreadfully High</h2><p>Ezekiel 1:18a says, &ldquo;As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful.&rdquo; Here I would point out that we should never try to make ourselves great; instead, we should be little ones. However, the wheel beside us should be so high that it is dreadful. In our locality we should not have a small wheel only a few inches in diameter. On the contrary, in our city there should be a high wheel, a wheel that is dreadfully high and that will surprise others. The wheel in every church should be so high that it is dreadful.</p>
