   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place:Kuling CONCERNING THE LAYING ON OF HANDS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is some difference between the laying on of hands and bread-breaking and baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the conversion of the three thousand and the five thousand in Acts 2 and 4 and in the outpouring of the Spirit in the house of Cornelius, the Bible does not say anything about the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is clear that through the baptism of the Holy Spirit all the members were baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Corinthians 12:13 says that all the believers have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no need to have any additional procedure, but in Samaria and Ephesus we find the laying on of hands Acts 8:14-17; 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is because those two instances were somewhat special.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Samaritans had no contact with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When some in Samaria became believers, they needed the laying on of hands to usher them into the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The disciples in Ephesus who received the laying on of hands were baptized through the baptism of John, and they had to be brought into the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hebrews 6 speaks of baptisms in the plural.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This refers to the many Jewish ordinances regarding purification.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the time Hebrews was written, the temple was still there, and many Hebrew believers were still under the influence of their Jewish background.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The same can be said about the ordinance regarding purification in Acts 21.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>CONCERNING FOOT-WASHING</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Foot-washing is a sign of Christ's humility.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is an actual practice, not just an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord's word in John 13:14 shows that He intended for His disciples to learn this lesson of humility.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a personal gesture and act cf.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1 Tim 5:10 ; it is not something done in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The same can be said about kissing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the time the Lord was on the earth, foot-washing was a common Jewish practice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Jews wore loose sandals.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When they entered a house, they first needed to wash their feet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was something that a servant would do.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is like the Chinese who offer guests a wash basin and a cup of tea before serving the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This practice is not found in other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the Lord were in China, He could have said, "I am the host.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today I am serving you towels to wash your face.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the work of a servant.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet I am doing this with the hope that you would do the same to others."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>CONCERNING THE CUP</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Concerning the cup, it is better to have one cup.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If anyone is afraid of this practice, he can drink with a straw.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>CONCERNING RECOGNIZING A CO-WORKER</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The highest test in recognizing a co-worker is whether or not one can touch him with his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to recognize men with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Unless we do this, we can easily be deceived.</S>
