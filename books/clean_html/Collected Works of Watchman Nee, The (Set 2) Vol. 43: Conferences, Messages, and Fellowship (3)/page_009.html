<h2 class="head1">THE REASON THE HOLY SPIRIT INTERRUPTED PETER</h2><p>Acts 10 shows us the first time the church preached the gospel to the Gentiles. The church had been in Jerusalem for about eight or nine years. But the gospel had only reached the region between Samaria and Jerusalem; it had not reached the Gentile places yet. The Jews thought, "We are Christians, but we are also Jews. To be a Christian is to believe in Christ, to have our sins forgiven, to have God as our righteousness, and to have Jesus Christ as our Savior and Lord. But at the same time, we are also Jews; we cannot associate with the Gentiles." In the eyes of the Jews, the Gentiles are a filthy and unclean people. But in Christ there is no difference between Gentiles and Jews (Eph. 3:6). If a person wants to be a Jew, he cannot be a Christian believer at the same time. If he wants to a Christian believer, he cannot be a Jew. The believers at that time did not know this; therefore, they brought the Jewish element into the church. God first showed Peter that it was wrong for Christians to dissociate themselves from the Gentiles. Peter, however, only went to the Gentile house reluctantly. Peter thought that if he went to a Gentile home, he had already done them a great favor. He did not know that the Holy Spirit would grant a greater favor to the Gentiles. The Bible says that while Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word (Acts 10:44). Up until this time the thought had never occurred to Peter that the Holy Spirit would descend upon the Gentiles just as He descended on the Jews at Pentecost. Peter could not go on speaking. The Holy Spirit was showing Peter that the grace God gave to the Gentiles was exactly the same as that which had been given to the Jews.</p><p>The Holy Spirit descended on the Jews as well as on the Gentiles. This is the salvation of Christ. This is the church. In the church there is no difference between Jews and Gentiles. How is the church today? Are there any distinctions between male and female, master and slave, educated and uneducated, rich and poor, Chinese and foreigners? I thank God that we are neither the Chinese Christian Church nor the Anglican Church. The Lord says that in the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew, slave and free man, noble and lowly, rich and poor, respectable and despised (Col. 3:11). In the church we are all brothers and we are all members of the Body of Christ (Matt. 23:8; 1 Cor. 12:12-13).</p><p>In Kumming I said to some, "If you have the Chinese you do not have the church; if you have the church you cannot have the Chinese. There is absolutely no such thing as a Chinese Church." After the First World War, several British brothers went to Germany. They were introduced as "British brothers." Right away they made a correction, saying, "We are not British brothers; we are brothers from Britain."</p><p>Several months ago I was holding some meetings in Kaifeng. Many important government officials were saved. Afterward, a group of people said, "We cannot go to an ordinary church because the people there do not dress well and the preaching is not that sophisticated." One of the saved officials said, "We should build a big hall and invite a high-class preacher to preach. Then the high-ranking personnel from the party, the administration, and the army can come." I asked them, "What sign would you hang on the outside of the hall?" While they were considering, I said, "You could hang a sign with the words The Christian Church of the Officials. They said that they could not do this. I said, "Why not? That is what your words suggested." I then spoke a very frank word to them: "Outside of the church, you are over the common people, among whom I am one. But in the church there is no difference between officials and common people." This is like what we see here today. All those who are in Christ are brothers. There is no difference in rank or position. Everyone who believes in the Lord receives the same redemption by the precious blood and the same life. If there is the church, there cannot be officials. If there are officials, there cannot be the church. Our church is not an anti-Western church; neither is it a special establishment for a special class of people. Some have asked me whether it is proper to establish a women's church. If there is the church, there are no females. If there are females, there is no church. There cannot be a women's church. The church is established for all those who are redeemed by the precious blood of Christ and who have received the life of the Son of God.</p><p>Thank God for interrupting Peter's speaking three times. Through these interruptions we see what the Christian faith is and what the church is. On the Mount of Transfiguration, the Father interrupted Peter's speaking after a few sentences. Inside the house at Capernaum, Christ interrupted his speaking even before he began. In the house of Cornelius, Peter gave a long message, and then the Holy Spirit interrupted his speaking. These three interruptions by the Triune God are very much related to the salvation of Christ and the church. The content of the salvation of Christ and the church is just Christ Himself. The law and the prophets cannot be brought into the picture. The salvation of Christ and the church stands on the fact that Jesus the Nazarene is the Son of God. The Son of God is the only foundation of the church. In the church of Christ there is no difference among races and ranks. The church includes all those who are redeemed by the precious blood of Christ and who have received the life of the Son of God. If any one of these three items is missing, we lose the salvation of Christ and the church of Christ. Therefore, God would not listen to man's speaking. God wants man to listen to Him. God wants man to listen to the speaking of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
