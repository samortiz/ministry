An organism is an entity that is living. Christ is the embodiment of God, and this God needs a living organism. This organism is the Body of Christ, which is also called the new man (Eph. 2:14-16).</P><P>However, another entity has existed on this earth for nearly two thousand years, an entity that is called Christianity. Christianity cares for a religion, an "anity"; it does not care for God's organism. Within every human being there is a seeking after God. In every man created by God there is something hidden, that is, the desire to seek God. If we contact people in society, we will find that a great number of people like to have a good religion for them to rest on. They realize that to be a proper human being man needs a religion. Without religion man is lacking something. Religion is something on which man can rest. If man does not have a religion, he has nothing on which to rest. Thus, on the one hand, man has a heart to seek after God; on the other hand, man has a need for something that can be called religion. Today's Christianity seemingly meets this need within man because it preaches God, whom human beings are seeking, and it preaches Christ as the Savior, who can be relied on as man's rest. According to the teaching of Christianity, if a person has some trouble, he has Someone, a Savior, to whom he can go. Furthermore, he has a place, a "church" or a cathedral with a good teacher and a good choir, in which he can rest.</P><P>At the time of their wedding a number of young couples do not care for religion. However, after living together for two or three years, they both realize that they need a religion. Hence, they consider joining a proper religion. Many of these couples are knowledgeable and highly educated. After comparing the different religions, many choose Christianity. Fairly speaking, Christianity is the top religion. After talking among themselves, many couples choose to go to an attractive "church" or cathedral where there is an interesting pastor, a good choir, and pleasant people as a congregation. It is easy to attract people into such a religion, especially in a wealthy and highly developed country like the United States. However, I would like to impress you with the fact that this is altogether against the Bible. Even the way those in Christianity preach God and Christ is far off from the Bible. The focus of the Bible is to gain an organism for God, that is, to gain a Body for Christ.</P><P>Every believer is a member not of a club, a society, or a religion, but of Christ's Body. The membership of the believers in the Body is not like the membership in an organization. Every member of the Body of Christ has the life of Christ, which is the life of the Triune God. Our membership in the Body is in this life; as long as we have this life, we are members of the Body.</P><P>Christianity has misled people into having a kind of religious life. Furthermore, it has annulled all the members of Christ, making them nearly not members of Christ but members of the religious organization. From the beginning we have never done that kind of work. For this reason, we anticipated that our work would be difficult. To make a mechanical man out of wood or steel is relatively easy, but to produce a member of Christ is not easy. What we speak is altogether heavenly; it is altogether foreign to human thought. Because of this, it is difficult to contact unbelievers. If we go to them to speak with them according to the heavenly view, they may think that this is something foreign. They may think that since they do not understand it, they do not need it, and therefore they may have no interest in what we speak.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_061.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_063.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practice of the Church Life according to the God-ordained Way &nbsp; pg 62</div><br></body></html>
