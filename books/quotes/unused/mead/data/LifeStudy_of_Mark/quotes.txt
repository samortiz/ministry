[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE ONE A WORD OF INTRODUCTION 1 Scripture Reading: Isa 42:1-4, 6-7; 49:5-7; 50:4-7; 52:13 53:12; Mark 10:45
[2]  Mark is not as profound as the Gospel of John, and it does not contain as many teachings as are found in the Gospel of Matthew.
[3]  In these three Gospels we see different aspects of Christ in His humanity: the Lord s humanity in being the King Matthew , the Lord s humanity in being a man who is up to standard Luke , and the Lord s humanity in being a Slave Mark .
[4]  Mark does not record very much of the Lord s teaching.
[5]  Mark also does not intend to impress us with the Slave s wonderful words as Matthew does with His marvelous teachings and parables concerning the heavenly kingdom, and John with His profound revelations of divine truths , but he impresses us with His excellent deeds in His gospel service, providing more detail than the other Gospels, in order to portray the Slave-Savior s diligence, faithfulness, and other virtues in the saving service He rendered to sinners for God.
[6]  This message is a continuation of the introductory word in our Life-study of the Gospel of Mark.
[7]  We have seen that this Gospel portrays the excellency of Christ s virtues in His humanity as a Slave.
[8]  The Gospel of John presents Christ as the God-Savior, the Gospel of Matthew presents Him as the King-Savior, and the Gospel of Luke presents Him as the Man-Savior.
[9]  Isaiah 49:7 says, Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers.
[10]  According to this verse, the Lord Jesus was despised by man, He was abhorred by the nation, and He was the Slave of rulers.
[11]  From Isaiah 50:4 we see that as the Slave of God the Lord was given the tongue of the instructed: The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.
[12]  According to Isaiah 53:7, the Lord did not open His mouth when He was oppressed and afflicted: He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.
[13]  This means that when the Lord was brought to the cross, he was like a sheep dumb before the shearers.
[14]  Then verse 10 goes on to say, Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.
[15]  From these verses we see that God laid on Him the iniquity of us all, bruised Him, put Him to grief, and made His soul a trespass offering.
[16]  In Philippians 2:5-11 we have the word of the Apostle Paul concerning Christ as the Slave of God.
[17]  Here we see that the Lord not only existed with God, but subsisted in the form of God.
[18]  LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE THREE THE BEGINNING OF THE GOSPEL
[19]  AND THE INITIATION OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR 1 Scripture Reading: Mark 1:1-13
[20]  The compound title Jesus Christ, the Son of God denotes the Lord s humanity as Jesus Christ and His deity as the Son of God.
[21]  Both the Lord s humanity and His deity were adequately expressed by His human virtues and divine attributes in His ministry and His move for His gospel service, as recorded in the Gospel of Mark.
[22]  As one who signified the termination of the old dispensation with the old culture and religion, John the Baptist preached a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.
[23]  Repentance is to change the mind, turning it to the Slave-Savior, and baptism is to bury the repenting people, terminating them, for the Slave-Savior to germinate them by regeneration John 3:3, 5-6 .
[24]  Mark 1:5 says, And all the country of Judea went out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
[25]  It is through baptism in such a water and in such a Spirit that the believers in Christ are regenerated into the kingdom of God, into the realm of the divine life and the divine rule John 3:3, 5 , that they may live by the eternal life of God in His eternal kingdom.
[26]  Mark 1:9 says, And it came about in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.
[27]  Therefore, the Lord s baptism indicates that He would not live, speak, or do anything by Himself, but would live by God, walk by God, and minister by God.
[28]  If you consult the outline of the Gospel of Mark printed in the Recovery Version, you will see that this Gospel is composed of six main sections: the beginning of the gospel and the initiation of the Slave-Savior 1:1-13 ; the ministry of the Slave-Savior for the spreading of the gospel 1:14 10:52 ; the preparation of the Slave-Savior for His redemptive service 11:1 14:42 ; the death and resurrection of the Slave-Savior for the accomplishment of God s redemption 14:43 16:18 ; the ascension of the Slave-Savior for His exaltation 16:19 ; and the Slave-Savior s universal spreading of the gospel through His disciples 16:20 .
[29]  The first item in the Slave-Savior s gospel service was to preach the gospel.
[30]  We have pointed out that the Lord s preaching always implied teaching, and His teaching implied preaching.
[31]  In the same principle, when we teach the truth, we should also preach.
[32]  The gospel was planned, promised, and accomplished by God Eph 1:8-9; Acts 2:23; Rom 1:2; 2 Cor 5:21; Acts 3:15 , and it is the power of God unto salvation to all believers Rom 1:16 , that they may be reconciled to God 2 Cor 5:19 and regenerated by Him 1 Pet 1:3 to be His children John 1:12-13; Rom 8:16 and enjoy all His riches and blessings as their inheritance Eph 1:14 .
[33]  In 1:23-28 we have a case of the casting out of demons.
[34]  A man with an unclean spirit cried out, and the Lord Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet, and come out of him! vv.
[35]  The Slave-Savior came to destroy the works of Satan 1 John 3:8 , and the third thing He did as a part of His service to God was to cast out these demons from the possessed people Mark 1:34, 39; 3:15; 6:7, 13; 16:17 so that they might be delivered from Satan s bondage Luke 13:16 , out of Satan s authority of darkness Acts 26:18; Col 1:13 , into God s kingdom Mark 1:15 .
[36]  In 1:40-45 we have the case of the cleansing of a leper.
[37]  Verse 40 says, And a leper comes to Him, entreating Him, and falling on his knees says to Him, If You are willing, You can cleanse me!
[38]  CARRIED OUT HIS GOSPEL SERVICE 1 Scripture Reading: Mark 2:1-12 A GROUP OF FIVE INCIDENTS
[39]  The five incidents recorded vividly in 2:1 3:6 form one particular group, showing how the Slave-Savior as the Slave of God carried out His gospel service to care for the need of fallen people, who were captured by Satan from God and the enjoyment of God.
[40]  Thus, He annulled the practice of the disciples of John the new religionists and the Pharisees the old religionists , so that His followers might be delivered from the practices of their religion into the enjoyment of God s Christ as their Bridegroom, with His righteousness as their outer clothing and His life as their inner wine in God s New Testament economy 2:18-22 .
[41]  FORGIVING THE SINS OF THE SICK A Sinner Paralyzed by Sin
[42]  While the Lord was in a house at Capernaum, speaking the word to those who were gathered together, a paralytic carried by four men was brought to Him 2:1-3 .
[43]  This paralytic signifies a sinner paralyzed by sin, one who is unable to walk and move before God.
[44]  Mark 2:4 says, And not being able to bring him to Him because of the crowd, they removed the roof where He was; and having dug through, they lowered the bed on which the paralytic was lying.
[45]  According to verses 6 and 7, when the scribes heard this word, they were reasoning in their hearts: But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, Why is this man speaking this way?
[46]  Scribes and Pharisees, as the proponents of the old and dead religion, were motivated and used by Satan, the enemy of God, to oppose, resist, and frustrate the gospel service of the Slave of God throughout all His ministry 2:16, 24; 3:22; 7:5; 8:11; 9:14; 10:2; 11:27; 12:13, 28 .
[47]  In this incident we see both the humanity and the deity of the Slave-Savior.
[48]  When the Lord referred to the paralytic as a child, the Lord conducted Himself in a very human manner.
[49]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that in 2:1 3:6 five incidents are recorded to show how the Slave-Savior as the Slave of God carried out His gospel service to care for the need of fallen people: forgiving the sins of the sick 2:1-12 , feasting with sinners 2:13-17 , causing His followers to be merry without fasting 2:18-22 , caring for His followers hunger rather than for religion s regulation 2:23-28 , and caring for the relief of the suffering one rather than for the ritual of religion 3:1-6 .
[50]  Verse 15 indicates that Matthew not only followed the Lord, but also prepared a great feast for Him: And it came about that He reclined at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners were reclining at the table with Jesus and His disciples, for there were many, and they followed Him.
[51]  The fourth incident, recorded in 2:23-28, is that of the Lord s caring for His followers hunger rather than for religion s regulation.
[52]  Mark 2:23 and 24 say, And it came about that He passed through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to make their way, picking the ears of grain.
[53]  Let us now go on to consider 2:18-22 in more detail.
[54]  As we have pointed out, following the incident of the Lord s feasting with tax collectors and sinners, the disciples of John, the new-time religionists, and the disciples of the Pharisees, the old-time religionists, asked the Lord why His disciples did not fast.
[55]  LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE TEN THE WAYS THE SLAVE-SAVIOR
[56]  In this message we shall continue to consider the ways the Slave-Savior carried out His gospel service.
[57]  According to 2:23-28, He cared for His followers hunger rather than for religion s regulation, and according to 3:1-6 He cared for the relief of the suffering one rather than for the ritual of religion.
[58]  In verse 28 we have a strong display of who the Lord is: So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.
[59]  This indicates the Slave-Savior s deity in His humanity.
[60]  He, the Son of Man, was the very God who ordained the Sabbath, and He had the right to change what He had ordained concerning the Sabbath.
[61]  The Lord Jesus indicated to the condemning Pharisees that He was the real David, the King of the coming kingdom of God, and also the Lord of the Sabbath.
[62]  In 2:1-12 we have the case of a paralytic, the case of someone fully paralyzed.
[63]  Although the Lord sought to avoid the crowd, He wanted the sincere ones to be able to touch Him.
[64]  If we are simply part of the crowd, we shall not receive anything from the Lord.
[65]  We need to learn of the Lord not to carry out our ministry by ourselves.
[66]  LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE TWELVE THE SLAVE-SAVIOR S AUXILIARY ACTS
[67]  In 3:7-35 we see five auxiliary acts for the Slave-Savior s gospel service: averting the crowd s pressing vv.
[68]  In 3:31-35 we see the fifth auxiliary act for the Slave-Savior s gospel service: not remaining in the relationship of the natural life but in that of the spiritual life.
[69]  Mark 3:31 and 32 say, And His mother and His brothers came, and standing outside they sent to Him, calling Him.
[70]  Through His gospel service the Slave-Savior was making the believing sinners His spiritual relatives, those who became His many brothers Rom 8:29; Heb 2:11 in the house of God Heb 3:5 and His many members for the building up of His mystical Body Eph 5:30; 1 Cor 12:12 to do the will of God.
[71]  LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE PARABLES OF THE KINGDOM 1 Scripture Reading: Mark 4:1-34
[72]  In this message we come to chapter four of the Gospel of Mark, a crucial chapter concerning the kingdom of God.
[73]  Following this, in 3:7-35 we have five auxiliary acts for the gospel service: averting the crowd s pressing, appointing the apostles to preach, not eating because of the urgent need, binding Satan and plundering his house by the Holy Spirit, and not remaining in the relationship of the natural life but in that of the spiritual life.
[74]  In the preaching of the gospel, the kingdom of God is often neglected.
[75]  Much of today s gospel preaching gives people the impression that the gospel is only for soul winning, for transferring people out of hell into heaven, for helping people have peace, joy, and eternal blessing.
[76]  Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 . Peter recognized the Lord as the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[77]  LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE PARABLES OF THE KINGDOM 2 Scripture Reading: Mark 4:1-34
[78]  The word kingdom, no doubt, denotes some kind of ruling.
[79]  To say that we are practicing the kingdom life means that we are under God s ruling.
[80]  In this message I am not concerned with a verse-by-verse study of 4:1-34, nor even with a study of the different parables.
[81]  My burden is that we may see what the kingdom of God is.
[82]  This gospel is actually the God-man, Jesus Christ, sown into us as a life seed, a seed which is the seed of the kingdom.
[83]  If we say that in the Lord s recovery we are practicing the kingdom life, we need to realize that this kingdom is not something of organization.
[84]  LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE PARABLES OF THE KINGDOM 3 Scripture Reading: Mark 4:1-34
[85]  As we have pointed out, it is not the intention of this Gospel to give us a record of the Slave-Savior s words or teaching.
[86]  Where does the church stand in this picture of the kingdom gene and its development and consummation?
[87]  In Mark 4:26-29 we have the parable of the seed.
[88]  Verse 26 says, And He said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth.
[89]  The kingdom of God is the reality of the church brought forth by the resurrection life of Christ through the gospel 1 Cor 4:15 .
[90]  This sower is the Slave-Savior, who was the Son of God coming to sow Himself as the seed of life in His word v. 14 into men s hearts so that He might grow and live in them and be expressed from within them.
[91]  The casting of the seed here indicates that the kingdom of God, which is the issue and goal of the Slave-Savior s gospel, and of the church in this age Rom 14:17 , are a matter of life, the life of God, which sprouts, grows, bears fruit, matures, and produces a harvest.
[92]  LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE CHURCH AND THE KINGDOM Scripture Reading: Mark 4:26-29; Matt 16:16-19; 1 Cor 3:9b; Rev 14:4, 14-16
[93]  In the foregoing messages we have covered the kingdom of God as revealed in chapter four of the Gospel of Mark.
[94]  In particular, we have paid attention to the seed of the kingdom as the intrinsic element of the kingdom.
[95]  Because the Father s revelation concerning Christ is only the first half of this great mystery, the Lord went on to speak concerning the church: And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church v. 18 . This indicates strongly that the church must be something of Christ and for Christ.
[96]  Although the church is clearly mentioned in Matthew 16, nothing is said concerning the church in the Gospel of Mark.
[97]  In chapter four, in particular, the Lord speaks concerning the kingdom of God.
[98]  And He said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth v. 26 . This parable reveals that the kingdom is a matter of life, which sprouts, grows, bears fruit, matures, and produces a harvest.
[99]  Because the rebellion was subdued, the Slave-Savior and His disciples came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes 5:1 .
[100]  This is strong evidence that Mark s Gospel, as a biography of the Slave of God, emphasizes His work instead of His word and gives more details than the other Gospels.
[101]  Mark 5:28 and 29 say, For she said, If I may touch even His garments, I shall be healed.
[102]  And immediately, Jesus realizing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, turned around in the crowd and said, Who touched My garments? v. 30 . The Lord had the inner sense that His virtue, His power, had gone out of Him and had been transfused into someone else.
[103]  LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE MOVE OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR S
[104]  Immediately after the Lord did the wonderful work of bringing in the blessings of the kingdom, He came to His own country.
[105]  Mark 6:1 says, And He went out from there and came into His own country, and His disciples followed Him.
[106]  The Lord Jesus then said to them, A prophet is not dishonored except in his own country and among his relatives and in his own house v. 4 . This word indicates that probably even some of the Lord s own household joined in with the others to despise and reject Him.
[107]  LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE NINETEEN THE MOVE OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR S
[108]  In the foregoing message we saw that in 6:1-6 the Slave-Savior was despised by the Nazarenes, and that in 6:7-13 He sent out the twelve to preach.
[109]  We pointed out that just as the twelve preached, cast out demons, and anointed the sick, we today need to preach the gospel, present the truth in order to cast out demons, and minister life to others by anointing them with our testimonies of the experience of Christ.
[110]  After the forerunner of the gospel was martyred, the Slave-Savior said to His disciples, Come you yourselves privately to a place in the wilderness and rest a while v. 31 . In order to rest, they went away in the boat to a place in the wilderness privately.
[111]  The church life is portrayed by the pictures in 4:35 5:43 and 6:1-44.
[112]  In Mark we have a record that is according to the sequence of events that took place in the life of the Lord Jesus.
[113]  We believe that it was according to God s sovereignty that everything that happened in the Lord s life took place in a particular order and in a progressive way.
[114]  The Lord said to the Pharisees and scribes, Isaiah prophesied rightly concerning you, hypocrites, as it is written, This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far away from Me; and in vain they are worshipping Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men vv.
[115]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that in chapter seven the opposition of the Pharisees and scribes gave the Lord Jesus an excellent opportunity to expose man s inward condition, the condition of man s heart.
[116]  In 7:15 the Lord said to the crowd, There is nothing outside of a man which entering into him can defile him, but the things coming out of a man are the things which defile a man.
[117]  We need to be impressed with the fact that the Lord did not speak of these things in a careless way.
[118]  On the contrary, knowing man s inward situation, He speaks in a careful way of what proceeds out of man s heart.
[119]  If we study 7:1-23 carefully, we shall see that the Lord s word here actually covers all of the Ten Commandments.
[120]  The Lord even uses the word commandment in verse 8: Leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men.
[121]  Then in verse 9 He goes on to say, You nicely set aside the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.
[122]  As we study this portion of Mark, we see that here the Lord s word is concerned with the worship of God.
[123]  LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO THE MOVE OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR S
[124]  No doubt, whatever the Lord experienced was sovereign, for God arranged the environment so that the Lord would experience certain things in His earthly life.
[125]  We have also seen that, in chapter four, the Lord Jesus gave a strong word concerning the intrinsic element of the kingdom of God.
[126]  Because this Syrophoenician woman was such a Gentile, the Lord Jesus said to her, Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the children s bread and throw it to the little dogs v. 27 . Here the Lord seemed to be saying to her, As a Gentile, you are a little dog, and I cannot throw the children s bread to you.
[127]  In my study of the Greek word for dispensation oikonomia , I have learned that this word comes from a root that means to distribute food.
[128]  Let us read verse 27 again: And He said to her, Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the children s bread and throw it to the little dogs.
[129]  In verse 28 we have the answer of the Syrophoenician woman: Yes, Lord, but even the little dogs under the table eat of the little children s crumbs.
[130]  In this section of the Gospel of Mark five matters are covered: the healing of a deaf and dumb man 7:31-37 , the feeding of four thousand 8:1-9 , not giving a sign to the Pharisees 8:10-13 , warning the disciples concerning the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod 8:14-21 , and the healing of a blind man in Bethsaida 8:22-26 .
[131]  The Slave-Savior s thrusting His fingers into the deaf one s ears signifies His dealing with his hearing organ see Isa 50:4-5; Job 33:14-16 , and His touching of his tongue with His spittle signifies His anointing the dumb one s speaking organ with the word that proceeds out of His mouth.
[132]  The healing of the deaf and dumb man follows the record concerning the Lord as the children s bread.
[133]  This indicates that after we enjoy the Lord s feeding, we need further healing.
[134]  After the feeding of the four thousand, the Pharisees came out and began discussing with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, tempting Him 8:11 .
[135]  Groaning in His spirit, the Lord Jesus said, Why does this generation seek a sign?
[136]  This portion of the Gospel of Mark may be considered the highlight of the Lord s contact with His disciples.
[137]  After Peter made the declaration that Jesus is the Christ, He warned them that they should tell no one concerning Him v. 30 . Then He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise v. 31 . Here we see that after the revelation of the mystery concerning Christ, we have the revelation of the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ.
[138]  In order for Him to fulfill God s purpose, Christ had to go to the religious center, pass through crucifixion, and enter into resurrection.
[139]  In verse 31 the Lord opened up some of the mysteries of God s economy concerning Himself as the Christ, the anointed One of God.
[140]  After Peter saw the vision concerning Jesus the Nazarene being the Christ, the Lord went on to unveil the fact that He, God s anointed One, is the Son of Man.
[141]  In verse 33 the Lord said specifically that Peter was not setting his mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.
[142]  In 8:34 the Lord Jesus says, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. In the foregoing message we pointed out that to come after the Lord is to gain Him, experience Him, enjoy Him, and partake of Him.
[143]  If we would come after the Lord in this way, we need to deny ourselves, take up our cross, and follow Him.
[144]  In 8:35 the Lord goes on to say, For whoever wants to save his soul life will lose it, but whoever will lose his soul life for My sake and the gospel s shall save it.
[145]  In this verse the Lord speaks about the soul life, whereas in the preceding verse He speaks about the self.
[146]  In verse 35 the Lord speaks of losing the soul life for His sake and the gospel s. Many readers of the Gospel of Mark misinterpret the Lord s word about losing our soul life for His sake and the gospel s. Some may say, The words for My sake mean for the Lord s purpose and glory.
[147]  After the unveiling of Christ s Person and His death and resurrection, the Lord went on to say in 9:1, Truly I tell you, there are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the kingdom of God come in power.
[148]  In 8:27 9:13 we have a revelation of the mystery of the Lord s Person and His death and resurrection.
[149]  We should not regard the Gospel of Mark merely as a book of stories.
[150]  This Gospel is a record showing us how the Lord Jesus as the Slave-Savior serves sinners.
[151]  This service begins in chapter one and continues into chapter seven, where the Lord exposes the condition of man s heart.
[152]  Peter, in particular, did not understand, and he went so far as to rebuke the Lord v. 32 . Then the Lord rebuked Peter, saying, Go away, behind Me, Satan, because you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men! v. 33 . The Lord went on to say, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me v. 34 . Do you know what it means to deny ourselves? To deny ourselves is to be replaced by Christ.
[153]  In the foregoing message we saw that in 8:27 9:13 we have a revelation of Christ with His death and resurrection as the universal replacement for everything that is not God Himself.
[154]  Mark 9:14-50 is actually a practicing of the revelation of Christ as our replacement.
[155]  The disciples may have had some understanding after their failure to cast out the demon that prayer is a matter of not I but Christ, that prayer implies that we deny ourselves and realize that we are nothing, that we can do nothing, and that we need to be replaced by Christ.
[156]  In order to be replaced by Him, we need to pray that the Lord will come in and be everything to us.
[157]  As we pointed out in the foregoing message, in verse 38 John said to the Lord Jesus, Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name who does not follow us, and we forbade him, because he was not following us.
[158]  This is proved by the Lord s response in verse 39: Do not forbid him, for there is no one who shall do a work of power in My name and be able soon to speak evil of Me. Here we see the Slave-Savior s tolerance, in the practice of the gospel service, toward His believers who were different from those closer to Him.
[159]  Verse 43 says, And if your hand stumbles you, cut it off; it is better for you to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go away into Gehenna, into unquenchable fire.
[160]  We need to understand 9:38-50 in the light of the vision given in 8:27 9:13 concerning Christ, His death, and His resurrection.
[161]  Apart from that vision, we do not have the way to understand this section of the Gospel of Mark.
[162]  The Lord s reply in verse 39 must have come as a great surprise to John: Do not forbid him, for there is no one who shall do a work of power in My name and be able soon to speak evil of Me. Here the Lord Jesus was saying to John, You should not forbid him.
[163]  Some Christians may be greatly surprised to hear that a believer may be cast into unquenchable fire.
[164]  In 9:50, which is the Lord s concluding word in this section, we see the real significance of this portion of Mark.
[165]  In this verse the Lord says, Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltness, with what will you restore its saltness?
[166]  We have emphasized the fact that 9:38-40 begins with John s word about forbidding someone to cast out demons in the Lord s name, because he did not follow the disciples.
[167]  In this message I would also like to impress you with two maxims uttered by the Lord Jesus, the first in Matthew 12:30 and the second in Mark 9:40.
[168]  This maxim speaks of outward formality in practice regarding those who are not against the Lord v. 39 . According to verse 38, someone was casting out demons in the name of the Lord Jesus, although he was not following the disciples who were close to the Lord.
[169]  In verse 1 we have a word concerning the Lord s coming to Judea.
[170]  Mark 10:1 says, And rising up from there, He comes into the district of Judea and beyond the Jordan; and again crowds came together to Him, and again, as He was accustomed, He taught them.
[171]  AND COMING BACK TO THE PURE WORD OF GOD
[172]  Although the scribes were dedicated to the study of the Scriptures, they did not see from chapter nine of Daniel the year that the Messiah would be cut off, put to death.
[173]  The teaching concerning riches in 10:17-31 is also related to the kingdom of God.
[174]  For example, in verse 24 the Lord says, Children, how difficult it is to enter into the kingdom of God!
[175]  Then in verse 25 the Lord goes on to say, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
[176]  These verses indicate that what we have in 10:17-31 is not merely a story for children; what we have here is a serious word concerning the kingdom of God.
[177]  In verse 26 we see the disciples response to the Lord s word about entering into the kingdom of God: But they were even more astounded and said among themselves, Then who can be saved?
[178]  Here we see that although the Lord was teaching about entering into the kingdom of God, the disciples minds were occupied with the matter of being saved.
[179]  In verses 29 and 30 we have the Lord s reply: Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for My sake and for the gospel s sake but that he shall receive a hundred times as much now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions, and in the coming age, eternal life.
[180]  In this portion of the Gospel of Mark we have four matters: the Lord s coming to Judea v. 1 , the teaching against divorce vv.
[181]  Here the Lord s word not only recognizes God s creation of man, but also confirms God s ordination of man s marriage, that is, one male and one female to be joined and yoked together as one flesh, inseparable by man.
[182]  I have given much thought as to why the record concerning the Slave-Savior s blessing the young children vv.
[183]  As a result of my consideration, the Lord enlightened me to see that this indicates that those who are on their way to enter into the kingdom of God should not become old.
[184]  According to Mark 10:32b-34, as the Lord was going up to Jerusalem, He unveiled His death and resurrection the third time: And taking the twelve aside again, He began to tell them the things about to happen to Him: Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and they shall condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him to the Gentiles; and they shall mock Him and spit at Him, and shall scourge Him, and kill Him; and after three days He will rise.
[185]  Because the time for the Slave-Savior s death had come, He was willing to go to Jerusalem.
[186]  He went before His followers with a speed and boldness that amazed them.
[187]  This was His obedience to God unto death Phil 2:8 , according to the counsel of God Acts 2:23 , for the fulfillment of His redemptive plan Isa 53:10 .
[188]  The Lord Jesus knew that through His death He would be glorified in resurrection Luke 24:25-26 and that His divine life would be released to produce many brothers for His expression John 12:23-24; Rom 8:29 .
[189]  Therefore, God exalted Him to the heavens, seated Him at His right hand Mark 16:19; Acts 2:33-35 , gave Him the name which is above every name Phil 2:9-10 , made Him both Lord and Christ Acts 2:36 , and crowned Him with glory and honor Heb 2:9 .
[190]  On the day of Pentecost, ten days after the Lord s ascension, the Spirit, who is actually the Lord Himself, was poured out upon all those who entered into Christ s death, participated in His resurrection, and saw His ascension.
[191]  Immediately after the Lord s unveiling of His death and resurrection for the third time, James and John came to Him and said, Teacher, we desire that whatever we ask You, You will do for us v. 35 . The Lord replied, What do you want Me to do for you? And they said to Him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on Your right, and one on Your left, in Your glory vv.
[192]  The cup signifies that His death was the God-given portion for Him to take for the sinners whom He would redeem for God.
[193]  Baptism denotes that His death was the God-ordained way for Him to pass through for the accomplishment of God s redemption for sinners.
[194]  From the Lord s answer we see that those who would sit at the Lord s right and left in His glory must be prepared to drink the cup of suffering.
[195]  When James and John asked to sit at the Lord s right and left, He said to them, You do not know what you are asking.
[196]  Are you able to drink the cup which I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized? v. 38 . We have seen that both the cup and the baptism refer to the death of the Slave-Savior John 18:11; Luke 12:50 . The cup signifies that His death was the God-given portion for Him to take for the sinners whom He would redeem for God.
[197]  Baptism signifies that His death was the God-ordained way for Him to pass through for the accomplishment of redemption.
[198]  All the disciples, represented by the two sons of thunder, needed the healing of their blindness.
[199]  Mark 10:47 says, And hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and to say, Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me!
[200]  FOR HIS REDEMPTIVE SERVICE 1 Scripture Reading: Mark 11:1-26 THE CONCLUSION OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR S
[201]  In this section twenty-nine matters are covered: silencing the wind and stilling the sea 4:35-41 ; casting out a legion of demons 5:1-20 ; healing a woman with a flow of blood and raising up a dead girl 5:21-43 ; being despised by the Nazarenes 6:1-6 ; sending the twelve to preach 6:7-13 ; the martyrdom of the forerunner of the gospel 6:14-29 ; feeding the five thousand 6:30-44 ; walking on the sea 6:45-52 ; healing everywhere 6:53-56 ; teaching concerning the defiling things from within 7:1-23 ; casting a demon out of a Syrophoenician woman s daughter 7:24-30 ; healing a deaf and dumb man 7:31-37 ; feeding four thousand 8:1-9 ; not giving a sign to the Pharisees 8:10-13 ; warning concerning the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod 8:14-21 ; healing a blind man in Bethsaida 8:22-26 ; being recognized as Christ and unveiling His death and resurrection the first time 8:27 9:1 ; being transfigured on the mount 9:2-13 ; casting a dumb spirit out of a man s son 9:14-29 ; unveiling His death and resurrection the second time 9:30-32 ; teaching concerning humility 9:33-37 ; teaching concerning tolerance for unity 9:38-50 ; coming to Judea 10:1 ; teaching against divorce 10:2-12 ; blessing young children 10:13-16 ; teaching concerning the rich and the kingdom of God 10:17-31 ; going up to Jerusalem and unveiling His death and resurrection the third time 10:32-34 ; teaching concerning the way to the throne of the kingdom of God 10:35-45 ; coming to Jericho and healing blind Bartimaeus 10:46-52 .
[202]  Furthermore, if they did not enjoy the Lord by being brought into His death and resurrection, they would not be able to enter into the kingdom of God or have anything to do with the kingdom.
[203]  In the Gospel of Mark we see Peter, John, James, and other faithful ones following the Lord Jesus.
[204]  From their point of view, they were following the Lord.
[205]  But from the Lord s point of view, He was preparing them to be brought into His death and resurrection.
[206]  By the end of chapter ten, the Slave-Savior s gospel ministry had been completed.
[207]  We have seen that the ministry of the Slave-Savior included five matters as the contents of the gospel service: preaching the gospel, teaching the truth, casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the leper.
[208]  FOR HIS REDEMPTIVE SERVICE 2 Scripture Reading: Mark 11:1-26
[209]  In this message we shall continue to consider the preparation of the Slave-Savior for His redemptive service.
[210]  The matter we are emphasizing with respect to the cursing of the fig tree is that this indicates that God had determined to give up the nation of Israel and to go to another people, the church.
[211]  The church is composed of those who have been brought into the death and resurrection of Christ in order to participate in the full enjoyment of Christ.
[212]  In His preparation in Jerusalem 11:15 14:42 for His redemptive work, His major work was to confront the opposing Jewish leaders, who were supposed to be the builders of God s building 12:9-10 , but actually had been usurped by God s enemy Satan and instigated by him to plot to kill the Slave-Savior.
[213]  This paved the way for Him to point out to these blind opposers that He, the Christ, as the Son of David was the Lord of David, the very God 12:35-37 , so that they might know His deity in His humanity, that they might know that He was God living in man.
[214]  We have seen that by cursing the fig tree and cleansing the temple the Lord was making the necessary preparations for His redemptive service.
[215]  In particular, His cleansing of the temple stirred up the chief priests and the scribes, who sought how they might destroy Him v. 18 . Actually, the Lord s cleansing of the temple caused His opposers to speed up their efforts to put Him to death.
[216]  FOR HIS REDEMPTIVE SERVICE 3 Scripture Reading: Mark 11:27 12:44 BEING IN THE DEATH, RESURRECTION,
[217]  When the Lord Jesus went from Galilee to Judea, His intention was to go to Jerusalem in order to enter into His death and resurrection and also to bring His close followers with Him into His death and resurrection.
[218]  The chief priests, the scribes, and the elders the three categories of those who made up the Sanhedrin came to the Lord and said to Him, By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority that you may do these things? v. 28 . Here the chief priests, scribes, and elders seemed to be saying, You cursed the fig tree, and then you overturned the tables in the temple.
[219]  After they brought a coin to Him, He said, Whose image and inscription is this? v. 16 . When they answered, Caesar s, the Lord went on to say, The things of Caesar pay to Caesar, and the things of God to God v. 17 . To pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar s is to pay tribute to Caesar according to his governmental regulations.
[220]  We should not think that to understand the Bible it is sufficient to know the original languages of the Bible, Hebrew and Greek.
[221]  Knowing that He had answered well those who were disputing with Him, the scribe asked the Lord, Which is the first commandment of all? v. 28 . The Lord answered, The first is, Hear, Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord; and you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart, and from your whole soul, and from your whole mind, and from your whole strength vv.
[222]  In type, the Passover lamb was examined for four days before it was killed Exo 12:3-6 .
[223]  As we shall see, under God s sovereignty, the Slave-Savior was judged not only by the Jewish leaders as a sheep before the shearer Isa 53:7; Mark 14:53-65 , but also by the Roman governor, as a criminal before the accusers 14:64; 15:1-15 , that He might die to serve sinners with His life as a ransom 10:45 .
[224]  FOR HIS REDEMPTIVE SERVICE 5 Scripture Reading: Mark 11:27 12:44 FOUR KINDS OF QUESTIONS
[225]  Immediately after the Lord had subdued all the opposers and had spoken to them concerning Christ, He went on to give them a warning concerning the scribes.
[226]  Mark 12:38-40 says, Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and like greetings in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at the dinners; who devour the widows houses, and for a pretense make long prayers.
[227]  It is very significant that after the Lord subdued all the opposers, He gave a warning concerning the scribes and appraised a poor widow in her loyalty.
[228]  First, He warned His disciples to beware of the vain, empty teachings of the scribes.
[229]  He wanted them to look into the situation among God s people, not outwardly according to man s way, but inwardly according to a person s inward reality.
[230]  Before we begin to consider 13:1-37, where the Lord Jesus speaks of things to come, I would like to give a further word on chapter twelve.
[231]  In 12:35 the Lord Jesus, teaching in the temple, says, How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?
[232]  Then the Lord Jesus went on to ask how the Christ could be the son of David when David himself called Him Lord.
[233]  Preparing the disciples for His death, the Slave-Savior first told them, in chapter thirteen, the things to come.
[234]  These are the things that would take place in the world during the church age after His resurrection until the time of His coming back.
[235]  The Lord Jesus did not leave His disciples in darkness concerning the following matters: the destruction of the temple vv.
[236]  Mark 13:3 and 4 say, And as He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew questioned Him privately, Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?
[237]  The fact that the Lord was sitting with the disciples on the Mount of Olives indicates that to receive the vision of the Lord s prophecy of the things to come, we need to climb to the high mountain to enter into His presence.
[238]  We may find it surprising that at such a time the Lord Jesus had the heart to sit with His disciples on the Mount of Olives and speak to them concerning things to come.
[239]  LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FORTY THE PREPARATION OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR
[240]  In 13:1-37 the Lord prepares His disciples for His death by telling them of things to come.
[241]  The emphasis of the gospel of grace is on forgiveness of sin, God s redemption, and eternal life; the emphasis of the gospel of the kingdom is on the ruling of God and the authority of the Lord.
[242]  Jerusalem has already been destroyed more than once, and it will be destroyed again.
[243]  In 13:28-37 we have a word concerning watching, praying, and awaiting the Slave-Savior.
[244]  In this message I would like to give a further word on chapter thirteen, one of the most difficult chapters for us to understand.
[245]  Actually, this chapter is not merely a prophecy; it is also a word of preparation given by the Lord Jesus to His followers.
[246]  As we read chapter thirteen of the Gospel of Mark, we should not be distracted from the main point in this chapter.
[247]  The crucial matter here is that the Lord was telling His close followers that the entire world situation is for the producing of a new man.
[248]  This new man can be produced only through Christ s all-inclusive death and His wonderful resurrection.
[249]  If you study the account of Peter s preaching on the day of Pentecost, you will see that he emphasized the two matters of the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus.
[250]  Concerning the vision of God s economy, the crucial matter for us to see is that we need to enter into Christ s death and resurrection so that we may participate in the full enjoyment of Him as the universal replacement.
[251]  LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FORTY-TWO THE PREPARATION OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR
[252]  Then in 14:1-11 He prepares them by enjoying their love, while His opposers conspire to kill Him, and one of His disciples plots to betray Him.
[253]  Although the chief priests and the scribes wanted to kill the Lord Jesus, they said, Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar of the people v. 2 . Eventually, under God s sovereignty, they did kill the Lord Jesus at the feast Matt 27:15 for the fulfillment of the type.
[254]  The house of Simon in Bethany is a miniature of the church life.
[255]  According to this miniature, the church life is composed of cleansed lepers who love the Lord Jesus.
[256]  Those who love Him, as did Simon and as did the woman who anointed Him, take Him as their full replacement.
[257]  She has wrought a good work upon Me. For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want you can do them good; but you do not always have Me. The Lord s word, You do not always have Me, indicates that we must love the Lord and seize the opportunity to love Him.
[258]  No doubt, this woman had been brought into the death of Christ.
[259]  FOR HIS REDEMPTIVE SERVICE 10 Scripture Reading: Mark 14:12-26 A REPLACEMENT OF THE PASSOVER
[260]  After the Lord Jesus enjoyed a feast in Bethany, He partook of the feast of the Passover and then instituted His supper as a replacement of the Passover 14:12-26 .
[261]  In the history of God s economy, that was the last feast of Passover, for from that time the feast of Passover was replaced by the Lord s table.
[262]  Mark 14:22 says, And as they were eating He took bread, and blessed and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, Take; this is My body.
[263]  This was the eating of the Slave-Savior s supper after He and His followers ate the Passover feast in verses 16 through 18.
[264]  He initiated this new practice for His believers remembrance of Him to replace the Passover feast, the old testament practice of the elect s remembrance of Jehovah s salvation Exo 12:14; 13:3 .
[265]  This new practice of the new testament is to remember the Slave-Savior by eating the bread, which signifies His body given for His believers 1 Cor 11:24 , and drinking the cup, which signifies His blood shed for their sins Matt 26:28 .
[266]  The bread denotes life John 6:35 , the life of God, the eternal life, and the cup denotes blessing 1 Cor 10:16 , which is God Himself as their portion Psa 16:5 .
[267]  Such bread and such a cup are the constituents of the Slave-Savior s supper, which is a table 1 Cor 10:21 , a feast, set up by Him that His believers may remember Him by enjoying Him as such a feast.
[268]  We have seen that as the Lord and His disciples were eating, He took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them, and said, Take; this is My body v. 22 . First the Lord and His disciples ate the Passover; then the Lord established His table with the bread and the cup to replace the feast of the Passover.
[269]  The Lord s blood redeemed us from our fallen condition back to God, back to the inheritance we lost through the fall of Adam, and back to God s full blessing.
[270]  Concerning the Lord s table 1 Cor 10:21 , the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God s blessing.
[271]  In particular, we need a further word concerning the Lord s instituting His supper as part of the preparation of His disciples to enter into His death and resurrection.
[272]  How is it possible for the Triune God to be our life and blessing?
[273]  The Lord Jesus said, I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever, v. 51 . Then He went on to say, As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me. v. 57 . Any believer who eats the Lord Jesus as the bread of life will live by Him.
[274]  We have seen that the cup of the Lord s table signifies His blood.
[275]  In God s economy there is only one kind of blood that is good for us to drink, and that is the blood of the Lord Jesus.
[276]  FOR HIS REDEMPTIVE SERVICE 12 Scripture Reading: Mark 14:27-42 WARNING THE DISCIPLES
[277]  When Peter heard the Lord s word concerning the disciples being stumbled, he said to Him, Even if all shall be stumbled, yet I will not! v. 29 . Then, also as part of His preparation of His disciples for His death, the Lord went on to say to Peter, Truly I tell you, that you today, in this night, before a cock crows twice, will deny Me three times.
[278]  Why is it that after the Lord Jesus instituted His supper, He warned the disciples of their stumbling and charged them to watch and pray?
[279]  The reason is that whenever the Lord reveals something concerning Himself in God s economy, He exposes our real situation.
[280]  According to the Gospel of Mark and the book of Acts, Peter not only passed through the death process, but also entered into the Lord s resurrection and ascension.
[281]  In this message we shall begin to consider the death and resurrection of the Slave-Savior for the accomplishment of God s redemption 14:43 16:18 .
[282]  Mark 14:43-52 tells us how the Lord Jesus was arrested.
[283]  In verse 49 He said to those who came to seize Him, Daily I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me but that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.
[284]  The God-forsaking and God-offending opposers, afraid of the people who had warmly welcomed the Slave-Savior 11:7-11 and who were gladdened by His speaking 12:37 , dared not arrest Him in the daytime or in a public place like the temple.
[285]  Again the high priest questioned Him and said to Him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? v. 61 . The befuddled high priest of the traditional, God-forsaking and God-forsaken religion called God the Blessed in order to show how much he revered and honored God.
[286]  We have pointed out that while the Lord Jesus was being falsely accused, He was silent.
[287]  But when He was questioned concerning His Person, whether He was the Christ, the Son of the Blessed, He answered, I am; and you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven 14:62 .
[288]  Although He was asked whether He was the Son of the Blessed, that is, the Son of God, the Lord referred to Himself as the Son of Man.
[289]  The Lord is the Son of Man, not only on earth before His crucifixion, but also in the heavens on the right hand of God after His resurrection Acts 7:56 , and even at His coming back on the clouds.
[290]  Verses 29 through 31 tell us that those passing by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha!
[291]  Mark 15:39 says, And the centurion standing by opposite Him, seeing how He expired, said, Truly this man was God s Son!
[292]  Verses 40 and 41 tell us of the women who were present: And there were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were both Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the little and of Joses, and Salome, who when He was in Galilee, followed Him and ministered to Him, and many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.
[293]  LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FORTY-EIGHT THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION
[294]  And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, My God, why did You forsake Me? v. 34 . In this message we need to pay particular attention to this verse.
[295]  When the Lord Jesus was conceived, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit in a virgin Matt 1:20 .
[296]  His conception was divine, for it was of the Holy Spirit, that is, of God.
[297]  His wonderful conception was a conception of God in man.
[298]  The book of Hebrews reveals that when the Lord Jesus died, He presented Himself as the all-inclusive offering to replace all the offerings in the Old Testament.
[299]  According to Hebrews 9:14, Christ through the eternal Spirit offered Himself spotless to God.
[300]  Although Christ is both human and divine, He presented Himself to God as the all-inclusive offering not only by Himself, the divine-human One, but also through the eternal Spirit.
[301]  The Lord s offering Himself to God through the eternal Spirit can be compared to His ministering on earth by the Spirit.
[302]  When the Lord Jesus cried, My God, My God, why did You forsake Me? it was during the time He was bearing our sins 1 Pet 2:24 , being made sin for us 2 Cor 5:21 and taking the place of sinners 1 Pet 3:18 .
[303]  WHAT CHRIST S DEATH ACCOMPLISHED The Problem of Sins
[304]  Let us now consider what the death of Christ accomplished.
[305]  First, Christ s death solved the problem of our sins, the problem of our offenses, transgressions, and sinful deeds.
[306]  The Bible reveals that Satan has formed a satanic system called the world.
[307]  1-18 , the ascension of the Slave-Savior for His exaltation v. 19 , and the Slave-Savior s universal spreading of the gospel through His disciples v. 20 . In this message we shall begin to consider the Slave-Savior s resurrection.
[308]  In Acts 2:23 and 24 Peter says, speaking of Christ, This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to the cross and killed; whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it.
[309]  In Acts 4:10-12 Peter again preaches concerning the resurrected Christ: Let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in this name this man stands before you well.
[310]  Through Christ s all-inclusive death, God s chosen people are ushered into Christ s resurrection.
[311]  When Christ was resurrected, God s chosen people were resurrected with Him.
[312]  Consider what 1 Peter 1:3 says concerning this: Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead.
[313]  In verse 16 the Lord went on to say to the disciples, He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned.
[314]  To believe is to receive the Slave-Savior John 1:12 , not only for forgiveness of sins Acts 10:43 but also for regeneration 1 Pet 1:21, 23 , so that those who believe may become the children of God John 1:12-13 and the members of Christ Eph 5:30 in an organic union with the Triune God Matt 28:19 .
[315]  To be baptized is to affirm this, by being buried to terminate the old creation through the death of the Slave-Savior and by being raised up to be the new creation of God through the Slave-Savior s resurrection.
[316]  In this exaltation God crowned Him with glory and honor Heb 2:9 , gave Him the name that is above all names Phil 2:9 , and made Him the Lord of all Acts 2:36 and the Head over all things Eph 1:22 , that He may have all authority in heaven and on earth Matt 28:18 to rule over the heavens, the earth, and the nations so that they may work together for the universal spreading of His gospel.
[317]  Concerning the Slave-Savior s universal spreading of the gospel through His disciples, 16:20 says, But those went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the accompanying signs.
[318]  This preaching of God s gospel to all the creation v. 15 by the resurrected and ascended Slave-Savior, as the Slave of God, through His believers, began from Jerusalem and has been proceeding to the uttermost part of the earth Acts 1:8 continuously and universally for the past centuries.
[319]  With this message we begin a series of supplementary messages to the Life-study of the Gospel of Mark.
[320]  These messages will be concerned with the life of the Slave-Savior as a life that is fully according to and for God s New Testament economy.
[321]  If we make a thorough study of the New Testament with respect to God s economy, we shall see that there is no defect, deficiency, or shortcoming in the life of the Lord Jesus.
[322]  Immediately after His baptism, the Lord Jesus was thrust into the wilderness by the Holy Spirit 1:12-13 .
[323]  From that time onward, He fulfilled His ministry by living, moving, and working in the Holy Spirit.
[324]  In 8:27 9:13 the Lord Jesus is revealed as our universal and entire replacement.
[325]  As those who have been ushered into the Lord s resurrection, His followers may now enjoy Him in His ascension as their life and life supply, the Lord of all, God s Christ, the Head of all to the church, the Head of the Body, the glorified One, the enthroned One, the One who is above all, and the One who fills all in all.
[326]  God s New Testament economy is to work Himself into His chosen people to make them members of Christ so that Christ may have a Body for His expression.
[327]  God s New Testament economy is not a matter of keeping the law or practicing rituals.
[328]  Neither is God s economy a matter merely of doing good according to human ethics or philosophy.
[329]  When God s people have His life, they are automatically able to live this life.
[330]  We believe that if the saints see that in His economy God desires to work Himself into His chosen people so that they may have Him as their life and live Him, there will be no need to argue concerning anyone s manner of dress.
[331]  In the foregoing message we pointed out an important difference between the Epistle of James and the Gospel of Mark.
[332]  Perhaps you are wondering what our reason is for saying that in the Gospel of Mark we see a life that is the substance of God s New Testament economy.
[333]  In chapter twenty-one of Acts we see a situation in which Paul was distracted from God s New Testament economy.
[334]  They had been instructed concerning Paul that he was teaching all the Jews throughout the nations apostasy from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs v. 21 . Then James and the others went on to give Paul this advice: Therefore do what we tell you: Four men are with us who have a vow on themselves; take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses that they may shave their heads; and all will know that there is nothing to the things of which they have been instructed concerning you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law vv.
[335]  In this message we shall continue to see from the Gospel of Mark a life that is fully according to and for the New Testament economy of God.
[336]  The word beginning in Mark 1:1 implies the termination of many things.
[337]  Consider what was present at the time of 1:1: culture, the Gentile nations, the chosen people of God, the promise, the law, the Old Testament, the temple, the system of priestly service, the proper way to worship God according to His ordinances.
[338]  By this we see that there were many good, positive things, even a number of things that had been ordained by God.
[339]  Perhaps I can illustrate the difference between human ethics and a life that is according to God s New Testament economy by telling you about the teaching of certain missionaries in China years ago.
[340]  In the foregoing message we considered the significance of the phrase the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ in 1:1.
[341]  Mark 1:10 tells us what happened when the Lord Jesus came up out of the water: And immediately, coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens being parted, and the Spirit as a dove coming down to Him.
[342]  Before this time, the Lord Jesus already had God the Father within Him as the essence of His being.
[343]  After His baptism, God the Spirit descended upon Him.
[344]  Therefore, within Him the Lord Jesus had the divine essence, and upon Him He had the Spirit of God.
[345]  As the One with the Father within Him as His essence and the Spirit upon Him as the power for His move and work, He began to minister.
[346]  In His move, His work, the Lord Jesus was not a person merely of morality or ethics, and He was not a person of religion.
[347]  After His baptism, with the Spirit upon Him, the Lord Jesus was a person absolutely of God inwardly and outwardly.
[348]  Was all this the Lord s work, His move, or His life?
[349]  Actually, it is difficult to say, for His life was His work, and His work was His move.
[350]  He worked everywhere and all the time because His work was His life, His life was His move, and His move was His work.
[351]  GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 6 Scripture Reading: Mark 1:14-15; 4:3, 26, 29; 1 Pet 1:23; 1 John 3:9; 1 Cor 3:9; Rev 14:14-16
[352]  The mystery we shall consider in this message is the mystery of the Lord Jesus as the Sower, the seed, and the kingdom.
[353]  The Sower, the seed, and the kingdom are all part of a wonderful, all-inclusive Person, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[354]  We have seen that in His gospel service, the Lord Jesus preached, taught, cast out demons, healed the sick, cleansed the lepers, and brought those whom He touched into the forgiveness of sins, and into a condition of feasting with Him, with joy, satisfaction, and freedom.
[355]  It may have been that those who touched Him wondered what had actually happened to them.
[356]  In chapter four we have a definition of what the Lord Jesus was doing in chapters one through three.
[357]  In 4:1, after ministering in the three foregoing chapters, the Lord Jesus got into a boat and taught the people many things in parables v. 2 . The first parable was the parable of the sower 4:1-20 , which opens with the words, Behold, the sower went out to sow v. 3 . This indicates that in the first three chapters of the Gospel of Mark whatever the Lord did was a sowing of the seed.
[358]  When I was young, I was taught that the good news is what is spoken of in John 3:16: For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.
[359]  There is not a word here that the Lord Jesus preached about God s love or that He said the time had come to believe in Him that we might have eternal life.
[360]  This book does not reveal anything other than the Lord Jesus as this wonderful Person.
[361]  As we pointed out in a foregoing message, the Lord Jesus did not live in the kingdom of law or that of ethics; He lived altogether in another realm the kingdom of God.
[362]  If we have seen this vision, it will control us and deliver us from culture, religion, ethics, and the other items that may distract us from God s New Testament economy.
[363]  It took the Lord a long time to rescue me from these things, especially from the preoccupation with being spiritual, holy, and victorious.
[364]  As long as we who seek the Lord are not rescued from these things, we shall be frustrated in experiencing the wonderful Person of Christ and enjoying the life that is absolutely according to God s New Testament economy.
[365]  We thank the Lord that the remainder of the New Testament, especially the Epistles of Paul, helps us to interpret the details of the Lord s biography in Mark.
[366]  Furthermore, the Lord Jesus lived in a way to be one with God, to bind God s enemy, and to deny the natural relationship and remain in the relationship of the spiritual life.
[367]  The four cases of healing in chapters one through three are all in the same category, the category of general healings.
[368]  After chapter four the Lord Jesus goes on to carry out further healings.
[369]  We need to have a clear understanding of the two categories of healing in Mark.
[370]  John 20:31 says, These have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.
[371]  I could not understand why John 20:31 spoke not only of the Son of God but also of the Christ.
[372]  Eventually, I came to understand that the Son of God refers to the Lord s Person and that Christ refers to His commission.
[373]  It is by being the Christ that the Lord Jesus imparts Himself into us as the Son of God so that we may have eternal life.
[374]  The entire New Testament is a book about a Person, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[375]  If we read only the Gospel of Mark, we shall see many of the events that took place during the Lord s life, but we shall not know the meaning of these events.
[376]  When we study the Gospel of Mark, we are actually studying our own biography.
[377]  This means that the biography of Jesus is also our biography.
[378]  The life the Lord Jesus lived is now our life.
[379]  Today we are His expansion, increase, and continuation, and we should continue to live the kind of life He lived.
[380]  After Christ s ascension, His disciples continued His life, a life of preaching, teaching, casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the lepers.
[381]  LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE SIXTY-TWO A LIFE FULLY ACCORDING TO AND FOR
[382]  Many Christians do not realize that the Gospel of Mark gives us a biography of a life that is fully according to and for God s New Testament economy.
[383]  The Lord Jesus is the embodiment of the Triune God.
[384]  As the Lord Jesus was ministering and living a life according to God s New Testament economy, He collected the soil into which He would sow Himself as a seed.
[385]  As we read the Gospel of Mark, we need to see that the Lord Jesus was living a life of sowing the Triune God into His believers as the soil.
[386]  After the Lord spit in the blind man s eyes and laid His hands on him, He asked him, Do you see anything? v. 23 . The man replied, I behold men; I see them as trees walking.
[387]  They answered, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, one of the prophets v. 28 . Then the Lord questioned the disciples further: But you, who do you say that I am? v. 29 . This question indicates that the Lord was healing His disciples seeing organ.
[388]  Since we were put into Christ before the foundation of the world, we were also in Him when He was crucified.
[389]  GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 13 Scripture Reading: Mark 1:14-18; 4:26; 9:1-8; 10:23-25; Rom 14:17 THE BACKGROUND AND LOCATION OF
[390]  At this point I would like to say, by way of reminder, that when we read the Bible, we should not understand it in a natural way.
[391]  This was also the reason Paul prayed, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him Eph 1:17 .
[392]  In verse 14 the Lord Jesus preached the gospel of God.
[393]  Hence, the gospel the Lord preached is the kingdom of God that has drawn near, and the kingdom of God that is near is the gospel.
[394]  According to the Gospel of Mark, the Lord Jesus came to the center of the inhabited earth to sow Himself into God s chosen people in order to develop into a kingdom for God s purpose and our enjoyment.
[395]  In the foregoing message we considered the background of the Lord s ministry in the Gospel of Mark.
[396]  Let us now go on to see how God s chosen people are the soil into which Christ as the seed of the kingdom is sown to develop into the kingdom of God.
[397]  We have seen that in Mark the Lord Jesus gathered the soil and put it into His pocket in order to sow Himself into it.
[398]  Through His death and resurrection the Lord Jesus not only healed the soil, but He also released God s life and imparted it into the soil.
[399]  Through His death the divine life in Him was released, and through His resurrection this life was imparted to the soil.
[400]  Hence, the Lord s death and resurrection were the completion of His sowing Himself as a seed into His disciples.
[401]  In chapter after chapter the Lord Jesus was sowing Himself into His disciples.
[402]  In the two preceding messages we considered four important matters: the background of the Lord s ministry, the Lord as the Sower sowing Himself into God s people, the condition of the disciples as soil, and the Lord s healing of this soil through His death and resurrection.
[403]  We saw that through this healing the one hundred twenty became the good ground for the Lord s sowing.
[404]  We pointed out that, according to the New Testament, the kingdom of God is a Person, the Lord Jesus Christ, sown into us in order to be developed.
[405]  In His ministry, the Lord came to sow Himself as the seed of the kingdom into God s chosen people so that this seed might develop into God s kingdom.
[406]  For years I was familiar with the story of the Lord s transfiguration without realizing that this transfiguration should be something experiential and practical to us in our daily living.
[407]  Hence, we need Him to grow in us until by transfiguration He blossoms into the expression of the kingdom of God in our experience.
[408]  Later, in 9:1, the Lord told His disciples that some standing there would not taste death until they saw the kingdom of God come in power.
[409]  The incident concerning the rich man in Mark 10 is an illustration of our need to be free from being occupied by anything except God Himself.
[410]  After the rich man went away sorrowing, the Lord said to His disciples, With what difficulty shall those who hold on to riches enter into the kingdom of God!
[411]  In the Gospel of Mark we see the Lord Jesus as the One who lived a life according to God s New Testament economy.
[412]  The Lord gathered the disciples, the chosen ones of God, as His soil in which He sowed Himself so that He might grow in them and that they might grow Him.
[413]  The disciples also received the Holy Spirit both essentially and economically.
[414]  After receiving the Spirit in this aspect for their spiritual existence, it was still necessary for them to receive the Spirit economically so that they could carry out God s economy as the continuation of the Lord Jesus.
[415]  Since the Lord carried out God s economy by the economical Spirit, the disciples had to carry out God s economy by the economical Spirit.
[416]  In the book of Acts we may say that there are two lines concerning the Spirit the line of the essential Spirit and the line of the economical Spirit.
[417]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that in the book of Acts we have both the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit.
[418]  In chapter eight of Acts we have both the Spirit and the Spirit of the Lord.
[419]  In 2 Corinthians 3:17 Paul says, And the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
[420]  In Philippians 1:19 Paul says, For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[421]  There is no indication in the book of Philippians that Paul prayed in the way of telling the Lord how weak he was and that he needed the Lord to strengthen him.
[422]  But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them to be refuse that I may gain Christ, and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God based on faith, to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.
[423]  GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 18 Scripture Reading: Rev 1:4-5a, 11-13, 20; 2:7, 11, 17, 26-28; 3:5-6, 12-13, 21-22; 4:5; 5:6; 14:13-16; 21:l-3a, 9-12, 14, 18-19a, 21; 22:1-2, 14, 17
[424]  In the foregoing messages of this Life-study of the Gospel of Mark, we have seen that the Lord s disciples followed Him from the beginning of His ministry.
[425]  We have pointed out that in chapter one of Acts the disciples are the Lord s continuation, following Him to live a life according to God s New Testament economy.
[426]  The Spirit coming as the Son with the Father is the consummation of the Triune God.
[427]  In the Gospels the Son with the Father and by the Spirit is the embodiment of the Triune God.
[428]  Thus, to say that the church is the Body of Christ and the temple of God is to say that the church is the kingdom of God and the house of God.
[429]  LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE SEVENTY A LIFE FULLY ACCORDING TO AND FOR
[430]  In the foregoing message we considered a chart that presents a summary of God s New Testament economy.
[431]  In the first section we see the Son with the Father and by the Spirit to be the embodiment of the Triune God in Jesus Christ as God s tabernacle and God s temple, living the life of God to develop into the kingdom of God.
[432]  In the first section of the New Testament, the four Gospels, we have the embodiment of the Triune God, and in the second section we have the consummation of the Triune God.
[433]  Although in the New Jerusalem revealed in the book of Revelation we see the precious materials of gold, pearl, and precious stones, with these materials we cannot see the intrinsic essence of the divine building specifically.
