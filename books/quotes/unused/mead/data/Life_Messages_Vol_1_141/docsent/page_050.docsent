   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Suppose after fifteen minutes in the Word and prayer, you feel you haven't gotten anything.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Should you persist, or by faith consider you have gotten something?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Learn to live not according to your feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Of course, your normal feelings help, but if you have a high fever, you may feel it is warm when it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you want to be spiritual, do not behave according to your feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not let circumstances determine how you feel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the spiritual life learn to drop your feeling and go according to the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is a fact that you need to read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many young Christians get excited when they first start studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They want to prolong the time and come back the next day for more because it is so much fun.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such excitement is short-lived.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After a week or so, it fizzles out.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you feel excited when you first start getting into the Word and feel there is light shining, don't have regard for that feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Prepare for a cold day soon to come!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is your duty to spend time in the Word and in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Your day-to-day feeling about it makes no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just fulfill your duty; go by the fact that you need to do these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Don't think you are wasting your time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A sister once asked Brother Nee if there was any point in her continuing to read the Bible every day; she could never remember what she had read.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Nee reminded her of how they washed the rice there in southern China.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They would put the rice into a basket made of willow branches and then repeatedly immerse the whole basket in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The water would never stay in the basket, however many times it was immersed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brother Nee pointed out to her that nonetheless the rice and the basket were both getting washed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By continuing to read the Word, this sister would be getting washed even though she couldn't remember what she had read.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Another fact is that you need to pray regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may soon find that your time of prayer is dry and lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Don't persuade yourself that this legality is killing you and you should drop it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This would be going by your feeling rather than the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The truth of the matter is that having wonderful times in prayer can lead to deception.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I can give you two examples.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day while a sister was praying, she thought the Lord told her He would come back at a certain time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It made her neglect her daily duties to get ready for His return.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A number of times saints have been deceived in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once while a brother was praying, he received a "revelation" that he was no more in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Alas, not only was his flesh still with him; it was stronger than ever.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He made many blunders as a result of this wrong feeling and eventually ended up in fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Let me warn you to beware of excitement when you contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Don't go the way of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whether you feel high or low, just come to contact your Lord for ten minutes every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not allow yourself to be played upon, directed, and even fooled, by your untrustworthy feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes when children will not drink their milk, the mother puts sugar in it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In like manner, when we are young, the Word is sweet to our taste because God has added some sugar.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You may also find singing hymns so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But as time goes on, the sugar will be reduced, and eventually the sweet taste in the Word and in the hymns will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually we shall have no ups and downs; all the days will be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But it is hard not to go by our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I hear some brothers and sisters pray so strongly and loudly in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I highly regard them; yet when I touch their daily lives, they disappoint me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then I cannot stand it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I love the saints, but I cannot control the bitter feeling about the lack of correspondence between their daily life and their meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The disparity you mention between how we live and how we behave when we meet has been greatly troubling me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some of our meetings have become theatrical performances, an offense to God and an offense to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we feel down at home, we should just come to the meeting that way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That is being real.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we are real, God will come in to heal us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After we have been sitting in the meeting for a short while, the merciful God may visit us, touch our heart, and cause the tears to flow.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then we may say, "O Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am so down.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Lord, forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is genuine, because it results from the Lord's visiting us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we thus receive grace, others are helped and we are changed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Such is the genuine Christian life and the genuine Christian meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To stir yourself up to perform in the meeting is abominable in the eyes of God.</S>
