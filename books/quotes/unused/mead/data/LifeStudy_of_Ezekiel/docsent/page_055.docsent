   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Unfortunately, the actual condition of Israel was very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we read the long record in Ezekiel from chapter two to chapter twenty-four, we may feel like weeping over Israel s pitiful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A Rebellious House</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The people of Israel were God s elect, but they became rebels against God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many times in these twenty-three chapters God said that Israel was a rebellious nation, a rebellious house.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 2:3 the Lord said to Ezekiel, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verses 5 and 6 God referred to them as a rebellious house, and in verse 7 He said that they are most rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They were God s elect, but they had become rebels against God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Briars and Thorns</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The people of Israel were God s vine, but they became briars and thorns 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A vine should produce grapes as fruit to eat and for making wine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead of producing grapes, Israel became briars and thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They became a pricking, injuring, and damaging plant which yielded no fruit and no wine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s elect became rebels, and God s vine became briars and thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A Harlot</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, although the people of Israel were God s bride, they became a harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They had a whorish heart and they went a whoring after their idols 6:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What a miserable situation!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In chapters sixteen and twenty-three God said that His heart was broken because of their whorish heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a dear Husband, God was grieved because His people had become a whorish wife.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Scorpions</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the record in Ezekiel, what became of Israel as God s flock?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 2:6 we see that God s flock became scorpions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As God s flock they should have been sheep producing meat to nourish people and wool to warm people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But they became scorpions, and with scorpions there is no producing, only stinging.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Dross</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ezekiel 22:18 says, Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This reveals that Israel, God s precious treasure, had become dross, the waste material that remains after gold and silver have been refined.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As God s elect, they became rebels; as God s vine, they became briars and thorns; as God s bride, they became a harlot; as God s flock, they became scorpions; and as God s treasure of gold and silver, they became dross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This picture of Israel can be applied to the situation of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In their standing Christians are God s elect, but many have become rebels against God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead of being a vine, they have become briars and thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead of being a wife, they have become a harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to Revelation 17 and 18 today s Christianity is not a bride but a great harlot with many daughter harlots.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, today s Christianity is altogether a whoredom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moreover, among Christians what we see today is not a flock producing meat and wool for others but stinging scorpions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Finally, although some Christians today may be a treasure to God, most have become dross.</S>
