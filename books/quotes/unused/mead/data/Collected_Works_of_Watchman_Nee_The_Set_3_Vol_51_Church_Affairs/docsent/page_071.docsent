   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>No Coordination without Obedience</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have spent only a little time to see that the matter of who should be the leader and who should obey in the work is spontaneously arranged before God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Christians are together there should be fellowship as well as obedience among them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We hope that brothers and sisters can eventually learn that when two are together there will always be one who obeys.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When three people are together, there will always be two who obey.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the basic coordination in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without obedience there is no coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When two or three brothers or eight or ten brothers live together, we should never allow a confused situation to exist in which they do not know whom they should listen to.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a confused situation would prove that we have received very little instruction before God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever God's children live together, they will spontaneously and immediately know whom they should listen to if they have been instructed before God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When brothers live together or when brothers fellowship together, spontaneously there is one who is in the forefront among them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever something happens, learn to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once we have learned this matter, there is no need for man to tell us or teach us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We will automatically stay in our position and ask, "Brother, what do you think I should do?''</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After he speaks, the matter will be settled and it will be arranged that way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to keep our place, knowing what our position is and knowing that this is what God wants us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first thing in God's work and in the coordination among workers is to ask God to open our eyes that we may know the authority among us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we are together with brothers, we should know which brother is ahead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to humble ourselves to see that as soon as a word is spoken, a matter is decided, or an opinion is expressed, we need to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are persons who obey.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are not here to elect or nominate, but to stand spontaneously in our place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Recognizing authority is the first principle of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do not recognize this fact, we will find that it is impossible to coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>FELLOWSHIP BEING NEEDED</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In coordination, the first matter is authority, and the second matter is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Co-workers Being Those to Whom</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We Can Open Up Our Heart</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A basic need among co-workers is that they be ones to whom we can open up our heart and with whom we can have fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Coordination opposes individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Coordination is for the service of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is we who serve, but we serve according to the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we need the mutual fellowship, having our hearts open to one another and helping one another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a member rejoices, the entire Body rejoices.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a member suffers, the whole Body suffers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a member is sorrowful, the whole Body is sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is called coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Two Persons Being as One Man</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Several people living together is not necessarily coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose a brother has a very thick, heavy, solid outer shell; whether he lives alone or with ten people, he remains an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not coordination, and he is not in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people, whether they are alone or with ten people, pray, seek God, speak to God, and seek the will of God as individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How can we say that this is coordination?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Putting two people together as co-workers does not mean putting two individuals together.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do we see this?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must not have the misconception that this is coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Formerly, we worked by ourselves; now two are working together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If one person is working alone, he is working individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If two persons are working together as two individuals, there is still no coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is useless if one person is an individual or if two persons remain as individuals!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Formerly, one person was working, but now two persons need to work together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When two or three get together, what should they do?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They need to be in one accord!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that before God we are able to open up to our brothers.</S>
