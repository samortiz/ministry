   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO YI-YANG Date:March 10, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong A REPORT ON THE GOSPEL MIGRATION TO YI-YANG</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the end of 1948 there was flooding around Shiao-Shan, Chekiang province.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The local brothers considered this to be a sign of God's sovereign hand in urging them to migrate to other places.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They began to move to Yi-Yang in Chekiang.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the beginning of 1949 the first group of brothers and sisters settled in Yi-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These brothers and sisters practiced the communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They learned to love one another, and they dealt strictly with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thank the Lord that He has blessed His children through their obedience to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The number of migrating ones increased day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now the saints in Yi-Yang are contemplating a further move to two or three neighboring localities.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The soil in these neighboring lands is two to four times richer than in Yi-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the brothers and sisters who have moved to Yi-Yang work with their own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They earn their own living with their two hands.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nanchang is an important town in Kiangsi; it is very close to Yi-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Presently, several dozen brothers and sisters are moving to Nanchang from Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the major cities are gospel bases for spreading the gospel to surrounding places.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to "capture and occupy" these places as soon as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The brothers and sisters who have migrated to Yi-Yang have set up a good pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The government radio station in Nanchang has made many public announcements, asking people everywhere to go and learn from Yi-Yang, Chu-Chi, Yin-Tang, Chao-Bin, Lung-Fu-Shan, etc.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE WAY OF GOSPEL MIGRATION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our present way of gospel preaching is not through sending one or two missionaries to a place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way today is the way of gospel migration by the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is like paratroopers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The whole church moves forward.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to prepare themselves for the migration, the brothers and sisters have to pick up trades that allow them to work with their own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who are preparing for migration must learn to work with their hands, even if this means working as a barber, a tailor, or a blacksmith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Migration can teach us many things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, it is not easy to practice having all things in common in the cities.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But in such places as Yi-Yang and Chu-Chi, it is easy to practice having all things in common; there is no problem with such a practice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The new government has adopted a new philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The basic principle of its philosophy is the principle of equalization, but they are afraid that when everyone becomes equal, some will become lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the reason they have to keep a close eye on everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To the new government, equalization is something very hard to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But this does not pose any hardship for us, the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We love one another, and we love our neighbors as ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Yi-Yang the elderly and sick ones are fed even better than the others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The present urgent need is the spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are over two million people in the northwestern part of Kiangsi.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have only a little over two hundred brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is less than a hundredth of one percent.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I hope that in the near future, the gospel will spread out quickly from them.</S>
