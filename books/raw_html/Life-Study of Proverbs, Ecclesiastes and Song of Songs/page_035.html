<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Leech Having Two Daughters</H2><P>The leech has two daughters, crying, "Give, give." There are three things that are never satisfied, indeed, four that do not say, "Enough": Sheol and the barren womb, the earth that is not satisfied with water, and the fire that does not say, "Enough" (vv. 15-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Eye That Mocks at His Father</H2><P>The eye that mocks at his father, and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley will pick it out, and the young eagles will eat it (v. 17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Three Things Which Are Too Wonderful</H2><P>In verses 18 through 19 the writer speaks of three things which are too wonderful for him, indeed four which he does not know: the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man with a maiden. This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth and says, "I have done no wickedness" (v. 20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Under Three Things the Earth Quaking</H2><P>Under three things the earth quakes, and under four, it cannot bear up: under a servant when he is king, and a fool when he is filled with food; under a hated woman when she gets married, and a maidservant who is heir to her mistress (vv. 21-23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. Four Things Which Are Small<br>but Are Exceedingly Wise</H2><P>Four things are small on the earth, but they are exceedingly wise: The ants are a people without strength, yet they prepare their food in the summer; the rock badgers are a people without might, yet they make their houses in the rocks; the swarming locusts have no king, yet all of them go out in ranks; the lizard can be grasped with the hands, yet she is in kings' palaces (vv. 24-28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Three Things Which Are Stately in Their Step</H2><P>There are three things which are stately in their step, indeed four which are stately in walking: the lion, which is mightiest among beasts, and does not turn back before any; the strutting cock girded in the loins, or a male goat, and a king who has a band of soldiers with him (vv. 29-31).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. Being Foolish in Exalting Oneself</H2><P>Verse 32 says, "If you have been foolish in exalting yourself,/Or if you have thought an evil scheme,/Put your hand upon your mouth."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>13. The Pressing of Wrath Bringing Forth Strife</H2><P>The churning of milk produces butter, and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood, so the pressing of wrath brings forth strife (v. 33).</P>
