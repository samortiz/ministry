   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILDING UP THE MYSTICAL BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider the other sign in John 2, the sign of building up the mystical body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to realize that the rebuilding of the destroyed temple has already been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Christ's resurrection we all have been resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Peter tells us that we have been regenerated through the resurrection of Christ 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that in God's view, according to His accomplishment in His economy, the Body of Christ has already been built.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The tense of the verbs in the book of Revelation indicates this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, the Apostle John does not say that the New Jerusalem will come; he tells us that he saw the New Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Approximately nineteen hundred years ago, John saw the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This shows us that, according to God's way of seeing, the Body of Christ has already been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you know what our living is?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our living as Christians is simply a matter of the changing of death into life for the building up of the mystical Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The entire Christian life consists of two matters: changing death into life and building up the mystical Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the proper, genuine, and complete Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no third item in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we are in this building by our daily living, and our daily living is a matter of changing water into wine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may summarize our Christian life by saying that the Christian life is the changing of death into life, water into wine, for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is our living?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our living is the changing of death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What are we doing here?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are carrying out the work of building up the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is our living, and this is our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our living is the changing of death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our goal is the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have a living of the eternal life, the eternal zoe, for the purpose of building up the mystical Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This message is a word of encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all should be encouraged by what is revealed in chapter two of John.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the church life we are doing the work of building in three days, that is, in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some may say, "Brother Lee, on some occasions you have told us that we are short, lacking, and somewhat off from the central vision of God's economy."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yes, in the past I have spoken concerning our shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But what we have in John 2 is a word of encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many things have both a positive side and a negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the positive side is not for the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, the negative side is for the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do not know if this is true in physics, but I know it is true in "spiritual physics."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to my experience in the Christian life, the negative side is for the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every time I have a defeat, I soon enjoy a victory, and every sorrow is followed by joy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why I say that the negative side is always for the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As believers in Christ, we are not a people without hope.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the contrary, we are a people full of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, God the Father has regenerated us unto a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have the eternal life within us as our hope.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With eternal life, everything is hopeful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may still be short and somewhat off from God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, we cannot deny the fact that the situation among us today is much better than it was years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I can testify that there is more building in the churches than there was some years ago or even a few months ago.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the raising up of the destroyed temple in three days.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to the Lord's word in John 2, He allowed the enemy to destroy the temple of His body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That was a test to resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is also a test to resurrection life in our experience in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let the enemy destroy God's temple.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have resurrection power within us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Without the negative side, this positive power could not be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everything else is going down, but the church exists forever.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may fluctuate, but the church never fluctuates.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When some hear this, they may say, "This I cannot believe.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I feel that a few years ago the church in my locality was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We were happy and excited.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But now the condition of the church is worse."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I would reply that your feeling, which is related to something outward, is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps in the past there was more excitement, more shouting, more so-called release in singing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That, however, is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I have the full assurance that there is more life in the churches today than even a few years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I can say this because I have the assurance that many of us are living a water-changing life, and by this life we live in the building.</S>
