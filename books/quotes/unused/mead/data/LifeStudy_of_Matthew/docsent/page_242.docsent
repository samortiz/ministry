   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE SIXTY-SIX PROPHECY OF THE KINGDOM 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall continue our consideration of the parable for faithfulness 25:14-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord of the Slaves Coming</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>to Settle Accounts with Them</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 19 says, Now after a long time the lord of those slaves comes and settles accounts with them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A long time signifies the entire church age, and the coming signifies the Lord s coming to the air 1 Thes 4:16 in His parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To settle accounts signifies the Lord s judgment at His judgment seat 2 Cor 5:10; Rom 14:10 in the air within His parousia , where the believers life, conduct, and work will be judged for reward or punishment 1 Cor 4:5; Matt 16:27; Rev 22:12; 1 Cor 3:13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Five-talented and the Two-talented Ones Both Receiving a Reward</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 20 says, And he who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, Lord, you delivered to me five talents; behold, I have gained another five talents.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The coming of the five-talented one refers to the coming to the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Gaining another five talents is the result of the full use of the gift of the five talents.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 21 says, His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The few things signify the Lord s work in this age, over signifies the ruling authority in the coming kingdom, and the many things signify the responsibilities in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The joy of the Lord signifies the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the inward satisfaction, not the outward position.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To participate in the Lord s joy is the greatest reward, better than the glory and position in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here we see two aspects of the reward given to the faithful slave: authority and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The faithful will enter directly into the Lord s presence in the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The same reward is given to the two-talented one as to the five-talented one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the two-talented one came and said that he had gained another two talents, the Lord said the same thing to him that He had said to the five-talented one vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although the gift given to the twotalented one is smaller than that given to the five-talented one, the Lord s appraisal and reward to both are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that the Lord s appraisal and reward are not related to the size and quantity of our work, but to our faithfulness in using His gift to the fullest extent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The same appraisal and reward would also have been given to the one-talented one if he had been as faithful.</S>
