The divine revelation in the Scriptures is progressive, unfolding and developing book by book and chapter by chapter
In Colossians 1:25 Paul said that he was made a minister according to the economy of God 'to complete the word of God'
It is John's writing in the book of Revelation, however, that marks the completion of the divine revelation in the Scriptures
Because the revelation is complete, we are warned neither to add to nor to take away from the words of God's revelation
Now that God's progressive revelation in the Scriptures has been completed, no one is permitted to add anything to it
By comparing Exodus with Genesis we can see how Exodus presents a side or line of spiritual experience not found in Genesis
Abraham was an example of a typical called one he was called by God out of Chaldea out of the land of Babel a land of rebellion and idolatry
The picture we see in all of Isaac's experience is a picture of the enjoyment of the rich inheritance rather than a picture of redemption
Although Jacob was eventually transformed into an Israel, a prince of God, there is no record regarding Jacob's experience of redemption
They tied two of the lamb's legs to the foot of the cross and fastened the other outstretched legs to the cross bar
As we consider the portrait of the Passover, we receive a vivid impression of the powerfulness of the blood of the Lamb of God
In Exodus from the very beginning we have a clear and detailed record of how the Lord took care of His redeemed people
In Exodus we see not only the Lord's leading but also a vivid portrait of how the Lord took care of the daily needs of His redeemed people
As we all know, in the daytime the Lord's presence was a pillar of cloud, and during the night it was a pillar of fire
In Genesis God appeared to His chosen people again and again, but He did not have a substantial dwelling place among them
The book of Exodus however records in a very full way both the revelation and the building of the tabernacle as Gods dwelling place on earth
A further contrast between Genesis and Exodus is seen in the difference between individual experience and corporate experience
The book of Genesis concludes with an individual Israel, but the book of Exodus concludes with a corporate Israel
Exodus 1430 says Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore
The corporate Israel, composed of the descendants of the individual Israel, is the increase and enlargement of the individual Israel
Concerning Gods calling there is an individual element however with Gods redemption there is nothing individual but everything is corporate
In the last chapter of Exodus, we have a corporate vessel, God's habitation, God's dwelling place with man on earth
In Genesis there is the line of individual spiritual experience, whereas in Exodus there is the line of corporate experience
In Genesis basically two people, Abraham and his wife, came out of Chaldea, but in Exodus over two million people came out of Egypt
Although the book of Genesis is rich, in this book we do not see God's glory manifested among His people in a substantial way
In chapter forty of Exodus, the glory of God came down visibly and substantially when the tabernacle was erected
We were in rebellion and idolatry and also in the world with its enjoyment, including sports and entertainments
Exodus is not a continuation of the spiritual experience in Genesis; it reveals another side or line of the believer's experience
The experience in Genesis is somewhat vague and abstract, but the experience presented in Exodus is solid and substantial
Every aspect of the experience in Exodus is solid, from the Lord's presence as the pillar to the glory filling the tabernacle
In Egypt the Israelites had much enjoyment of the Egyptian produce, but in the wilderness they had only manna to eat
When God called Moses, He firstly gave him a vision of a burning bush, a bush that was burning without being consumed
Unable to escape God's calling, Moses expressed his concern that the children of Israel would not believe him nor hearken to his voice
At the Lord's command, he put his hand into his bosom again and took it out, and 'it was turned again as his other flesh'
The fact that the bush was burning without being consumed indicates that when God calls us, He does not intend to use our natural man
Moses' hand becoming leprous is an indication that in our flesh there is nothing good; our flesh is the embodiment of leprosy
Exodus is not only a book telling how the Israelites got out of Egypt; it is a book of redemption, supply, revelation, and building
God's chosen people are to be built up together into one entity, the tabernacle, where God and man may mutually meet, communicate, and dwell
The book is arranged in five sections: enslaved , redeemed and saved , led , receiving revelation , and building the tabernacle
It ends with the statement, 'So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt'
Chapter one of Exodus is a detailed record of the activities of God's people in their situation of death in Egypt
The situation among the worldly people today, like that among God's people in Exodus 1, is characterized by slavery and death
Before we came into the church life in the Lord's recovery, many of us continued to be enslaved and deadened, even after we had been saved
The book of Genesis has a good beginning but ends with a poor situation, whereas Exodus begins with a poor situation but ends gloriously
Where do you prefer to be-in a coffin in Egypt or with the ark in the tabernacle that is filled with God's glory?
By this we see that people become enslaved primarily out of the need to maintain their livelihood, out of the need to make a living
People today pursue higher education or technical training in order to secure a good living, even the best living
Throughout the world, whether in developed nations or in backward countries, people are enslaved due to the need to earn a living
God's calling Abraham out of the land of Babel symbolizes our being called out of the rebellious and idolatrous world
Before we were saved, we were not only in the world of rebellion and idolatry, but also in the world of riches and enjoyment
Abraham was called out of the rebellious world, but the children of Israel made their exodus out of the world of enjoyment
The children of Israel were enslaved to that aspect of the world which gave them their livelihood and afforded them their enjoyment
They work hard to earn a large amount of money and then in a short time they spend all they have to indulge in the pleasures of the world
They were not in the first aspect of the world, typified by Babel, nor in the second aspect, represented by Sodom
How we need to thank the Lord for delivering us from slavery in the world and for setting us free from the usurping hand of Satan!
The worldly people do not realize how wise Satan is and how wisely he deals with people to usurp them, to occupy them, and to enslave them
You may work in a hospital factory or office but actually you are laboring in the field making bricks and cementing them with mortar
These names indicate that Pharaoh's treasure cities were built for pride and boastful display, just as the pyramids were
Today the worldly people are building treasure cities for Satan because of pride in their integrity and standard
Pharaoh not only enslaved the children of Israel, but also sought to kill all the baby boys born to the Hebrew women
According to the Bible, the male life is for God's purpose; and, especially among the fallen people, the female life is for man's pleasure
If we do not have the Lord's grace, daily we shall be a Pharaoh killing the life for God's purpose and keeping the life for man's pleasure
On the Lord's day the believers should come together to worship the Lord, to listen to His Word, and to serve Him
Satan is always looking for opportunities to kill the life that is for God's purpose and to preserve the life that is for man's pleasure
It is in the time of degradation of desperate need that God comes to use the female life to rescue the situation and bring in His salvation
If there is no blessing from the Lord, we shall not see much positive result, no matter how good or right we may be
On the other hand, we should not think that because everything depends on the Lord's blessing, we should do nothing
We need to labor, to do our duty, realizing as we do so that the condition of the church and of the saints is a matter of God's sovereignty
Verses 20 and 21 say, 'Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and became very strong
By dealing well with the midwives, God made them households to bring forth life for the fulfilling of His purpose
If we are such midwives, God will establish households for us filled with people producing life for the accomplishment of God's purpose
In the following message we shall see that Moses was preserved through three women: his mother, his sister, and the daughter of Pharaoh
In chapter one of Exodus Pharaoh held the children of Israel in slavery and also sought to kill all the baby boys born to Hebrew mothers
Although Pharaoh was a powerful ruler, even a tyrant, the midwives were not afraid of him, nor did they hearken to his word
In Exodus 2 there is the need for the preparation of a savior to deliver God's people out of the hand of Pharaoh's tyranny
The female whom God used strategically for this purpose was found in Pharaoh's very household-it was Pharaoh's own daughter
Hebrews 11:23 says that Moses 'was hid three months by his parents,' but Exodus 2:2 mentions only that his mother hid him three months
Without the female life in chapter two, there would have been no way for God to prepare a savior to rescue the children of Israel
When she could no longer hide him, she put him in an ark of papyrus and laid it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile
The first female mentioned in Exodus 2 was the mother of Moses, the life that brought him forth in birth and nursed him
Moses' father, mother, and sister may have held a family conference concerning what to do with Moses when they could no longer hide him
When Pharaoh's daughter saw the baby and had compassion on him, Moses' sister recommended that his mother be asked to nurse him
Moses' sister thus watched over the male life and established the connection between Pharaoh's daughter and Moses' mother
Possessing spiritual insight and discernment, they realized that Moses was a very promising child for God's purpose
The emphasis in Exodus 2 is not on the spiritual significance of Moses' early life; it is on the important role played by the female life
During critical times, the only life that can be used by God is the female life that stands with God and is dependent upon Him
If we see this, we shall have a great appreciation for the female life, the life that is wholly dependent on God
Another his sister Miriam watched over him when he was in the ark and served as a connecting link between Pharaohs daughter and Moses mother
Acts 7:22 says, 'Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in his words and deeds'
Under God's sovereignty, Moses learned all the Egyptian wisdom while staying in the royal palace as the son of Pharaoh's daughter
Acts 7:23 says, 'But when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the sons of Israel'
At the end of these years, Moses was confident that he had been furnished, equipped, qualified, and perfected to save the children of Israel
Acts 7:22 says that Moses was 'powerful in his words,' but in Exodus 4:10 Moses said to the Lord, 'I am not eloquent
In order to break down Moses' natural strength, God arranged to have him work as a shepherd in the land of Midian
One who had been raised in the royal Egyptian family and who had attained the highest level of culture became a shepherd
When God called Moses in chapter three, He showed him the sign of a burning bush, a bush that burned without being consumed
In order to be used by God, we need to have a heart for Him and His interests, but our natural strength must be set aside
It may seem to many, especially to the young people, that forty years is too long a time for God to deal with our natural ability and energy
God intended that Moses learn all the wisdom and knowledge of the Egyptians, but wisdom and knowledge should not remain raw, unprocessed
Whether we like this process or not, we must pass through it in order to learn not to depend upon our natural strength or ability
We have seen that Moses was naturally very strong and supposed that his Hebrew brothers would recognize him as their deliverer
Some historians believe that if Moses had remained in the Egyptian palace, he would have been the heir to the throne
In the priest of Midian we see a mature, experienced, male life that received the vessel which had been raised up by God
In the church life today, we need both the various kinds of female life and the mature male life for the Lord's economy
When some of the young people hear this, they may be disappointed, thinking that they are not able to wait such a long time to be perfected
If we would be perfected over a long period of time, we must have the proper heart, the proper attitude, and the proper standing
If we have such a heart and such a standing, we shall be willing to accept the Lord's training, no matter how long it lasts
God heard their groaning, and He remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to bring their descendants into the good land
For the fulfillment of God's purpose, there is also the need for an army to fight for God's interests on earth
Chapter one shows that the people of God were under slavery, and chapter two reveals how God prepared one to save His people out of bondage
Both the preservation of the people and the preparation of the savior were accomplished only through the female life
All married brothers need to realize that they are simply husbands in shadow and that the real husband is Christ
When we speak of a male in the positive sense, we have in mind a husband who is the head and who has an independent life
Rather, they must live a life of dependence upon their husbands, who are but shadows of the Lord as the real husband
Although the married brothers are husbands in shadow with respect to their wives, in actuality they are females with respect to the Lord
Man, on the one hand, should be under the headship of Christ, and, on the other hand, he should be the head of the woman
In this we see that God is the head of Christ and that Christ, under the headship of God, is the head of every man
With respect to Christ, the married brothers have a dependent life, but with respect to their wives, they have an independent life
Whether we are sisters or brothers, we all need to be 'females' and live by the only life that is useful to God
To live an independent life means to live by the tree of knowledge, but to live a dependent life means to live by the tree of life
Not only do the worldly people live an independent life, but many Christians also live a life that is independent of God
How foolish for a person to say that because he has been breathing for seventy years he no longer needs to breathe!
During his third forty years, from the age of eighty to the age of one hundred twenty, Moses lived the life of a female
Because Moses acted as a male on that occasion, he offended the Lord and thus was denied the privilege of entering into the good land
The female life is seen not only in chapters one and two of Exodus, but also throughout the following chapters
The history of the church reveals that whenever there is such a 'female' life, God is able to do something for His purpose
Whenever the Israelites rebelled against God, they assumed the position of the husband, and it was as if they divorced themselves from God
Ephesians 5:25 says, 'Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her'
The problems among Christians and in the churches are due to brothers or sisters living an independent 'male' life
All problems in the church life, in married life, and among the saints come from one source, and that source is independence
In these days we have been speaking much about the perfecting of the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ
If we live and work independently of God, the result of our work will be that other lives will be perfected to be independent
The result of such work will not be the New Jerusalem-it will be Babylon the Great, a city independent of God and rebellious against Him
The reason the church throughout the years has been torn down instead of built up is that the so-called builders have been too independent
We thank the Lord that there have been a small number who were willing to live a 'female' life in dependence on the Lord
We may do many things to help the churches; yet all that we do may be rebellion because it is done independently of the Lord
Even Moses, when he was provoked by the children of Israel in the wilderness, once acted like a male and in so doing lost God's blessing
In the Lord's economy and in His move today in His recovery, we all must be watchful with fear and trembling not to act independently of God
In chapter one of Exodus we saw the children of Israel under slavery, and in chapter two we saw the preparation of a savior
Although God wanted to deliver the children of Israel out of bondage, He had to wait until Moses had been fully prepared
According to his own estimation, no doubt he thought he was qualified and ready to act on behalf of his people
Surely God wanted a way to come in earlier than He did, but there was no one among the children of Israel to whom He could come
If we ask the Lord why His coming back has been delayed so long, He may reply, 'Where are those who are ready for Me to come back?
In Exodus God could not come in when Moses was a child or when he was still trusting in his natural strength and ability
In the same principle, the Lord continues to delay His coming back because not enough of His people are ready for Him to return
When by God's sovereignty Moses was set aside, he must have been very disappointed and he must have lost all hope
At the age of eighty, in the eyes of God Moses was fully prepared and qualified, and at the precise time He came to him
The record of God's calling of Moses is longer than the record of His calling of any other person in the Bible
If we would know the full significance of God's calling, we must pay close attention to God's calling of Moses in Exodus 3
In the same principle, if you are a businessman, you must go to the back side of your business in order to be called by God
If you are dissatisfied with your occupation or with your marriage, this dissatisfaction may turn you to the back side
As Moses was slowly making his journey with the flock to the mountain of God, God was already there waiting for him
In verse 5 God said to Moses Draw not nigh hither put off thy sandals from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy soil
The fact that God called from the midst of a thorn-bush indicates that the place of God's calling is within us
Initially, Saul was called by the Lord out of heaven, but eventually this calling became something within Saul
Apparently Gods calling occurred at the back side of the desert actually it took place at the mountain of God and particularly on holy soil
Exodus 3 reveals the name of God, the calling One, in a full way, more fully perhaps than any other portion of the Word
When we put verses 2 and 4 together, we see that this sent One, the Angel of Jehovah, is actually Jehovah Himself
Verse 4 says, 'And when Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the thorn-bush'
The one who knows how to use his employees and how to properly supervise them is the one who has done their particular job already
The title 'the Angel of Jehovah' mainly refers to Christ, the Son of God, sent to save God's people from their situation of suffering
When God appeared to Moses and called him, He was not a stranger, for He had been with Moses' family for generations
In the New Testament the Lord uses many things to describe Himself: 'I am the true vine' , 'I am the bread of life' , 'I am the light'
If we would be called by God, we must see that, as the calling One, God is the God of the river-crossers, the separated people
As such a God, He is not the God of those in Babel nor is He the God of those in Egypt, because they are not separated
He is not the God of the Egyptians, but the God of the Hebrews, of the people who have crossed the river for the fulfillment of His purpose
Was a man now eighty years of age, one who had spent the last forty years of his life shepherding a flock in the wilderness
How can God's people be delivered out of the hand of such an evil power and be rescued from the kingdom of darkness?
For this reason, the divine revelation in the New Testament places a very high value on the preaching of the gospel
Although Christ is one Person He has the redeeming life typified by the animal life and the generating life typified by the vegetable life
On the one hand, Christ is the Lamb of God to redeem us; on the other hand, He is a loaf of barley to supply us
Both kinds of life were part of the Passover meal, for in the Passover there were the lamb and the unleavened bread with bitter herbs
Having realized this, he might have determined to learn everything necessary to equip him to rescue his people
Moses probably did not see clearly that the goal was not just to deliver God's people out of Egypt, but to bring them into the good land
Although Moses was not altogether clear concerning the goal, he still expected to do something on behalf of his people
We know that Moses was dealt with just by the fact that he had to live in the wilderness after having been raised in the royal palace
Whenever we have been burdened by the Lord, we cannot lay aside that burden, no matter how much others may oppose us
Because he was so confident that he had the ability and the power to carry out this burden, God arranged for him to be rejected
We like to marry these two things, but God wants to divorce them, to keep the burden and to set aside our natural strength
Many saints know that we need the church life, but, because they are disappointed, they are reluctant to come to the meetings
God was the sending One, the Initiator, and Moses was to be the sent one to carry out the wishes of the sending One
He 'appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a thorn-bush' , a bush that burned with fire without being consumed
Seeing this burning thorn-bush, Moses said, 'I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the thorn-bush is not burnt'
Genesis 324 the first mention of fire in the Bible speaks of a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life
Today God's holiness no longer excludes us from the tree of life; it burns within us, although we once were sinners under God's curse
The memory of that vision must have worked within him to constantly remind him not to use his natural strength or ability
Through the sign of the burning thorn-bush, God impressed Moses that he was a vessel, a channel, through which God was to be manifested
In his translation Darby adds the words 'the section of' before 'bush'; the American Standard Version adds 'the place concerning'
In these days we have seen that all the saints can be apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
As Moses prostrated himself before God, God came forth as flaming fire, manifesting Himself from within Moses as the thorn-bush
Although you may consider yourself to be capable, you will eventually realize that you are merely a useless thorn-bush
After God called Moses and sent him to Pharaoh, it was not Moses but God Himself who did everything and who was glorified
Whenever we touch the work of God or the service of the church, we shall be reminded that we are nothing more than a thorn-bush
Although Moses had been rejected by man, he was accepted by God, and the fire of God's glory burned within him and upon him
The burning thornbush in Exodus 3 however refers not only to Moses as an individual but also to the children of Israel as a corporate entity
In the individual aspect Moses was a thorn-bush, and in the corporate aspect the children of Israel were a thorn-bush
Sometimes we may even feel like prostrating ourselves before the Lord and confessing to Him how pitiful we are
The sense Moses had was much deeper, even more tender and sweet than this, for he realized he was a thorn-bush burned by the glory of God
Today, as believers in Christ, we are not merely sinners saved by grace; we are a thorn-bush burning with the fire of God's glory
The thorn in Genesis 3 indicates that man is under a curse and the flame of fire indicates that man is excluded from God as the tree of life
Immediately after the curse was pronounced, a flaming sword was placed at the east of the garden 'to keep the way of the tree of life'
The function of fire in Genesis 3 is to exclude sinners from the tree of life, that is, from God as the source of life
In Genesis 3 the fire keeps the man who is under the curse away from the tree of life, away from God as the source of life
Praise the Lord that the excluding flame of Genesis 3 has become the visiting and indwelling flame of Exodus 3!
Apart from the process of transformation, how could Moses, a man so strong and active in his natural life, become a man of God?
Moses was like steel that is thrust into fire and kept there until the steel glows with the fire that has been burned into its very essence
Moses was redeemed, sanctified, and transformed; we today are redeemed and we are being sanctified and transformed
In the Lord's recovery we do not care for a large number; we care for the genuine experience of transformation
According to our nature, we are still a thorn-bush, but according to God's burning within us, we are transformed people
In that meeting an experienced sister co-worker, troubled by the low state of the church, cried out to the Lord on behalf of the church
Speaking on behalf of God, Balaam said, 'He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel'
If you praise the Lord for the church life and speak well concerning it, you will put yourself under God's blessing
Those who speak positively about the church, declaring that the church is lovely and that it is God's house, receive the blessing
In eternity, the Lord's word will prove to be right, for in eternity the church will be marvelous, glorious, and transcendent
If we stand with the Lord's estimation of the church, we shall be kept from falling from the blessing into the curse
In His eyes, the children of Israel were redeemed, sanctified, transformed, and built up, and God had His dwelling place among them
What makes the corporate thorn-bush in the Lord's recovery different from all other thorn-bushes is the burning of the flame of fire
As soon as a brother becomes an elder, he becomes subject to the scrutiny of many saints whose eyes are quick to detect any shortcoming
As Balaam was prophesying, it seemed that God was saying, 'The children of Israel are very pleasant in My sight
If God were the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and there were no resurrection, then God would be the God of the dead
As those who are still in the flesh, it may be difficult for us to believe or to realize that we are in resurrection
We need to be strong in faith and declare that we are in resurrection because our God is not the God of the dead but the God of the living
Because the very God who indwells us is the God of resurrection, we have a basis for declaring that we are in resurrection
Individually we are a thorn-bush, and together we are a corporate thorn-bush burning with the God of resurrection
We have seen that the record of the call of Moses is the most complete record in the Bible pertaining to God's calling
When Moses came to the back side of the desert and met God there, he beheld the sign of a thorn-bush that burned without being consumed
The serpent in Exodus 4 is the very serpent in Genesis 3, the one who is called 'the ancient serpent' in the book of Revelation
The serpent, leprosy, and blood are related respectively to Satan, to sin in the flesh, and to the death brought in by the world
If he does not know how to deal with Satan, the flesh, and the world, you should not believe that he is a sent one
The Bible reveals that the serpent always tries to hide himself in something, behind something, or under something
In the eyes of Moses the rod was simply a rod that he could lean upon but in the eyes of God it was the serpent whose aim is to usurp man
To God the serpent is hidden in that job, because from his hiding place within the job, Satan, the serpent, seeks to usurp the brother
We may rely upon many persons or things our wife or husband our parents our children our ability our education our property our bank account
When it was cast down, it was no longer lovable to him because the serpent who had been concealed within it all the while was exposed
The young people in the Lord's recovery should attend college and study diligently, not for themselves, but for the Lord
They should not get married according to the common way, but should get married in a way that is not common, in the way that is for God
One who claims to be sent by the Lord must know that the serpent is hiding in every person, in every matter, and in every thing
He must know how to cast that hiding place to the ground and then he must know how to deal with that situation by the 'tail'
If we handle a person or a thing in a natural way, that person or thing will become a hiding place of the serpent
Those persons or things we rely upon must eventually be cast down and then taken back again at the word of the Lord
When young saints are disappointed with a particular situation, they may want to deal with it by throwing it away
Of throwing it away, they should keep it, not by themselves or for themselves, but by the Lord and for the Lord
If we have learned this lesson, this is a strong sign, strong evidence, that we have been called by God and sent by Him
Moses may have thought that by putting his hand into his bosom, he would find a pearl, a diamond, or some precious treasure
After Moses was shown the sign of the hand that became leprous, he knew that his flesh was the embodiment of leprosy
If we would be such gifts to the Body, we must know that our flesh is the incarnation of rottenness, corruption, uncleanness, and sin
Moses 'put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh'
If you keep the water of the Nile in a well, a vessel, or a pitcher, you will still regard this water as the source of supply and enjoyment
Those who have been called by God and sent by Him know the serpent, leprosy, and blood; that is, they know Satan, the flesh, and the world
According to the New Testament, Satan is against Christ ; the flesh is against the Holy Spirit ; and the world is against the Father
The Devil works against the Son, the flesh strives against the Spirit, and the world frustrates people from coming back to the Father
If we lack these three qualifications, then we have not been called by God and therefore cannot be His sent ones
If we would understand the calling of Moses in full, we need to consider even the small portions of chapter four as part of this calling
When the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples, He sent them out two by two , that is, in the principle of two as a testimony
To be alone is to be individualistic, but to be sent forth with another is to be sent according to the principle of the Body
Although this was according to God's principle, God did not simply tell Moses that he needed Aaron to match him
The whole of verse 14 says, 'And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?
Although the Lord was ready to do this, He did not point this out to Moses until he himself became conscious of his need
If we are clear about what was in the Lord's heart, we can understand why the Lord's anger was kindled against Moses
For this reason, it is rather difficult to understand the appearing of the Angel of Jehovah in the Old Testament
According to the record, the conversation was more like that between friends than like that between the almighty God and a human being
It is not the kind of anger that he would ever show toward anyone else; for it is an anger that expresses a sweet, intimate feeling
His reaction forced the Lord, in His pleasant anger toward Moses, to open His heart regarding Aaron as Moses' match
According to the divine principle, the proper representation of the Body is always by those members who are matched with others
The Lord had prepared Aaron for Moses, and, no matter how difficult it was, Moses had no choice except to take him as his match
In Numbers 12 there is recorded an incident involving Aaron and Miriam which shows how difficult it was for Moses to be matched by Aaron
There is very little coordination between Christian workers because they lack the vision of the principle of the Body
The Lord's service is not a race run by individuals; it is a race run by those who are bound to another member of the Body
By yourself you may be able to accomplish a great deal, but what you do will not be very profitable for the building of the Body
In cutting the foreskin of her son, Zipporah did not use a knife; she used a sharp stone, a flint, an unusual cutting instrument
The use of a sharp stone also seems to indicate that the circumcision was carried out in an atmosphere of unpleasantness
Had there been a pleasant atmosphere, no doubt Zipporah would have expressed her repentance and fellowshipped with Moses
As soon as he begins to love the Lord, to go the Lord's way, and to live for the Lord, the wife is exposed as being a 'Gentile,' a 'heathen'
A wife who has been a Christian for years may suddenly behave like one who is not separated unto God and who does not live for God
They are Christians in that they have been regenerated and have received the divine life, but they are not Christians in their daily walk
As soon as he begins to live for the Lord, his wife behaves like a heathen Zipporah, a woman not wholly separated unto the Lord
In his situation there is something that is not circumcised, something that is common, unholy, and not separated, sanctified, to the Lord
As they were on the way to fulfill God's commission, Zipporah was somewhat agreeable with what Moses was doing
Without circumcision, it is impossible to participate in the covenant God made with Abraham regarding the inheritance of the good land
The meaning of God coming in to kill Moses was that an uncircumcised situation would cause him to be finished in the ministry of God
As Moses was on the way to carry out God's commission, God could not tolerate Moses' negligence in the matter of circumcision
Because the responsibility rested mainly upon her due to her opposition to the circumcision, she was forced to take action
As we make the spiritual application of this incident, we see that often wives cut their husbands in an unusual way
If the sisters bring this matter to the Lord in prayer, He will show them the unusual ways in which they cut their husbands
Sometimes the Lord places us in an environment where we are cut by others, perhaps by our dear brothers in the Lord
To handle the matching ones is difficult, but to manage the cutting ones is more difficult because it makes us a 'bloody husband'
We shall consider the purpose of God's calling in the next message; in this message we shall look at the other four aspects of God's calling
No other portion of the Word affords us as clear and profound a revelation of the divine name as the third chapter of Exodus
The male help, afforded by Aaron, was the matching, and the female help, provided by Zipporah, was the cutting
In Genesis we have the revelation of the house of God at Bethel, but we do not have the actual building of the house of God
Through this divine burning the holy fire was one with the thornbush and the thornbush was one with the fire which is the Triune God Himself
Even if we were to go back to the world, we could not eradicate the vision that has been burned into our being
Do not believe either in your weakness or in your strength, for both your weakness and your strength will pass away
When Timothy became ill, Paul exhorted him to take wine for the sake of his stomach and his frequent infirmities
We also believe in God as the God of resurrection; that is, we believe in Him as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
Although God did not release Paul from prison, Paul knew that, after his martyrdom, God would come in to resurrect him
In the days that followed we experienced what He was to us, and we saw His abundant spiritual blessing and even His material provision
After we see the vision of the burning thorn-bush and after we come to know who God is and what God is, we still need the three signs
We have pointed out that the rod which Moses had used for many years was a hiding place for the usurping serpent
Every called one must have the subjective knowledge that his flesh is a flesh of sin and that nothing good dwells in it
In the eyes of God's called one, the world is not filled with living water, but filled with the blood of death
In the church life the Lord will often raise up an environment that forces us to allow others to do what we can do
Our natural life must also be circumcised, either by those in our family or by the brothers and sisters in the church
Most Christians regard Moses as the highest servant of God in the Old Testament and Paul as the highest in the New Testament
The purpose of God's calling is firstly to deliver His chosen people out of the usurpation and tyranny of Pharaoh and Egypt
God is still seeking to deliver His chosen people out of the usurping hand of Satan and out of the tyranny of the world
In the world Satan is keeping God's chosen people, those destined for the fulfillment of God's purpose, under his usurping hand
It is easy to preach to people, but it is very difficult to bring them out of the usurpation and tyranny of Satan and the world
One aspect of God's purpose in His calling is to use us to bring others out of the usurpation and tyranny of Satan and the world
As soon as one is saved, he should be brought out of the world into the wilderness where there is no Egyptian element
We need to pray that the Lord will grant us the ability to bring His children out of the world and into the wilderness
People can listen to our preaching and even repent and receive the Lord, but still remain in their tombs in Egypt
In 3:12 the Lord told Moses, 'When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain'
Not only do we need to be separated from the world, but in this realm of separation we need to ascend to an elevated place
His speaking delivers us from Egypt; it rescues us from the usurping hand of Satan and from the tyranny of the world
We realize that He desires to have a people who walk according to His statutes and who build Him a tabernacle that He may dwell among them
With the tabernacle we do not yet have the solid building, which is signified by the temple in the land of Canaan
The distance from Egypt to Mount Sinai is approximately one-fourth of the distance from Egypt to the land of Canaan
From Mount Sinai God's chosen people had to journey onward until they came into Canaan, a good land flowing with milk and honey
Some of the more familiar types are the Passover, the crossing of the Red Sea, the manna, and the water from the cleft rock
If Canaan typified heaven with the heavenly mansions, then this would mean that the heaven where God dwells is filled with enemies
Iron is for warfare, power, authority, protection, and, ultimately, for the building up of the kingdom and the temple
The riches of Christ as typified by the produce of the land of Canaan are covered in detail in the book The All-Inclusive Christ
We have the concept of good behavior, but we do not have the concept of taking Christ as our life and of living by Him
Although we have heard messages about this, we must confess that, in a practical way, we do not live out Christ very much
We can sing Theres a Man in the glory whose life is for me or maybe change the words to Theres a Man in my spirit whose life is for me
In John 16:9 the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit would convict the world concerning sin 'because they do not believe in Me'
In addition to this commandment concerning believing, God commands us, the believers in Christ, to live by Christ
One reason for the difficulty is that instead of seeking Christ Himself, we seek holiness, victory, or spirituality
Although we have heard so much about living by Christ, in our daily living we do not practice what we have heard
We need to be stirred up so that we may go forward to enter into the land, to labor on the land, and to enjoy the rich produce of the land
The difference between the church and a social organization is that the church is an entity constituted of Christ
As God's called ones, we need to see that the purpose of God's calling is not just to save people out of the world
Ultimately, the purpose of His calling is to bring His people into the good land so that they may enjoy Christ in His all-inclusiveness
By bringing His chosen people into the good land, God will be able to have a dwelling place built up on the earth
These four books unveil Christ not merely as the lamb, but as the all-inclusive One, that is, as the all-inclusive land
It is also there that the evil principalities and powers, typified by the wicked peoples in the land of Canaan, are to be defeated
We, the called ones, must deliver people out of the world and bring them into the heavenly places to deal with the principalities and powers
After the Israelites entered into the good land, they did not fight against the Egyptians, but fought against the nations in the land
These powers that occupy the heavenly places seek to frustrate us from the enjoyment of the riches of the all-inclusive Christ
In order to enjoy Christ in His all-inclusiveness, we must defeat the principalities, rulers, powers, and authorities in the heavenly places
It is to bring them into the rich and all-inclusive good land to defeat God's enemy and to enjoy the riches of Christ
All these points are fully developed in Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians, four books which are the heart of the Bible
We need to bring people all the way from the world into the all-inclusive Christ for God's kingdom and God's building
What we need today for the accomplishment of God's purpose is the genuine experience of Christ as the good land of Canaan
In this message we shall consider the three stations in the fulfilling of God's purpose as they are mentioned in Exodus 3
Many Christian teachers have emphasized the importance of the experience of the children of Israel in the wilderness
Although elsewhere in the Bible the wilderness has this significance, this is not the meaning of the wilderness in 3:18
The wilderness, the place of separation from the world, is the first station in God's deliverance of His chosen people from Egypt
It is not difficult to see the significance of these types however hardly any Christians realize that the good land is also a type of Christ
The children of Israel came out of Egypt and into the wilderness by the enjoyment of the Passover and through the baptism in the Red Sea
The second station is the mountain , where the children of Israel received revelation concerning God and concerning the tabernacle
For hundreds of years they had been under darkness in Egypt where there was no light, no word, and no speaking of God
The children of Israel went on to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water , and they camped there by the waters
When the children of Israel murmured because there was no water, God brought forth living water from the cleft rock
All these items signify various aspects of Christ as our life supply, the very supply God uses to bring us to the mountain
Many of us can testify that before we came into the church life, we were not at the mountain, the place of revelation
Many of us in the Lord's recovery have seen the revelation on the mountain and have shared with others in the building of the tabernacle
Before the children of Israel came to the mountain, the wilderness was positive, for it was just a place of separation
On the mountain, Moses received a revelation both of what God is and of the kind of life the people of God should live
Because God is holy, righteous, and loving, His people should live a life characterized by holiness, righteousness, and love
Chapters twenty through twenty-four of Exodus reveal that God is detailed in His holiness, righteousness, and other divine attributes
We see that God wants us to live according to what He is because the desire of His heart is to have a dwelling place on earth
Before the tabernacle was built, a detailed revelation regarding every aspect of it was given to Moses in chapters twenty-five to thirty-one
The remaining chapters cover the experience of the children of Israel at the mountain and tell of the building of the tabernacle
The church life we have today is not the temple church life; rather, it is the movable church life, the tabernacle
Many Christians, however, have not yet reached the stage of the tabernacle, the temporary church life, much less that of the solid building
Because the tabernacle is merely the temporary dwelling place of God, we should not be satisfied with the church life in this stage
The tabernacle in the wilderness was the temporary building, but the temple in the good land was the consummate building
For this reason, the children of Israel had to journey onward to the third station and enter into the good land
We have seen the factors that brought the children of Israel into the wilderness and that brought them in the wilderness to the mountain
When the children of Israel entered into the good land, the ark went down into the Jordan, and the waters stopped
If our Christ is only the Passover Lamb, the manna, and the rock with the living water, how can we walk in Him?
We have seen that the children of Israel enjoyed the Passover lamb, the unleavened bread, the manna, and the rock with the living water
The descendants in the flesh are the nation of Israel, and the descendants by faith are those who believe in Christ
Christ with such a church life is the factor by which we enter into the all-inclusive Christ typified by the land of Canaan
My burden in this message is to point out that there is no need for us to wander through the wilderness with the ark and the tabernacle
We ascended the mountain where we saw the vision concerning God, concerning the life of God's people, and concerning God's dwelling place
Gods chosen people had to cross two bodies of water the Red Sea which deals with the world and the Jordan River which deals with the self
After the children of Israel entered into the good land by crossing the Jordan, they were circumcised; that is, their flesh was cut off
Through the rich enjoyment of the allinclusive land Gods people were strengthened to fight against Gods enemy and to establish Gods kingdom
The Old Testament reveals two stages of the church life, the stage of the tabernacle and the stage of the temple
Our church life today may not yet be in the stage of the temple, but may still be in the stage of the tabernacle
The main hindrances to entering into the all-inclusive Christ are not worldliness and sin; they are the self and the flesh
If we are absolute to go on with the Lord, we shall eventually become willing to have our self and flesh dealt with
It was the riches of the land, not the manna in the wilderness, that enabled them to fight against the enemies in the good land
After the children of Israel entered into the good land, they had to defeat the Canaanites, the enemies that were occupying the land
These enemies typify the principalities and powers in the air that seek to keep us from enjoying the all-inclusive Christ
Within us we are troubled by the self and the flesh, and above us, in the air, there are the evil powers of darkness
We have pointed out that the good land for us today is the Triune God processed to become the all-inclusive Spirit
The Triune God is not only our Creator, Redeemer, Savior, Master, and Lord; He is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
Because God's desire is that Christ be lived out of us, even our natural virtue is a form of rebellion against God and His economy
In Romans 8:4 Paul says that the righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled by those who walk according to spirit
Do not think that the land of Canaan is far away and that you must wander for years before you can enter into it
The good land is within us, for it is the processed God who is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit
Like Caleb in Numbers 13:30, we must believe and declare that through the church life with Christ we are well able to possess this good land
Praise the Lord that we have enjoyed the Passover, the sweet water, the manna, and the living water from the cleft rock
We all have the ark with the tabernacle, Christ with the movable church life, as the factor by which to enter into the land
Because of this factor, we may have the boldness to enter into our spirit to enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit as the good land
God's demand and Pharaoh's resistance issued in a number of conflicts, which are recorded in chapters five through fourteen of Exodus
Even when the children of Israel were in a dreadful situation in Egypt, God still regarded them not as Jacob, but as Israel
In His dealings with Satan, the persecutor and usurper, God told him that He is the God of a transformed, victorious, and kingly people
You may not believe this today, but you will certainly believe it in the future, either in the next age or in eternity
If a representative of a certain nation is to negotiate with the government of the United States, he must have a proper title
The three main festivals were the Passover, including the feast of unleavened bread; the feast of weeks ; and the feast of tabernacles
At those times the people were not allowed to do any work; anyone who worked on those festival days would be cut off from God's people
According to God, real worship is our enjoyment of God as our provision and then our rest in what we enjoy of Him
In God's salvation, we have been brought out of such cities into the desert, where there is no human culture and no worldly building
After the three days' journey, the children of Israel passed through the Red Sea, in which the Egyptian forces were buried
Three of them may desire to attend the church meeting as they usually do, but the others may restrain them and encourage them to stay home
If you check with your experience, you will see that many times you have frustrated yourself from feasting unto the Lord
You have kept yourself away from the meetings of the church, perhaps with tiredness as your excuse for not attending the church feast
Although you may have claimed to be too tired to attend the meetings, you were full of energy to talk on the telephone
In a very practical way, this means that if we keep ourselves from the church meetings, we are like Pharaoh who denied the Lord
Whenever we gather together according to the Lord's ordination, we hold a feast unto the Lord and we sacrifice to our God
Suppose a dinner of many courses is prepared and set on your dining table at home and you sit down to eat it by yourself
In verse 8 Pharaoh said And the number of the bricks which they did make heretofore ye shall lay upon them ye shall not reduce any of it
Pharaoh said of the children of Israel, 'For they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God'
According to Pharaoh, it was because of idleness that the Israelites wanted to go into the wilderness to sacrifice to their God
In the eyes of today's Pharaohs, especially in the eyes of the opposers and the unbelievers, we in the Lord's recovery are idle
In verse 9 Pharaoh said, 'Let the labor be heavier on the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard vain words'
What we are doing in the church life may be idle in the eyes of the worldly people, but what they are doing is vanity in the eyes of God
Someone who is too busy must be trained to be idle, that is, to spend some time with the saints in the meetings of the church
Today those in the fallen world care for nothing but their existence; they do not care for the purpose of their existence
Anything that exceeds our need becomes worldly, 'Egyptian,' something of Pharaoh, and it frustrates us from the economy of God's purpose
Our living and our existence depend on the provision from the heavenly source, not on the supply from the world
It is a positive sign, for it indicates that God's negotiation with the enemy is taking place and that we are affected by it
We expect the dead to be resurrected, the sick to be healed, the weak to be strengthened, and the poor to be enriched
After Moses expressed his discouragement and bewilderment to the Lord, Jehovah God came in to reconfirm His name and His covenant
By God's reconfirmation, Moses was strengthened and encouraged both to go back to Pharaoh and to speak again to the children of Israel
In brief, the Lord's name is what He Himself is, and His covenant is His word spoken with a promise and confirmed with an oath
A word spoken in an ordinary way is not a covenant, but a word spoken with a promise and confirmed with an oath becomes a covenant
God spoke to Abraham; then He spoke with a promise concerning the good land, a promise that was confirmed again and again
God wants us to take a three days' journey into the wilderness so that we may hold a feast unto Him and sacrifice to Him
After the first conflict between God and Pharaoh, Moses, who was God's representative, was troubled and discouraged
The answer rests in the fact that it is one thing to know a particular name and it is another thing to know God by that very name
To know the name of Jesus is one thing, but to know the Lord Jesus in an experiential way by His name is another
In the same principle, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob knew the name Jehovah, but they did not know God by this name
When God spoke to Moses in 6:1-8, He did not speak as El Shaddai, the promising God, but as Jehovah, the fulfilling God
God did not make a promise to Moses regarding the good land; rather, He came to fulfill the promise He had made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
In order for God to be the fulfilling God, He must be the existing God; that is, He must be the self-existing One
As the One who promised, He is El Shaddai; but as the One who fulfills what He has promised, He is Jehovah, the One who is
If God were not the self-existing One and the ever-existing One, the promise made thousands of years ago could not be fulfilled
The Lord spoke this way to Moses because Moses had complained to Him about the result of his negotiation with Pharaoh
The stage of fulfillment includes the fulfillment of the promises made both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament
It is rather easy to know Him by the name El Shaddai and to declare that He is rich, almighty, and all-sufficient
That night not only did the Lord unveil His word to me, but He also unveiled Himself as the One who fulfills His promises
Because Jehovah exists eternally and because He is the reality of the verb to be, He will fulfill whatever He has spoken
In Genesis 15 that promise became a covenant, and in Genesis 17 circumcision was enacted as a token of that covenant
In Genesis 14 Abraham told the king of Sodom that he had lifted up his hand unto the most high God not to take anything from him
By the lifting up of the Lord Jesus, God made a great oath that caused His promises to become the new covenant
From now on we need to tell Him that what we are doing is according to His covenant, the very covenant which He has sworn to fulfill
In fighting the battle for the Lord's interests, not only do we stand with God's pure Word, but we also stand with His covenant
In the same principle, today's Pharaoh- Satan and the Satan-possessed and usurped self-is not easily dealt with either
Do not be troubled by any opposition to the Lord's recovery, and do not be discouraged when religion rises up against us
We have pointed out that God's calling of Moses in chapters three and four of this book is the most complete call in the Bible
In speaking to Moses about these two matters, God was training him to know His person and His faithful word in His covenant
In addition to speaking to Moses regarding His name and His covenant, the Lord gave Moses further training concerning six other matters
If we would follow the Lord today to carry on His testimony in His recovery, we must learn to regard God's repeated word of assurance
We think that if God sends us to speak to people in a certain place, their hearts will be open to receive whatever we may say
If we had been Moses in that situation and had had to confront the stubbornness of Pharaoh, we would no doubt have been very discouraged
We need to learn that God's chosen people are full of unbelief, that the enemy is stubborn, and that we are natural
After the further training given to Moses in chapters six and seven, Moses did not receive any additional training
In the last message we covered two of the positive aspects of God's further training: God's name and God's covenant
As God was assuring Moses it seems He was saying Moses forget the peoples unbelief forget Pharaoh and forget the condition of your lips
God assured Moses that He would take the children of Israel to Him for a people and that He would be a God to them
The Lord would do whatever was necessary to cause the children of Israel to know that He was Jehovah, their God
Naturally speaking, what Moses said to the Lord regarding the children of Israel and regarding Pharaoh was true
What we are doing in the recovery today is not according to our plan; it is according to the Lord's covenant and His word of assurance
If you are sent by the Lord to a particular place for the church life, do not believe the negative things in the environment
Elders in the churches may actually prefer the children of Israel to the saints in the church in their locality
He may have thought that his speech would become so powerful that everyone, including Pharaoh, would obey his word
Those who are called by the Lord today may pray and expect that He will endue their speaking with miraculous power
To have this attitude indicates that we depend on what we are and on what we can do, not on what the Lord is and on what He can do
Although the Lord told Moses that He had made him God to Pharaoh , He would not do anything about the condition of Moses' lips
Although God had spoken marvelous words of assurance, Moses did not pay attention to them due to his natural concept
Because we cling to our natural insistence, natural tendency, and natural understanding, we may read the Bible without receiving any light
Because those who have received God's commission are His representatives, it is a serious matter to touch them in an improper way
In his negotiations with Pharaoh, Moses' word was to be backed by the strong hand and mighty judgments of the Lord
God demanded that Pharaoh let His people go into the wilderness a three days' journey to hold a feast unto Him
In the last plague, all the firstborn in the land of Egypt died, from the firstborn of Pharaoh to the firstborn of the maidservants
During the great tribulation, the seven plagues will enable God's people to make their final exodus from the world
Verse 12 says, 'For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods'
Just as Aarons rod swallowed up the rods of the Egyptian magicians so the preaching of the gospel swallows up todays philosophical teachings
We experienced this many times in our gospel preaching in China, where there were many 'magicians,' or philosophical teachers
Aaron did so, and throughout the whole land of Egypt the water was turned into blood, even the water in vessels of wood and of stone
The first plague gives a thorough indication that the life of Egypt, that is, the life of the world, issues in nothing but death
If we realize the significance of this plague, we shall know that under the wrath of God's judgment the life of the world issues in death
Through that exposure we saw that worldly entertainments and amusements are not the real pleasures, but are pleasures that issue in death
According to Revelation 16, near the end of the great tribulation God will once again change the water of the world into blood
The Lord Jesus Himself indicated that those who do not receive His word will be judged by the very word they reject
The purpose of the first plague was to make the Egyptians know that their worldly supply and enjoyment issued in death
The magicians of Egypt were able to do the same thing with their enchantments as Moses and Aaron had done with the rod
God longs to rescue His chosen people from every form of usurpation and preoccupation so that they may have nothing besides God Himself
After the children of Israel had been delivered from Egypt and had passed through the Red Sea, they came to Mount Horeb, the mountain of God
At one time, God's people were in Egypt, living an Egyptian life and performing Egyptian labor under the tyranny of Pharaoh
The first chapters of Exodus reveal that God's people had been usurped by Satan and were held in bondage under Satan's hand
When the children of Israel came to Mount Horeb, God was their center, their purpose, their business, and their very life
Not only were the ten plagues a warning and a punishment to the Egyptians, but they were also a revelation, an unveiling, to God's people
By means of these plagues, the children of Israel must have come to see the actual situation of Egyptian living
If we see God's purpose as it is disclosed in the book of Exodus, it will be easier for us to understand the significance of the plagues
God's intention in sending the plagues was not only to punish the Egyptians; it was also to expose the Egyptian living
Like the Egyptians in the book of Exodus, the people in the world today have no understanding of the actual situation of life in the world
By coming upon Pharaoh, all his servants, and all the Egyptians, the frogs destroyed the enjoyment of the comfortable Egyptian living
Everything you gather up from the 'Nile,' the source of supply for the world, will be a cause of trouble to you
When the things we treasure turn into 'frogs,' then we realize that the enjoyment of the world is not the true enjoyment
They were everywhere-in their houses, in their bedrooms, upon their beds, in their ovens, and in their kneading troughs
Certain philosophical teachers also are able to make people realize that the things of the world usurp them and damage them
Evangelists expose the real situation of living in the world, but some 'magicians' or philosophers can do the same thing
When Moses cried unto the Lord concerning the frogs, the Lord did according to Moses' word , and the frogs died out
In the same principle, a proper evangelist not only brings forth 'frogs,' but also causes them to be driven away
The plague of the lice was not only a punishment but also a revelation that ultimately the dust of Egypt produces lice not grain for food
If God had suddenly destroyed all the Egyptians, there would have been no warning, no reminder, and no revelation
In His wisdom and mercy, God used lice to expose the situation of the living in Egypt and to encourage His people to get out of Egypt
The plague of the frogs unveils the nature of the water in Egypt, whereas the plague of the lice unveils the nature of the dust in Egypt
The dust becoming lice indicates that the source of the supply of our living in the world eventually becomes a cause of irritation
Although water and dust were created for us by God, they have been taken over by Satan and used for his own evil purpose
The first three plaguesthe plagues of the blood the frogs and the liceunveil to us the nature meaning and result of living in the world
In His mercy, God has shown us a vivid picture that unveils the nature, meaning, and consequence of living in the world
If we would grasp the revelation in the book of Exodus we need to see that God desires His people to build a dwelling place for Him on earth
In the first fourteen chapters of Exodus, there was a struggle between God and Pharaoh, the representative of Satan
If the Egyptians had received mercy, they would have seen the nature, meaning, and result of the life in the world
The plagues of blood and frogs are related to water, whereas the plague of lice is related to the dust of the earth
Flies swarmed in the air, pestilence was carried through the air, and ashes that caused boils were sprinkled into the air
According to His righteousness, God should have judged both the heavens and the earth immediately after the fall of Adam
Because of the redemption of Christ, God is wholly just and righteous whether He keeps the universe or destroys it
Pharaoh and the Egyptians rejected the redemption ordained by God and thus made themselves naked and exposed to God's judgment
When God sent the plagues upon the Egyptians, they were not under God's redemption, but were exposed to His judgment
The children of Israel, however, remained under the redemption of Christ, for God had put a redemption between them and Pharaoh's people
All the people of the world are actually enjoying the benefit of Christ's redemption, although they have no realization of it
At the time of Pharaoh's resistance to God, Pharaoh and the Egyptians exposed themselves to God's righteous judgment
In the sixth conflict between the Lord and Pharaoh, the Lord sent upon Pharaoh and all the Egyptians swarms of flies
These swarms of flies signify the pollution in the atmosphere of the world today pollution caused by immorality that pervades the atmosphere
Because of the fall of man, the moral atmosphere of the world has been polluted; it is full of noisome swarms of insects
In order for them to realize this, God must come in to expose it to them thoroughly, just as He did to the Egyptians through the plagues
The animals that were subject to the plague were of two categories: those used for transportation and those used for food
The Egyptians depended upon their cattle for transportation and food, but in the fifth plague even the cattle were judged
Because the cattle in Egypt were related to Pharaoh and served Pharaoh, they were subject to the righteous judgment of God upon Pharaoh
Under God's righteousness, we who love the Lord become a factor of blessing to others, even to society as a whole
Because the people of the world were hindering God's people from fulfilling His purpose, God came in to judge the way of living in Egypt
The more the Egyptians were judged, the more the children of Israel were enlightened regarding the living of Egypt
The Lord told Moses and Aaron to take handfuls of ashes from the furnace and to sprinkle them toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh
The ashes scattered into the air by Moses and Aaron must have been filled with germs because they became dust that caused boils
Such a prayer will put us under the redemption of Christ, and the anointing will restrict us from spreading ashes
The first is that these plagues did not affect the land of Goshen, because the children of Israel were under the Lord's redemption
We have pointed out that certain of the philosophers of the world may teach things similar to what we teach in the preaching of the gospel
No other portion in the Bible shows us such a detailed picture of the worldly life as it opposes God's building
If they are willing to be rescued from the world unto God, God can work out His purpose on the earth to have His dwelling place
As we shall now see, in the third group of plagues God altered some of the principles that govern the functions of the universe
The Bible reveals that the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man with his human spirit is for God
Genesis 25 indicates that in order for things to grow there is the need of two things rain to water the earth and a man to till the ground
In this plague God changed one of the functions of the universe; that is, He changed one of the natural principles governing the universe
If our relationship with God is proper, He sends the spiritual rain upon us to water the garden in our spirit and to quench our thirst
In the eighth plague, which took place during the tenth conflict , we see a change in another function of the universe
In the eleventh conflict between the Lord and Pharaoh, 'there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days'
Exodus 10:23 says of the Egyptians, 'They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days'
When Pharaoh heard this he told them that evil was before them meaning that the young ones were in danger of being accidently hurt or killed
All parents know that it is extremely difficult for them to leave their children behind, because their heart is set on their children
Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the eighth plague, the plague of the locusts, came upon Pharaoh and the Egyptians
To this bargain Moses responded, 'Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto Jehovah our God
We may be very careful about losing our temper, but we may be extremely careless in guarding our hearts from loving the world
Sinfulness is against God's righteousness, whereas worldliness is against God's holiness, which is higher than His righteousness
Some modernistic teachers have argued that God was not righteous in interfering with the situation in Pharaoh's territory
Spontaneously we shall see that the things of the world are not lovable, and we shall automatically stop loving the world
Between the blood and the darkness are the frogs, the lice, the flies, the pestilence, the boils, the hail, and the locusts
If we have a detailed vision of the world, we shall know God's attitude toward it, and we shall spontaneously cease to love it
According to Galatians 1:4, Christ gave Himself for our sins in order to deliver us from this present evil age
They still need to realize that everything related to the life of the world goes from death to death, with various plagues in between
If we love the world, every function in our universe will be changed, and all the resources of life will be destroyed
Before we go on to consider the final conflict between God and Pharaoh, we need to consider Pharaoh's subtle bargaining
In the eyes of both God and Satan, the children of Israel passed through the burial of the Red Sea and entered into resurrection
By means of such a journey, God's people not only come out of Egypt, but they also enter, in resurrection, into a new environment
When the children of Israel entered into the wilderness, they were separated from everything Egyptian, from everything worldly
Through burial and resurrection we have passed out of the world into the wilderness, where we are separated to the Lord
According to our experience, when we hold a feast unto the Lord, enjoying Him in His presence, our heart is deeply touched by the Lord Jesus
As we offer Christ to the Father, the Father is pleased, happy, and satisfied by us through our sacrifice of Christ
The second stage of Pharaoh's bargaining is seen in his telling Moses and Aaron, 'Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land'
When we have finished reasoning with Him, He simply exercises His finger to deal with us by means of another plague
If the children of Israel had agreed not to go very far away, Pharaoh could have reached them whenever he wanted them
Sometimes today's Pharaohs will allow us to believe in the Lord Jesus, just as long as we do not go to what they regard as an extreme
Unable to bear the plagues, Pharaoh became willing to let the men of Israel go to serve their God, but not with the young and the old
Moses answered Pharaoh in an excellent way Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrifice unto Jehovah our God
Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve Jehovah our God'
Moses did not say that the people needed cattle for their living; the cattle were needed to provide something to sacrifice to the Lord
If we remain in Egypt after believing in the Lord, our sins may be forgiven, but we shall not be rescued from the tyranny of Satan
Their baptism should have been the crossing of the Red Sea, but it was merely a ritual for them to become part of religion
We may think that after a long period of time the Lord will change His mind, only to discover that the Lord is more insistent than ever
Having been saved, they thoroughly plundered the world and brought a good number of things with them out of the world for the Lord
We have pointed out that the materials given to the Israelites by the Egyptians were used in building the tabernacle
The silver was used to make sockets, and the gold was used to overlay the boards and other furnishings in the tabernacle
The argument concerning this is related to whether God hardened Pharaoh's heart or Pharaoh hardened his own heart
On the one hand 101 says that the Lord hardened his heart but on the other hand in 1020 we see that the Lord made Pharaohs heart hard
According to the meaning of the Hebrew words used, Pharaoh's heart became not only hard, but also stubborn and obstinate
The fact that Moses uses different words to describe the hardening of Pharaoh's heart indicates the seriousness of this matter
In Romans 9:16 Paul says, 'So then, it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy'
To be a vessel of mercy and of honor unto glory does not depend on our willing or our running, but on God's mercy to us
The only thing we can say to explain God's mercy to us is that in His sovereignty He has chosen to be merciful to us
In the universe there are three things that cannot be denied: God's sovereignty, God's mercy, and man's free will
In His greatness, wisdom, and love, God gave man the opportunity to choose Him by placing him in front of two trees
In the case of our salvation, God initiated our believing in the Lord Jesus, but He did not execute it by believing for us
On the one hand, we must worship God for His sovereignty, but, on the other hand, we must fulfill our responsibility
If we see this, we shall humble ourselves under God's sovereignty and spontaneously take up our responsibility
The more we are willing to bear our responsibility, the stronger is the sign that we have been predestinated by God
Suppose, however, that we have the attitude that because everything is according to God's sovereignty, we are not responsible to do anything
We see that we need to humble ourselves under God's sovereignty and, at the same time, carry out our responsibility
We have pointed out that some verses say that God hardened Pharaoh's heart, whereas other verses say that God made Pharaoh's heart hard
In the same principle, in some places we are told that Pharaoh hardened his heart but elsewhere, that Pharaoh's heart was hard
Once something negative comes forth and your heart is hardened, you will have only one choice, and that is to reject God
At first, there were two choices in front of them, and it was still possible for them to change their direction
We need to look to the Lord that we may be not vessels of wrath like Pharaoh, but, like Moses, vessels of mercy and honor unto glory
Otherwise, God would have lost the opportunity to make His power known and to declare His name throughout the earth
Using Pharaoh as an example, Paul pointed out that the Lord 'has mercy on whom He wills, and He hardens whom He wills'
Pharaoh, the troubled one, could do nothing with Moses, the troubling one, because Moses was backed by the sovereign Lord
Moses, therefore, is an example of one who had received mercy from God, whereas Pharaoh is an example of one who was wholly set aside by God
Through the twelve conflicts and the ten plagues that transpired over a period of time, God's sovereignty was made known
The plague of hail damaged the environment, and the locusts devoured all that remained after the severe damage caused by the hail
In the confrontation between Moses and Pharaoh, we see a display of God's sovereignty on the one hand and of His mercy on the other
In the tenth and last plague, the firstborn of the Egyptians and even the firstborn of their beasts were killed
That was the time the angels came to slay the firstborn, the strongest and most lovable ones in all the families in Egypt
After the children of Israel had left Egypt, Pharaoh regretted what he had done and pursued them with chariots
You will realize, even as you come to the meetings of the church, that you are under the Lord's sovereign mercy
We desire to come together in the Lord's presence, to listen to His word, to seek what is on His heart, and to practice being one with Him
In a time when so many are given to worldly entertainments, we have the desire to seek the Lord and to meet together in His presence
Exodus 11:3 says, 'The man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people'
Pharaoh was actually not listening to Moses and dealing with him; he was listening to God and dealing with God
As God's sent ones, we need to have the assurance that wherever we may be, we are there as God's representatives
By Pharaoh God made Himself manifest as the sovereign God, but in Moses God had one to represent Him and to execute His will
The Passover portrayed in Exodus 12 is a clear, adequate, and even all-inclusive type of the redemption of Christ
Why did God tell the children of Israel to use a bunch of hyssop to sprinkle the blood on the lintel and doorposts?
Although the New Testament reveals the various aspects of redemption, these aspects are not systematized in a doctrinal way
In Genesis 4 Abel 'brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof' and presented them to the Lord
Anyone who does not have a sacred age as well as a civil age is not a genuine believer in Christ and cannot share in Christ as the Passover
According to Genesis 8:4, Noah's ark landed on the mountains of Ararat on the seventeenth day of the seventh month
On the day we first called on the name of the Lord, believed in Him, and were saved, life began to bud and sprout from within us
We enjoy the eighth day, the first day of the week, the beginning of a new week, a new beginning in resurrection
The fact that the Passover was held on the fourteenth day of the month means that it was held at the end of two complete weeks
After a lamb had been selected, it was examined for four days to test it, to find out whether or not it had blemishes
During those four days the Lord Jesus was examined by the congregation of Israel as represented by the priests elders scribes and Pharisees
The feast of Passover takes place on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, which lasts a total of seven days
In 123 the children of Israel were commanded to take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house
If a man's house was too small for the lamb, he and his neighbor were to come together to take one lamb according to the number of the souls
Verse 4 indicates that the lamb was both according to the number of the souls and according to every man's eating
The extent to which He can be enjoyed is both according to the number of people and according to our capacity to eat Him
Exodus 12:5 goes on to say that the lamb had to be 'a male of the first year,' taken either 'out from the sheep, or from the goats'
At the time of His crucifixion, He was both a sheep and a goat, depending from what angle His crucifixion is considered
Speaking of the Passover lamb, 12:6 says, 'The whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening'
They tied two legs of the lamb at the foot of the cross and fastened the other outstretched legs to the crossbar
They slew the lamb so that all its blood was shed, for they needed all of the blood to sprinkle on their door frames
The type of the Passover foreshadowed both the date and the way Christ would be put to death for our redemption
As the children of Israel applied the Passover lamb, they were in houses that had been sprinkled with the blood of the lamb
Once we are in Christ as the house, we are redeemed by the blood that has been sprinkled upon the lintel and doorposts of the house
In John 6:53 the Lord Jesus says that we must eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and in verse 55 He declares, 'My flesh is true food'
In 12:8 the children of Israel were given the proper way to eat the flesh of the Passover lamb: roasted with fire
To eat of Christ as if He were 'boiled with water' is to regard His death on the cross not as death for redemption, but as martyrdom
According to their concept, He was persecuted by man and died as a martyr, having sacrificed Himself for His teachings
If you believe that Christ died on the cross as a martyr because of man's persecution, then you eat the Passover lamb by boiling it in water
If you believe that He died as our Redeemer, being roasted by the holy fire of God, then you eat Him as the Passover lamb roasted in fire
The head signifies wisdom, the legs signify activity and move, and the inwards signify the various inward parts of Christ's being
According to 12:8, the children of Israel were to eat the flesh of the lamb with unleavened bread and bitter herbs
When we believed in the Lord Jesus, many of us received Him as our life supply and also gave up everything sinful
The fact that Christ's legs were not broken signifies that in Christ, the Passover lamb, there is something unbreakable and indestructible
The Roman soldiers and Jewish people could come together to put Christ on the cross, but they could not break His eternal life
In the same principle, Christ's unbroken bone signifies His unbreakable and indestructible eternal life that imparts His life into us
In Christ as our Passover lamb there is such an unbreakable and indestructible life that can impart life into us
The reason for all the detail is that God wants us to know the redemption of Christ in such a thorough way that we could never forget it
The children of Israel were told in 12:46 that none of the bones of the lamb used in the Passover were to be broken
The Passover lamb is wonderful, but if we do not know how to apply it, the lamb will have little meaning in our daily subjective experience
The prevailing concept seems to be that anyone who believes in the Lord Jesus should be placed in a palanquin and carried away to heaven
According to the picture in the book of Exodus, the redeemed ones applied the Passover in such a way that they could become God's army
When you heard the gospel, were you told to repent, believe in the Lord Jesus, receive Him, and then gird yourself up?
When we decided to take Christ as our Savior, inwardly we had the sense that we had been made ready for a long journey
Perhaps you did not have words for it, but the Holy Spirit did equip you in such a way and did lead you into a journey of fighting
Because they had to flee from the land of Egypt that night, they were required to eat the Passover lamb hastily
Even by the exercise of such a small amount of hyssop, the blood will be applied to him, and the entire Passover will be his
We should simply maintain our identification with Christ, with a constant realization that we are nothing and that He is everything
The greatest problem among believers today is that, in their experience, they are outside of Christ, apart from the oneness with Christ
If you read the book of Galatians, you will see that the Galatians had been distracted from the standing of redemption
Once we are saved, we need to remain in the very place where we have been redeemed, in the place where the blood has been sprinkled
The principle of redemption is that there is no need for us to do anything other than to exercise our hyssop, our faith, to apply the blood
If you are enlightened of the Lord, you may realize that even now you may be outside of the house, outside of Christ
Whenever we endeavor in our natural energy to please God, we leave the standing of the redeeming blood and are outside of Christ
The more we endeavor to do things, the more displeased He becomes, for our endeavors do not give Him any enjoyment
Most Christians are outside of the house trying to do things for the Lord; they are not in the house feasting unto the Lord
When some hear this, they may point out that the children of Israel left the house in order to make their exodus out of Egypt
It is sufficient to usher us into the house and to keep us from the judgment of God, but it is not sufficient to equip us
We have seen that Christ is not only the Passover lamb, but also the unleavened bread, the bitter herbs, and the house
The blood of the lamb was put on the lintel and the doorposts of the houses and all the lamb including the head legs and inwards was eaten
Continuing from the feast of the Passover, there was another feast, the feast of unleavened bread, which lasted seven days
Concerning the Passover, the emphasis in the Bible is mainly on the eating of the Passover, not on the keeping of the Passover
Exodus 12:15 says, 'Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses'
According to 12:19, no leaven was to be found in the houses, and according to 13:7, no leaven was to be seen with the children of Israel
Eating unleavened bread indicates that God's people should not live in sin, that is, should not live a sinful life
The function of sin is similar to the function of yeast; it softens things that are hard and makes them easier for us to take in
The children of Israel were to observe the feast of unleavened bread as a continuation of the feast of Passover
We have pointed out that when the children of Israel ate the Passover lamb, they were also required to eat unleavened bread
We have seen that the feast of the Passover lasted one day, whereas the feast of unleavened bread continued for seven days
From the time we received Christ and were saved and had a new beginning in life, we began to live a life without leaven, a life without sin
Although it is not possible for us to be without sin, we must deal with any sin that is manifested, with any sin that is seen
As soon as we refuse to deal with any sin that has been exposed, we no longer keep the feast of unleavened bread
Due to our serpentine nature, immediately after we were saved or revived, we made up our mind to do certain things
Even many zealous Christians are cut off from spiritual fellowship simply because they are engaged in so much work
As soon as a word is spoken against eating the Lord, it is followed by a suggestion that we work or engage in a certain activity
Our natural man is no different from an unbeliever, for our natural life is always quick to go along with the way of an unbeliever
Romans 4:4 and 5 say, 'Now to the one who works, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt
To the one who works not, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness'
If we remain in the natural man or regard ourselves as hired servants who work for recompense, we have no right to partake of the Passover
Although strangers and hired servants could not partake of the Passover, the purchased and circumcised servants were qualified to eat of it
If we are hired by a certain person to work for him, we are willing to work as long as we are happy with our employer
To be a hired one is, spiritually speaking, to work in our natural life for the purpose of receiving recompense
A purchased one is a person who has been lost, who has been bought back, and who has been dealt with by the cross
Exodus 12:44 says, 'But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then he shall eat thereof'
When a new believer has this realization, he is conscious of the fact that he has been purchased and circumcised
Many of today's Christians have received God's salvation blindly, not realizing that they need to be purchased and circumcised
Thank the Lord that we are the purchased and circumcised ones and that we eat the Passover according to God's principles
We need to continue our enjoyment of salvation by getting out of the world and becoming part of the army of the Lord
When we apply Christ as our Passover today, we need all the principles given in the account of the Passover in Exodus
Exodus 1212 says I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast
We cannot apply the Passover in a full way, because God does not allow the old man or the natural life to participate in His Passover
Without this part of 12:12, we would not realize that on the night of the Passover, Satan and all the demons were also judged
These items are not only portrayed in the picture of the Passover in Exodus, but they also are clearly revealed in the New Testament
When we keep the Passover according to the detailed principles ordained by God, then we apply the Passover in a proper way
The points we shall cover in this message concerning the exodus from Egypt are all to be found in the New Testament
Without the picture in the book of Exodus, it is difficult to say just how we are able to get out of the world
According to the picture in the book of Exodus, God's salvation includes the aspect of the Passover and the aspect of the exodus
All genuine Christians have experienced the Passover, but only a small minority of believers have experienced the exodus
To be rescued from the usurping hand of Satan and from the world, we need God's hand to subdue our environment
In this record we are told twice that 'by strength of hand' the Lord brought the children of Israel out of Egypt
Through Christ as our Passover we are saved from God's judgment, but by God's subduing hand we are saved from Satan and the world
Pharaoh and the Egyptians were subdued to such an extent that they actually drove the children of Israel out of Egypt
By the time of 12:33, 'the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste'
Our wife, husband, or relatives may charge us to go out; they may tell us that it is better for us to leave the world than to remain in it
After God subdues our environment and causes us to be driven out of the world, we shall discover that no time remains for sinful things
Before that time, we who ministered the Word tried to help certain people get rid of the 'leaven' in their lives
You may still want to practice certain sinful things, but because of physical infirmity you are no longer able to do so
Because God dealt with our environment, it was not possible for us to take leavened bread out of the world with us
God's goal in doing this is not the enrichment of His people; it is the building of the tabernacle, His dwelling place on earth
On the one hand, when Peter and John were asked for money by the beggar, they had no silver or gold to give him
When we, the chosen people of God, come out of the world under God's sovereign hand, we have no time to leaven anything
Apparently, it was unjust for the children of Israel to plunder the Egyptians of their gold, silver, and raiment
As we have pointed out, by plundering the wealth of Egypt, they were actually receiving righteous payment for their forced labor
The money they earn should not be used only for themselves or for their enjoyment; it should be used for the Lord's testimony
Eventually they received for their labor the riches of Egypt that were used for the building of the tabernacle Gods testimony not for Egypt
All those who realize what it means to come out of the world will work diligently not for their own welfare, but for the Lord's interests
If it is used for God's testimony, it will be another case of plundering the wealth of the world under the sovereignty of God
If there had been only a small number of people making their exodus out of Egypt, there would not have been a mixed multitude
We in the Lord's recovery today have also learned a great deal through the mixed multitude that has been with us
Exodus 12:40 and 41 say, 'Now the time of dwelling of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years
These four hundred thirty years began in Genesis 12 when God made the promise to Abraham that He would give the good land to Abraham's seed
For all these years the people God had chosen and to whom He had promised the good land had not been dwelling in the land of promise
According to Genesis 15:13-14 and Acts 7:6, the children of Israel were under persecution for four hundred years
From Genesis 12 to Genesis 21 there was a period of thirty years, and from Genesis 21 to Exodus 12 there was a period of four hundred years
For four hundred thirty years God's people were in a strange land, and for four hundred years they suffered persecution
According to God's promise and ordination, we should live in Christ as the good land and enjoy Him as the land
Although God has chosen and ordained us to live and dwell in Christ, many of His people are not dwelling in Christ
The account of the book of Exodus makes it clear that our exodus must be the termination of our period of sojourning
Only after the children of Israel had crossed the Red Sea were they fully delivered from Egypt and released to praise the Lord
During the night of the Passover, the children of Israel had satisfaction, rest, and joy, but they did not sleep
If we are not alert spiritually, we turn the day into night, but if we are watchful and observant, even our night will be turned into day
The fact that we are to march out of the world as God's army indicates that it is not an easy matter to make our exodus out of Egypt
In the previous message we saw that Pharaoh and the Egyptians were subdued by God; then they drove the children of Israel out of Egypt
From the standpoint of spiritual experience, chapter thirteen is not an insertion; it is a definite continuation of chapter twelve
Certainly this signifies a particular aspect of the spiritual experience of God's people in coming out of Egypt
Because the firstborn had been redeemed by the Passover lamb, all the firstborn both of man and of beast had to be sanctified to the Lord
For the sanctification of the firstborn, the oxen and the sheep did not need another kind of animal to be substituted for them
Since the firstborn of a donkey had already been redeemed by the Passover lamb, why did it need to be redeemed again in sanctification?
In order to be sanctified, to be offered on the altar to the Lord for His satisfaction, the donkey still had to be redeemed with a lamb
In verse 13 we are told that not only the firstling of the ass, but all the firstborn of man among the children of Israel had to be redeemed
As far as our nature is concerned, we all are 'donkeys,' unclean in the eyes of God and therefore not acceptable to Him for His satisfaction
Only by having Christ as our substitute can we be a living sacrifice to God that is acceptable and satisfying to Him
Not many realize that in order to be a living sacrifice to satisfy God, they also need Christ as their substitute in sanctification
After we have been saved through Christ as our Passover lamb, we need to take Him as our substitute for the beginning of a new, sinless life
Joseph 'took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence'
According to the picture, the bones that were taken out of the grave and brought into the good land signify resurrection life
The fact that Joseph's bones were brought into the good land indicates that the saints who have died will enter the kingdom in resurrection
The reason Joseph's bones are mentioned in 13:19 is to show us that the exodus is accomplished only in resurrection
According to our experience we can testify that without resurrection life there can be no exodus from the world
Immediately after the word about Joseph's bones, we have a record regarding the leading and guidance of the Lord
In order to have the Lord's leading and guidance, the buried bones must be raised out of the tomb and begin to move
According to the natural understanding, they certainly would have chosen the short way, not the roundabout way that involved a long detour
Although chapter thirteen may appear to be an insertion between chapters twelve and fourteen, actually it is not an insertion at all
To be sanctified and to have the new beginning of a sinless life are the first two requirements to be able to receive the Lord's guidance
After Christ had been revealed to Paul, Paul did not confer with flesh and blood; that is, he did not confer with the natural man
The Lord's leading and guidance are simply the Lord Himself in the pillar of fire by night and in the pillar of cloud by day
As the children of Israel marched out of Egypt in martial array, they were led by the pillar of fire or the pillar of cloud
We need to be sanctified, we need to have the new beginning of a sinless life, and we need to be in resurrection
Because of the possibility of war with the Philistines, God did not lead the children of Israel along that way
As 13:20 indicates, 'they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness'
If we had been God, we certainly would have led the people by another way, in order to avoid the possibility of pursuit by Pharaoh
Because the children of Israel were led this way, eventually they had to wander in the wilderness for thirty-eight years
We also see the resurrection life in which we enjoy the Lord's presence for guidance as the pillar of cloud and as the pillar of fire
Let us worship the Lord for His leading, even when He leads us, not in a straight way, but in a roundabout way
God's complete salvation for His chosen people includes the Passover, the exodus from Egypt, and the crossing of the Red Sea
The Passover signifies redemption; the exodus signifies the going out from the world; and the crossing of the Red Sea signifies baptism
It was necessary for God to have such a person as Pharaoh for the accomplishing of these three aspects of salvation
We can say that without him there would not have been the necessary environment for the institution of the Passover
During the night of the Passover, not only were the children of Israel saved, but the Egyptians and the evil power of darkness were judged
In a normal experience of salvation, we are redeemed, and the power of darkness within us and around us is judged
We have seen that time after time Pharaoh struggled against the Lord, resisting His demand to let the children of Israel go
The more Pharaoh struggled, the more he helped to bring about the environment that was needed for the accomplishment of God's salvation
We may expect that anyone who has been chosen by God will turn to the Lord after we have contacted him a few times
If he continues to resist the Lord, we may give up, thinking that it is a waste of time to pursue the matter further
As a result of Moses' contact with Pharaoh and of Pharaoh's struggle against the Lord, the situation in Egypt became very tense
They were responsible for producing the environment that required the institution of the Passover, with its redemption and its judgment
Pharaoh's oppression of the children of Israel created the environment for their exodus from Egypt and then made it necessary for them to go
In the crossing of the Red Sea, God used Pharaoh once again, this time to create a situation to bring about the baptism of His people
If we are not persecuted for apparently wandering aimlessly, our baptism may be a mere procedure with little significance
When there is no persecution, baptism may not be as meaningful, for when the new converts are buried, nothing else is buried with them
When the children of Israel were baptized in the Red Sea, they brought the Egyptian army into the water with them
If we consider the type and apply it to our situation today, we shall be able to help new believers to be baptized in a proper way
In the same principle, God may not lead the ones saved through our gospel preaching to take a straight path to baptism
If we study the type in Exodus, we shall no longer expect new converts to take a straight path from conversion to baptism
Pharaoh's last struggle was a type of the struggle of Satan and his world over the believers who are to be baptized
Rather, we should realize that this struggle will prepare the environment for the converts to have a thorough baptism
When we are in eternity, we may be surprised to learn that God has done a great many things that are not in keeping with our concept
We see from such portions of the Word as Revelation 12 and the book of Job that Satan has access to God's presence in heaven
According to Pharaoh's concept, this was an excellent opportunity to get the children of Israel back under his control
When the children of Israel looked backward, they saw the army of Pharaoh, and when they looked forward, they saw the Red Sea
As soon as Moses spoke these words, the Lord came in and told him not to cry unto Him, but to tell the children of Israel to go forward
The fact that God's sent One went before the camp of Israel indicates that Christ was the One who was leading the people
If we are faithful to the Lord, His guiding light will become our protecting light whenever we face opposition
Many of us can testify that after we have received light, we are protected by this light, no matter how intense the opposition may be
Eventually, the opposers may be in such great darkness that they themselves no longer understand what they are talking about
He was the One who took the lead to bring them out of Egypt and to guide them through the wilderness into the good land
When the Angel of God moved from the front of the people to the rear, the pillar moved also, for the Angel and the pillar were one
The more we are attacked and opposed as we follow the Lord, the brighter the guiding and protecting light becomes
Pharaoh and his army pursued the children of Israel to the midst of the Red Sea because the Lord had hardened the hearts of the Egyptians
God did this for the purpose of glorifying Himself through Pharaoh and through his army, his chariots, and his horsemen
Having been released from the usurping hand of Pharaoh by crossing the Red Sea, the children of Israel entered into another realm
Although we are not happy with attack and opposition, all the attackers and opposers are useful in the hand of God
After God's people crossed the Red Sea and Pharaoh was buried in the sea, they were separated from him forever
In this message we have seen that Pharaoh was used by God to accomplish a thorough, complete, and perfect salvation of His chosen people
Praise the Lord that even Pharaoh's last struggle helped to accomplish the full salvation of God's chosen people!
Because the blood of the lamb had been applied to the doorposts of their houses, God in His righteous judgment could pass over them
Although the Passover was adequate to save them from Gods judgment it was not effective to rescue them from the usurpation of the Egyptians
In order to be saved from Egyptian tyranny, the children of Israel needed the exodus and the crossing of the Red Sea
If the children of Israel had had only the exodus but not the crossing of the Red Sea, their salvation would not have been secure
Later, at the time of Numbers 14:4, some of the rebellious ones said, 'Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt'
After the flood waters had abated, Noah and his family found themselves in a new realm, in a new world, where they could serve God
In Egypt the children of Israel were involved with the evil, corrupt, and condemned world and were under God's judgment
The blood of the Passover lamb saved them from God's judgment, and the water saved them from the tyranny of the Egyptians
Many have been baptized in a ritualistic way, but such a baptism is not an experience of the saving, separating water
In the case of Noah's family and that of the children of Israel, the water was a means both of salvation and of separation
In the same principle, it is through baptism that believers today are saved from the world and from the satanic power of darkness
If we have only the Passover and the exodus without the crossing of the Red Sea, our salvation will not be secure
Before the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, they took Moses as their leader, but not to a very great extent
After they crossed the Red Sea the people feared Jehovah and believed Jehovah and his servant Moses for they had been baptized unto Moses
We have been baptized not unto a denomination, practice, belief, or doctrine, but unto Christ, our Leader and our Head
When a new believer is baptized, he should realize that he is being baptized both into the Spirit and into the death of Christ
The death of Christ deals with matters on the negative side, whereas the Spirit takes care of matters on the positive side
Hebrews 11:29 says, 'By faith they passed through the Red Sea as through dry land, which the Egyptians attempting to do were swallowed up'
The Lord was not angry with the people for their lack of faith, even though they had just witnessed His mighty and miraculous acts in Egypt
To Moses, who as a human was no doubt troubled by the situation, the Lord said, 'Wherefore criest thou unto me?
When Moses received this word from the Lord, the children of Israel spontaneously had the faith to cross the Red Sea
According to 14:21 and 22, the 'waters were divided' and were a 'wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left'
158 says that the waters were gathered together the floods stood upright as an heap and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea
Although the waters had been divided, heaped up, and congealed, it still required faith for the children of Israel to pass through them
By crossing the Red Sea, the children of Israel were saved from Egypt and also brought into a realm of freedom
As we baptize new believers, we ourselves need faith, and we need to help those who are being baptized to have faith as well
The significance of this fact is that when we were baptized, Satan and the world with its tyranny were terminated
When we baptize others, we must tell them that as they are buried in baptism, Satan and the world will be buried also
When we consider this picture in the light of the New Testament, we have a clear view of the significance of baptism
Referring to the water of baptism typified by the flood in Genesis, 1 Peter 3:20 speaks of being 'saved through water'
They were saved to the wilderness of separation, that is, to a realm which is for the accomplishment of God's purpose
The water through which they were saved and separated from Egypt brought them into a realm where there was no bondage or slavery
In this realm there was the freedom to fulfill God's purpose by building the tabernacle as God's dwelling place on earth
In both cases the principle is the same: God's people are saved through the sea, and now they can sing praises to God
In verse 17 we are told that the Lord would plant His people in the mountain of His inheritance, in the place which He has made to dwell in
Although we regard the good land as the inheritance of the children of Israel, here Moses speaks of it as the inheritance of God
As we read 15:1-18, we realize that the goal of God's salvation is the building of His dwelling place for the establishment of His kingdom
The tabernacle was constructed within a year after the exodus from Egypt, and it remained with the people until the temple was built
Exodus 40:2 says, 'On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation'
In chapter fifteen Moses used three expressions related to God's goal: habitation, dwelling place, and sanctuary
The descendants of Esau, the Edomites, signify those who are natural, those who are not chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed
The descendants of Lot, the Moabites, signify the fleshy ones, for their source was an act of incest, a grossly sinful and fleshy deed
The aim of all the attack opposition and evil speaking is to hinder the building of Gods dwelling place for the fulfillment of His purpose
All the attack and opposition are actually positive signs, indicators that the building of God's temple is assured
As we baptize new converts, we need the faith and the boldness to speak to them about the goal of their baptism
We must tell them that baptism is intended to bring them to Gods habitation to the mountain of Gods inheritance where His people are planted
When we have been brought through baptism to the place of God's inheritance, God will be able to build the dwelling place as His sanctuary
We have pointed out that Exodus is a book of pictures that portray God's salvation as revealed in the New Testament
Without the pictures in the book of Exodus, it would be difficult for us to have a firm grasp of the meaning of God's salvation
The crossing of the Red Sea is related to the destruction of the Egyptian army, which perished in the waters of the sea
In order to understand this adequately, we need the proper knowledge of the Bible and some amount of spiritual experience as well
As soon as a believer is baptized he has the sense that he has been brought out of the old realm into a new realm the realm of resurrection
When the children of Israel entered into this realm, they were separated from Egypt both by the Red Sea and by the wall
Since three is the number of resurrection, this signifies that they walked in resurrection, that is, in newness of life
It is significant that the journey from the Red Sea to Marah was exactly three days, not two days, four days, or even three and a half days
According to a note in the text of the Amplified Version, the distance from the Red Sea to Marah was thirty-three miles
When the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they certainly walked in a way that was different from the way they walked in Goshen
In Goshen they did not have the pillar of cloud, but in the wilderness they walked according to the guidance of this pillar
After we were baptized, our relatives and friends may have thought that we entered into some kind of wilderness
Before we were baptized we were in Egypt enjoying the Egyptian garlic leeks and onions and our relatives and friends were happy with us
Praise the Lord that in His creation God prepared even the geographical features in order to present a picture of His salvation!
We are told in 15:22 that during this journey of three days in the wilderness, the children of Israel did not find any water
Before we were saved, and when we were living in the old realm of the world, we had an abundant supply of natural water from the Nile
When the people discovered that the waters were bitter, they 'murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink'?
As a true servant of the Lord, instead of striving with this murmuring and complaining people, Moses cried out to the Lord
Seeing this vision, we apply the cross of Christ to our situation, and immediately the bitter waters become sweet
Because we were walking in the realm of resurrection, we could experience the cross of the Lord Jesus and live a crucified life
Eventually we enjoyed sweetness because the healing tree with the crucified life had been applied to our circumstances
In the same principle, in the realm of resurrection we experience the death of Christ changing our bitterness into sweetness
As we walk in the realm of resurrection, we shall thirst, only to discover that there is no natural water to supply our need
Whenever we are in such a situation, we need to see the vision of the tree and then apply this tree to our circumstances
Immediately after the waters were made sweet, the Lord made a statute for the people and an ordinance, 'and there he tested them'
We may sense the need for healing in the mind, or realize that our will needs to be adjusted, or see that our emotion needs to be balanced
We are healed when we are subdued and when we hearken to the voice of God, listen to His statutes, and obey His commandments
The reason for the impurity or the lack of uprightness is that your spirit has not been touched by the cross of Christ
The Lord's word in Exodus 15:26 indicates that in His eyes the children of Israel were sick and in need of healing
The only way to be touched by the cross is to see the vision of the tree and to cast this tree into the very place that needs to be healed
Every time we experience the cross of Christ, we shall have a deeper realization of our need to be healed through the touch of the cross
We need to be identified with the crucifixion of Christ by applying His cross to every part of our being that is bitter and sick
The more we are healed by the Lord, the more we have an ear to hear His voice, a heart to keep His statutes, and the willingness to obey Him
God deliberately led them to the south so that they could be baptized in the Red Sea, the baptistry He had prepared for them in His creation
No doubt, the children of Israel expected to be led northward, to the good land; however, God led them southward, to Marah and to Elim
Our concept is that this experience of resurrection will be on a way that is upward, not on a way that leads downward
In itself resurrection takes us upward, but its application requires us to take a way that leads in a downward direction
Although this account is very short, only one verse long, we need to take the time to study in a thorough way Israel's experience at Elim
We have pointed out that instead of northward, the direct way to the land of Canaan, the children of Israel journeyed southward
If they had not gone to the Red Sea, they could not have passed through the baptistry God had prepared for them
The blood of the Passover lamb saved them from God's judgment, but the water of the Red Sea saved them from the armies of Pharaoh
According to the picture in Exodus, the pillar of cloud led the children of Israel downward from Marah to Elim
We have pointed out that in His creation God prepared the Red Sea to serve as the baptistry in which His people were baptized
Certainly it was no accident that the children of Israel came to Elim and found there twelve springs and seventy palm trees
The answer is that in His sovereignty God placed twelve springs and seventy palm trees at Elim for a specific purpose
When we follow the Lord as the pillar of cloud, we shall come to a place of twelve springs flowing and seventy palms growing
Since four signifies humanity and three signifies the Triune God, four times three signifies the mingling of God with humanity
The Spirit is the divine life in resurrection portrayed by the twelve springs in Exodus 15 and the rivers of living water in John 7
The divine life in resurrection flows out from God and into God's people for the mingling of divinity with humanity
In contrast to the number twelve, it signifies perfection and completion in time dispensationally, not eternally
The same is true in Revelation, where the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls are arranged in groups of six plus one
The local churches are signified by the number seven because the churches today are for God's dispensation in time
All these examples indicate that the number seven signifies perfection and completion dispensationally and temporally
The fact that there were seventy palm trees at Elim instead of just seven indicates such a fullness of God's dispensation in time
When Moses was about to contact God for the carrying out of His administration on earth, the Lord told him to bring seventy elders of Israel
When used together, the numbers twelve and seventy indicate that the Lord's people are to carry out His ministry
Both as the church corporately and as the believers individually, we need to experience the resurrection life at Elim
It flows out of God into us, and through this flowing it grows upward to express the riches and victory of the divine life
Those in the vast multitude in Revelation 7 are all holding palm branches and have come out of great tribulation
If we consider the picture of Israel at Elim, we shall realize that it is a marvelous portrait of resurrection life
God fought for them and defeated Pharaoh and his army by destroying Pharaoh and his chariots in the waters of the Red Sea
In order to fight, it is not sufficient simply to eat the Passover lamb with the bitter herbs and the unleavened bread
We also need to experience the cross and the resurrection; that is, we must pass through Marah and arrive at Elim
Have you seen that the result of this flowing and growing life is an army strengthened to fight for God's purpose?
We need the water that has been changed from bitter to sweet and also the water that flows from the twelve springs at Elim
In order to have the flowing water, we must go on from Marah, the experience of the cross, to Elim, the experience of resurrection
They mainly testify of how their bitterness has been changed into sweetness through the application of the cross
Those who linger at Marah have the healing tree, but not the seventy palm trees growing to express the riches and victory of the divine life
Because at Marah there is no plantation, only the changing of bitterness into sweetness, there is no growth there
Of being angry with the people for their murmuring, the Lord showed Moses a healing tree that changed the bitterness into sweetness
Realizing that His people were children and that this was the first instance of their murmuring, the Lord did not punish them
From Marah, the people were led by the Lord to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water flowing and seventy palm trees growing
Exodus 16:2 says, 'And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness'
We see three parties: those who murmured, those against whom the murmuring was directed, and the Lord, who overheard the murmurings
According to verse 8, Moses said to the people, 'Jehovah heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we?
My burden is to point out that after the marvelous experience at Elim, the flesh of the children of Israel still remained
After having an exciting experience at Elim with the twelve flowing springs and the seventy growing palms we still are troubled by the flesh
Believers may experience the baptism of the Spirit or the so-called second blessing, but they still have the problem with the flesh
By this we see, once again, that the book of Exodus is not written according to doctrine, but is written according to spiritual experience
According to our spiritual experience, we realize that the exciting times at Elim never cause the believers to become mature saints
If your intention is to conceal your flesh, you will have to avoid the experience of the springs and the palms at Elim
Although we may have exciting experiences of the twelve springs at Elim, we shall soon discover that we ourselves are unchanged
To quench the thirst in our spirit is one thing, but to deal with the fleshly aspect of our natural being is another
If we are clear about this, we shall be freed from the influence of the erroneous concept that prevails in Christianity today
Because our flesh remains after the experience at Elim we need to be led on by the Lord from Elim into the wilderness described in Exodus 16
As we shall now see, our flesh is exposed because of the lack of nourishment, because of the lack of Christ as the heavenly life supply
After we enjoy the Lord at Elim, we discover that we still have a problem with the flesh and with the lust of the flesh
In our Christian experience we have not come to the place of experiencing Christ daily as our life supply to fill us and to satisfy us
Do not think that a person who has been in the Lord for many years will reach the point where he is no longer troubled by the flesh
Although we need to experience the twelve springs at Elim, we also need our hunger to be satisfied by Christ as the heavenly manna
If we have the adequate experience of eating Christ daily as our heavenly manna, our flesh and lust will be dealt with
When they murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness between Elim and Sinai, the Lord was somewhat displeased
Verse 3 goes on to say that the name of that place was called Taberah, 'because the fire of Jehovah burnt among them'
Do not think that because you have been in the Lord for such a long time, you can no longer be troubled by the flesh
It is crucial to see that the shortage of the heavenly supply of Christ is what causes our flesh to be exposed
No matter what exciting experiences we have had in the Spirit, we still need to partake of Christ daily as our heavenly manna
If we are undernourished, our flesh will rise up, and our lust will disturb us and hinder our fellowship with the Lord
According to the doctrinal understanding of many Christians, a fleshly person cannot see the glory of the Lord
It is significant, however, that we are not told that the Lord's glory appeared to His people when they were at Elim
At Elim there is a great deal of excitement, but very little of the appearing of the Lord's glory in a definite way
As the children of Israel were following the Lord in the wilderness and seeking Him, their flesh and their lust were still active
At certain times, because we were undernourished, our attitude has become negative as we were seeking the Lord
He sent quails to satisfy their lust in eating , to show them His sufficiency and to discipline them with His anger
When the children of Israel murmured at Marah and the Lord showed Moses the healing tree, the Lord did not deal with the people
In Exodus 16 the Lord told Moses to say to the people that He had heard their murmurings and that He would appear to them in His glory
In Exodus 15 and 16 we see three types of water: the waters at Marah, the twelve springs at Elim, and the dew in the wilderness
Because we still must pass through many nights, many situations filled with darkness, we need the refreshing dew to water us
Manna does not come with the water that has been changed from bitter to sweet, nor with the water flowing from the twelve springs
Do not take this word about the dew as a doctrine, but receive it as a word that corresponds to your experience
The main point of this message is that after we have a wonderful and exciting experience at Elim we discover that the flesh is still with us
As we apply these two matters to the book of Exodus, we see that it was God Himself who dealt with Pharaoh and the Egyptians
He delivered the children of Israel from the hand of Pharaoh and brought them through the Red Sea, in which the Egyptian army was drowned
In chapter twelve we have the Passover, in chapter fourteen the crossing of the Red Sea, and in chapter sixteen the eating of the manna
We cannot say what was the essence of manna, but we do know that it was food of a category different from all earthly food
Although we do not know the essence of manna, we know that it was the kind of food that caused people to become heavenly
Although God's people had been brought out of Egypt into the wilderness of separation, they were still constituted with the element of Egypt
His desire was to fill them, to satisfy them, to saturate them with food from heaven, and thereby to make them a heavenly people
God's goal is not simply to change our behavior; it is to change our inward being, the very inner fabric of our constitution
Although we have been constituted with the substance of Egypt, God intends to constitute us with a heavenly element
He dealt with Pharaoh He slew the firstborn He defeated the Egyptians He brought us through the Red Sea and He has supplied our every need
Instead of exercising faith in the Lord, the children of Israel seemingly forgot everything the Lord had done for them
To the contrary, this was a sign that he had been defeated, having been touched by the murmurings of the people
Because God has a purpose in His salvation, there is no need for us to beg Him to have mercy upon us and to rescue us
Let us now go on to see how God dealt with His people when they murmured and complained about the lack of food
As we consider this matter, we need to realize that we all have the tendency to understand the Bible in a natural way
According to our natural understanding, we may think that in Exodus 16 God was merely testing the children of Israel
If we have spiritual vision, we shall see that Exodus 16 reveals that God's redeemed people still wanted to live a natural life
Desiring to live in the same way they did in Egypt, the people remembered how they sat by the flesh-pots enjoying the food of Egypt
He wanted them to forget the Egyptian diet and to partake of heavenly food, a kind of food that no one had ever eaten before
Because His aim was to change their diet, He did not send them food immediately after they came into the wilderness
He realized that if He waited until His people had a need and then sent the heavenly manna they would be more deeply and lastingly impressed
After the people arrived in the wilderness and realized that there was no food, they began to murmur and complain
The more they ate of Egyptian food, the more fleshly they became, for the Egyptian diet corresponded to the people's flesh and nourished it
The flesh here does not signify only the lustful part of our being it signifies the totality of our fallen being the whole of our old person
Although God's people had been redeemed, they were still living like Egyptians, like those who had not been redeemed by God
The second time 'the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague'
Numbers 11:34 goes on to say, 'And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted'
Eventually the quails became loathsome to them, for the people had to eat them until the flesh came out of their nostrils
Just as God sent an abundance of quails to the children of Israel, He may give you so many cars that they become loathsome to you
Do not think that if God gives you what you lust after, He agrees with you, He is happy with you, or He intends to edify you
In the foregoing message we pointed out that often when we are murmuring against the Lord, His glory appears to us
If you attempt to indulge in some form of worldly entertainment, you may have a strong awareness of His presence
We see that Moses wondered how God could supply meat for six hundred thousand men plus women and children for a period of thirty days
At the beginning of their years in the wilderness, the children of Israel learned not to lust after Egyptian food
Viewing this matter of dealing with the flesh in a superficial way, some Christian teachers say that the flesh is dealt with by the cross
God's intention is not only to deal with the flesh of His people; it is also to cause the flesh to be set aside
In Exodus 16 we see that their diet should no longer consist of foodstuffs from Egypt; it should consist only of heavenly food
By changing their diet and feeding them with manna from heaven, He causes them to have a different constitution
Exodus presents a clear picture of Gods salvation a picture that is not found in any other book of the Bible including the Epistles of Paul
After we came into the Lord's recovery, we immediately had the desire to become something and to do something for the Lord
Although the children of Israel had been redeemed and delivered, they were still Egyptian in their constitution
The children of Israel had been saved, redeemed, rescued, and supplied, but their constitution was altogether the same as the Egyptians
He may deliver from Egypt those who have an Egyptian constitution, but He will not bring such people into His dwelling place
After they had eaten the last of the Egyptian food and had nothing for the next meal, the people were troubled
They were bothered to such an extent that they forgot the miracles God had performed, and they murmured and complained to Moses and Aaron
Suppose God had rained down manna before the children of Israel arrived in the wilderness of Sin, and it was there waiting for them
They would simply have eaten the manna, and the problem of their Egyptian constitution and appetite would not have come to light
In His wisdom, God did not send the heavenly supply of manna until the people were exposed through the lack of nourishment
According to the record in Exodus 16, God did not give His people anything to eat until after they had been exposed
The regulations concerning the sending of manna and the eating of manna can also be illustrated by the observance of table manners
Although we may not care for table manners as an end in themselves, we must have certain regulations in order to eat properly
In order to gather the manna, the people had to rise up early in the morning and collect it before the sun became hot
We see another regulation concerning manna in 16:19, where Moses charged the people not to leave any manna until the morning
Eating quails makes people wild and unrestricted, but eating manna regulates them and causes them to be according to God
They will rise up to gather manna according to God's timing, and they will collect it according to God's way, not according to their greed
After God has redeemed us, saved us, and delivered us from the world, He will change our diet in order to change our constitution
Such a diet may include television, sports, music, magazines, newspapers, or other forms of worldly entertainment
Through these illustrations we can readily understand that America is the leading country with respect to the Egyptian diet
The point here is that whatever we desire, hunger, and thirst after is the diet according to which our being has been constituted
According to Numbers 116 the people complained But now our soul is dried away there is nothing at all besides this manna before our eyes
We thirst for Him and desire to contact Him, to read the Word, to call on His name, and to read the printed messages
If we would have such an inward change, we need to have a change of food supply, for the food we eat is the source of our constitution
These illustrations indicate that the Egyptian diet constitutes people with the Egyptian element and makes them Egyptian in composition
Because so many Christians still desire the things of Egypt, they suffer spiritual death, having been smitten by God's holy anger
The garlic, leeks, onions, melons, and cucumbers were only good to make God's people Egyptian in their constitution
Remember that those who built the tabernacle had experienced a change of diet and had begun to be reconstituted with the element of manna
By means of the heavenly diet we are kept alive for the sake of God's dwelling place, not for any other purpose
We all should be able to testify that the Lord has changed our diet from so many items to just one, the heavenly manna
In chapter twelve we see a people who have been redeemed, but we do not see a people who have been reconstituted
During their years in the wilderness, the children of Israel did nothing except eat manna and care for the tabernacle
As we consider this picture, we see that God only wants us to eat Christ and to take care of the church, His dwelling place
If we have no light and no vision as we read this book, we shall not be able to grasp the meaning of all these pictures
They may be familiar with the story in Exodus, and they may even know that manna is a type of Christ as food to us
According to this principle, the first mention of a matter in the Bible governs its meaning throughout the Scriptures
According to His eternal plan, God created man in His image and after His likeness so that man might express Him
God placed the man He had created in front of the tree of life with the intention that man take God into him to be his very life
Verse 2 says that on either side of the river which flows from the throne of God and the Lamb there is the tree of life
These references in Revelation 22 all indicate that in eternity and for eternity God's redeemed people will be eating of this tree
In John 6 the Lord Jesus clearly said that He was the real manna, sent from heaven by God the Father to be food for God's chosen people
Manna is also mentioned in Revelation 2:17, where we are told that the Lord will 'give of the hidden manna' to the one who overcomes
On the one hand, the heavenly manna nourishes us and heals us; on the other hand, it eliminates the negative things in us
Man fell by eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, but he is saved and recovered by eating of the tree of life
Although we may readily acknowledge that manna is a type of Christ, we should not regard this in a natural way or superficial way
If you eat a great deal of fish, you will be constituted of the element of fish, for you will absorb the life and nature of fish
According to the picture in the book of Exodus, the children of Israel were destined to have a heavenly living
When the children of Israel were in Egypt, they had many different things to eat, all elements of the Egyptian diet
God wanted to change their diet from many items to just one item, and that item was the manna which came from heaven
Although this tree will bring forth twelve kinds of fruit, there will nonetheless be just one tree in the New Jerusalem, not many trees
In today's Christianity, on the contrary, there are thousands of trees; that is, there are thousands of sources of food
If you read the Bible carefully and with understanding, you will see that manna and the tree of life are interchangeable
The manna in Exodus 16 was the tree of life in Genesis 2, and that the manna in John 6 will be the tree of life in Revelation 22
In the previous message we pointed out that worldly people may live on such things as education, sports, and amusements
Because the people in the world feed on so many things other than Christ, we may rightly regard them as today's Egyptians
We may still desire to sit by the fleshpots in Egypt to feed on cucumbers melons onions leeks and garlic or to enjoy fish from the Nile
On the one hand Christ is in heaven as the Lord of all on the other hand He is dwelling in our spirit as the allinclusive lifegiving Spirit
Anything which is to be our food and life supply must be something that can enter into us and then be assimilated by us
In the same principle, when we eat Christ as our real food, we are joined to Him and become one spirit with Him
The Christ who is subjective to us, to whom we are joined and with whom we are one spirit, is our food, our heavenly manna
To be one spirit with the Lord is like breathing: it does not happen once for all, but takes place moment by moment
We need to be watchful lest we turn off our spiritual switch and become separated from Christ in our experience
The reason we have an unkind expression on our face is that we are not at that instant one spirit with the Lord
Our experience may be somewhat like a lamp that, because of some electrical problem, switches off and on unpredictably
All those who want to live Christ by being one spirit with Him will be troubled by such on-and-off experiences
As you are getting ready for bed at night, ask the Lord to prepare you to practice being one spirit with Him the next day
In Christianity today, as we have already pointed out, there are hundreds of sources; there are also hundreds of so-called ministries
In a message entitled The Ministry in the New Testament Economy we considered the truth regarding the ministry in the New Testament economy
We pointed out in that message that in the eyes of the Lord, there is just one ministry in the New Testament age
We thank the Lord that from the very beginning He showed us what is the ministry of Christ, the ministry of life
The reason for this oneness is that our ministry is one and the life we are ministering to the saints is also one
We need to be clear, however, that to have one ministry does not mean that there is just one speaker for all the churches
As we have pointed out, both in the Far East and in the West, there are many speakers speaking the same thing for the same goal
Because manna was the unique food for God's people, they were not permitted to have any choice of food according to their own tastes
For our physical food we can choose from a wide selection of Chinese restaurants as well as from many different styles of Western cooking
On the one hand, manna has all the elements needed to sustain man's physical body; on the other hand, manna is a heavenly food
In John 6:51 the Lord Jesus said, 'I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever'
From the time of the Roman Empire until today, many earthly governments and world leaders have tried to quench the Lord's move on earth
Just as manna sustained nearly two million people in the wilderness for forty years, so Christ as the real manna sustains the church today
Numbers 11:9 also tells us that manna came with the dew; 'And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it'
Although we may regularly have morning watch, often during our time with the Lord in the morning we do not experience the freshness of dew
If your desire is to relive the past, to live the same kind of life you did years ago, manna will not come to you
If you pray to the Lord in this way, eager for a new beginning, the manna will come in the morning with the dew
They are content to understand the Bible according to traditional knowledge and according to ethical aspirations
After Saul of Tarsus was saved, he probably spent a good deal of time checking his experience with the Old Testament
He surely did this according to the leading of the Spirit, not according to traditional knowledge inherited from his forefathers in Judaism
It is possible to read the Word every morning without gathering any manna, for we may not have living contact with the Lord
Perhaps among us in the Lord's recovery this also has become a doctrine instead of a real and genuine practice in life
In your daily life, is the matter of being joined to the Lord in one spirit a practice, or is it merely a doctrine?
The crucial point here is not whether or not we love the world; it is whether or not our diet has been changed
Because this is our tendency, it is a good habit to contact the Lord in the Word before we become occupied with the affairs of the day
Once we have become involved in so many things, it is much more difficult to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord
In the previous message we pointed out that manna came from heaven , that it came with the dew , and that it came in the morning
Throughout the centuries, few of those who believe in the Lord have had an adequate appreciation of the preciousness of the Lord's smallness
According to John 6, the crowd wanted to enthrone the Lord Jesus as a king, but He fled from such an exaltation of Himself
He did not want to be a king; He wanted to be food that His people may receive Him as their life and life supply
From the time of Christ's ascension until now, Christian teachers have tended to stress the greatness and exaltation of Christ
Because of the desire for greatness, many of those in the Pentecostal or charismatic movement are given to boastfulness and exaggeration
Some may boast that many healings took place in a particular meeting when there was not even one genuine healing
Some years ago reports were circulated about a great revival that supposedly was taking place on the island of Timor
A former missionary who was there and is now in the Lord's recovery attended some of these revival meetings to observe what was happening
At a certain point, this brother saw the leader take out a bottle he had hidden and pour wine from it into a container of water
It is possible to receive divine healing in the proper way so that through the healing the Lord becomes a supply of life to us
According to the Gospel of John, people tried to exalt the Lord Jesus, but He always fled from such exaltation
Without anything miraculous taking place the Lord was life to this man in a very ordinary way in a way that was calm hidden small and silent
The more we take in Christ as our life supply, the more our natural color is eliminated, and the whiter we become
In the church the life-giving Spirit moves in us and among us in a small way, here and there capturing people for the Lord
Many Christians read the Bible, but they do not receive any food because they lack the grinding, beating, and boiling
Although we may gather manna during our time with the Lord in the morning, this manna may still not be ready to eat
Bdellium has been interpreted to signify two different substances, both a white transparent gum and a white pearl
Two substances may be called pearls, one produced by oysters and the other produced by the secretion of resinous gum from trees
The four living creatures in Revelation 4 are 'full of eyes in front and behind' and 'full of eyes around and within'
The fact that the four living creatures are full of eyes indicates that they are crystal clear in every respect
Nowhere else in the Bible do we read that God commanded His people to preserve an item of food before Him for coming generations
Why was the manna placed in a golden pot, and why was it put into the ark along with the tables of the covenant?
To describe this manna in a fuller way, we may say that this manna is the Christ we have eaten, digested, and assimilated
In New Testament terminology, we should answer that the center of our being is the very Christ we have eaten, digested, and assimilated
As we consider this record from the standpoint of our experience, we see that as we partake of Christ day by day, we are also preserving Him
In the collecting and eating of manna, some of the children of Israel may have been greedy, whereas others may have been lazy
After they had measured the manna which had been gathered, 'he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack'
Those who were greedy in their gathering of manna received one omer, and those who were lazy also received one omer
Using Old Testament terms, what we collect and eat measures an omer, and what we preserve also measures an omer
The point here is that God commanded the people to keep one omer of manna, the very amount they collected and ate each day
The Christ whom we enjoy will be an eternal memorial, because the Christ we experience and enjoy becomes our very constitution
He actually becomes the reconstituting element for God's people, that element which causes them to be reconstituted
If we are right with the Lord day by day and eat Him consistently, we shall have much to say about Him in eternity
According to the Bible, this memorial of manna indicates that as the real manna Christ is the source of supply for God's dwelling place
In the past we pointed out that the open manna was the manna gathered by the children of Israel every morning, the manna that was public
If you read Numbers 18:26-30, you will see that the tenth part denotes a special portion that was reserved for the priesthood
Spontaneously the manna we eat causes a transformation that transfers us from the general congregation to the priesthood
If you eat the open manna, this manna will become the hidden manna which enables you to function in the church life
If we consider the hidden manna from the standpoint of our experience, we shall gain a proper understanding of it
In 16:33 we see that an omer full of manna was placed in a pot and laid up before the Lord to be kept for future generations
If we apply this picture of the manna, the golden pot, and the ark to our spiritual experience, we shall be able to understand it
Since our spirit is for the church, with the church, and in the church, in experience we are actually God's tabernacle today
In the Old Testament the testimony does not refer to the ark; it refers to the law of God, the Ten Commandments
The manna contained in God's nature corresponds to God's testimony, which describes the nature of God and testifies concerning it
As we have pointed out a number of times, the law testifies that God is holy and righteous, and that He is light and love
In our experience we have learned that our efforts in the natural life to fulfill God's requirements always end in failure
In the words of Romans 8:4, the righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled in those who walk according to spirit
In ourselves we cannot fulfill these demands and requirements, for we have nothing in us which corresponds to God's testimony
On the one hand, we have the law with its demands; on the other hand, we have Christ as our life supply which corresponds to the law
At this point we need to be reminded that this experience is related to the church and takes place in the church
According to the Old Testament, the children of Israel ate manna in the wilderness for a period of forty years
Sixteen hundred years later the Lord Jesus spoke to the church in Pergamos and to all the seven churches in Asia concerning the hidden manna
In the churches we should not eat simply the open manna, but should also eat the hidden manna, which makes us priests and overcomers
Many Christians today are seeking miracles without realizing that all these points related to manna are genuine miracles
If the eating of manna by the children of Israel was a miracle, surely our eating of Christ today is also a miracle
On the sixth day the children of Israel collected a double portion in order to have a supply for the Sabbath day
No matter how greedy we may be in gathering manna eventually we shall be the same as others and we shall not receive more than they receive
When they hear that whether we gather more or less we shall each receive an omer of manna some may say Then we should not try to do anything
The way it was sent was miraculous, and the way of balancing according to the heavenly measure is also miraculous
In the same principle, it is also difficult to understand why those who collect less than an omer also receive one omer
The children of Israel had to collect, enjoy, and keep manna according to God and according to His regulations
The principle here, as with everything else related to manna, is that manna was a miraculous provision from the Lord
A group of Christians may hear the same messages and receive the same spiritual truth, but some seek the Lord and others do not
We must go on to say that the hidden manna is in the golden pot that the golden pot is in the ark and that the ark is in the Holy of Holies
If we have the genuine experience of Christ, we shall appreciate Christ and enjoy Him in the divine nature within our spirit
Because many Christians do not grasp the significance of this picture, they only realize that manna is good for food
Having already covered the heavenly manna in chapter sixteen, we come in this message to the living water out of the smitten rock
In chapter sixteen we have a clear picture of manna and in chapter seventeen the record of the living water flowing out of the smitten rock
In His work of creation God prepared the rock spoken of in Exodus 17 and placed it in exactly the right spot geographically
In chapter seventeen we are not told that Moses was commanded to look for a rock or to bring a rock to the people
Why does Genesis speak first of the tree of life and then of the river, whereas in Revelation 22 the order is reversed?
In the beginning stage the tree of life is followed by the river, but in the ongoing stage the tree of life grows in the flowing river
Now as we go on in spiritual experience, the Spirit as a flowing river brings us the supply of the word, the manna
At the beginning of our Christian experience we have first the word and then the Spirit, first the manna and then the living water
Psalm 368 says They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures
In 13:22 we are told that the Lord 'took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people'
At the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of Jehovah they pitched'
They just followed the pillar as it led them to a dry place, a place where there was no supply of water, but where there was a huge rock
Passing on from Marah to Elim, they experienced the seventy palm trees growing and the twelve springs of water flowing
The same principle applies when unbelievers respond to the preaching of the gospel and open to receive the Lord
If they take in the word of the gospel without experiencing the Spirit, they will not be able to digest the word
The Lord told Moses to use his rod to 'smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink'
John 7:39 goes on to say, 'But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive'
Such a picture may have literally been in the background when the Lord Jesus stood up to call the thirsty ones to come to Him and drink
The record in Numbers 20 describes an incident that took place approximately thirty-eight years later than what is recorded in Exodus 17
The concepts of science may change, for they are altogether devoid of divine revelation, but God's word never changes
According to Paul's word in 1 Corinthians 10:4, the rock followed the children of Israel all the way from Horeb to Kadesh
We have pointed out that this rock is a begetting rock and that it is also our salvation, refuge, strength, rest, and refreshment
Having been smitten by the power of God's righteous law, He was cleft, and living water came forth for us to drink
When the children of Israel came into a region where there was no water, they quarreled with Moses and tempted God
Many of us can testify that a number of times when we have been complaining, we have sensed the Lord's presence within us
If the children of Israel had known the ways of God, they would not have quarreled with Moses or tested the Lord
They would also have understood that they were not in the present situation by their own choice, but by the Lord's leading
The Lord led them there, and He was present with them, as indicated by the pillar which stood between heaven and earth
Lest we be tempted to laugh at the children of Israel or criticize them, we need to realize that our situation today is the same
Psalm 817 confirms the fact that God put Israel to the test at Massah and Meribah for it says God proved the people at the waters of Meribah
When the children of Israel quarreled with him, he reacted immediately by asking why they were quarreling with him and tempting the Lord
On the one hand, he reacted to the children of Israel; on the other hand, he accused them of wanting to stone him
When the people complained again about the lack of water, Moses, having learned the lesson at Massah, did not react at first
Unable to tolerate the situation he eventually reacted very strongly saying Hear now ye rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock
Disobeying the Lord's command to speak to the rock, 'Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice'
For this reason, although the children of Israel behaved very poorly and although Moses himself failed, God was not angry with them
In Numbers 20 he not only reacted to the people's quarreling; he also broke the basic principle of God's redemption
We need to learn from this failure of Moses to be careful in our reactions that we do not touch God's administration
When we lose our temper, we need to take heed lest we act in such a way as to break a basic principle of God's redemption and administration
When there is a shortage of food, even those who ordinarily behave like ladies and gentlemen will fight for it
When we are thirsty and dissatisfied because of the shortage of water, we shall fight and strive for ourselves
Christ was smitten for us so that the living water could flow out of Him to quench the thirst of sinful people
In Exodus 17 Moses was more than eighty years of age, and in Numbers 20 he was nearly one hundred twenty years old
When the Lord allows the church to come into such a stage of dryness, not even His leading servants are able to pass the test
Whenever we are short of Christ as the living water to quench our thirst, we are automatically subject to God's test
In a later message we shall see that for living waters to flow out of us, we need to be one with Christ in being smitten
If we are not identified with Him in this matter, there will be no way for the living water within us to flow out
According to the revelation in the Scriptures, the eating is in the drinking, and the drinking is in the breathing
Although we may have the doctrine of drinking, without breathing we would have no practical way to drink living water
The water is the source, for it is the water of life, not the tree of life, which proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb
Concerning the water flowing from the smitten rock in 17:6, there are some matters which are spiritual and mysterious
In order to understand these matters, we need to see that every record in the Bible has a spiritual significance
We should not try to understand any portion of the biblical record simply according to the black and white letter
For something to be mysterious means that it cannot be fully explained, although it may be enjoyed and experienced
Perhaps his basis was the abundance of revelation he received from the Lord concerning things in heaven, on earth, and under the earth
The water is mysterious in that it flowed out of a rock which followed the people in their journey through the wilderness
When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, 'one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water'
Many Christians pay attention only to the blood which flowed from the Lord's pierced side, but not to the water
Although we have pointed out that the water of life flows in resurrection, we have not yet given a definition of resurrection
That resurrection is God Himself is indicated by the fact that the One who said that He is resurrection was God incarnate
The throne of God with the flow of living water was in existence long before Jesus was crucified and before the rock was smitten
According to the sequence in the Bible, the rock is first, the physical body of Jesus is second, and the throne is third
Before the rock was smitten and before Christ was crucified, the living water was already flowing from the throne
Whenever we drink this living water in a proper way, it supplies us with all the elements and substances in the water
Those who emphasize the so-called Pentecostal experiences think they are drinking a great deal of water when they speak in tongues
Resurrection is the Triune God, the Father as the source, Christ the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow
To say that the water of life is the Triune God may shock those who are systematic and dogmatic in their theology
When they read such statements, some may argue that the water of life is not God Himself flowing, but the flowing of God's life
If He had not fallen into the earth and died, He would have remained alone , and what was within Him would not have been released
In John 1:1 we are told that in the beginning was the Word, that the Word was with God, and that the Word was God
If we prefer to analyze this marvelous revelation doctrinally and to debate about it instead of enjoying it, we shall suffer loss
On the one hand, the One sitting on the throne is God; on the other hand, the water of life proceeding out of the throne is also God
Because the riches of the divine life are carried in the flow of the living water, we receive these riches whenever we drink this water
According to Revelation 22:17, the Spirit and the bride sound forth the call to come and drink of the water of life
If we drink of the living water day by day, the Body of Christ will be built up, and the bride of Christ will be prepared
In the Bible the basic principle concerning man's relationship with God is that man needs to eat and drink of God
After the record of the creation of man, there is mention of the tree of life and of a river which 'went out of Eden to water the garden'
At the beginning of the Bible, eating and drinking are presented with respect to the relationship between God and man
According to Revelation 21:6, the Lord will 'give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely'
In verse 14 we have the promise of eating the tree of life, and in verse 17 we have the call to drink of the water of life
In the Gospel of John, the Gospel that emphasizes the deity of Christ, there also are references to eating and drinking
Chapter six covers the eating of Jesus as the heavenly manna, as the true bread, the living bread, the bread of God
In verse 57 the Lord Jesus speaks a clear, strong, and definite word concerning eating: 'He who eats Me shall also live because of Me'
At the well she meets the Lord Jesus, who talks with her and tells her that living water is to be found in Him
In verse 14 He says that the water He gives will become in the one who drinks it a 'spring of water welling up into eternal life'
Throughout the years, we have pointed out repeatedly that God's intention is to work Himself into us to be our life and our everything
We still need to be impressed with the fact that the way God works Himself into us is through our eating and drinking of Him
Throughout the centuries, Christians have talked about eating and drinking, but hardly anyone has known how to eat or how to drink
Christians have written many 'how-to' books, books on subjects such as how to pray, how to overcome sin, and how to be victorious
Paul does not say that the rock was a type of Christ or a symbol of Christ; he says clearly that the rock wasChrist
Paul says boldly and plainly that it was a spiritual rock which followed the children of Israel in the wilderness
Although eating and drinking are very common in our daily living, in the Bible they are matters of crucial significance
As we eat and drink certain elements, those elements are taken into us and become one with us in substance and in essence
Revelation 22:17 does not say that whoever is hungry may come and eat; it says that whoever is thirsty may come and drink the water of life
Exodus 16 speaks of food, the heavenly manna, and then chapter seventeen goes on to speak of the water flowing from the smitten rock
In the same principle, many of those Christians who have gone before us had many experiences of drinking the living water
The New Testament was written by a number of different authors, including Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter, James, Jude, and Paul
Problems had been caused by certain ones who called themselves Christians but did not believe in the deity of Christ
We have pointed out that in the very Gospel which emphasizes the deity of Christ the eating and drinking of the Lord are also emphasized
Even though we have been positioned to drink and are thirsty, we still need to come to the Lord again and again
Perhaps calling on the Lord will eventually become such a part of our living that we shall call on Him even when we are asleep
If we care more for politeness or reverence than for drinking, the Lord would say, 'I don't want your reverence
Recently we have been having fellowship about opinions and the damage they cause in both the Christian life and the church life
When you are tempted to quarrel with your husband or wife, drink of the living water by calling on the name of the Lord
The more we call, the more we shall believe, and the more we believe, the more we shall receive and take the living water
A basic problem among Christians, especially among those in organized Christianity, is related to the religious worship of God
The Jews and the Moslems have their ways of worship, and those in the Catholic Church and in the denominations have their ways
The Lord Jesus revealed to her that the proper worship of God is not in a certain physical place; it is in our spirit
According to the natural concept, the Bible is used as a book of ethics to teach the believers to glorify God in their daily living
Finally, Christians are told that, after they die or after the Lord comes back, they will spend eternity with Him
The kernel of the divine revelation is that God created us and redeemed us for the purpose of working Himself into us to be our life
According to Revelation 22:17, the Spirit and the bride speak as one to call those who are thirsty to drink of the water of life
He spent his time watching how others at the dinner conducted themselves and how they used their eating utensils
The priests worshipped God in vain; the Samaritan woman worshipped Him in reality by drinking Him into her being
God was seeking real worship, and He received it from this Samaritan woman who drank of the Spirit as the living water
They condemn those in the Lord's recovery as heretical, when they themselves are heretical and ignorant of the truth
In John 4 the Lord Jesus did not spend time talking to typical Jews according to the Old Testament way of worship
If we see this vision, the focal point of the divine revelation in the Bible, we shall know how to drink the Lord as the water of life
We see that if we drink the water of life, this water will become a spring within us welling up into eternal life
Of the many genuine believers in Christ who have drunk of the living water, not many experience the flowing of this water
It is not the drinking, the taking in, that keeps the current going; it is the outflow of water which does this
The proper gospel preaching is not mainly to minister the water of life to others; it is to stir up a sense of thirst within them
After passing through such a time of dryness, we shall be stirred up by the Lord in His sovereign mercy to repent and return to Him
Since we have already begun to drink of the Lord to quench our thirst, we need to pay attention to the flowing
It is difficult to tell whether or not someone is drinking, but we can easily tell whether or not a person is flowing
To flush out a pipe is to flood it with water for the purpose of cleansing; it is to wash it out by a sudden rush of water
In order to have this flushing out, this strong flowing, we need to call on the name of the Lord Jesus and pray
What is particularly helpful to bring about the inner flowing is speaking to the Lord by the Lord for the Lord in the Lord and with the Lord
Even in meetings that are devoted to the ministry of the Word, there is opportunity to speak both before and after the message is given
According to Ephesians 5:18-20 and Colossians 3:16, Christians should be continually speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks
The flowing of living water, the welling up of this water, always brings us into a situation where there is the fullness of life
Even though much of this speaking is ridiculous, it is better than no speaking at all, and it may even afford a little spiritual benefit
We have much to say about Christ as our life and about all that has been brought forth through the ministry of the Word
Such speaking will not only bring us into a situation where we are flooded with life, but also bring us into the fullness of the Spirit
If we simply are one with the smitten Christ, identified with Him, we shall experience the crucifixion of our natural life
If we speak without being identified with the smitten Christ, our speaking, even our praise and prayer, will be natural
We shall experience the smiting of the natural life which took place in Him and with Him at the time of His crucifixion
According to Revelation 22:1 and 2, the supply of life is in the water of life, for the tree of life grows in the river of life
What we have been speaking in this message is according to the pure Word of God, not according to the tradition of Christianity
At the Red Sea there was war between God and Pharaoh, but the children of Israel themselves did not fight against Pharaoh's army
In chapters fourteen through seventeen we have a portrait of the many experiences through which we pass after baptism
If we do not enjoy the heavenly manna daily and drink of the living water consistently, we shall be defeated by the flesh and subdued by it
Those Christians who do not partake of the manna and drink of the living water are already subdued by the flesh
Whenever we are not satisfied with Christ and not supplied by the life-giving Spirit, we are subdued under the flesh
We can testify that after we began to enjoy Christ and to drink of the living water, the flesh rose up to fight against us
Praise the Lord that we have the heavenly manna and the living water to support us as we fight against the flesh!
The heavenly Christ is our manna to satisfy our hunger, and the Spirit is the living water to quench our thirst
Even though we partake of Christ as the heavenly manna and drink of the Spirit as the living water, Amalek is at hand to fight against us
Immediately after we enjoy the Lord in morning watch, something may happen, perhaps at the breakfast table, to provoke the flesh
The children of Israel had been satisfied by the heavenly manna, and they were drinking of the wonderful living water
If you were to write a biography of any believer, you would have to devote considerable attention to the flesh
Perhaps even as you sit in the church meetings you remember certain offenses or recall how others have mistreated you
We have seen that Amalek, one of the descendants of Esau, was the first to fight against the children of Israel
For this reason, the Bible gives a complete picture of Amalek as the first enemy to fight against the children of Israel
Many of us can testify that from the time we first began to seek the Lord and to walk in His way, the flesh has been fighting against us
We also have the goal of entering into the all-inclusive Christ as our good land and possessing Him as this land
The purpose of the flesh in warring against us is to frustrate us from entering into Christ as the all-inclusive land
We must admit that not many Christians, even among us, have entered in a complete way into the full enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ
Exodus 1711 says And it came to pass when Moses held up his hand that Israel prevailed and when he let down his hand Amalek prevailed
Although it is necessary for us to fight against Amalek, we should not think that by our fighting we can be victorious
In our fighting we must recognize the need not to fight in ourselves, but to fight by means of Moses and Joshua
On the one hand, Moses lifted up his hand on the mountaintop; on the other hand, Joshua was fighting for the people
Now we must go on to point out that Moses typifies the heavenly Christ, and Joshua, the indwelling Spirit fighting against the flesh
Christ is the life supply, the living water, the One interceding in the heavens, and the indwelling One fighting against the enemy
We all must come to know Christ as the heavenly manna, the living water, the interceding Moses, and the fighting Joshua
We also need to experience Christ in the aspect of manna, living water, the interceding One, and the fighting One
As the indwelling Spirit, Christ is our present, practical Joshua fighting against the flesh and putting it to death
The altar built and named by Moses in Exodus 17 signifies that the cross of Christ is a memorial of our victory
After we were redeemed, saved, and delivered, we began to enjoy the divine provision of manna and living water
Your only realization may have been that these chapters cover the building up of the tabernacle as God's dwelling place
It is crucial to realize, however, that apart from the kingdom there is no possibility for God's house to come into existence
Only when we defeat the enemy, overcome the world, and deal thoroughly with the flesh shall we be in the kingdom
In the second section of Exodus, chapters eighteen through forty, we see that God's redeemed people were in the enjoyment of the kingdom
Having been delivered from the world and having dealt with the flesh, they were able to build the tabernacle as God's dwelling place
In Exodus Satan is signified by Pharaoh, the world is signified by Egypt, and the flesh is signified by Amalek
We thank the Lord that by His mercy and grace we in His recovery have learned something of the importance of dealing with the flesh
We see this in Judges 3:13-15; 5:14; 6:3; 7:12-14; 1 Samuel 15:2-9, 32-33; 27:8; 30:1-17; 2 Samuel 8:12; 1 Chronicles 4:42-43
According to the book of Esther, the flesh works in a hidden way to undermine God's people and even to kill them
We see that the book of Esther is a story of Gods war with Amalek the continuation of the warfare with Amalek from generation to generation
Although the interceding Christ does not need anyone to support His hands, we need our praying hands to be stayed up
Aaron, the high priest, signifies the priesthood, and Hur, who was of the tribe of Judah, signifies the kingship
Sometimes our praying hands become heavy not because we lack the desire to pray, but because we are lacking in incentive and encouragement
If we have the priesthood and the kingship and care for the building up of the tabernacle, the church, our prayer life will not become heavy
Rather, it will be supported by the priesthood and the kingship, and it will have the building of the church in view
If we have these factors-the priesthood, the kingship, and God's building in view-I do not believe our prayer can be stopped
The picture of Aaron and Hur holding up Moses' hands is a portrait of the union in prayer between Christ and us
In order to deal with the totality of our fallen being, we need much prayer in union with the intercession of the heavenly Christ
If we would pray in this way, we need to be stirred in our spirit by the priesthood and subdued by the kingship
We may have a good time of prayer early in the morning, but we usually cannot continue until noon, much less until the end of the day
Moses was able to pray until sunset because he had a rock, a solid base, to sit on, and because he had Aaron and Hur supporting him
Verse 11 says, 'And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed'
It is a fact that if our prayer ceases, our flesh will spontaneously show itself to be the same as that of unbelievers
If we do not believe that our old man has been crucified with Christ on the cross, we shall not be able to deal with our flesh
Based upon the fact that our old man has already been crucified, we have the boldness and encouragement to put the flesh to death
Saul excused this by saying that 'the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the Lord'
Whenever we claim to be better than others, we allow the bleating of the sheep and the lowing of the oxen to be heard
Instead of obedience and hearkening, among today's Christians there is much bleating of the sheep and lowing of the oxen
If we would deal with our flesh, we must deal with it thoroughly, utterly putting to death all that is good or bad
In His contact with Abraham, God did not require Abraham to do anything other than to leave his father's country
God had promised that He would do something for Abraham which would cause all the nations on earth to be blessed
When in the eyes of both Abraham and Sarah it was impossible for them to have a son, God came in to enable them to have a child
It means that Isaac was born not through the exercise of man's flesh, but according to God's grace, according to God's visitation
For Ishmael the issue of the flesh to be versus Isaac the issue of Gods grace is rebellion a great rebellion against Gods eternal purpose
According to the New Testament, grace is God Himself not only being our enjoyment, but also doing everything for us
Whatever we do without depending on God and trusting in Him is of the flesh, no matter how good that thing may be
We cannot fulfill God's purpose as long as we exercise our flesh and do not trust in God, depend on Him, or live in oneness with Him
Exodus 1716 says that because there is such a hand against the throne of Jehovah God will have war with Amalek from generation to generation
Whenever we are in the flesh, we regard ourselves as individuals who are not obligated to submit to God's throne
Because Amalek is involved with God's kingdom, we need the support of both the priesthood and the kingship in order to fight against Amalek
Since we have been born kings and shall be kings in the future, it is important for us to exercise our kingship today
Saul told Samuel that the best of the sheep and oxen had been spared for the purpose of offering sacrifice to God
Many believers lack the weight of spiritual authority simply because they have not utterly dealt with their peculiarities
Culture, opinions, peculiarities, and habits are all hiding places of the flesh, and these damage our spiritual life
As those who have been in the Lord for many years and who love Him and seek Him, we should have considerable spiritual weight
God would not accept Saul's excuse that the people had spared the best of the cattle and oxen to offer as a sacrifice unto the Lord
They claim to be engaged in spiritual service, but God says that their offering is evil because it has its source in the flesh
Samuel said to him, 'Hath Jehovah as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Jehovah?
In 1 Samuel 15:23 Samuel went on to say, 'For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry'
Samuel's word to Saul indicates that sparing our flesh is an act of rebellion which brings us into contact with demons
To offer sacrifice in the way Saul did is not actually to offer sacrifice to God; it is to come in contact with demons
Samuel's word to Saul means that, because of his rebellion, Saul had become involved with demons and with the idols of vanity
If instead of utterly destroying our flesh, we spare certain good aspects of the flesh, we also shall become involved with demons
Sparing the good flesh and then offering it to God is hateful to Him because in such a practice demons are involved
If we would follow the Lord's word to utterly destroy the flesh, we shall have the kingship and shall be in God's kingdom
The record in the Bible concerning Amalek teaches us that we must be in fear and trembling before God in doing good things
Cain's sacrifice seemed good, but it was actually an act of rebellion against God's throne and against His economy
Much of what is done by today's Christians supposedly for God is actually rebellion against God's economy and involves contact with demons
Without 1 Samuel 15:22 and 23, we would not realize that Saul's deed was an act of rebellion related to demons
Only the Lord knows how much of Christian activity today is related to demons and is thus a hindrance to God's purpose
Since these things took place after Exodus 40, why are they recorded in Exodus 18 and inserted between chapters seventeen and nineteen?
For this reason, sometimes the biblical record is not according to the sequence of history, but is instead according to doctrine
The writers of the Gospels selected certain things and put them together for the purpose of presenting a view of the divine revelation
According to the New Testament, when man's flesh is defeated and subdued, the kingdom of God immediately comes in
Galatians 5:17 says, 'For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other'
When the Spirit with the power of the cross defeats our flesh and causes it to be subdued, the kingdom of God is with us
Each of these four terms may be signified by a color: the flesh by black, the Spirit by green, the cross by red, and the kingdom by blue
In our experience today we have the black of the flesh, the green of the Spirit, the red of the cross, and the blue of the kingdom
Chapters one through seventeen make up the first section, and chapters nineteen through forty, the second section
We see that we have passed through the Red Sea and have entered into the wilderness, where we enjoy God's provision and defeat the flesh
In the second section, chapters nineteen through forty, we have a revelation of the building up of God's dwelling place on earth
At the beginning of the book of Exodus, the children of Israel, God's chosen people, are under the tyranny of the world
To us, the book of Exodus will primarily be a record of how God gave commandments, ordinances, and statutes through Moses
Between the two main sections of Exodus, the section on God's salvation and on God's building, there is the need for the kingdom
Because few Christians deal with the flesh thoroughly there is not found among them the proper result of Gods salvation that is the kingdom
In our preaching of the gospel we may be nice, pleasant, and humble, always talking kindly to others and never arguing with them
God does not first care for what we do; He cares for the means by which we do things, for whether we do them by the Spirit or by the flesh
Sometimes a negative word has been on the tip of my tongue, but the living Spirit with the operating cross came in to subdue the flesh
As we have indicated, the kingdom comes in after God's enemy, Amalek, which typifies the flesh, has been defeated
Before the kingdom is presented in Exodus 18, God's enemy within us, typified by Amalek, is defeated in chapter seventeen
In chapter eighteen the church is represented by Zipporah, the wife of Moses secured by him during his rejection by Israel
During this period of rejection, Christ gains the Gentile church, taken out from the Gentile world, just as Moses gained a Gentile wife
If Paul had not told us that the Passover was a portrait of Christ, who would have had the boldness to say this?
With all this as the background, it is proper to say that Jethro and Zipporah in chapter eighteen also have a typical significance
As Pharaoh represents Satan and Egypt represents the world, so Jethro signifies the Gentiles, and Zipporah, the Gentile church
According to the principle that all the items in Exodus are figures, the matters in chapter eighteen should not be considered as exceptions
If we live in the flesh and fail to defeat Amalek, we may labor a great deal in preaching the gospel, but not many unbelievers will turn
If we first defeat and subdue our flesh and then go forth to contact people and preach the gospel to them, Jethro will come to us
When we preach the gospel by the living Spirit through the operating cross, killing the flesh, people will turn to us wherever we go
If we live in the flesh, others will not turn to God through us, no matter how hard we work in preaching the gospel
Christ, signified by Moses, is the Head of authority, and under the headship of Christ is the order of authority
Because of this rebellion, Moses complained to the Lord: 'I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me'
The rebellion in Numbers 11 is very different from the weariness, burdens, and strife referred to in Exodus 18 and Deuteronomy 1
There should be captains in the church life who, under Christ's headship, work out problems and maintain order
If there is the need to call in the elders, the kingdom of God is not present in the church in a practical way
Even among a small number of brothers and sisters, there should be a captain, someone who can remind others about the Spirit and the cross
If there is a captain to do this, the problem between the brothers will be solved, and the order will be maintained
It is an indication that we have Christ, signified by Moses, as our Head and that we are all under His headship
When these four matters are put together, we have the kingdom of God as the issue of the enjoyment of God's salvation and provision
There is no indication in the first eighteen chapters of Exodus that the children of Israel had been brought into fellowship with God
In 3:12 the Lord said to Moses, 'When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain'
In chapter nineteen we see the children of Israel at the mountain of God, Mount Sinai, the place where God could contact His people
In 5:1 Moses told Pharaoh to let the people go so that they might hold a feast unto the Lord in the wilderness
According to 5:3, the people were to make a journey of three days into the desert and there sacrifice unto the Lord
To sacrifice unto God is to offer something to Him, and to hold a feast unto God is to enjoy with God what is offered to Him
Chapter nineteen of Exodus is actually very positive, for here God's chosen people are brought into fellowship with Him
4:27 indicates that Aaron was charged by God to meet his brother, Moses, at the mount of God in the wilderness
Although the distance from Egypt to Mount Sinai could be traveled in three days, it took the children of Israel more than two months
Even though our journey may be under God's care and according to His leading, we are not yet in fellowship with Him
Before they came to the mountain of God, the children of Israel heard about God through Moses' preaching and teaching
The Passover lamb, the crossing of the Red Sea, the manna, the living water from the cleft rock, and Amalek are also pictures
We need to be saved from the condemnation of sin, the world, and Satan, as seen in chapters one through fourteen
The bitter water is changed into sweet, and we eat of manna, the heavenly food, and drink the living water flowing from the smitten rock
It is a very great matter to hear God's speaking and to see His vision, especially the vision concerning His dwelling place
The Lord Jesus delivered the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens while on a mountain with His disciples
John was carried away to a high mountain to see the vision of the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem
In our experience we need to come out of Egypt, cross the Red Sea, and journey through the wilderness until we arrive at the mountain of God
Exodus 19:10 says, 'And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes'
At Mount Sinai they were living in God's presence, having been sanctified, separated, unto God in an absolute way
Exodus 1911 says And be ready against the third day for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai
To be in resurrection means that the old has passed away and that we are altogether in a new position and situation
Whenever we are brought into the presence of God and enter into fellowship with God, we are spontaneously brought into the knowledge of God
Everything revealed in chapters twenty-five through forty corresponds to what Paul describes as the full knowledge of God
Isaiah 40:31 says, 'They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles'
Your strong wings have brought us out of Egypt and carried us through the wilderness to this place, where we are here with You'
In verse 21 the Lord said unto Moses, 'Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish'
Moses answered, 'The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it'
If you consider your experience, you will see that in fellowship with the Lord you are first grateful to Him for His mercy and grace
The Hebrew expression in verse 5 has a double meaning; it means both personal possession and peculiar treasure
When God's redeemed people were brought into God's presence, they became His personal possession and peculiar treasure
If such a thing could exist in Old Testament times, how much more should it be our experience in the New Testament age!
Although we thank the Lord for this picture, we thank Him all the more that we today may enjoy the reality, the fulfillment
In chapter nineteen the children of Israel were brought into God's presence and began to have fellowship with Him at His mountain
In the foregoing message we pointed out that in this fellowship with God His people came to know God's grace and holiness
He wanted the children of Israel to know what kind of God they were approaching, what kind of God with whom they were having fellowship
It was important for the children of Israel not only to know such divine attributes as grace and holiness, but also to know God Himself
Concerning the matter of law, there is an important principle: the kind of law a person makes expresses the kind of person that one is
A backward country would have rather barbaric laws, whereas a highly cultured society would have highly cultured laws
Although the fourth through the tenth commandments are clearly identified it is difficult to determine which are the first second and third
In order to have the proper understanding of the Ten Commandments, we should see that they actually begin with verse 2
Although the expression 'Jehovah thy God' is used in each of the first five commandments, it is not used in any of the last five
If we read carefully the record of the Ten Commandments, we shall see that they are divided into two groups of five
As we have indicated, in the first group the sacred title 'Jehovah thy God' is used with respect to each commandment
According to the Jewish way, verse 2 is regarded as the first commandment, and verses 3 through 6 as the second
According to the Catholic way, verse 2 is not regarded as part of the first commandment, only verses 3 through 6
In Ephesians 6:2 and 3 Paul pointed out that the commandment about honoring our father and mother is the first commandment with a promise
The blessing of longevity is related to God as our source, for only He, the source of life, can grant us a long life
If we want our family and our country to be blessed by God, we must honor our parents and thereby remember God Himself as our source
As long as their parents do not require anything that is contrary to the standard of the Bible, the young people should obey them
Apart from the Ten Commandments, there would be no way for us to realize that God is narrow, or jealous, in this way
The fourth commandment, which concerns keeping the Sabbath, is related to God's holiness, to His being separate from all things
Although many Jews and Seventh-Day Adventists keep the Sabbath, not many know the true significance of keeping a day unto the Lord
In Matthew 22:37-40 the Lord Jesus answered His opposers by implying that the whole law is fulfilled in loving God and man
In Galatians 5:14 Paul says, 'For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself'
God will charge iniquity as far as the third or fourth generation, but to those who love Him, He will show mercy for a thousand generations
When we get into the depths of these ten words, we see that God is jealous, holy, loving, righteous, and truthful
Whereas the first nine commandments are related to outward conduct, the tenth is related to the sin hidden within us, mainly in our thoughts
The first commandment touches our inward condition, and the commandment about coveting likewise touches our inward condition
According to 31:18, the two tables of stone on which the Ten Commandments were written are called the 'two tables of testimony'
The law was the testimony, the ark was the ark of testimony, and the tabernacle was the tabernacle of testimony
As a type of Christ, it typifies Christ as God's testimony, the One who describes God and expresses Him in a full and adequate way
As the law is the ten words of God which reveal God to His people, so Christ is the Word of God revealing God to us
Concerning the giving of the law, verse 1 of Exodus 20 is of great significance: 'And God spake all these words'
At the very place where God was meeting with His people and where they were contacting Him in fellowship, the law was given
According to this concept, God was far away from His people when the law was given, and they had no way to come into contact with Him
According to this view, the law-giving God did not contact the people, and the law-receiving people did not meet with God
After God had brought the people out of Egypt to the mountain of God, He began to have fellowship with them and to speak with them
He also said that they would be His personal possession, His peculiar treasure, and would be unto Him a kingdom of priests and a holy nation
Such a conversation was not the decree of certain laws; it was a time of fellowship in which God spoke to His people
The conjunction 'and' at the beginning of 20:1 is very important, for it connects chapter twenty to chapter nineteen
God did not merely give His people ten laws, ten commandments; in fellowship with them He uttered the ten words
If the commandments were nothing more than laws, God's people could do nothing more than try their best to keep them
When he came down from the mountain, he had something more than ten commandments inscribed on two tablets of stone
During those days of communion on the mountain Moses experienced a divine infusion, the infusion of God's substance into his very being
John 1421 says He who has My commandments and keeps them he it is who loves Me and verse 23 says If anyone loves Me he will keep My word
The reason for this is that, as far as the basic principle of life is concerned, the Old Testament and the New Testament are the same
The law is not only a list of divine commandments it is the living word of God which infuses Gods substance into those who lovingly seek Him
If we consider the Ten Commandments only as laws and then try to keep them, we are not proper in our approach to the law
In this matter, we should be like Paul in Philippians 3, one who was pursuing Christ out of love and even running after Him
Out of love for the Lord, we should pursue Him, contact Him, and abide in His presence, dwelling together with Him
We should remember that the law was given on the mountain of God, the place where God's people could be infused with His substance
Let us now consider a number of passages from the Psalms which indicate how the psalmists dealt with God's law
The writer of this psalm loved God to such an extent that neither in heaven nor on earth did he have anyone besides God Himself
Psalm 43:4 shows how the psalmist sought God as his exceeding joy, and 119:2 and 10, how he sought God with his whole heart
They were like olive trees planted in the house of God, and they were being infused with God's riches so that they could grow spiritually
We see four aspects of being infused with Gods riches planted in the house flourishing bringing forth fruit and being full of sap and green
Through such an infusion from God, they spontaneously were strengthened to keep the law and to live out the law
According to the Gospel of John, when we abide in the Lord, He infuses us with His element, and we absorb the life juice of the vine into us
To be satisfied with the fatness of God's house and to drink of the rivers of His pleasures are to enjoy the Triune God
The use of the word 'portion' reminds us of Colossians 1:12, where Paul tells us that Christ is the portion of the saints
Because God was the portion of the psalmists, the psalmists could keep God's word, by which they meant the law
Again we see that in principle the experience of the psalmists in the Old Testament was the same as our experience today
Like the psalmists, they spontaneously lived the law of God, and their living corresponded to God's expression
Because they had been infused with the substance of God, they could live a life which corresponded to the law as God's expression
Because the psalmists were living and rich in the experience of God, they were not legal or dogmatic, as the Judaizers were
If we love the Lord, seek Him with our whole heart, dwell with Him, and enjoy His riches, His substance will be infused into us
True worshippers of God are those who are according to what God is, who correspond to what God is, and who reflect what God is
We have pointed out repeatedly that in principle the enjoyment of the Old Testament saints was the same as that of the New Testament saints
These words bring the transfusion of God's element, which enables His people to have a living that corresponds to what He is
If we are today's psalmists, we shall seek the Bible, the Word of God, out of love for the Lord and for His word
Some students of the Word have not seen that the law is the word of God and that the word is the breath of God
If we take the Word as God's breath and are thereby infused with His substance, we shall become today's psalmists, His loving seekers
In the case of the last five, we are simply told not to murder, commit adultery, steal, bear false witness, or covet
In reminding the people that He saved them and delivered them from bondage, God speaks to them as if He were a young man courting a maiden
Even the commandments regarding not taking the Lord's name in vain and keeping the Sabbath day were uttered in an atmosphere of love
They have not seen the fact that the first five commandments, which refer to God Himself, were given in an atmosphere of love and intimacy
We have seen that the word of the Lord Jesus in John 14:21 and 23 is similar to that uttered by the Lord in 20:4-6
In John 14 the Lord Jesus said that if we love Him and keep His word, He and the Father will love us and make Their abode with us
If we pray-read 20:1-17 adequately, these verses will bring us into God and will transfuse the substance of God into us
In the foregoing message we saw that the law is the living word of God which infuses His substance into His loving seekers
Through such a love for God and His word, they will be infused with God's substance and live in a way which corresponds to what He is
Even though these four prophets lived at different times and in different places, they all had the same concept concerning this matter
Addressing the church in Corinth, Paul says, 'I betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ'
Have you ever realized that the giving of the law was a transaction in which God's people became engaged to Him?
The covenant here is that mentioned in Ezekiel 16:8, made at the mountain of God, after God had brought the people out of the land of Egypt
We have seen that both Ezekiel 16:8 and Jeremiah 31:32 use the word covenant, a word which refers to the law given in Exodus 20
The signing of such a paper shows the importance of engagement and serves as proof that a certain man and woman are engaged to be married
We may say that the first nineteen chapters of Exodus are chapters in which God was courting, wooing, even 'dating' His people
As we consider the Ten Commandments given in Exodus 20, we see that the last five commandments were given in a simple, direct manner
God commanded the people not to kill, not to commit adultery, not to steal, not to bear false witness, and not to covet
Verse 2 says, 'I am Jehovah thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage'
If we compare this commandment to the last five commandments, we shall see that it is spoken in love as a condition of engagement
A young man wants the woman engaged to him to honor his name and speak it in a proper way, full of love and appreciation
A young man who gives an engagement ring to the one he loves wants her to wear it as a sign that she is engaged to him
As a condition of engagement, He required His people to bear a sign that they belonged to Him and that they were absolutely for Him
Each commandment uses the expression 'Jehovah thy God,' an expression uttered intimately again and again as God lovingly courted His people
According to Song of Songs, the man is the beloved, and the woman, the one who lovingly seeks him, is his love
The Bible reveals that in the Old Testament God sought His people as the Beloved seeking someone to be His love, His spouse
If you read Exodus 1 through 20 in this light, you will see that in these chapters God came a number of times to woo His people
There seems to be no reason for God's love for His people; He just loved them, almost as if He were blinded by love
God still loves Israel with an everlasting love, just as He did when He uttered the words of love in Jeremiah 31:3
If we do not love God, we shall not be able to keep His commandments, and thus we shall not be able to express Him
They emphasize the distance between God and His people and the fact that God wanted them to keep the commandments
According to the Bible, this basic principle applies both to human marriage and to the love relationship between God and His people
As all students of the Bible realize, the law is a very important subject both in the Old Testament and in the New
Failing to understand the law in the light of the main subject of the Bible as a whole, they do not have a proper, balanced view of the law
Concerning the law, there are two aspects, two sides: the aspect of 'night,' the dark side, and the aspect of 'day,' the bright side
When God's purpose has reached its ultimate fulfillment in the New Jerusalem, there will be no night in that eternal city
In discussing the giving of God's law, many Christian teachers place too great an emphasis on the aspect of 'night'
In order for this purpose to be fulfilled, God must impart Himself into His chosen people and work Himself into them
The New Testament clearly and emphatically reveals that in Christ and through Christ God has come to us to dispense Himself into us
The Lord Jesus said If anyone loves Me he will keep My word and My Father will love him and We will come to him and make an abode with him
We know from Ephesians 4:6 that the Father is in us and from John 14:17 and Romans 8:11 that the Spirit dwells in us
Verse 15 of the same chapter declares, 'Whoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God'
Many Christians today neglect this crucial matter of God dispensing Himself into us and working Himself into us
When we expound this point and emphasize its importance, we are accused by some of teaching pantheism or even 'evolution into God'
We do not have the full understanding of how intensely God longs to be one with us and to make us one with Him
Those who think this is 'evolution into God' are grossly ignorant of God's economy revealed in the New Testament
Unless there is mutual love, it is not possible for a man and woman to live together as husband and wife and remain truly one
If we did not have God, we would have to say with the writer of Ecclesiastes, 'Vanity of vanities; all is vanity'
The love between God and His people unfolded in the Bible is mainly the affectionate love between man and woman
Because the Lord had such a love for His people, He 'took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt'
When we come to the divine revelation in the Bible, we should not be occupied by anything that would blind us to the Lord's light
For eternity, the Triune God as the Husband will enjoy a sweet married life with His wife, His chosen and redeemed people
By entering into such a covenant with His people, God betrothed them to Himself, and He betrothed Himself to them
We see that in making the old covenant with the children of Israel, God betrothed Himself to the people and became their Husband
Jeremiah 31 refers to the old covenant, the covenant of betrothal, and also to the new covenant which the Lord would make with His people
In order for such an engagement to take place, an affectionate love like that between a man and his wife is absolutely necessary
When we enter into such a love relationship with the Lord, we receive His life, just as Eve received the life of Adam
Among the cattle, the fowl, and the beasts of the field, Adam did not find a counterpart; he did not find anything to match him
Just as Eve came out of Adam and possessed his life and nature, so the church comes out of Christ and possesses His life and nature
Because such a relationship exists between Christ and the church, we receive the Lord's life whenever we tell Him that we love Him
Many Christians do not realize that if they love the Lord Jesus, He will come into them to be their life and their life supply
Because the truths in the Bible are so profound, we cannot understand them unless we use illustrations and parables
Eventually, after many years, a man and woman who have enjoyed a genuine married life will become one even in expression
We are one with Him in love; then we become one with Him in life and nature; and finally we shall be one with Him in expression
There will be no need for us to make up our mind to keep it, for we shall spontaneously live according to God's law
Concerning the law, the teaching of the New Testament is thus essentially the same as that of the Ten Commandments
Our memorial day is no longer the seventh day; it is the eighth day, the first day of the week, the day of resurrection
According to Acts 20:7, the disciples came together on this day, not on the seventh day, to have the Lord's table
Again we see that, in principle, the whole Bible, the Old Testament as well as the New, is the same concerning the law
Loving the Lord as our Husband and experiencing and enjoying His life and nature, we shall become His expression
The more we love the Lord in this way, the more we shall partake of His life and spontaneously live Him in accordance with His nature
If we read the Bible in a pure way without any preoccupations we shall realize that Gods purpose in creating man was to gain a counterpart
In this way there will be a mutual relationship of love between God and mankind, those created to be His counterpart
In dealing with the question raised by the disciples of John, the Lord revealed Himself as the Bridegroom coming to receive the bride
At the end of this dispensation, there will be a glorious wedding day, at which time Christ will marry His redeemed ones
At the very end of the Bible we see that God will enjoy a married life with His people in eternity and for eternity
If there is no romance between us and the Lord Jesus, then we are religious Christians, not romantic Christians
He did not want Peter to love Him as a child honoring a parent, a friend caring for another friend, or a rich person pitying a poor person
The Lord wanted Peter to love Him with an affectionate love, with a love like that of a young woman for the man who loves her
The Father and Son making an abode with the one who loves the Lord Jesus is a reference to living together in married life
Although the Lord often spoke as a Bridegroom conversing with His bride, not many Christians have realized this aspect of His word
In the foregoing message we pointed out that both the Old and New Covenants were espousal covenants, covenants of engagement
In giving them the law, He was seeking to stir them up to love Him and not to have any other beloved in addition to Him
The law would then impart God's substance into them, usher them into God, and unite them with God in life and nature
All this indicates that God's law can be kept only by those who love God and are one with Him in life, nature, and expression
A number of gospel songs speak of the Lord's calling, and many preachers say that the believers are a people called by God
His calling is His courting of His seeking people not only to be saved, but also to be His bride loving Him in an affectionate way
Some so-called Christians disagree with the inclusion of Song of Songs in the Bible, viewing it as a secular book, not as a sacred one
If we did not have Song of Songs, we probably could not have such an expression regarding our relationship with the Lord
Since the law was given as an engagement contract, we should not try to keep it apart from loving the Lord and being one with Him
Concerning God's law, the content of the New Testament is essentially the same as that of the Ten Commandments
Paul refers to God's jealousy in 2 Corinthians 11:2, where he indicates that we should be a chaste virgin to Christ
Both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament, God's people were to have a memorial day as a sign that they belonged to the Lord
As those living in the new creation in resurrection, our memorial day is the eighth day, no longer the seventh
Based upon this fact, the Seventh-Day Adventists argue that believers in this age should continue to observe the Sabbath
In the coming millennium the Sabbath will be observed not by Gods regenerated people but by restored and preserved yet unregenerated mankind
Although they will be restored to man's state at the time of creation, they will not have the divine life in resurrection
In either case the Bible teaches that God's people are to have a particular day as a sign of their separation unto the Lord
While they teach others the knowledge of the Bible, they do not encourage them to contact the Lord in the Word
By loving the Lord as our Beloved and becoming one with Him, even becoming His love, His word will become the life supply to us
The note in one version says that in Hebrew the word pant refers to the longing for a cool spring after suffering burning heat
In this message and in the next, we shall look into Psalm 119 to consider how the Old Testament seekers of God enjoyed His law
Trying to keep the law without seeking God with their whole heart, they failed in their endeavor to fulfill the law's requirements
Psalm 119:132 says, 'Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name'
Like the Old Testament saints, may we all love the Lord's name and remember it, even in the middle of the night
No doubt, this threefold blessing refers to the blessing of the Trinity: the blessing of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
The law is a matter of commandments which make demands on us or require that we keep certain regulations ordained by God
Paul refers to this in Galatians 3:21: 'For if a law was given which was able to give life, righteousness would have indeed been of the law'
If we treat the law only as the law and not as God's word, we shall not receive the supply of life through the law
If we regard the law not only as the law but also as God's word, we shall receive life, breath, food, and living water through the law
If we take the Bible only as letters in black and white and do not contact the Lord directly as we read, it will become a dead book to us
We have pointed out a number of times that through the Word, which is God-breathed , we can breathe God into us
Certain faultfinders have twisted our words quoted us out of context and criticized us for teaching that believers can breathe God into them
To lift up our hands unto the Lord's word is to welcome it, to indicate that we receive it warmly and say 'Amen' to it
In verse 162 the psalmist testifies of his rejoicing in the word: 'I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil'
If you have never spontaneously rejoiced in reading the Bible, perhaps you have never been fully inspired by the Word
We need to be healed of all spiritual disease so that our heart may be pure, sound, and healthy toward the word of God
The psalmist prayed in this way and could also testify that he himself inclined his heart toward the Lord's statutes
The Old Testament seekers of God also sought God's word , longed for it , hoped in it with prayer , and trusted in it
According to our experience, these matters go along with having a sound heart in the Word and inclining our heart unto the Word
If our heart is right, we shall not only seek the Word; we shall also long for it, hope in it, and trust in it
As we read Psalm 119, we see that what we have pointed out in the foregoing messages concerning the 'day' aspect of the law is right
Mount Horeb has a special reference to the day aspect of giving the law whereas Mount Sinai has a particular application to the night aspect
Those at the foot of the mountain were of another class, the ones trembling in darkness at the giving of the law
To Moses and those with him, the mountain was the Mount of God, but to the remainder of the people, it was Mount Sinai
In these messages we are not at the foot of the mountain; we are on the top of the mountain receiving the Lord's infusion
In their experience, the psalmists and all the other Old Testament seekers of God were on the mountain and received a divine transfusion
Those who delight in the law of the Lord and who muse on it day and night are like trees planted by the rivers of water
In the four Gospels we see a portrait of those who were zealous for the law and for the traditional exposition of the law
Simeon and Anna are representatives of the day people the Pharisees and Judaizers of the night people and Gamaliel of those in the evening
In our experience the Word of God will be a source of life supply and nourishment, and we shall be in the 'day,' not in the 'night'
The writer of Psalm 119 uses many different terms to express how he enjoyed God's law as His living word and how he handled it as God's word
In the foregoing message we pointed out that the psalmist inclined his heart unto it , sought it , and longed for it
When the psalmist said that he hoped in God's word, he meant that he was waiting on the word of God and waiting for it
Rich in meaning, the Hebrew word for muse, or meditate, implies to bow down, to converse with oneself, and to utter
When we muse upon the Word of God, enjoying it and even chewing it as a cow chews the cud, we shall spontaneously pray
In all our musing upon God's Word, talking to the Lord or conversing with ourselves, we should be spontaneous and full of enjoyment
Surely one who takes the law of God in such a way will not apply it as dead letters, but will take it as God's living word
It is to contact God in the Word and to have fellowship with Him, to worship Him, and to pray to Him through and with the Word
By musing upon the Word of God in this way, we shall be infused by God, breathe Him into us, and receive spiritual nourishment
As the psalmists mused upon the Word of God, they spoke to God, prayed, worshipped Him, and even bowed down to Him
The psalmist waited for the Lord's word, hoped in it, and arose before dawn to cry out to the Lord that he needed His word
Verse 73 indicates that God has created us in such a way that we may have understanding of His Word and learn His commandments
He treasured it as great spoil , as all riches , above thousands of gold and silver , and as a heritage forever
We shall have the spoil, the spoil will be our riches, the riches will be our gold and silver, and this will become our inheritance
In verse 16 the psalmist declares, 'I will not forget thy word,' and in verse 93 he says, 'I will never forget thy precepts'
With the psalmist, we should not forsake God's Word , not swerve from it , not turn aside from it , and not go astray from it
To turn is to go in another specific direction, but to swerve is to veer off without direction, regulation, or control
Verse 1 says Blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of Jehovah and verse 32 says I will run the way of thy commandments
We see that first the psalmist loved the Word; second, that he welcomed the Word; and third, that he enjoyed it and mused upon it
Through such an enjoyment of the Word, we shall worship God, talk to Him, pray to Him, and converse with ourselves before Him
Sometimes we may shout or cry; at other times we may delight ourselves in the Word or give ourselves a command
Having received the word, they could then muse upon it, pray to the Lord, worship Him, and have fellowship with Him
God gave the law to His people in such an intimate way, again and again referring to Himself as 'Jehovah your God'
As we consider the 'day' aspect of the law, we see that God gave the law to His people in the way of enjoyment
Psalm 119:13 speaks of 'the judgments of thy mouth,' verse 72 of 'the law of thy mouth,' and verse 88 of 'the testimony of thy mouth'
If we would enjoy the function of God's law as His living word, we need to be God's loving seekers, those who seek Him out of love
If we do not regard God's law as His breath and if we do not lovingly seek Him, we shall not experience the positive function of the law
If we want the Word of God to function properly in our experience, we need to be 'plugged in' to the divine current whenever we read it
When we speak of the function of the law as the living word of God, we are actually speaking of the function or operation of God Himself
There is no doubt that in reading the Bible we need to exercise our mind to understand the words and terms of Scripture
The Word will not be dead letters, for through the exercise of our spirit we shall touch the living One in the Word
Praying requires more exercise of the spirit than speaking, and singing requires even more exercise than praying
Although we have often spoken about pray-reading, we have not emphasized adequately the matter of praying at every time in spirit
We need to pray at every time, even when we are tempted to become angry with our wife or husband or to gossip about the saints
Praying at every time in spirit will kill all the 'germs' and 'pests' and bring in the rich supply of divine nourishment
The Christians at the time of Paul probably sang the Old Testament psalms, perhaps using certain Jewish melodies
At such times we may worship the Lord, have fellowship with Him, or even converse with ourselves in the Lord's presence
If we would receive these riches, we must have a living, organic, dynamic contact with God whenever we touch the Word of God
According to Ephesians 5, a wife's submission to her husband and a husband's love for his wife are the overflow of being filled in spirit
There is no need for a wife to strive to submit to her husband or for a husband to exert himself to love his wife
If a brother does this, he will be saturated with the Lord and will automatically love his wife, no matter how she may treat him
In the years 1969 to 1971 many of the saints in Elden Hall in Los Angeles practiced singing and praising the Lord in their daily life
Many times a meeting began on the street with the singing and praising of the saints as they walked to the meeting hall
Only when we have continual, personal, living, and intimate contact with the Lord all day long do we truly live by breathing Him
Through their dealing with the Word of God, they became one with God and experienced the functions of His Word
All the functions of the law as God's living word as revealed in Psalm 119 are the acts and activities of a living Person
We contact this living One through the Word and are infused with Him and saturated with Him so that He becomes our life and our very being
If we praise the Lord in the meetings without praising Him in our daily life, our meetings will be a performance, and we shall be actors
In everything we do-in eating, clothing ourselves, talking to others, and all the details of our daily living-we need to pray
In order to do everything in the name of the Lord we need to be those who are continually singing, psalming, praising, and thanking
For the word of Christ to inhabit us richly means that it permeates us and is assimilated into our inner being
When the word of Christ inhabits us richly, it permeates, saturates, and sustains every part of our inner being
In Psalms 119 and 19 we see at least twenty-six functions of God's law as His living word to those who lovingly seek Him
We need to be not only quickened by the Word, but also restored by it, especially when we are depressed, suppressed, or oppressed
Our situation should be that of Moses on the mountaintop, not that of the children of Israel at the foot of the mountain
In this message and in the message following we shall consider the blessing we may receive from the living Word of God
Although the loving seekers of God receive blessing from His Word, it is possible to come to the Word of God and not receive anything
As a result, first they themselves are killed by their kind of Bible knowledge, and then they use this knowledge to kill others
Provided we have no problems within us which cause a hindrance, we should receive blessing whenever we come to the Word of God
Suppose a young man has a heart for his studies, but also has a heart for a particular form of worldly entertainment
Another problem with the heart is related to things that cover you, separate you from the Lord, or frustrate your contact with the Lord
On the other hand, a certain sin may lie hidden in your heart, and you may not be willing for the Lord to deal with it
Even though the Lord speaks to us again and again, we still are not willing to be convinced, because His speaking is contrary to our opinion
We also need to deal with anything in our heart that is negative or that causes separation between us and the Lord
If we deal with our heart and with the negative things between us and the Lord, our condition is likely to be normal
Even if we deal with our heart and with the negative things in our heart, we may still have some complications
If we do not receive the Lord's mercy, something within us unconsciously may continue to cover us and keep us from the Lord's Word
If we do not humble ourselves in coming to the Word, we shall be greatly hindered in receiving help from the Word
If it is difficult to clean our physical surroundings in an absolute way, how much more difficult it is to clean our heart!
Years ago, when our youngest daughter needed minor surgery, the physician told us that he could not perform the surgery in his office
Although they have passed through a very good training, they should not think that everything is right between them and the Lord
If we realize this about ourselves, we shall not be so confident as to think that in everything we are right with the Lord
If we have a humble attitude when we come to the Word, not having any trust in ourselves, we shall be enlightened
Perhaps you are wondering why you do not receive light from the Word, even though you have been reading the Bible regularly for a long time
If this is your attitude in coming to the Bible, you will receive blessing from the Word, no matter what portion of the Word you read
Whenever we come to the Word, we come to the light, because the Word is the embodiment of God, and God is light
Because the Word is the condensation of the divine light, we enter into an atmosphere of light whenever we come to the Word
After reading a portion of the Word, you may not have much understanding, but you have the sense that you are in light
Whenever we come to the Word in a proper way, we have the conviction that we have come into the light and are in a sphere of light
Our experience testifies that if we have no problems with the Lord when we come to the Word, the Word will be open to us
When we come to the Word and open it, then in our spiritual experience, the Word will have an entrance, an opening
In verse 105 the psalmist says a practical word about light: 'Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path'
If we do not sense that we are in light when we come to the Word, this is a sign that our condition is not right
The knowledge many Christians gain from reading the Bible actually becomes a veil or covering that keeps them in darkness
Those who have such a knowledge of the Scriptures need to humble themselves before the Lord so that the coverings may be removed
If we humble ourselves and receive the Lord's mercy, the Bible will no longer be mere knowledge to us-it will be light to our eyes
We may have the Bible just in the way of knowledge, or in our experience the Word may be the shining of the divine light
The loving seekers of God also receive the life supply, the enlivening, the quickening, through His living Word
We have pointed out that if our condition is proper or normal when we come to the Word, we have the sense that we are in the light
In our understanding in the realm of the soul, the Word is light, but when the Word goes deeper, into our spirit, it becomes life
Whenever through our prayer this light goes deeper, reaching into our spirit, it becomes life, and we receive the life supply
The study of the Bible also requires the exercise of our emotion to love the Word and the exercise of our will to take God's way in His Word
In order for a tree to grow, it must have roots, and on these roots there must be tiny root hairs to absorb the water
If we would be watered through the Word, we need to contact the Word not in a rough way, but in a very fine way
It means that you simply read it with your eyes and utter something with your mouth, not even caring for a proper understanding of the Word
With them everything is outward, a matter of what they see with their physical eyes and utter with their mouths
We need to let the Word go deeper in us in a fine way, and we must also allow our being to sink deeper into the Word, also in a fine way
When we go along with the Word and the Word comes into our spirit, in our experience we shall have the root hairs
The word of the Bible must enter into our spirit and become the water containing all the elements of nourishing food
When we try to understand the Word by exercising our mind, by loving it, and taking it with our will, we exercise our soul
When we exercise our spirit to pray, our whole being is brought into the spirit, and the Word enters into our spirit also
The Word as food may remain in our mind, but in order for it to become the Spirit as water, it must enter into our spirit
The reference to strength in 119:28 refers not to something doctrinal, but to something that fills us inwardly and energizes us
By the living Word of God we are restored, strengthened, delivered, comforted, nourished, upheld, and safeguarded
If the Word becomes life in our spirit, then we shall enjoy all the other blessings afforded to God's loving seekers through His living Word
The law tells what is right and what is wrong, what is of God and what is not of God, what is for God and what is not for God
If our condition is right when we come to the Word of God, we shall enter into a realm of light and thus be enlightened
These three items go together and bring in restoration, deliverance, strength, comfort, nourishment, upholding, and safeguard
When we have God as our portion, we have not only light, life, water, and all the benefits these bring us, but we have the very God Himself
Psychological phenomena usually do not last very long; yet the enjoyment of God as our portion is long-lasting
Even though your experience may be limited, you cannot deny that to you God is real, practical, present, enjoyable, and available
We may compare the Word and the Spirit to an antenna and a ground wire which are the means for divine 'electricity' to be conveyed to us
The more we come to the Bible in the right way, the more the Author of this book, God Himself, becomes our portion
Immediately after speaking of God as his portion, the psalmist says, 'I entreated thy countenance with my whole heart'
If you consider your experience, you will realize that out of love for the Lord, there have been times when you longed to see His face
His countenance was all-important to you, and you wanted nothing else but to remain under His countenance and enjoy it
If you are faithful in contacting the Lord through the Word, you also will experience the shining of His countenance
To experience the shining of the Lord's face is even easier than to experience the shining of light by turning on the switch
If we want to experience Him and enjoy His shining, we simply need to turn on the switch by exercising our spirit
Another blessing received by the loving seekers of God through the living Word is that of enjoying God as their hiding place and shield
When we enjoy God as our portion and experience the shining of His countenance, He becomes our covering and hiding place
As the hiding place, the Lord is for our rest and our living, but as the shield, He is for our protection in fighting
According to spiritual mathematics, if we add together knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, we shall have discernment
Through the living Word of God the loving seekers of the Lord are also preserved from sin , from stumbling , and from every evil way
If we enjoy the Word and daily get into it, we shall be preserved from sinning, from going astray, and from being stumbled
If we come to the Word in a right way, we shall enjoy the Lord's enlightenment, life, watering, restoring, and delivering
According to the divine revelation in the Bible, whenever God comes to have contact with man, there are always two aspects of this contact
At the time God brought the children of Israel to Mount Sinai, were they after God's kind or after Satan's kind?
It is rather difficult to say how many were among the house of Jacob and how many belonged to the children of Israel
In the morning, we may be numbered among the children of Israel, but at the end of a day's work, we may act like a Jacob
According to 24:1, Aaron, along with Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, was told to come up unto the Lord
In a very real sense, Aaron was on both sides, sometimes on God's side and at other times, on the side of the religious congregation
It is difficult to locate where Joshua was physically with respect to Moses at the time the law was decreed on the mount
From the time of the fall, man's condition determines whether or not God's contact with him will be in the 'day' or in the 'night'
For those in the house of Jacob both the giving of the law and the function of the law were in the negative aspect in the aspect of night
In giving us the holy Word, the Bible, God did not intend for there to be a 'night' side as well as a 'day' side
After we were saved and began to seek the Lord, we were still under the influence of this threefold background when we came to the Bible
The factor that determines whether the Word of God is in our experience 'day' or 'night' is our condition in coming to it
We need to realize the crucial importance of our condition when we come to the Word and seek the Lord's countenance
It is a basic principle of spiritual experience that our condition determines whether our contact with God is in the 'day' or in the 'night'
In 19:7 Moses called for the elders of the people and presented to them all the words the Lord had spoken to him
When 'Moses returned the words of the people unto Jehovah' , the Lord said that He would come in a thick cloud
Aaron said Break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me
We are told that the people 'rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings'
The Lord could destroy the people and still fulfill His promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because Moses was one of their descendants
We see that although the giving of the law was in the 'day' for Moses, it was in the 'night' for those in the house of Jacob
If some are in the 'day' in coming to the Word and others are in the 'night,' there will be disputing, fighting
Some claim that we teach 'evolution into God,' that we teach that believers are deified and become God Himself
Some have even gone so far as to claim that it is blasphemy to teach that we can be one spirit with God and thus be what God is
The same light which was a terrifying, consuming fire to the house of Jacob was a delightful, infusing light to Moses
To say that man is mingled with God does not mean that this mingling produces a third entity, an entity which is neither God nor man
Because the Bible is in our experience Mount Horeb, the mountain of God, we meet together at this mountain and are truly one
At Mount Sinai the sinfulness of God's people is exposed, and there is revealed the boundary which God has forbidden them to cross
In Exodus we see at least three different classes of people who stood at different distances in relation to Mount Horeb
Moses was being infused, others were at a distance worshipping and watching, and the majority were at the bottom of the mountain trembling
Paul's use of the adjective 'spiritual' with respect to the law indicates that the law is related to God the Spirit
Certain things are very good, but because their substance is not of the Spirit, they cannot be called spiritual
For Moses, the mountain on which the law was given was not Mount Sinai; it was Mount Horeb, the mountain of God
In Matthew 13:43 the Lord Jesus said that 'the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father'
If we wish to be those who shine as the sun, we need to be a Moses on the mountaintop beholding the Lord and being infused with Him
Whether in our experience the decree of the law is positive or negative, 'day' or 'night,' depends on our condition, not on the law itself
If we are like the people trembling at the bottom of the mountain, the decree of the law in our experience will be dreadful and terrifying
The ones who were on the mountain, neither at the top or the bottom, worshipped afar off, and those at the foot of the mountain trembled
According to this superstitious belief, whenever a person comes to the Scriptures, he will receive something positive
People are slain by the Word not because there is anything wrong with the Bible, but because there is something wrong with those who read it
From the very beginning, it was not God's intention to give man commandments to keep or to have man do things for Him
Whether Moses was right or wrong in attempting to deliver the people, it is certain that he acted in a foolish way
According to Moses' word in Psalm 90, even those who are strong should not expect to live beyond the age of eighty
By the time he reached the age of eighty and thought of himself as good for nothing but death, Moses had lost every trace of ambition
When he turned aside to 'see this great sight' and learn why the bush was not burnt , God called to him out of the midst of the bush
In 3:12 the Lord said to Moses, 'When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain'
According to the New Testament, in His salvation God brings His people not only to Himself, but also into Himself
He brought them out of Egypt, through the Red Sea, and through the wilderness, where He provided water for drinking and food for eating
Eventually, God brought the children of Israel to the very place where He had appeared to Moses and called him
If the people had been enlightened concerning God and themselves, they would have said, 'Lord, we thank You for Your mercy
When the children of Israel heard the words God spoke to Moses, they answered, 'All that Jehovah has spoken we will do'
Because the people knew neither God nor themselves, God changed His attitude toward them and also caused a change in the atmosphere
He realized that it was not God's intention to have thunder, darkness, lightning, and the terrifying blast of a trumpet
At the word of the Lord, Moses went up to the top of the mountain and stayed there with God for a period of forty days
We may pray to the Lord and even meet with Him in fellowship in order to get something from Him that is a benefit to us
If we would shine forth God, we need to spend time with Him, not to do something but to have Him transfused into our being
He told them that He brought them on eagles' wings and that He would make them His personal treasure and a kingdom of priests
When the people heard those words, they should have bowed down and confessed, 'O God, we cannot make ourselves a treasure for You
Imagine what the situation would have been like if all two million Israelites had been infused with God and had begun to shine forth God
If we would be blessed by Him through the Word, we need to see that both what God wants us to do and what He says to us are secondary
By reading the Bible we find out a great many things God wants us to do, perhaps hundreds or even thousands of things
The secret is whenever you find that the Bible tells you to do a certain thing, do not say, 'Lord, I'll do this
The Lord will assure that young person that although he cannot honor his parents, He Himself will do this in him
As long as you love the Lord and His Word and as long as you stay with Him, He will do in you what you cannot do yourself
God has not only given us the Ten Commandments and certain ordinances and precepts; He has given us the entire Bible
We should stay with the Lord and tell Him again and again that we love Him and His Word, but that we cannot do what the Bible says
Just as iron can be burned by fire until it glows, God wants us to be burned by Him, infused and mingled with Him, until we shine with Him
If, instead of trying to love her, he stays with the Lord and is infused with Him, he will love his wife automatically
According to Galatians 3:23-24, the law also functions to guard God's chosen people and to bring them to Christ
When the element of God is transfused into us, our face shines with God, and when we stay with Christ, we spontaneously live Him
God placed the man created by Him in front of the tree of life and warned him not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
According to the New Testament, when we are baptized into the name of Jesus Christ, we are placed into the very Person of Christ
God came again and again to make promises, promises which indicate that God's intention was to do everything for man
On our part we should simply turn to Him, seek Him, love Him, be one with Him, and stand with Him in His interest
The children of Israel did not know the desire of God's heart and declared that they would do whatever God required
Many Christians have the concept that the Old Testament is a book of commandments, but the New Testament is not a book of commandments
The commandments given by the Lord in His message on the mountain are both deeper and higher than those found in the Old Testament
If we read the New Testament carefully, we shall see that the commandments given through Moses are repeated in the Epistles
As an example of the Lords requirements consider His word in Matthew 548 You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect
If this is our attitude toward the Lord, the Lord will have a way to come into us and to fulfill this requirement for us and in us
Our responsibility is to love Him, receive Him, stay with Him, and spend time with Him so that He can infuse Himself into us
All religions instruct people concerning how to do things, how to work, how to behave, and how to improve themselves
A woman could insist that she kept the law in the Old Testament even if she refused to submit to her own husband
The truth of God coming into us to do everything for us and in us is the central concept in the Bible concerning the giving of commandments
The more we are infused with Him, the more He will have a way to do everything in us and for us to fulfill the commandments He gives to us
God's eternal purpose is to work Himself into us as our life so that we may take Him as our person, live Him, and express Him
God's intention in creating man was that man would receive God into him and take Him as his life and everything to him
Because the student knows mathematics for himself, it is no longer necessary for him to depend on this teacher
If man had not fallen, man's living would not be independent from God, but man would continually take God in and live by Him
At the time of man's fall a wedge was driven between man and God, a wedge that caused a separation between them
With fallen human beings, therefore, there are two striking characteristics: independence and efforts on his own to please God
All the commandments given by God both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament reveal who God is and what He is
The Lord Jesus issued an even higher commandment: 'You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect'
If we think that we are able to fulfill the requirements of the law and then try to do so, we shall find ourselves in the 'night'
The law could only give a picture of God, but the infusion Moses received on the mountaintop actually made him one with God
Moses on the mountaintop received the infusion from without, but we today can receive a marvelous infusion from within
Paul's word in Romans 7:10 is based on Leviticus 18:5, a verse which says that those who do God's commandments will live in them
In Romans 7 Paul makes it very clear that although the law was intended to result in life, he could not fulfill the requirements of the law
Rather, we should be thankful to the law for exposing us, subduing us, and bringing us to the Lord as the source of life
In presenting a full picture of both the 'day' aspect and the 'night' aspect of the law, Paul used some negative terms to describe the law
Those who read Paul's Epistles without a full understanding may come to despise the law and think that it is not good
In Galatians the very book where Paul regards the law as a concubine and speaks of slaves Paul also uses positive terms to describe the law
On the one hand, the law is a concubine; on the other hand, it is a guardian and a child-conductor unto Christ
Although the law brings us unto Christ that we may be justified by faith and have life, the law in itself is not able to give us life
Whenever the law is separated from the living God as the source of life, it becomes the condemning and killing element to sinful people
Simply by saying they would do whatever the Lord required, they separated themselves from God, the source of life
The case of the Judaizers exemplifies the fact that the law becomes killing letters when it is separated from the living God
Others think that if a person places his hand on the Bible when taking an oath, it will not be possible for him to lie
Whether the Bible is the tree of life or the tree of knowledge to us depends on our condition and our standing
If we separate ourselves from the Lord and still attempt to use the Bible, it will become the tree of knowledge to us
Eventually, in the books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel God came in to speak about establishing another covenant, a new covenant
When Moses was on the mountaintop experiencing a divine infusion, did he receive a new heart and a new spirit?
After man's fall, God's intention is to change our heart and our spirit, and then to put Himself as the life-giving Spirit into us
We shall have a life with the ability to fulfill God's requirements, and we shall be able to live in a way that corresponds to what God is
He went on to tell them, 'You have been brought to nought from Christ, you who are justified by law; you have fallen from grace'
By turning to the law, the Galatian believers had cut themselves off from the enjoyment of Christ and from the profit of being in Christ
Galatians 5:6 says, 'For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith operating through love'
Paul says, 'For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory'
Although Paul's face did not shine in this way, he experienced an inward shining, a shining from within his spirit
With Moses and Paul there were two different kinds of shining: the outward shining upon the face and the inward shining from the spirit
In Exodus 34 we are simply told that the skin of Moses' face shone, not that glory was shining from the face of Moses
The book of Exodus says at least thirteen times that Pharaoh's heart was hardened, or that Pharaoh hardened his heart
When the children of Israel were at the foot of the mountain of God, their hearts were the same as the heart of Pharaoh
Whether the Bible is a ministry of life or of death, of righteousness or of condemnation, depends on our heart
In this message we are concerned with the matter of the veil over the glory of the ministry of condemnation and death
Verse 34 says, 'But when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out'
We read that when Moses spoke to the children of Israel, he 'put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him'
If our heart is turned away from Him, such a heart becomes a veil which keeps us from beholding the face of the Lord
Because the hearts of the children of Israel had become hardened, Moses' ministry of glory became a ministry of condemnation and death
On the day we stand before the judgment seat of Christ, the words of the New Testament may become to us words of condemnation
We see that the principle is the same both with the ministry of Moses in the Old Testament and the ministry in the New Testament
Exodus 34 emphasizes the fact that when Moses spoke to the people, he put on the veil, but when he spoke with God, he took it off
It is a very serious matter for any servant of the Lord to be unveiled in speaking to the Lord, but veiled in speaking to the people
To unbelievers and even to believers who are indifferent in heart, the gospel of grace may become a ministry of condemnation and death
How dreadful for our hearts to be indifferent when the Lord comes to us to have fellowship with us or to converse with us!
From the context of 2 Corinthians 3, we see that the heart turned to the Lord causes us to have an unveiled face
If we are covered by a veil, the result of both the Old Testament ministry and the New Testament ministry will be condemnation and death
For those whose hearts are hard and turned away from the Lord even the gospel of grace will become such a ministry of condemnation and death
Although they sit in the church meetings, they, like the children of Israel at the foot of Mount Sinai, are covered by a veil
If our heart is indifferent and turned away from the Lord, our indifferent heart will be a veil separating us from Him
We need to emphasize again and again the fact that the principle is the same in both the Old Testament and in the New
If we are impolite to Him and insult Him with our indifference, His speaking will immediately become condemnation and death to us
Otherwise even the New Testament ministry the ministry of righteousness and of the Spirit will become a ministry of condemnation and death
Such a warning is sounded throughout the New Testament, in the Gospels, in the Epistles, and in the book of Revelation
In the book of Revelation we see that the decline of the church began with the loss of the first love for the Lord
As we have indicated, in 2 Corinthians 3 Paul says that the veil is not upon Moses' face, but upon the heart of the people
In principle, they are the same as the children of Israel, who had been redeemed, delivered out of Egypt, and brought to Mount Sinai
Although the veil is done away in Christ, in our experience the veil may still exist because of problems in our heart
In brief, to be veiled is to be in the Old Testament, but to be unveiled and under God's glory is to be in the New Testament
Although Moses was chronologically in the Old Testament age, he was in the New Testament according to his spiritual condition
Whereas many of today's Christians are veiled and do not reflect God's glory, Moses could shine with the glory of God
The veil on Moses' face was a sign of this cloud and also of the cloudy relationship between the children of Israel and God
If we have an unveiled face to behold and reflect the Lord, we shall be under the New Testament in our spiritual experience
Genesis opens with a word about God's creation and concludes with a word about Joseph put in a coffin in Egypt
It was not until twenty-five centuries after the creation of man that the children of Israel were brought into such fellowship with God
On the one hand, at Mount Sinai the people were brought into fellowship with God; on the other hand, God came down to speak with them
These ordinances are found in the remaining chapters of Exodus, in the entire book of Leviticus, and in parts of Numbers and Deuteronomy
If we see that the law includes the ordinances as well as the commandments, we shall then find it easy to understand Psalm 119
In the second part of Exodus and in Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy we have the supplement to the law and the details of the law
In this message, the first on the ordinances of the law, we shall consider the ordinances concerning the worship of God
If we get into the depths of these verses, we shall see that they give us the main points of how we should worship God
The revelation here is in keeping with that found not only in the rest of the Old Testament, but also in the New Testament
In the first two of the commandments we are told not to have any gods other than God and also not to make idols
Just as a woman should have only one husband, so the children of Israel were to have only the Lord as their unique God
While Moses was on the mountaintop fellowshipping with God, the people at the foot of the mountain charged Aaron to make them a golden calf
We read of the altar, the sacrifices, the name of God being remembered, and God coming to visit His people and bless them
We see from verse 26 that the people were not to 'go up by steps' unto the Lord's altar, lest their nakedness be exposed
The reason for this is that the concept here is not redemption; it is fellowship between God and His redeemed people
If we have the altar and the sacrifices, and if we remember the Lord's name, we shall experience God's visitation and blessing
It is not wrong to have wealth, but to hold on to wealth instead of holding on to the living God is to worship idols
The commandment not to make gods of gold and silver implies that in our worship of God we should not give any place to riches
The fact that the children of Israel could erect an altar either of earth or stone indicates that the cross is readily available
If God had commanded His people to build an altar only of stone, the children of Israel might have had difficulty finding the materials
It was permissible to build an altar of earth or of stone, to receive the cross either in a strong way or in a weak way
A great heresy in Catholicism is that there is room for mans work to be added mans working is given place in receiving the cross of Christ
If someone had regarded such an altar as too crude and wanted to hew the stones to make them more beautiful that would have caused pollution
Throughout the centuries of church history, many have tried to beautify God's work of preparation by man's work
We have pointed out that of the five major sacrifices, only two-the burnt offering and the peace offering-are mentioned here in Exodus 20
The burnt offering is for God's satisfaction, and the peace offering is for the people's enjoyment with God mutually
To present the peace offering means that we offer Christ to God for our enjoyment and satisfaction mutually with God
We see that, with the mention of the sacrifices, the basic principles of genuine and proper worship are revealed in 20:22-26
Throughout the thousands of years of human history, thoughtful people have considered the matter of the worship of God
After giving them the Ten Commandments, the governing principles of the entire law of God, God went on to issue a number of ordinances
Those who live in New York, Paris, and Tokyo may boast respectively of the Empire State Building, the Eiffel Tower, and the Tokyo Tower
The first occurrence of this was at Babel , where the people sought to build not only a city, but also a tower of which they could boast
As far as the worship of God is concerned, God gives no room for man's skill, ability, inventiveness, wisdom, labor, or power
People use their wisdom to make plans and use their power, including whatever skills and abilities they possess, to carry out their plans
In 20:24-26 God gave them a clear word concerning worship, telling them to make an altar either of earth or of stones
They were not to use hewn stones, and they were not to build an altar so high that it required steps in order to reach it
Many regard Christianity as a revealed religion a religion which has its source in Gods revelation and regard all other religions as natural
God does not give even the slightest amount of space to man's power, ability, skill, strength, wisdom, or plans
People may claim to worship God, but in their worship the work and way of man have actually caused them to put God aside
When the Roman Empire embraced Christianity, many elements of culture were brought into the so-called Catholic Church
If we study the history of religion and the present situation of Christianity, we shall see an abundance of man's work and way
Cain did not realize that he was totally pollution in God's sight and that whatever came from him was also pollution
Anything that originates with us, anything which comes from our labor, is pollution and is not acceptable to God
It is foolishness because it is something crude, primitive, and altogether without culture, beauty, or human craftsmanship
It is significant that here Paul does not say that he preached Christ resurrected, ascended, glorified, or enthroned
Paul preached Christ crucified; he preached One who was put to death on the cross, executed as if He were a criminal
The decision to receive such a Christ did not originate with us; we have received Him because God has called us
Because we do not add man's work to the cross, but only have an altar that is primitive, the Lord's speaking is with us
Because we do not give place to the work of man, the Lord continues to open His Word to us and to send forth His light
Exodus 20:26 says, 'Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon'
Immediately after the fall, Adam and Eve discovered that they were naked, and they tried to make a covering for themselves
Should the elders in a church exercise their wisdom to make plans or to build something elevated with steps, Christ will be set aside
If we presume to advise others and tell them what to do, we shall expose our nakedness, the shame of our fallen nature
The priests in the Old Testament had to wear long robes so that God could see only the garment which covered them
To be sure, man's way promotes his own achievement by natural ability and creates different levels of attainment
Just as adding man's work to the cross is abominable to God, so man's way in the worship of God is also abominable to Him
As we have pointed out, the cross not only provides man with Christ's redemption; it also terminates fallen man with his ability and wisdom
On the one hand, a person terminated by the cross worships God in the virtue of Christ as the burnt offering for God's satisfaction
Let us learn not to bring our work and our way, our power and our wisdom, our ability and our plans, into the worship of God
A true worshipper of God is one who is terminated on the cross with his power and wisdom and who worships God in the virtue of Christ
In 20:22-26 we see that the worship God desires is worship through the cross and with Christ, through the altar and with the sacrifices
We must worship God through the cross which terminates us and with Christ who brings God and all the worshippers into a mutual satisfaction
There is no doubt that 20:22-26 is a supplement to the second and third commandments and also adds details to these commandments
We may have followed Pauls sequence in Ephesians and Colossians and spoken of wives husbands children and parents before slaves and masters
It is indeed strange and very significant that of all the ordinances in these three chapters the first mentioned is that related to slavery
One of the best ways to understand the Bible is to endeavor to touch the spirit of the particular portion of the Word under consideration
Even though Christ was equal with God and had the highest rank in the universe, He became a person on the lowest level of society
A slave is one who does not stand on his own rights; instead, he is always willing to serve others and sacrifice himself for them
How different things would be if all men became slaves sacrificing and serving instead of fighting for their own interests!
In Romans 13:8 and 10 Paul says, 'He who loves another has fulfilled the law,' for 'love is the fulfillment of the law'
In Galatians 5:14 Paul declares, 'For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself'
In order to keep the ordinances, we must empty ourselves, humble ourselves, take the lowest position, and regard ourselves as nothing
In Psalm 40:6 we have the Lord's word to God: 'Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened'
Because the Lord Jesus loved God the Father, He kept the Father's word not only as a Son, but especially as a slave
The Father gave this commandment to the Lord, and out of love for the Father the Lord obeyed Him as a slave and went to the cross
To keep His word, we need to empty ourselves and humble ourselves, laying aside the rank both of a creature and of a son
As a slave of Christ and of God, Paul was willing to empty himself, humble himself, and sacrifice his rank, rights, and privileges
If the Israelite did not have the spirit of a slave, he might rejoice to see harm done to cattle belonging to his enemy
If he obtained a wife and children during his years as a slave, he was to leave them as the property of his master and 'go out by himself'
Many Christians are serving God, but they do not stand by the doorpost, and their ear has not been bored through with an awl
The elders in the churches need to realize that if they are not willing to be slaves, they cannot be proper elders
Those who are not willing to have the spirit of a slave cannot enter into all these messages in a practical way
In the past certain ones testified that they loved the church and were willing to consecrate themselves to the church
My burden in this message has been to emphasize three matters: the spirit of a slave, the love of a slave, and the obedience of a slave
In the New Testament economy, as well as in the Old Testament, there is the need of such a spirit, love, and obedience
Now we can see why God puts the ordinance concerning slaves first and why the slave here is a type of Christ, the true slave
As those who believe in Christ belong to Him and have His life of sacrifice we also must be slaves loving God the church and Gods people
Although it is easy to touch the body of the Word outwardly, it is often rather difficult to touch the spirit of the Bible inwardly
We are told that if an ox killed a slave, the owner had to pay a smaller amount than if the ox killed a free man
All the ordinances in chapters twenty-one through twenty-three were written by Moses according to God's dictation
The laws and ordinances of God in the Bible are written in a way that is very different from the way man-made laws are written
We have pointed out that when given the opportunity to be free, a slave could say, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children
In 21:1-6 we can see the spirit of a slave, the love of a slave, the obedience of a slave, and also the life of a slave
If we consider carefully all the ordinances in chapters twenty-one through twenty-three, we shall realize that every ordinance is sweet
The more we consider these ordinances, the more we realize the sweetness of the spirit in which they were written
As we read these verses, we should observe the principle of noting the sweet spirit in which they were written
If an Israelite slew a person by guile, he could not find safety even if he ran to the altar and laid hold of the horns of the altar
We may flee into Him as our refuge because, in God's sight, the things we have done may be regarded as mistakes
We may not have smitten our parents or cursed them; however, some may have cursed their parents inwardly, within their hearts
The details to the tenth commandment, the commandment which forbids coveting, in 22:7-15 indicate that coveting is a matter of greed
It is not easy to be pure concerning valuables belonging to another which are committed to our care for a period of time
Exodus 23:1 clearly says, 'Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness'
We may think that the ordinances in 23:12 and 13 are concerned with man's relationship with God instead of man's relationship with others
We see that keeping the Sabbath day not only involves our relationship with God, but involves our relationship with others
An Israelite was to observe the Sabbath so that the son of his handmaid and the strangers might rest and be refreshed
Exodus 21:16 says, 'He that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death'
We have pointed out that this ordinance is inserted between two verses which speak respectively of smiting one's parents and cursing them
It may be that those who would steal people for the purpose of selling them were also those who did not honor their own parents
Exodus 22:21 says, 'Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt'
In the book of Ruth we see that, according to the ordinance of the law, the poor were allowed to gather the gleanings
These gleanings are the same in principle as the crumbs under the table in Matthew 15 and the produce of the seventh year in Exodus 23
The first supplement to the law concerning man's relationship with God is that man must submit to God and to His authority
The divine ordinances also require that we honor our parents, for parents represent God as the source of human life
Preserving human life, honoring parents, and maintaining the purity of marriage are all according to God's plan
Exodus 23:14-17 speaks of three annual feasts: the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of harvest, and the feast of ingathering
In order to feast with God, God's people must be without leaven, and they also must sow in order to have a harvest
The most significant aspect of the ordinances in these three chapters of Exodus is that in them Christ is typified by implication
Because such vast riches are found beneath the surface, it is not sufficient merely to know the Bible in black and white letters
In particular, many 'diamonds' are hidden beneath the surface of chapters twenty-one through twenty-three of Exodus
My burden in this message and in the message following is to mine these 'diamonds' and present them to the Lord's people
In the decree of the law with its ordinances there is a clear indication that man is fallen and is living in the fall
Words like pollution nakedness slavery murder stealing coveting and witch strongly point both to mans fall and to his living in the fall
If man had not fallen, or if man were not living in a fallen condition, there would be no need for God to give such ordinances
If we pay attention to words like pollution murder lying and idols we may be enlightened to see that mans living in the fall is indicated
Because of man's fall and because of man's living in the fall, there was the need for God to come in to decree the law with its ordinances
Although Satan is not mentioned in these chapters by name, his existence behind the negative things is implied
In the light of the full revelation of the holy Scriptures, we can trace the word coveting to indwelling sin, and indwelling sin to Satan
Hidden beneath coveting is indwelling sin, and concealed under indwelling sin is Satan, the Devil, with his lusts
In Romans Paul deals with sins in chapters one through three, and he deals with indwelling sin in chapters five through eight
On the negative side, the ordinances in Exodus 21 through 23 point to Satan, demons, indwelling sin, and outward sins
By preparing cities of refuge into which a person may flee, He even provides for the mistake of one who kills another unintentionally
The ordinance concerning worshipping God through the altar and with the sacrifices was intended for fallen man, not for angels
Angels are spectators, those who observe Christ and the cross, but we are partakers, those who enjoy Christ and the cross
As students of the Word of God, we need to consider all the implications, indications, and significances found in these chapters
After we are terminated by the cross, we enter into resurrection, and in resurrection we can be replaced by Christ
As we have indicated the need for redemption indicates that we are sinful and the need for termination indicates that we are a hopeless case
The freeing of a slave in a sabbatical year signifies that fallen man under bondage may be freed by God's rest , which is Christ
The gospel declares the good news that when Christ, God's rest, appears to us, our slavery is ended, and we are set free
The murder and the lies within man signify that the Devil, the source of murder and the father of lies, is working in fallen man
As long as a person has murdering and lying within him, the Devil, the source of murder and the father of lies, is working in him
When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He prayed, 'Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing'
The fact that a certain person does not repent indicates that he is not a mistaken sinner, but is a willful sinner
If anyone refuses the gospel and does not repent, God will regard him as a willful sinner, one destined to perish
If God had not delivered the Lord Jesus into the hands of the Jews and Romans, the Lord would not have been crucified
After God delivered Him into the hands of those who crucified Him, the Lord Jesus prayed for the ones to whom He had been delivered
According to what is indicated by 21:13, Christ is the One delivered into the hands of mistaken sinners and killed by them
When he was persecuting the believers, the Lord Jesus appeared to him and said, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me'?
Exodus 21:13 is the unique verse in the Bible indicating that God delivered the Lord Jesus into the hands of mistaken sinners
If you are not satisfied, you may resort to stealing, to the transgressing of God's regulation in order to make base gain
Because God is our Creator and we are His creatures, we should be satisfied with the circumstances He assigns to us
The ordinance concerning coveting signifies that Satan's lusting nature has become the indwelling sin within fallen man to deaden his body
Whenever we are greedy or covetous, we should realize that this issues from Satan operating in us as indwelling sin
According to James 4:4, loving the world causes one to be an adulterer, for it confuses one's relationship with God
The fallen church is not merely an adulteress; she is a fornicator and for this reason is called a harlot in Revelation 17
The ordinance which requires submission to God and His authority signifies the subduing of the rebellious nature of Satan within man
The ordinances in 23:4 and 5 signify Christ bringing the lost things of life to fallen man and helping him in releasing his burden
These ordinances also signify that we should reconcile ourselves, by such a life of Christ, with our enemies and those who hate us
These ordinances also signify that, by the life of Christ, we should be reconciled with our enemies and those who hate us
It is easy to read and understand the ordinances in Exodus 21 through 23 merely according to the letters in black and white
We can trace murder to the Devil, the founder, the source, of murder, the one who was 'a murderer from the beginning'
In the same principle, the word coveting leads us to the matter of indwelling sin described by Paul in Romans 7
On the positive side, we need to consider the implications, indications, and significances of the words altar and sacrifice in 20:24 and 25
A number of Bible teachers have pointed out that the altar typifies the cross and that the sacrifices typify Christ
Not many teachers have gone on to find out how Christ is typified by other items in chapters twenty-one through twenty-three of Exodus
In principle, every kind of law has a certain spirit and also presents a picture of something, usually of the one who made the law
The fourth and fifth commandments are concerned respectively with remembering the Sabbath day and with honoring father and mother
In the ordinances we can see Christ and also Christ's redemption accomplished fully according to the economy of God
As we shall see, in chapters twenty-one through twenty-three we have Christ, redemption, and the economy of God
Both on the positive side and on the negative side, the ordinances of the law are rich in their implications, indications, and significances
They present a vivid picture of fallen man living in the fall, filled with sins, involved with Satan, related to demons, and fully enslaved
Having fled into Christ and having come to enjoy Him as our rest and freedom, we need to live in Him by having the harvest and the tears
We need a proper interpretation of these ordinances to know their indications, implications, and significances
We need to flee into Christ, enjoy Him as our rest and freedom, and then live in Him, the all-inclusive One, as the good land
In our experience of Christ not only should we have the fullness, but we should also have the tears, the flow of wine and oil
By the press, by the cross, wine flows out to cheer God and man, even to be used as a drink offering, and oil flows out to please God
The fullness and the tears signify the rich experience of Christ and the overflow from the suffering of the cross
Christ is not only the wheat and the barley, but He is also the grape to produce wine and the olive to produce oil
The Christian life is a life continually under the pressing of the cross in order that the riches of Christ may flow
If we would live in Christ, we need both the fullness of the harvest and the tears, the flow from the wine and oil presses
Shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me'
According to Exodus 13, the reason for this was that the firstborn among the children of Israel were redeemed at the Passover
Although these firstborn deserve to be slain by God, the firstborn of the children of Israel were redeemed by the Passover lamb
By offering the firstborn unto God, the children of Israel remembered what God did at the time of the Passover
If we would live in Christ, we need always to remember that because Christ has redeemed us, we are not our own, but we belong to God
In order to live in Christ, as God's chosen people we need to have a holy life, a life saturated with Christ as holiness
Exodus 22:31 also says, 'Neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs'
Keeping the Sabbath day enabled others to rest and be refreshed, whereas observing the sabbatical year supplied others with food
Some Christians may cause people to rest and even be refreshed; however, not many can supply others with spiritual food
We should not merely seek to live in Christ ourselves, but should also seek to bring the enjoyment of Christ to others
We should supply others with rest and refreshment, then with spiritual food, the produce of the field, the vineyard, and the orchard
These three annual feasts were the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of harvest, and the feast of ingathering
Keeping the feast of harvest, the second feast, typifies the enjoyment of the firstfruit of the Spirit of the resurrected Christ
In the Old Testament the feast of harvest is related not to oil, a type of the Spirit, but to the firstfruit, which typifies Christ
Today virtually all believers, even those who have no heart for the Lord, know that Pentecost is related to the Spirit
The type in the Old Testament of the feast of harvest indicates that the resurrected Christ is the Spirit in the fulfillment of this feast
The Spirit who came on the day of Pentecost is the fulfillment of the firstfruit offered to God in the Old Testament
We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that these three feasts signify the full enjoyment of the Triune God in Christ
We shall have the enjoyment of Christ the Son; second, the enjoyment of God the Spirit; and, consummately, the enjoyment of God the Father
Finally, we saw that keeping feasts unto God three times a year typifies the full enjoyment of the Triune God in Christ
When the people came to the feast, they were not allowed to mix the blood of the sacrifice with leavened bread
Exodus 23:19 says, 'The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of Jehovah thy God'
At other times, we may think that a certain experience of Christ is a topmost experience when it is actually quite ordinary and common
Not seething a kid in his mother's milk typifies that the milk of the word of God should not be used to kill new believers in Christ
The word of Christ which produces milk should be used always to nourish the babes in Christ, never to kill them
As we are enjoying the Triune God in Christ as typified by the feasts, we need to observe these four supplementary ordinances
These ordinances reveal that we have fled into Christ, have taken Him as our refuge, and now enjoy rest and freedom in Him
We must have the fullness of the harvest and also the tears of the presses, the outflow of wine and oil, to offer to God
As we live in Christ, we should offer to God both the fullness of the harvest and also the tears of the presses
We should always take the standing as those who have been redeemed through Christ as our Substitute and who have been separated unto God
In particular, the parents should testify to their children that we do not belong to the world, but we belong to God
We should partake of the sacrifices slain by God on the altar, not the flesh torn by the Devil, demons, or evil men in the field
If we live in Christ according to these ordinances, we shall no doubt keep the Sabbath weekly and also the sabbatical year every seven years
Whenever we enjoy the Triune God in Christ, we should not put Christ's redemption together with our sinful life
Anyone who remains in the sinful life is not able to apply the blood of Christ and not able to partake of the feasts
Of 'boiling' the new ones or the young ones, we should use our experience of Christ and our knowledge of the Word to feed them
There is a danger that we would use this milk not to feed others, but to 'boil' them by condemning them or rebuking them
We all should heed the warning not to use our milk, the supply of Christ, to boil others, but always use it to feed them
In these chapters we first have the decree of the Ten Commandments and then the decree of the ordinances of the law
If we would take possession of the promised land, we must deal with the frustraters and also pay attention to the boundaries of the land
The concluding word of the decree of the law and the ordinances refers to the Angel of Jehovah and the promised land
If we did not have the experience of the press in the church life and in our family life there would be no tears no outflow of wine and oil
My intention is to train you, discipline you, and regulate you so that you may be a proper people for Me to bring into the good land
For this reason, immediately after the decree of the law and the ordinances, God speaks of the Angel bringing the people into the good land
Those who follow the way of systematic theology may ask how we can say that Christ the Son and the Father are one
If the Father and the Son are one, they ask, how could the Son pray to the Father, and how could the Father answer the Son?
The Jehovah who appeared to Moses is the Triune God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob
As we consider the fact that God's speaking was the Angel's voice, we see that it involves the matter of the Trinity
We have pointed out that the Trinity denotes both the dispensation of the Triune God and the application of the Triune God
According to the Word of God, it is a fact that apart from the Trinity God has no way to apply Himself to His people
An excellent illustration of the Angel's guarding is found in chapter fourteen, when the Egyptians were pursuing the Israelites
A well-known hymn even speaks of crossing the cold waves of the Jordan and passing over into the promised land of heaven
According to the concept of many, to die is to cross the Jordan, and to enter into the land is to go to heaven
Having been redeemed through Christ as the Passover lamb, on our way to the good land we enjoy Christ as the manna and the rock
In our natural life there are many frustraters which hinder us from taking possession of the all-inclusive Christ
Exodus 23:24 indicates that these pagan tribes had idols: 'Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works'
They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee'
If God were to cut off all the tribes within one year, much of the land would be desolate, and the beasts would multiply against the people
As God's people increased, the Lord would cut off the tribes according to the degree of the numerical increase of His people
God will not cut off the pagan tribes once for all, but He will do it 'by little and little' according to our growth
We saw that the Angel of Jehovah was sent by Jehovah , that Jehovah's name is in Him , and that He is actually Jehovah Himself
In this message and in the message following, we need to pay attention to the details concerning the way to take possession of the land
These expressions from Philippians 3 are the fulfillment of the type of possessing the promised land in the Old Testament
For this reason, God has given us both the types in the Old Testament and statements of fact in the New Testament
Just as children put together the pieces of a puzzle, so we need to fit together various parts of the Bible in order to see a picture
We have seen that the ordinances in Exodus 21 through 23 are very rich in their implications, indications, and significances
23:20-33 tells us in a detailed way not only how to enter into the land, but also how to take possession of this land for our enjoyment
In these verses not a great deal is said either concerning the Angel of Jehovah or concerning the good land itself
A good deal of attention is given to the frustraters, the pagan tribes that would keep God's people from possessing the promised land
The driver of an automobile needs not only a bird's eye view of the city, but also a detailed understanding of the streets
In these fourteen verses we have a detailed 'map' for our spiritual 'driving' into the promised land, the all-inclusive Christ
If we would take possession of the promised land, we must learn to obey the Angel of Jehovah, the One sent to us from God
In order to take possession of Christ, we need to realize that we have Him with us, even within us, as a living Person
Because they hear the Lord's voice, many times it is not necessary for their parents or anyone else to tell them what to do
Exodus 23:21 says, 'Take ye heed before him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions'
These details are related to taking heed to Him, obeying Him, not provoking Him, and not being pardoned by Him of our transgressions
After charging us not to provoke the Angel of Jehovah, verse 21 says, 'He will not pardon your transgressions'
Although we may shout and try to rejoice, the Lord is silent, still unhappy with us and continuing to withhold His pardon
We need to realize that if we provoke the Lord by not obeying His voice, He may not pardon our transgression right away
You may think that after praying like this everything is all right, but this may not be the feeling of the Lord within you
According to verse 23, the Angel of Jehovah would go before the people and bring them into the land occupied by the pagan tribes
The Lord promised, 'I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee'
In Philippians 2:13 we find a word which corresponds to God's promise in the Old Testament to drive out the pagan tribes little by little
Whether the natural life appears to be good or bad, simply because it is natural it has these four extremely negative characteristics
At such a time your facial expression is not that of a gentleman, much less that of a son of God; it is the expression of a demon
In verse 29 God indicates that He will drive out the tribes, but in verse 31 He says, 'Thou shalt drive them out before thee'
We pray that the Lord will clear away all the aspects of our natural life so that we may be spiritual people, but He does not answer us
The more Gods people increased in the land numerically the greater would be the number of pagans God would cut off and drive out of the land
God's driving out of the pagan tribes from within us depends on our growth in life, on the increase of Christ in us
In order to take possession of the promised land, God's people must cooperate with Him in destroying the pagan tribes
When Israel lived in the promised land, their sins came from the source of the pagan tribes that were still in the land
In the sight of God, all those who live according to the natural life are sinning continually, even when they give alms or donate to charity
As the source of sin among God's people, the natural life frustrates them from possessing Christ as the good land
Because the natural life keeps us from possessing Christ and enjoying Him, we must hate it and, as we grow, be willing to drive it out
If we take the initiative to drive out the natural life, God will come in to honor us and strengthen us in this matter
If we are not willing to do this, not willing to cooperate with God, God has no way to impart life to our mortal bodies
Romans 8:23 speaks of our groaning, and verse 26, of the Spirit interceding for us 'with groanings which cannot be uttered'
At the time of the Reformation, Luther fought against this teaching and declared that salvation is by grace, not by works
No matter how much the mother loves the child and how carefully she prepares nourishing food for him, she cannot eat for him
We must grow to have the increase of Christ and be replaced by Him so that we may take the initiative to drive out the natural life
Without food and drink it would have been impossible for His people to take possession of the land and live in it
If you visit a group of Christians and see that the Word and the Spirit are blessed there, you should say, 'Lord, thank You
Only by having the blessed Word and Spirit can we take possession of Christ enjoying Him experiencing Him and obtaining Him to the uttermost
When the Lord Jesus came, there was widespread sickness among God's people: blindness, deafness, dumbness, and paralysis
If we are spiritually healthy in every way, we shall be able to take possession of Christ as the good land and experience Him
If we have many among us who are spiritually aged, mature, this is a proof that we are taking Christ as our possession
The second, third, and fourth aspects of the Lord's complete care are dependent on the first-His blessing on our food and drink
As a result, we shall have the strength to take the initiative to drive out the pagan tribes, the natural life
We thank the Lord for this picture in the Old Testament showing us in detail how to take possession of Christ as the good land
As we have pointed out, the book of Exodus begins with God's redemption and concludes with God's dwelling place
It is crucial to realize that the law is a portrait revealing what kind of God has chosen us, called us, and redeemed us
We are thankful to the Lord for the clear picture of Himself He has given in chapters twenty through twenty-three
May we be deeply impressed that the law and the ordinances decreed by God on Mount Sinai present a clear view of God and His economy
After giving His people such a revelation of Himself and His economy, God's intention was to reveal the desire of His heart
We praise the Lord that the book of Exodus has not only twenty-three or twenty-four chapters, but forty chapters
In this message and in a few that follow, we shall walk on this bridge from one section of Exodus to the other
Although we may be eager to get to the other side, we cannot do so without spending a certain amount of time on the bridge
Without such an official enactment, the contract would exist as a written statement, but it would not be binding on either party
Although the law had been decreed on the mountain of God, there was still the need for the law with its ordinances to be enacted
Before Moses climbed the mountain again with the leaders to receive further revelation, he took care of enacting the law
Before the second part of the revelation was given, Moses was told to go down, call the leading ones, and bring them up to the mountain
The fact that Moses enacted the law before ascending the mountain again shows that this enactment was very important
As we shall see, all the principles involved in the enactment of the law through Moses correspond to God's economy
We should not think that everything which took place during the time the law was decreed and enacted has been recorded in the Bible
No doubt, God must have told Moses to descend from the mountain and enact the law which He had decreed, and to enact it in a specific way
In ancient times, when two parties entered into a covenant, they usually used some kind of birds or animals as a sacrifice
If God did not expect the people to observe the law, they say, what was the need for Him to give them the law?
In vivid contrast to God who is holy and righteous and full of love and light the people were fallen sinful rotten and thoroughly corrupt
Their fallenness and corruption are exposed through the ordinances, especially those which refer to fornication, theft, and witchcraft
Humanly speaking, since there was to be a covenant between God and man, the law did function as the conditions or terms of this covenant
Exodus 24:4 says, 'And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill'
Initially the sacrifices offered on the altar were their substitute, but eventually this substitute would become their replacement
Because the law is weak through our flesh, God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin to redeem us, terminate us, and replace us
By doing this he seemed to be telling them, 'You children of Israel must realize that you need to be redeemed, terminated, and replaced'
These pillars stood as a testimony that God would establish the building, the temple, and that its strength would be in Him
After we have been redeemed, terminated, and replaced, we become pillars, the testimony of God, reflecting what He is
Out of ignorance of God's economy, many of today's Christians think that the New Testament was given for them to keep and observe
The New Testament was not written so that Christians would observe its requirements; it was given to make Christians a reflection of God
As the law is a testimony of God, so God intended that the people of Israel would become a living testimony of Him
If we become such a reflection and testimony, then surely the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in us
Christ first became the burnt offering offered to God to satisfy Him and then He became the peace offering to make peace between man and God
The more we are replaced by Christ in our experience, the more we become the burnt offering and the peace offering
By our own efforts to keep the law it is impossible for us to satisfy God, to have peace with God, or to enjoy Christ with God
According to the natural concept, the almighty God, the Creator, the holy One, has given us the law that we may observe and keep it
When we read a certain requirement in the Bible, it is easy for us to make up our mind to fulfill that requirement ourselves
If we experience Christ and the cross in this way, we shall have not only the altar and the sacrifices, but also the twelve pillars
Hallelujah for Christ's marvelous redemption and replacement that can transform fallen, corrupted sinners into pillars!
Exodus 24:6 says, 'And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar'
Although we are sinful, fallen, and corrupted, we have the blood for our redemption and for the forgiveness of sins
Hebrews 922 declares And almost all things are purified by blood according to the law and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness
We have seen that for God's people to become His living testimony and reflection, they had to be redeemed, terminated, and replaced
According to Ezekiel 36, this results from a profound inward change, from receiving a new heart, a new spirit, and the divine Spirit
Lacking revelation and vision, many of today's Christians are the same as the children of Israel in this respect
We also may still be under the influence of the religious concept and think that we are able to obey the law of God
Rather, we should be terminated and replaced in order to become pillars as God's living testimony, a reflection of God in Christ
May we all see that God's desire is to work Himself into us and to reconstitute us with Himself that we may be His testimony
Under the influence of this concept, we may try our best to keep God's laws in order to be approved by Him and to please Him
We may think that God gave the law to His people so that by keeping the law they would maintain a good relationship with Him
We have pointed out that the way Moses enacted the law was very different from what we would expect as the common human way
As we have emphasized again and again, this can take place only by the cross of Christ, by the blood of Christ, and by Christ Himself
Although the law itself does not depict God's economy, the enactment of the law does portray the economy of God
By putting His nature into us as the law of life, God changes our heart, regenerates our spirit, and imparts Himself into us as the Spirit
In this way we are gradually replaced and reconstituted to become a living testimony, a living portrait, of what God is
Through the ministry of Paul in the New Testament, we see that God desires to reconstitute us of Christ and thereby make us His testimony
May all the saints see this revelation and experience the tremendous difference it makes in our Christian life
Even readers of the Bible who are familiar with the term 'the blood of the covenant' may not know the true significance of it
We may realize that the blood is the redeeming blood, the cleansing blood, the sanctifying blood, and the blood which overcomes the enemy
Prior to this, the law was decreed by God and, through Moses as their representative, it was received by the children of Israel
As we have pointed out, Moses enacted the law in a way that was quite different from what we would expect according to the natural concept
Exodus 24:6 says, 'And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar'
We have seen that, according to verse 8, Moses also sprinkled the blood on the people and said, 'Behold the blood of the covenant'
In the foregoing message we placed great emphasis on the fact that it was not God's intention to have His people observe the law He decreed
Exodus 24:3 says, 'All the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which Jehovah hath said will we do'
If it was not God's intention that His people observe the law decreed by Him, then what was His intention in giving them His law?
If through redemption God's people are brought to Him and have contact with Him, they will then have God infused into them
As the representative of the children of Israel, Moses was brought into the presence of God and stayed there for quite a time
If the redeeming blood had not been in view, God could not have tolerated a fallen, sinful, corrupted man remaining in His presence
Although we may come forward boldly to the throne of grace, the children of Israel were not permitted to touch the propitiatory cover
The only one qualified to do this was the one who brought with him the redeeming blood from the altar in the outer court
Although he was a fallen, sinful, and corrupted person, through the blood he was ushered into the presence of God
Staying in God's presence for a period of forty days, Moses was infused with God and even became His reflection
He enacted the law not according to the intention of the children of Israel, but according to the intention of God
No matter how foolish and ignorant the children of Israel were, Moses nevertheless enacted the law according to God's way
The Lord has accomplished redemption for us, and His blood is available to cleanse us and bring us into His presence
According to the revelation in the New Testament, we are not only brought into God's presence-we are brought into God Himself
When many believers read the Scriptures, they think that the commandments contained in the Word are for them to keep
The redeeming blood of Christ will bring us into the Triune God, and we shall be infused with Him to become pillars
We have very little realization of how contaminated and defiled we are, and how contagious is the evil within us
The very fact that blood is mentioned indicates that the children of Israel needed forgiveness and that God was ready to forgive them
If God had not been willing to forgive the people, He could have set the sacrifices aside and put the people all to death
The blood for forgiveness of sins ushered the sinful party of the covenant, the children of Israel, into better things
We know this by the fact that after God's people failed to observe the law, He came in to make another covenant with them
At the foot of Mount Sinai the children of Israel spoke foolishly to Moses when they promised to do whatever the Lord commanded
Eventually she understood that although we may love God with our hearts, we need another organ, the spirit, to contact Him and receive Him
A new heart, a new spirit, and the Spirit of God can all be ours because the blood has been shed for the forgiveness of sins
Because we have a new heart, a new spirit, the Spirit of God, and the inward law of life, we have the ability of life to know God
The promises in Ezekiel 36:26 and 27 and Jeremiah 31:33 and 34 have not yet been fulfilled with the children of Israel
Even in Old Testament times, the high priests could enter the Holy of Holies through the redeeming blood shed on the altar
Aaron was the first to enter the Holy of Holies in this way and to behold the shekinah glory of God and to be under God's infusion
Leviticus 16:11-16 is an important passage showing that the blood shed on the altar enabled the high priest to enter into the Holy of Holies
Because the Lord has opened the way and brings us in, we may enjoy God in the Holy of Holies and daily be infused with Him
Praise Him that through the redeeming blood we have life and have been brought into His presence to serve Him!
They shall not hunger anymore, neither shall they thirst anymore, neither shall the sun beat upon them, nor any heat'
We have God Himself, the divine life, the divine nature, the inward law of life, and the ability of life to know God
The blood of the covenant brings us into the presence of God, into the infusion of God, and into the eternal enjoyment of God
It is extremely difficult for the natural mind to grasp the idea that through the blood of the covenant God becomes our portion
Certain articles even stated, although in a superficial way, that the new testament was enacted through the blood
As a result, we have the inward law, which is actually God Himself, to produce in us not only what God requires, but also what God is
Notice that here the Lord does not charge us to observe all the requirements; He tells us to be perfect as the Father is perfect
Because of the blood sprinkled in the Holy of Holies, he could enjoy God, behold His beauty, and receive His infusion
We see that through the washing of the blood, we have the right to come to the tree of life and enter into the city, New Jerusalem
We see the details concerning the design, materials, and construction of the tabernacle as God's dwelling place on earth
We need many messages covering the details of the wonderful, heavenly visions described in chapters twenty-five through forty of Exodus
The goal of God's salvation revealed in the book of Exodus is to bring His people into the tabernacle as His dwelling place
When we come to this portion of Exodus, we are at the threshold of the heavenly visions contained in the following chapters
The people were slaves in Egypt under Pharaoh's tyranny, but God prepared Moses and then sent him as an apostle to rescue the people
God's people had to pass through all these experiences before they could stand at the threshold in chapter twenty-four
We have pointed out that when the law of God was enacted, Moses built an altar, and sacrifices were offered with the shedding of blood
The altar, the sacrifices, and the blood indicate that God regarded His chosen people as having been redeemed, terminated, and replaced
As indicated by the twelve pillars set up by Moses, they could become pillars standing before God to reflect Him as His living testimony
Today when either Jews or Christians read Exodus 24, they are veiled and do not understand the significance of these things
He realized that He had gained a people who were redeemed, terminated, and replaced to become His living testimony
In the eyes of God, all His redeemed people have been terminated by the cross and replaced by Christ and with Christ
Moses could only liken what they saw under God's feet to a transparent sapphire stone, which was like the body of heaven in clearness
Have you ever been in a chapel or cathedral where the people worshipped God by eating, drinking, rejoicing, and enjoying the Lord?
We should not try to analyze the Bible according to our natural mentality, and we should not try to systematize biblical doctrine
John 1:18 says that no one has seen God at any time, but Exodus 24 says that the seventy elders and the others who were with Moses saw God
Questions like these remind us that the Bible is divine spiritual and mysterious and cannot be systematized or analyzed by the natural mind
If you have experienced the Lord in this way, it is a sign that your fellowship with Him has been enriched and uplifted
In chapter twenty-four, after the blood of the covenant was sprinkled on the people, the sky immediately became clear
When some hear us testify of seeing God in this way, they may find fault and say, 'This is absurd and even heretical
Only when we are in such a clear atmosphere can we receive the heavenly vision of the building of God's dwelling place
They might have seen something, but they did not have as full a view as did those who were with Moses on the mountain
Those who have had this experience of seeing the Lord under a transparent and clear sky will not trade it for anything in the world
It will seem that in front of your eyes there is something which resembles the body of heaven in its clearness
In such an environment, you will see God and the heavenly vision concerning the desire of His heart to have a dwelling place on earth
Many of those who are truly saved have not yet come up the mountain to behold the Lord in a transparent and clear heaven
The reason is that in our spiritual experience of fellowship with God we are still Joshua; we are not yet Moses
Just as we are not able to locate Joshua in the remainder of Exodus 24, we also cannot be located by others and we cannot tell where we are
We need to consider the picture portrayed in Exodus 24 and ask ourselves where we are in our fellowship with the Lord
Are we with the people at the foot of the mountain, are we with those on the mountain, or are we Moses on the mountaintop?
Among believers today there are different degrees of fellowship with the Lord and different degrees of closeness to Him
The Bible teachers among the Brethren in particular devoted a great deal of time to the study of the tabernacle
From that time onward the temple was no longer the house of God; it had become the house of the degraded Israelites
Concerning the New Jerusalem, Revelation 21:3 says, 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall tabernacle with them'
Christ is the tabernacle, the church is the enlarged tabernacle, and the New Jerusalem will be the consummate tabernacle
The tabernacle not only typifies Christ as an individual person, but also typifies the church as a corporate dwelling place of God
The first twenty-four chapters are a record of preparation, and the last sixteen chapters are a record of the building of the tabernacle
In Ephesians 1:22 and 23 Paul speaks of the church which is Christ's Body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all
In Exodus we have not only the ark-Christ, but also the tabernacle-Christ, not only the individual Christ, but also the corporate Christ
If we apply the type of the tabernacle only to Christ individually, everything about it may be objective and doctrinal
For this reason, as we consider chapters twenty-five through forty of Exodus, our emphasis will be more on experience
In order for Christ to have the Body, the church, as His enlargement, we need to have much experience of Christ
The crossing of the Red Sea signifies baptism, which separates us from Egypt, the world, and delivers us from the tyranny of Satan
If we lack the initial experiences, we shall not be able to see the vision recorded in chapters twenty-five through forty
After God's people passed through the initial experiences, they entered into intimate fellowship with God at Mount Sinai
Many of us can testify that when we have intimate fellowship with God and receive His revelation, we are exposed
Some experiences we had in the Lord's recovery years ago demonstrate that it takes time to see God's revelation
In 1964 some brothers decided that they would move to different cities in the United States to spread the church life
Of caring for the materials which correspond to God's revelation, Christians are taught how to organize and how to use psychology
According to the Old Testament, an offering is something created by God and prepared by Him, yet gained, possessed, and enjoyed by us
Although the lamb was created by God and prepared by Him, the one offering it had to gain it in a rightful way
Through our experience, we shall have the right and the position to offer these materials to God as a heave offering
We have pointed out that the materials used in building the church must be in the character of resurrection and in a heavenly position
When you are about to express love for a saint, you need to discern whether this love is natural or in resurrection
You need to ask whether your love is according to your natural taste, tendency, and purpose, or is of the character of resurrection
For us to be built up together as God's dwelling place, we need both the redeeming life and the generating life
If we would be built up, we need the generating life, and if we would be regenerated, we need the redeeming life
In the building of the New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of God's building, there will not be the plant life or the animal life
There will only be minerals: the pearl gates, the golden streets, and the wall and foundations of precious stones
Before you came into the recovery, how many chapters, according to your experience, were there in the book of Exodus for you?
We are told that those on the mountain with Moses not only saw the God of Israel, but that they even saw God's feet
He is beyond our imagination and cannot be explained adequately by the traditional teachings concerning the Trinity
Genesis 18 tells us that God came to Abraham in the form of man, and in Luke 2 we see that the Son of God was born in a manger at Bethlehem
We have pointed out that God's people experienced different degrees of fellowship with the Lord at Mount Sinai
We have been redeemed through the Passover, we have made our exodus from Egypt, and we have crossed the Red Sea
Many of us can testify that we have been brought to the mountain of God and have entered into fellowship with the Lord
No longer are we in Exodus 19 or even in Exodus 20 through 23, with the Ten Commandments and the ordinances, which reveal God's economy
Only the high priest was allowed to enter into the Holy of Holies to be in the shekinah glory of God and receive His speaking His revelation
Our understanding of the typology of the tabernacle is dependent upon the writings of those who have preceded us
Because we are on their shoulders, we are able to see more than they did, especially concerning the experiential aspect of the tabernacle
In all these messages on the tabernacle, we shall place particular emphasis on the significance of the tabernacle for Christian experience
We saw that all the materials refer to the virtues of Christ's Person and work and that all were offered to God as a heave offering
The materials were not only created by God and prepared by Him they were also gained possessed enjoyed and experienced by Gods chosen people
Although most versions do not adopt the rendering 'heave offering' in 25:2, the Hebrew word definitely denotes a heave offering
We know from the book of Leviticus that certain parts of an animal, a breast or a thigh, were often waved before the Lord as a wave offering
We need to possess Christ, gain Christ, enjoy Christ, and experience Christ both as the resurrected One and as the ascended One
He becomes our particular treasure, which we then offer to God as material for the building up of His dwelling place
Once they belong to us, they become our possession, and we may keep them, or we may willingly offer them to God
We have seen that the plants refer to the generating life, the animals to the redeeming life, and the minerals to the building life
Concerning minerals, we read of gold, silver, bronze, onyx stones, and 'stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate'
The onyx stones and other precious stones were used for the shoulder-pieces and the breastplate worn by the high priest
When the high priest entered the Holy of Holies to minister before the Lord, he wore the ephod with the shoulder pieces and the breastplate
In 1 Corinthians 3:10 and 11 Paul says that as a wise master builder he laid the foundation, and this foundation is Jesus Christ
In verse 12 Paul goes on to say, 'But if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble'
Although Christ is this building material, God does not use this material directly to build up His dwelling place
If we merely shout praises to the Lord without Christ as our content, we shall not be offering the surplus of Christ to God
In the meetings we should offer this precious Christ to the Father as the material for the building of the church
Those who boast of their degrees and theological knowledge actually have only a superficial knowledge of the Bible
We have pointed out that the high priest wore a breastplate made of precious materials when he came into God's presence
These inferior materials are not only welcomed by many Christians-they are appreciated, praised, exalted, and advertised
In the recovery we would rather have a small amount of gold, silver, and precious stones than a huge pile of wood, grass, and stubble
They will give the impression to others at school or in the neighborhood that they possess something weighty and valuable
Those who are still in high school should not think that they are too young to present such a heave offering to God for His building
Praise the Lord that Christ has redeemed us and terminated us and that He is now in the process of replacing us!
When we experience Christ as silver and possess Him in this way as our treasure, we should bring this treasure to the church meetings
As we function by releasing our spirit, we should offer to God in worship the silver we have gained, enjoyed, and experienced
He does not want us to prostrate ourselves before Him, and He does not want to listen to the performance of a choir
The worship which is acceptable to God is worship in which we offer to Him as a heave offering the Christ we have experienced and possessed
Under God's testing, a young person may be examined by Him when he is about to say or do a certain thing at school
Of saying a negative word to his wife, the brother may say a positive word to the Lord, telling Him, 'Lord, how wise and how good You are!
We should bring it to the meetings and, as we function by exercising our spirit, offer it to the Lord as a heave offering
The other precious stones signify different aspects of the transforming work of the Holy Spirit based on Christ's redemption
As we have pointed out, this means that Christ's redemption is the foundation for the transforming work of the Spirit
We need a love that is transformed by the Spirit with Christ's redemption, termination, and replacement as the basis
We shall love others with a pure love, a love which is the product of the precious transforming work of the Holy Spirit
Our meetings will be filled with the offering of such precious materials and a wonderful work of building will take place among us
According to John 12:24, He was the unique grain of wheat which fell into the ground and died in order to produce us as the many grains
We should always bear the testimony that we realize we are sinful and need the cleansing of the precious blood of Christ
Suppose the attitude of a young person toward his parents is that he is always right and that others are wrong
Verse 4 indicates that the linen used for the tabernacle was not only blue, purple, and scarlet, but was also fine
The acacia wood used in building the tabernacle signifies Christ's human nature, strong in character and high in standard
These spices were used both for making the anointing oil and for making the incense which was burned before God
When we experience the effectiveness of the spices, in our living there will be the fragrance of Christ's death and resurrection
Others will sense that Christ's death and resurrection are effective in us and are also producing a sweet-smelling aroma
The pattern of the tabernacle and of all its furniture signifies the church and all the details of the church life
The tabernacle is called the tabernacle of the testimony , because the testimony is in the ark, and the ark is in the tabernacle
We know from 40:2 and 3 that it was in the tabernacle, and from 40:20 and 21, that it was in the Holy of Holies
In teaching children to read, a teacher often shows a picture of an object with the word identifying it underneath
Concerning Christ as the embodiment of God's testimony, we have the word in Colossians 2:9 and the picture of the ark in the book of Exodus
The ark as a type of Christ indicates that God's redeemed people can contact God and enjoy God in Christ and through Christ
The outward prerequisite is the ground of oneness and the inward prerequisite is Christ as the contents as the embodiment of Gods testimony
If we claim to be the church, we must have Christ not merely in terminology, but in reality as the embodiment of God's living testimony
Certain groups of Christians are actually societies, not churches, because their content is something other than Christ Himself
He was born of a human mother, He partook of human blood and flesh, He had a human name-Jesus-and He lived on earth as a man
No other person in history has had a humanity as strong in character and high in standard as that of the Lord Jesus
Confucius did have a strong character, and his standard was quite high, but there is no comparison between him and the Lord Jesus
These books record the life of a Person who has a strong character and a high standard related to His humanity
The acacia wood used to make the ark also signifies that Christ's humanity is the basic substance for expressing God
In order to be God's testimony, His expression, Christ needed a humanity with a strong character and a high standard
Certain Bible teachers claim that, although Christ was both God and man in His human living, after His resurrection He was no longer a man
They actually believe that Christ is now no longer a man, that as the resurrected One He no longer possesses a human nature
According to Acts 7:55, 'looking intently into heaven, he saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God'
If only the outside of the ark had been overlaid with gold, this would have signified joining instead of mingling
They claim that to teach that the believers are mingled with God is to teach that we actually make ourselves God Himself
There is no doubt that as God's redeemed people, those who have been born of Him, we do possess God's life and nature
In the same principle, how can we be genuine children of God, those born of Him, and not be the same as He in life and in nature?
It is also a serious error to deny the fact that the genuine believers in Christ have the divine life and nature
When the oil is mingled with the fine flour, a third nature, something which is neither altogether oil nor flour, does not come into being
Exodus 2510 tells us the size of the ark two cubits and a half its length and a cubit and a half its width and a cubit and a half its height
Two and a half cubits, the length, is half of five cubits; and one and a half cubits, both the width and the height, is half of three cubits
The fact that two and a half cubits is half of five, and one and a half cubits is half of three indicates that the ark is a testimony
Every detail in the Bible, including the measurements of the ark given in halves of complete units, is meaningful and purposeful
The last sixteen chapters of Exodus are a test of whether or not we truly have a heart seeking after God's economy
In their reading of the Bible many Christians skip over these chapters after they have read the book of Exodus through once or twice
The tabernacle and all its furniture is a type of Christ and the church, including many details of the church life
Deep and profound matters related to Christ and the church are also found in the last sixteen chapters of Exodus
In typology anything that does not have a measurement refers to something eternal, immeasurable, unlimited, and inexhaustible
We have seen that acacia wood signifies Christ's humanity with its character and standard and that gold signifies His divinity
Not even those who opposed Him could deny the fact that there was a wonderful and glorious expression with Him
As you consider the record of the Lord's life in the four Gospels, you will realize that in His living, glory was expressed
If we live Christ at home and at work, the very Christ whom we live will become the glory expressed through us
In Philippians Paul expected that, whether through life or through death, Christ would be magnified in his body
Because Paul lived Christ and magnified Him, no one would presume to suggest that he join them in worldly entertainments
There was a move of Christ from Jerusalem to Judea, to Samaria, and then on to the uttermost part of the earth
In Acts we have a description of the rings and the poles; that is, we have an account of the move on earth of Christ as God's testimony
The casting of the rings signifies that the eternal life-giving Spirit becomes the linking power through the experience of the cross
The more we experience the cross, the more the life-giving eternal Spirit will be cast to become the golden rings
Recently we have pointed out that in the Lords recovery we must preach the gospel teach the Bible and meet together according to the Bible
We may preach the gospel prevailingly, teach the Bible accurately, and meet together properly and still not bear the Lord's testimony
Acts 1:8 says, 'You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth'
In Old Testament times it was possible to have the tabernacle with the laver and the altar, and yet not have the ark
There were occasions in the Old Testament when, due to the degradation of the children of Israel, the ark was separated from the tabernacle
When Solomon came into his reign, according to religious custom, he visited the place where the tabernacle was
When we experience the cross, we have not only gold, but gold which has passed through the process of being cast into a ring
The number two signifies that the move of Christ as God's embodied testimony is through a good coordination, not through individuals
The fact that the poles were made of acacia wood signifies that Christ's human nature is the strength for His move as God's testimony
He and his co-workers spread the kingdom of God and bore the testimony of Jesus by having a humanity with a high character and standing
When the early missionaries went to China, it was not easy for them to reach the ethical and philosophical Chinese with the gospel
These missionaries were genuinely human in a way that could reach the Chinese and open the door for the gospel
It was the practice for anyone who saw a foreigner to sound a gong to warn the villagers to go into their houses and shut the door
Eventually, someone would open the door, and the missionary would thrust a stick into the opening, thus preventing the door from being shut
Gradually, by such a testimony borne by acacia wood, various sections of the conservative country of China were opened for the gospel
The fact that there were two poles signifies that Christ's move is not by an individual, but by a corporate testimony
Neither were cattle used to pull it on a cart, for then there would have been no relation between men and the ark
In 1 Samuel 6:7 and 8 the Philistines, who had captured the ark, returned it by laying it upon a cart pulled by two cows
The anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God'
We have seen that here the testimony, the law, does not refer to regulations which God's people were to observe
Today the law of God, the living law, as God's testimony dwells in Christ bodily , making Him the testimony of God
In the two foregoing messages we considered the materials of the ark the dimensions of the ark and the rim of gold around the top of the ark
Exodus 2517 says And you shall make a propitiatory cover of pure gold two cubits and a half its length and a cubit and a half its width
Hilaskomaimeans to appease, to reconcile two parties by satisfying the demand of one upon the other, that is, to propitiate
According to Hebrews 2:17, the Lord Jesus made propitiation for our sins to reconcile us to God by satisfying God's righteous demands on us
In this way, the first party is reconciled to the second, for the demands of the second party have been satisfied
We have seen that Christ is the One who makes propitiation to God for us as well as the One who is the propitiatory sacrifice
As the hilasterion Christ is also the very place where God is able to meet with us, His redeemed people, and talk to us
No doubt, when Paul was writing Romans 3:25 he had in mind a picture of the propitiatory cover placed on the ark of the testimony
We need to guard against unnecessary questionings and thoughts which interfere with the shining of the light through the Word
Some may try to figure out the thickness of the propitiatory cover, realizing that the length and the width are given, but not the thickness
Other readers may wonder how the cherubim can have their faces toward each other and also toward the lid of the ark
Exodus 2518 says And you shall make two cherubim of gold of beaten work you shall make them from the two ends of the propitiatory cover
Hebrews 9:5 speaks of the cherubim of glory, and Ezekiel 10:18 says that God's glory left the temple and stood above the cherubim
The cherubim on the propitiatory cover indicate that Christ expresses God's glory, that God's glory shines out from Him
The cherubim were made of gold, of Christ's divine nature, and they were made of beaten work, indicating Christ's sufferings
Whenever we meet with God, we sense that we are in the midst of glory, a glory like that signified by the cherubim on the cover of the ark
When you listen to the genuine ministry of the Word, you are attracted, not by eloquence or knowledge but by a sense of God's glory
Exodus 25:17 tells us the length and width of the propitiatory cover, but it does not tell us the thickness of the cover
The fact that the thickness is not given and that the weight is not known indicates that the weight of Christ is immeasurable
We know from the fact that the cherubim had faces and wings that this glory is not lifeless, but is something living
To have a proper understanding of this, we need light from God and also a certain amount of spiritual experience
Apart from being enlightened by the Lord, we may read these verses again and again without seeing anything of their significance
When the light shines upon us, we realize that the propitiatory cover with the cherubim is nothing less than our dear Lord Jesus Himself
In 25:17-22, a record which describes the propitiatory cover of the ark, nothing is said which can answer our question
The blood of the animals shed on the altar for atonement was a promissory note of the true redemption accomplished by Christ
When Christ came to accomplish redemption by shedding His blood on the cross, the promissory note was then set aside
The blood shed on the altar for atonement was brought into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled on the lid of the ark, the propitiatory cover
Because of the blood sprinkled on the propitiatory cover, sinners could have fellowship with the righteous God
Because of the blood of redemption, we today can have fellowship with the righteous God in the glory of Christ
When God comes to us in the glory of Christ, He does not see the requirements of His righteous law, and He does not see our sins
As God, Christ shines in His divinity, but as man, He accomplished redemption in His humanity, signified by the blood
Now, because of Christ's divinity and humanity, we and God can meet together and talk together in the redeeming and shining Christ
Today He is for us the redeeming and shining Christ as the place where the righteous, holy, and glorious God can meet with fallen sinners
Paul is the one who speaks of the propitiatory cover, of the cherubim of glory, and of Christ making propitiation for the sins of the people
Paul presents Christ as the hilasterion, the propitiatory cover, with His shining divinity and redeeming humanity
Upon the propitiatory cover and in the midst of the shining of His glory, God can meet with us and converse with us
If the ark did not have the propitiatory cover as a lid, we could not come to God, and God could not come to us
On the one hand, the light confirms our experience of the Lord; on the other hand, it causes our experience of Christ to increase
We do not have the utterance adequate to describe such a Christ, but we have seen Him, we have experienced Him, and we are enjoying Him
In the foregoing message we emphasized the fact that God meets with His redeemed people and speaks with them in the propitiating Christ
The Holy of Holies is the deepest part of the tabernacle, and in this deepest part the ark occupies the central place
Just as we are tripartite, composed of body, soul, and spirit, so the tabernacle with the outer court is composed of three parts
You may be familiar with Pauls word The Lord be with your spirit and you may have had some experience of the Christ who dwells within you
The acacia wood and the gold typify the two natures of Christ: the gold typifies His divine nature, and the acacia wood, His human nature
They do not pay adequate attention to the fact that the ark is made of wood overlaid with gold, to the fact that Christ is truly the God-man
We realize that just as the ark was made of wood overlaid with gold, so Christ has a human nature within His divine nature
In time to come, more believers will realize that, as the One typified by the ark made of wood overlaid with gold, Christ is the God-man
As the God-man, the One who possesses both the divine nature and the human nature, Christ is both the Creator and a creature
Eventually, either in this age or in the coming age, all those who oppose today will come to believe that Christ is all-inclusive
The cherubim were made of beaten work, signifying that Christ's expression of the divine glory was through sufferings
The picture of the propitiatory cover with the cherubim shows that God's glory, signified by the cherubim, is upon Christ
Do not think that simply because a person has a scholarly knowledge of biblical languages he is qualified to translate the Bible properly
To translate the Bible accurately we must know the truth of the Bible as a whole and we should also have experience in the Lord
The blood of these sacrifices was brought into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled seven times on the propitiatory cover
To attempt to do this is to be like cows listening to beautiful music the sounds can be heard but there is no understanding or appreciation
In particular, we need light regarding the cover, the cherubim, the rim, and the sprinkling of the blood on the lid of the ark
Would you have the boldness to come into the Holy of Holies, stand before the ark, and meet with God face to face?
The Holy of Holies, in which the ark of testimony was situated, was a rather restricted space; it was only ten cubits square
Now we must see that this portrait signifies Christ in His totality Christ not only as the ark itself but also as the top the cap of the ark
Although the sacrifices were slain at the altar in the outer court, the blood was brought into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled on the ark
After redemption or propitiation had been accomplished this blood was brought into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled on the cover of the ark
In eternity God, for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose, created the heavens and the earth with man as the center
According to Zechariah 12:1, the Lord stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
Before God dispensed Himself into man's spirit, Satan intervened to inject himself into the man created by God
The tree of life in the garden indicates that God's intention is to dispense Himself into man to be man's life
If this tree were no longer in existence, if it had been removed from the scene, how would it be possible for the overcomers to eat of it?
Suppose a person who is a typical sinner one day hears the gospel, repents, confesses his sinful deeds, and believes in the Lord Jesus
Today, due to their limited understanding and the inadequacy of much gospel preaching, most Christians only realize that Christ is the Lamb
According to the type of the ark of testimony with the propitiatory cover, God is not under the blood, but is standing on the blood
We may illustrate this by the case of a young man who spends an hour in conversation with a famous university professor
After this hour spent in the presence of such a professor, many things from that person will be infused into the young man
Whenever we come to Christ, to the ark in the Holy of Holies, two things are before our eyes: the redeeming blood and the cherubim of glory
If we do not experience Christ as the indwelling ark and if we are not infused with Him, we shall not be able to live Him
We may also endeavor to live according to Scripture, without living according to the Christ who has been infused into us
The mending ministry was needed because of the damage caused to the church life in the latter decades of the first century
The Gospel of John opens with the words, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
According to Revelation 12:11, by the blood of Christ the Lamb we may overcome the enemy, the accuser of the brothers
When we are in the New Jerusalem, we shall be fully occupied with Christ, not with foot-washing, teachings, or prophecy
How pitiful that so many Christians pay more attention to these things than to Christ as the living ark of God!
In the New Jerusalem the Lamb-God is sitting on the throne, and flowing out from the throne is the river of living water
According to Hebrews 2:17, the Lord Jesus made propitiation for our sins to reconcile us to God by satisfying God's righteous demands on us
Hilasterion denotes the place of propitiation; hilasmos denotes a propitiatory sacrifice; and hilaskomai means to propitiate
Propitiation is needed when one party is indebted to another and unable to meet that party's demands and requirements
With Christ as the propitiatory cover of the ark, God and man can meet and have fellowship under a mutually satisfying situation
By the lid of the ark with the redeeming blood sprinkled on it the whole situation on the sinner's side is fully taken care of
The result of this intimate fellowship with God upon Christ as the ark in the Holy of Holies is that we are infused with God
Eventually, when we enter into the Holy of Holies to be infused time after time, we shall be transformed and become transparent
Speaking of Christ Jesus, Paul says in Romans 3:25, 'Whom God set forth a propitiation-cover through faith in His blood'
In these messages on the ark of the testimony we have seen that the entire ark with its cover is a type of Christ
Certain points in the mending ministry of John are stronger than the points in the completing ministry of Paul
John 19:34 says, 'But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water'
Revelation 5:9 declares, 'You were slain and did purchase to God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation'
In the book of Revelation we can see the very Christ typified by the ark made of acacia wood overlaid with gold
Speaking of Christ, Hebrews 1:3 says, 'Who being the effulgence of His glory and the express image of His substance'
Verse 12 says that Christ 'through His own blood, entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, having found an eternal redemption'
Just as the ark of the testimony was in the Holy of Holies, so now the Christ typified by the ark dwells in our spirit
Certain Christians who emphasize the inner life do stress that man is made of three parts and that the spirit and the soul are not identical
It is the allinclusive Christ typified by the ark in particular typified by the top part of the allinclusive Christ the propitiatory cover
The blood signifies the redemption accomplished by Christ in His humanity, and the cherubim signify the glory of Christ's divinity
Daily we may enter into the Holy of Holies through the new and living way opened by the blood of Jesus shed in His humanity
With the redeeming blood as our standing, we can meet with God and have fellowship with Him in the midst of Christ's shining glory
In order to be such Christians, we need to turn from devotion, piety, religion, morality, and ethics and turn wholly to Christ
Their opposition simply exposes their pitiful situation and shows that they do not see into the depths of God's Word
For this reason, in His recovery today, the Lord is emphasizing not only Christ, but Christ and the church, the great mystery
In this message we come to the second item of the furniture of the tabernacle-the table of the bread of the Presence
The sequence of the furniture in experience-from the brass altar to the ark-is different from the sequence according to revelation
The church as the Body of Christ to be His enlargement is typified by the tabernacle as the enlargement of the ark
According to the sequence of God's revelation, after the ark of the testimony we have the table of the bread of the Presence
Experientially speaking, it is not even necessary to say that a table has been set up, for the ark spontaneously becomes the table
As we consider the picture of the tabernacle and the outer court, we can see the real situation among Christians today
The bread of the Presence was in the Holy Place, whereas the manna was gathered outside the court of the tabernacle
The daily supply of the manna enables us to live; the weekly supply from the table enables us not only to live, but also to serve the Lord
Christ is not only the manna for God's people in a general way; He is also in particular a table for God's priests
If they enjoy Christ as their manna when they are doing something worldly, Christ will supply them to turn away from that activity
We must be those believers who are built up together as God's present dwelling place in an actual and practical way
It is significant that both the ark of the testimony and the table were made of acacia wood, signifying Christ's humanity
Within Him, Christ's humanity is the basic element for our enjoyment, and upon Him is His divinity as the expression of God
As we enjoy the Lord Jesus as the supply with which to serve God, the outcome will be gold, Christ's divinity as the expression of God
From our spiritual experience we know that the more we enjoy Christ as the basic element of our feast, the more we express God
The rim of gold around the table signifies that the expressed glory of Christ's divinity becomes the keeping power and holding strength
If our enjoyment of Christ does not come up to God's testimony as signified by the height of the ark, then our enjoyment is not perfect
On the one hand, these Christians have the Bible; on the other hand, they have things which lower the standard
Exodus 2525 says And you shall make for it a border of a handbreadth round about and you shall make a rim of gold to its border round about
According to verses 26 and 27, four rings of gold were to be put upon the four corners which were on its four feet
As we consider the table and its frame, or its border, we see that the purpose of the frame was to connect the legs and strengthen them
It is not adequate simply to use our mind to try to understand the significance of the frame round about the legs of the table
Verses 26 and 27 say, 'And you shall make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners which are on its four feet
The four rings of gold were put upon the four feet of the table so that there could be a way for the table to be moved
According to 1 Corinthians 10:4, the children of Israel 'drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ'
Just as Christ as a spiritual rock followed the children of Israel, so Christ as the table for our feast follows us
We have seen that the frame was for connecting and strengthening and that the rings were for linking and moving
Verse 28 speaks of the poles And you shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold and the table shall be carried with them
The fact that these poles were overlaid with gold signifies that Christ's divinity is the expression of the move of the table
The poles made of acacia wood overlaid with gold signify that the move of Christ as our life supply is by His two natures mingled as one
Frankincense signifying Christ's resurrection was poured upon the bread of the Presence displayed on the table
If we consider our experience as Christians, we shall know that this interpretation of the details related to the table is accurate
Although a certain mother may be in her seventies and her son in his fifties, she still loves him and enjoys cooking for him
The elderly mother may prepare a meal she enjoyed cooking for her son and that he especially enjoyed eating when he was young
Although words cannot explain this adequately, if we have had the experience, we shall also have the understanding
We know from our experience that when we enjoy Christ as such a portion, this enjoyment brings us into the presence of God
According to Leviticus 24:9, the bread of the Presence was the most holy of the people's offerings to Jehovah made by fire
It signifies the surplus of the believers' experience and enjoyment of Christ offered to God for His satisfaction
God, however, caused certain loaves to be spared, brought into the Holy Place, and arranged and displayed on the table
They should bring the Christ they have experienced and enjoyed, and they should offer Him to God for His satisfaction
As a result, there will not be the bread of the Presence, and the serving ones will not have any weekly supply
They will have a portion of the Christ experienced by them to bring to the meetings and offer to God for His satisfaction
Those who stay away from the meetings do not have this enjoyment, although they may enjoy Christ in other aspects
When we are in the tabernacle, in the midst of the built-up saints, we enjoy Christ on the table in God's dwelling place
The ark with the cherubim signifies God's glory, but the table with the bread of the Presence signifies nourishment
We should have both the ark of God as God's testimony and the table with the bread of the Presence as nourishment for the priests
The more we experience the table, the more we shall have of the ark, for the table will always bring us back to the ark
Throughout the centuries, readers of the Bible have been puzzled by the revelation of the Triune God in the Scriptures
By this we see that a great deal is involved with the lampstand, for the lampstand is related both to the church and to the Spirit of God
Concerning the lampstand, these teachers mainly said that the lampstand is a type of Christ as the light of the world
As we ponder the substance, the stand, and the lamps of the lampstand, we see that the lampstand is indeed the expression of the Triune God
If we consider this substance, this element, of the lampstand, we shall see that it signifies the divine nature
In the proper church life, God the Father is the substance, God the Son is the embodiment, and God the Spirit is the expression
In the church life we have the nature of the Father, the embodiment of the Son, and the expression of the Spirit
We have seen that the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God, signifies the saints who have been built up to be the house of God
After he enjoys Christ as the life supply at the table, his sight becomes clear, and he is enlightened concerning the matter
How much of the divine nature has been imparted into us determines to what extent we are the church in actuality
If we have only a very limited amount of the divine element, of divinity, then the church in our locality is limited, small, and immature
Just as Christ shines because of His divine nature, so we are able to shine with the divine element which has been infused into us
If you are kind, nice, humble, and loving in a natural way, without any portion of divinity, you will not have any light
Children can be compared to little hammers, hammers which beat the gold within their parents and help them to shine
The significance of the lampstand being without measurement is that the divinity of Christ and the light He shines are immeasurable
The expression 'blossoming buds' actually means blossoms, although 'blossoming buds' is the literal translation of the Hebrew
At the bottom of the cup there is a leafy green part called the calyx, which forms a container to hold the blossoming buds
According to Jeremiah 1:12, the Lord's intention was to hasten His word to perform it; that is, He would hasten to fulfill His word
Without the resurrection life, we have nothing to uphold, support, and sustain our shining of the divine light
You may have been shining a few minutes ago, but now, having lost the support of resurrection life, you are no longer shining
Through resurrection, in resurrection, and with resurrection, Christ, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit
On the one hand, in the Bible the number three refers to the Triune God; on the other hand, it refers to resurrection
In the lampstand resurrection is signified not only by the almond blossoms, but also by the three branches on each side of the lampstand
In the same principle, the two groups of branches on the two sides of the lampstand signify the testimony of the light of life
Although we are human and natural, through regeneration we have received the divine life with the divine nature
We shall be in resurrection, and with the divine element in resurrection there will be the blossoming, the shining
Before we consider more detailed points concerning the lampstand, it will be helpful to have a general view of the lampstand
There are three on each branch three holding one pair of branches each and four on the shaft of the lampstand making a total of twentyfive
Since the three knobs which each hold one pair of branches do not have blossoms, the lampstand has a total of twenty-two blossoms
With the lampstand there are five crucial matters: the divine nature, resurrection, life, the Spirit, and light
Praise the Lord that we are parts of this tree in resurrection and with the divine nature, life, the Spirit, and the shining light!
In the Bible the number four is not composed of two plus two; rather, it is composed of three plus one or one plus three
The fact that the wick could become charred indicates that the lampstand not only signifies Christ Himself, but also us
If we consider our situation each day, we shall see that there is always some charred wick that needs to be snuffed
If you are a Christian who is growing and maturing in the Lord, you will unconsciously snuff others as you have fellowship with them
Exodus 25:34 says, 'And on the lampstand four cups shaped like almond blossoms with its knobs and its blossoming buds'
In Galatians 5:22 Paul speaks of the fruit of the Spirit, but in Ephesians 5:9 he speaks of the fruit of the light
How is it possible for our relatives, friends, neighbors, colleagues, and schoolmates to see the light shining from us?
These young ladies would not have the same realization if they were sitting in a place of worldly entertainment
The knobs and the branches were not added to the lampstand; they were part of the lampstand, part of one beaten work of pure gold
The seven lamps signify the seven Spirits of God and the seven eyes of the Lamb as the full expression of the Triune God
A priest lighting the lamps signifies that Christ, or anyone who serves as a priest with Christ, keeps the resurrection life shining
Our charred natural life needs to be snuffed so that the shining of the resurrection life in us may be bright and pure
Many Christians still look at matters according to their natural philosophy, culture, background, education, and perspectives
Only when we have been enlightened by Christ are we able to drop our natural thoughts, concepts, and perspectives
In order to have the shining of the light, we must first have the growing, the branching, the budding, and the blossoming
Only when we reach the last step, the step of blossoming, can there be the shining, for we shine by blossoming
As a type of Christ, the lampstand portrays Christ as the resurrection life growing, branching, budding, and blossoming to shine the light
Although as those created on the sixth day we are the number six, we nonetheless have the Triune God in resurrection
If the lampstand did not have a wick and if it was not supplied with oil, it would be impossible for it to burn and give light
The wick must be of the right length, in proper proportion to the lampstand, and there must be an adequate quantity of oil
The wick and the oil will work together to produce the burning, the burning will cause the shining, and the shining will give forth light
In the foregoing message we pointed out that with the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies there are three kinds of light
The Holy Place is full of light because it is enlightened by the shining of the lampstand with its seven lamps
Whenever a priest left the outer court and came into the Holy Place, he could see the shining of light from the lamps on the lampstand
We can determine this by discerning whether in the meetings there is darkness or the shining of light from the lampstand
Whether or not a particular group of believers is the church depends on whether or not there is the shining of the lampstand among them
With the denomination there was darkness, and with the Brethren assembly there was only a small amount of light
If the lampstand did not have the opportunity to grow in full, the light in the Holy Place would likewise not be full
How much light there can be in the church depends on the extent to which Christ has a way to grow in us and through us
If we all give the Lord a free course to grow within us day by day there will be the adequate shining of the light whenever we come together
The more the lampstand grows in the branches, the more it will blossom and shine, and the more light there will be
When we enjoy Christ as our life supply on the table and are nourished by Him, we also come to the light and trim the old, charred wick
From our experience we know that in the church life the light shines upon us and directs us to the nourishment of Christ
We enjoy Christ at the table as our nourishment, and then we enjoy Him at the incense altar as the fragrant incense of resurrection
After we come into the Holy Place, we are no longer natural, for we are ushered to the threshold of the spirit
In the Holy Place Christ as our life supply deals with our natural life, and the snuffing cuts away the natural life
We enjoy Christ not only at the table, but also at the incense altar with the resurrection life as the fragrance offered to God
When we reach this point, it is difficult to determine whether we are in the Holy Place or in the Holy of Holies
The light from the lampstand also guides us into the Holy of Holies to enjoy Christ as the testimony of God with the throne of grace
When we experience Christ in the Holy of Holies and enjoy Him there to the uttermost, we no longer need the shining of the lampstand
We may sit peacefully under the shining of a lamp powered by electricity, but when lightning appears, we may be terrified
Apart from the sprinkling of the redeeming blood of Christ, no one can withstand the appearing of the shekinah glory
Verse 1 says, 'And you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet'
For a period of forty years, the children of Israel were camping in the wilderness, and God was camping with them
In the first chapters of Numbers we see that the twelve tribes were camped in four directions around the tabernacle
Verse 3 says, 'Five curtains shall be joined one to another, and the other five curtains joined to one another'
You shall make fifty clasps of gold, and join the curtains to one another with the clasps, and the tabernacle shall become one'
When the two sets were coupled together, the result was a large sheet which measured forty cubits by twenty-eight cubits
When we visualize the linen sheet spread over the standing boards, we can see a tent with an overlapping on the sides and at the rear
It is significant that God did not give nine commandments or eleven, but gave ten in order to signify human perfection
We must remember that the ten linen curtains signify Christ's humanity and that the overflow signifies the Triune God in resurrection
The four Gospels record that during the course of His life on earth, the Lord Jesus was a perfect and complete man with a balanced overflow
Some unbelievers have argued that it is not possible for a person such as the One described in the Gospels to have ever lived
For this reason, He could say that He came down from heaven and that He was the heavenly bread, the bread of life
The scarlet in the first layer of the covering of the tabernacle signifies the shedding of the blood of Jesus for redemption
Gods immeasurable glory is also indicated by the fact that the dimensions of the cherubim on the propitiatory cover of the ark are not given
We are not told the size of the cherubim on the ark, and neither are we told the number of the cherubim on the curtains
The silence of the biblical record in both cases indicates that the manifestation of God's glory is beyond measure
Verse 3 says, 'Five curtains shall be joined one to another, and the other five curtains joined one to another'
Two groups of five curtains indicate a testimony of a continuous life, testifying that the Lord Jesus is a complete and perfect man
If there is no connection between a brother's boldness and stability, it will be difficult for him to be joined to others
The joining of the curtains to each other makes the tabernacle one, signifying that it makes the testimony one
In the church life today we have the joining power only in the divine nature; we do not possess it according to our human life
Because we are familiar with the stories in the Bible about Christ, we should not think that we have a proper and adequate knowledge of Him
If you consider all the matters signified in 26:1-6, you will realize that you actually have very little knowledge of the Lord Jesus
The more we consider the significance of the details here, the more we shall realize what a wonderful Person the Lord is in His humanity
We see Him in the fine twined linen, in the colors of blue, purple, and scarlet, in the cherubim, and in all the loops and clasps
We do not gain an adequate understanding of Christ by reading only the Gospels and the Epistles in the New Testament
The linen, the blue, the purple, and scarlet, the cherubim, the loops, and the clasps are all parts of this expression
When we see Christ from within, we know that He is heavenly, He is kingly, He is the redeeming One, and He is glorious
Verses 7 and 8 say, 'And you shall make curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle: you shall make eleven curtains
The length of each curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits-one measure for the eleven curtains'
In the Bible ten is the number of human completion and perfection, and twelve is the number of perfection in the divine administration
As we have seen, the number five is composed of four, signifying the creature, plus one, signifying God the Creator
The ten curtains which make up the first layer of the tabernacle indicate that the Lord Jesus as a human being was complete and perfect
He also has the colors of blue, purple, and scarlet which, respectively, signify heavenliness, royalty, and redemption
The golden cherubim embroidered on the linen curtains signify that in Christ as a creature God's glory is expressed
The ten linen curtains of the first layer reveal that Christ is a perfect, complete, and altogether beautiful human being
The number of the curtains is eleven instead of ten, something more than human completion, but below the perfection of God's government
In these hours He was forsaken by God because God regarded Him as a sinner, as the One who was made sin for us
When the ten curtains of the first layer are joined, they form a rectangle measuring forty cubits by twenty-eight cubits
As we pointed out in the foregoing message, there was an overhang on two sides of the tabernacle of nine cubits
In brief, these two layers signify that the perfect man, the Lord Jesus, was made sin in the eyes of God for our redemption
As we shall see in the next message, under these two layers of covering were the standing boards, which typify us as believers
We are the boards standing under the covering and protection of Jesus Christ, the perfect man, who was made sin for us
The many details of these two layers of covering-the fine linen, the goats' hair, and all the numbers-are related to Christ
According to this view, we should only accept as types those things which the New Testament clearly says are types
Many persons and things in the Old Testament may also be genuine types, even though they are not denoted as such in the New Testament
If we infer from these implications that the tabernacle typifies the church, how shall we understand the first two layers of the tabernacle?
To be sure, it is necessary to make proper inferences concerning these two layers and interpret them as types of Christ
It is not always necessary for the New Testament to say definitely that a certain thing in the Old Testament is a type
It is adequate and proper to find in the New Testament the meaning of all the aspects of the Old Testament types
We understand the Old Testament in a New Testament way and thereby see a detailed picture of both Christ and the church
It is impossible for anyone other than God to design such a structure as the tabernacle and to give us such a record concerning it
We have seen that the second layer of the covering, a tent of goats' hair, typifies Christ being made sin for us
We have seen that eleven is composed of five plus six, with five being the number of responsibility and six indicating an excess
On the other hand, it is composed of three times ten, indicating the Triune God as resurrection life in human completion
The first set of five curtains signifies responsibility, whereas the second set of six curtains signifies sinners
These fifty loops were the same as the loops of the first layer of the covering except for the fact that they were not blue
As a sign of judgment, the clasps in the second layer are bronze, whereas the clasps in the first layer are gold
Verse 14 says, 'And you shall make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of porpoise skins over that'
Although there was scarlet on the first layer of covering, neither the first layer nor the second layer was dyed red
The first layer signifies the perfect man, Jesus; the second layer, Christ as our substitute; and the third layer, redemption
As the rams skins Christ enables us to stand before God but as the porpoise skins He enables us to stand against Satan and all his attacks
We thank the Lord for the details concerning Christ revealed in the four layers of the covering of the tabernacle
According to the sequence of the divine revelation, the covering of the tabernacle is mentioned before the boards
The first layer was fine linen, the second of goats' hair, the third of rams' skins dyed red, and the fourth of porpoise skins
Under the covering of the tabernacle there were the walls composed of standing boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold
We have the assurance to say that the tabernacle typifies not only the individual Christ, but also the corporate Christ
Just as the ark was made of two elements, acacia wood and gold, so are the boards constructed of the same two elements
As we compare the tabernacle and the ark, we see that the tabernacle is truly the enlargement and extension of the ark
We can say that we have a part, a share, in Christ's testimony, for we are joined to the witnessing Christ and have become His enlargement
When we believed in the Lord and received Him, we immediately found ourselves under the roof, under the covering
Within us we have the uplifted human nature signified by acacia wood and the overlaying divine nature signified by the gold
When you hear about acacia wood overlaid with gold, you may find it difficult to believe that, as a Christian, you are such a board
If you declare that you are strong and have the best way to handle a difficult situation, you will be strong and you will also have the way
Acacia wood signifies the regenerated and uplifted humanity of the new creation in Christ as the basic material, strong for standing
We have seen that five is the number of responsibility and that three is the number of the Triune God in resurrection
To serve the church privately and individualistically is to serve as a single board which is not joined to another
We need to realize that we are just one of many boards, that we are only half a unit, and that we need another board to complete us
We thank the Lord that during the last ten years the situation and condition among us regarding the standing boards has improved
According to verse 20, there were to be twenty boards also on the north side, the second side of the tabernacle
There was a need for Christ to be the cornerstone to embrace the two sections of the church wall, the Jewish wall and the Gentile wall
If we read Acts 13 carefully, we shall see that there definitely was a strengthening when the Lord made a turn at Antioch
In order for the boards to stand upright, there is the need for the tenons, the sockets, the rings, and the bars
The tenons and the sockets are for us individually, but the rings and the bars are for us to be joined together corporately
Verse 17 says, 'Two tenons shall be in each board, connected one with the other; thus you shall make for all the boards of the tabernacle'
They were made of silver, signifying the redemption of Christ as the base for the believers' standing for God's dwelling place
Just as we are not told the size and shape of the tenons, neither are we told the size and shape of the sockets
These tenons were not merely connected to the sockets, but they fit into the sockets and actually became one with them
Just as it takes two half-steps, one with each foot, to make a complete step, so we need two tenons in order to have a complete faith
Friends and observers who have attended our funerals have sometimes been surprised that there is not much weeping
The standing of the boards depends on the tenons and the sockets, whereas the linking, or the uniting, depends on the rings and the bars
Exodus 26:29 speaks of the rings: 'And you shall overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold, as receptacles for the bars'
We received the Spirit as a seal, pledge, down payment, guarantee, and foretaste of God as our eternal portion
The lines of bars above and below the middle bar each were made of two bars, with each bar going only half the way from end to end
Since these bars went from end to end in three lines, there must have been three rings on each board to serve as receptacles for the bars
As boards we do not have two rings or four rings; we have three rings indicating the Spirit of the Triune God in resurrection
In Ephesians 4 the oneness of the Spirit is mentioned in the context of human virtues such as humility and love
On the one hand, those in these groups are very easily shaken; on the other hand, they may fail to express the gold
In the proper church life in the Lord's recovery, we have a firm standing, and we also have the expression of Christ
Whenever a priest came into the tabernacle, he would immediately notice that the ceiling and the veil were the same
After being nourished at the table, he would go to the lampstand to trim it and add oil to it so that it would shine brightly
As we shall see in a later message, both the incense altar and the incense offered at this altar are types of Christ
What is difficult to understand is the significance of the veil within the tabernacle being placed on four pillars
We have seen that on the north, west, and south sides of the tabernacle there was a total of forty-eight boards
We cannot say that the boards typify Christ directly, for these boards are types of the believers who are the enlargement of Christ
Although the pillars differed from the boards in shape, they were made of the same materials-acacia wood overlaid with gold
The fact that the pillars rest in sockets of silver is a further proof that the pillars typify the believers and not Christ Himself
The believers must have a firm standing, and this standing, as signified by the silver sockets, is the redemption of Christ
Since both the boards and the pillars typify the believers, we may ask what is the difference between the pillars and the boards
Now we come to another difficult question: Why was the veil, a type of Christ, placed on pillars, which typify extraordinary believers?
Only through the holding strength of the divine nature can we bear the testimony of Christ's incarnation and crucifixion
With the tabernacle there was a total of one hundred silver sockets, ninety-six for the boards and four for the pillars
Ten times ten signifies the full and complete fulfillment of the requirements of the Ten Commandments according to what God is
According to 38:27, the silver for the redemption of the lives of the children of Israel was a little more than a hundred talents
From the silver collected from the people, one hundred talents were used to make the one hundred silver sockets for the tabernacle
Because God's people must bear the complete responsibility and have a complete fulfillment of God's requirements, each must pay ten gerahs
Ten is composed of two times five, with five being the number of responsibility and two the number of testimony
Now we can answer the question we raised at the beginning of this message Why was there the need of a separating veil within the tabernacle
Fallen human beings cannot come to the ark in the Holy of Holies to contact God, converse with God, or have fellowship with God
For this reason, there had to be a separation of the ark in the inner chamber of the tabernacle from the outer chamber
Fifty clasps of gold connected the two main sections of the covering, each of which measured twenty cubits in length
Twenty cubits of this layer covered the Holy Place, ten cubits covered the Holy of Holies, and ten cubits hung down over the back side
There were ten cubits of the first layer to cover the area from the veil to the standing boards at the rear of the tabernacle
The fact that the Holy of Holies was a cube measuring ten cubits in three directions signifies completion in completion
We have pointed out that these pillars signify extraordinary believers, those who have been not only redeemed, but also dealt with
The lamb is the redeeming Christ, the manna is the nourishing Christ, and the veil is Christ in the flesh crucified for us
Peter, John, Paul, and the overcoming believers throughout the generations and centuries have borne such a testimony
They have been pillars testifying that their fallen being with its fallen nature, that is, their person and their flesh, has been rent
In a human dwelling place a separation may be a positive thing, but in God's dwelling place the separation is a negative matter
When He was crucified on the cross, our fallen nature, that is, our natural being, the flesh, was crucified with Him
The pillars within God's dwelling place must now bear the testimony that the veil of their flesh has been cleft with Christ
The priests could come into the Holy Place and approach the table, the lampstand, and the incense altar, but they could go no further
Even though we may not be able to utter what we see in these figures, deep within we can have a proper realization
It is not our purpose simply to know the pattern, materials, and measurements of the tabernacle in a doctrinal way
Of applying these types in a doctrinal way, Paul applied them in an experiential way, either to Christ Himself or to the believers
In this message we shall consider the spiritual significance of the veil hanging on the pillars within the tabernacle
Paul's reference to 'the second veil' indicates that he must have regarded the curtain at the entrance to the Holy Place as the first veil
Paul does not say 'the first section of the tabernacle'; he speaks of 'the first tabernacle' having its standing
Although the first tabernacle the Holy Place was a type Paul does not say that the second tabernacle the Holy of Holies was a type or figure
When the high priest entered the Holy of Holies, he could actually see the glory of God and receive a word from God
To come forward to the throne of grace is to come forward to the propitiatory cover on the ark in the Holy of Holies
To love the Lord and to be burning is one thing, and to be in the Holy of Holies may be an absolutely different thing
There must be a clear distinction between the old covenant and the new covenant and between the soul and the spirit
The Hebrew Christians were not clear regarding this distinction, and for the most part were living in the soul, in the first tabernacle
Even many of us in the Lord's recovery are still living in the first tabernacle and thus are living in the Old Testament age
Most of the saints in the Lord's recovery have come into the Holy Place and enjoy the Lord's nourishment and enlightenment
Now we all must realize that next door to the Holy Place there is a place which has something richer and higher
Experientially we know that it is possible to be close to God and experience things of God without experiencing God Himself directly
We need to recognize, admit, and confess that even we are not absolutely in the spirit, not absolutely in the Holy of Holies
We must answer that in a sense it was positive, for it was exactly the same as the first layer of the covering
We may be in the flesh not only when we are gossiping and criticizing, but even when we are calling on the Lord and praising Him
The reason that as New Testament believers we remain in the soul, in the Old Testament age, is that our flesh has not been broken
We have pointed out that the pillars represent the extraordinary believers, who are the stronger members of the church
Among all the saints in the church, the pillars, the stronger ones, bear the testimony of God manifested in the flesh
Whether or not an assembly can enter into the Holy of Holies depends on whether or not the flesh of the leading ones has been cleft
The ceiling, the inner veil, and the curtain for the door were made of the same material and of the same colors, design, and workmanship
Although these words are similar in meaning, nevertheless an entrance denotes something more specific than a door
Although they were the same in design and appearance, the one is called the veil and the other is called the screen
It is significant that the matters related to the tabernacle are described not from the outside in, but from the inside out
Upon Christ as the ark there is a place called the propitiatory cover, where God can meet with us and speak to us
Also, in the Holy Place we have the lampstand with its light, and in the Holy of Holies we have the law as God's testimony
The bread corresponds to the manna; the lampstand, to the tablets of the law; and the incense, to the budding rod
In the Holy Place we have the life supply of Christ, the light of Christ, and the incense, the acceptance, of Christ
As long as we remain in our fallen nature, the ark with its precious contents is veiled from our sight and kept away from our presence
It is significant that the outer veil, the curtain at the door of the tabernacle, is called in verse 37 a screen
The function of a screen is, on the one hand, to allow air to come in, but, on the other hand, to keep out insects and other pests
As we shall see, the screen at the entrance to the tabernacle serves to keep all negative things out of God's dwelling place
With this understanding of the covering and the veil as a basis, we may rightly conclude that the screen also refers to Christ
The first layer of the covering of the tabernacle has nothing to do with our entering into God's dwelling place
If there were no way for us to come into God's dwelling place, we could not have any experience of God's dwelling place
The tabernacle would have nothing to do with us in our experience; it would simply exist objectively apart from us
Because we are sinful, this screen, this description, is a barrier between us and God, a separation between us and Him
That Christ was judged for us is indicated by the five sockets of bronze under the five pillars which support the curtain
God told Moses to make a serpent of brass and put it on a pole to indicate that it would be judged by God for them
Because Christ has died for our sins and has been judged by God for us, we can now enter into God's dwelling place
When we come into the tabernacle, we find ourselves in the Holy Place, which is far better than the outer court
The reason you have not yet entered the Holy of Holies is that although your sins have been forgiven, your flesh remains untouched
On the one hand, He died for our sins so that we may be forgiven; on the other hand, He died for us so that we may be terminated
We have pointed out that the revelation of the tabernacle is not merely according to doctrine, but also according to spiritual experience
When we realize that we are still in the flesh, we need to see that Christ died not only for our sins, but also for us
Eventually, after a certain time, he comes to realize that Christ died not only for his sins, but died also for him
Now he understands that on the cross Christ not only was judged by God for him, but also was killed and terminated with him
In the Holy of Holies we not only enjoy certain things that are of Christ; we enjoy Christ Himself as everything
There must have been one pillar next to a board on the north side and another pillar next to a board on the south side
According to these parables, the Son seeks the lost sheep, the Spirit enlightens, and the Father receives the returned prodigal
The fact that the screen has four entrances indicates that God's dwelling place is open to all people from the four corners of the earth
We have come from the four corners of the earth as redeemed creatures to enter into God's dwelling place for the enjoyment of Himself
The pillars supporting the veil cannot be Christ Himself, for they are plural in number, whereas Christ is singular
Those who are so zealous to preach the gospel that they even seem to be crazy are the pillars attached to the curtain
The pillars attached to the curtain are evangelists, bold preachers of Christ standing at the front of the church
They daily attach themselves to the rent veil, the broken veil, to the very Christ who was terminated in His flesh
We need the evangelists standing at the front of the church life zealously preaching Christ declaring to all that Christ died for their sins
We need those who are identified with the judged Christ and also those who are identified with the terminated Christ
If we have both the pillars at the front and the pillars in the inner chamber, God's dwelling place will have entrances
We need pillars bearing the testimony that Christ died for our sins and also pillars bearing the testimony that Christ died for us
If we are boards, it is not necessary for us to be quite so closely attached to the judged and crucified Christ
If we would be the pillars, we must be specifically attached either to the judged Christ or the crucified Christ
It is the pillars who open the way and form the entrances for others to come into the church life, God's tabernacle, His dwelling place
We have seen that in the tabernacle there were two curtains, one called the veil and the other called the screen
We need to pray for spiritual understanding concerning the veil and the screen, for they imply some very important things
They indicate that through His all-inclusive death Christ has become the entrance for God's chosen people to come into the enjoyment of God
We may also say that it is the place where God's chosen people participate in the full enjoyment of God Himself
Through His all-inclusive death, this Christ has become the entrance for God's people to come into the enjoyment of God
As ministers of the New Testament, the apostles lived a crucified life for the manifestation of the resurrection life
They could enter the Holy of Holies, for they had passed through the two curtains; they had passed through the screen and the veil
They had passed through the judgment of God upon Christ for their sins and also through the crucifixion of the flesh by the death of Christ
If we read the Gospels from this angle, we shall see that Christ is a screen keeping all the negative things away from God's dwelling place
Whenever a sinner meets the perfect humanity of the Lord Jesus he is either screened out or he is subdued and convinced to believe in Christ
In the Holy Place such a redeemed sinner can enjoy Christ as the life supply, as enlightenment, and as his acceptance by God
From experience we know that redeemed sinners can pass through the screen, enter the Holy Place, and enjoy all the riches of God in Christ
Eventually, he sees in the Bible that Christ's death not only deals with his sins, but also deals with the flesh
Spontaneously, by the indwelling Spirit, such a believer crucifies his flesh; that is, he puts his fallen nature to death
If we would pass through the riven veil, we need both the Spirit working within and the coordination of the circumstances outwardly
Without these pillars there is no way for the Christ who is the entrance into the enjoyment of God to be revealed to man
On the day of Pentecost Christ was attached to the one hundred twenty, and they became pillars bearing the testimony of Christ
We know this by the fact that the flesh, the fallen nature, of certain believers still had not been dealt with
On the one hand, they bore Christ as the first curtain, the screen; on the other hand, they bore Christ as the second veil, the riven veil
The record of the tabernacle is presented not only according to doctrine, but also according to spiritual experience
Generally, today's Christians know only the first aspect of Christ's death, that He died for our sins that we may be forgiven by God
They are not as familiar with the second aspect of His death, that He died for us that we may live to Him in the resurrection life
In His recovery the Lord is leading us into a deeper experiential understanding of the all-inclusive death of Christ
As we have pointed out in the foregoing messages, these two veils signify two aspects of the all-inclusive death of Christ
The screen indicates that Christ died for our sins so that our sins may be forgiven and that we may be justified by God
They had not yet passed through the second veil, the inner veil, the veil separating the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies
They were forgiven, they were justified, and they could enter into the Holy Place to have a certain enjoyment of the Lord
Although the Corinthians had experienced this aspect of reconciliation, they had not entered into the Holy of Holies
They had been reconciled to God to some extent, but not to the extent of being able to come into the Holy of Holies to enjoy God in full
For this reason, they needed a further reconciliation, the reconciliation Paul speaks of in 2 Corinthians 5:20
When we experience forgiveness and justification and enter the Holy Place, the barrier is taken away to a certain extent
In verse 21 he goes on to say, 'Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God's righteousness in Him'
In these verses we see three classes of people: the apostles, sinners, and believers who have not been fully reconciled to God
If we did not have the veil in the tabernacle as a type, we could not have a full understanding that the flesh must be dealt with
On the one hand, the apostles were captives; on the other hand, they were those bearing incense, the fragrance of Christ
The divine light shines through the lens and causes an image, a figure, to be imprinted on the film of our spirit
We praise the Lord for showing us the two veils, the inner veil and the screen, and for revealing the two aspects of reconciliation
Literally, according to the record in black and white, certain points are extremely difficult for anyone to understand
At this altar those who came into Gods dwelling place could have a very close relationship with God for there the incense was burned to Him
The fire on the altar of the burnt offering burns the sacrifices; the fire at the incense altar burns the incense
If we consider a diagram of the tabernacle and the outer court, we see that the ark and the altar of the burnt offering are at two ends
Anyone who wanted to meet God would have to travel through all the items of the tabernacle until he comes to the ark
When God came from His dwelling place to the earth and went to the cross, what was His main intention, His main goal?
Every week a great many sermons are given to Christians, yet few of these sermons are a means to bring saved sinners into the tabernacle
Some may argue that God is omnipresent and that as long as a person repents and believes in the Lord Jesus, he turns to God
God has come out of the tabernacle in order to bring us into the tabernacle, to bring us to the very place where He dwells
He went to the altar to the cross with the intention that we fallen sinners might be brought back to Himself in the place where He dwells
The reason for this is that only after we have experienced all the other items can we have a full acceptance from God
When you come to the meeting and exercise your spirit, spontaneously the incense altar in your experience comes close to God
If we have such a view of the tabernacle and the outer court, we are qualified to understand the altar of the burnt offering
The reason for this is that all spiritual experiences are initiated by the experience of the cross and implied in that experience
Referring to this, Hebrews 13:10 says, 'We have an altar, from which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle'
In the Old Testament certain offerings, after being presented on the altar to God, became the food for God's people
We need to realize whenever we come to the Lord's table that the table is an altar where Christ presents Himself to God
The reason we must raise this question is that the substance of the altar is acacia wood, and acacia wood signifies the Lord's humanity
In the same principle, when we come to the Lord's table, we do not partake of the table itself, but we eat the food on the table
When we speak of the altar, we do not mainly refer to the altar itself; we mainly are speaking of what is offered on the altar
When we say that the cross saves us, we do not mean the cross as an instrument of execution used by the Roman Empire
Only by fulfilling all these requirements of God could the Lord Jesus be qualified to be recognized by God as the Substitute for us sinners
Five is the number of responsibility, and five times five indicates full responsibility, responsibility upon responsibility
The fact that the height is less than the length and width indicates that the Lord's redemption is spreading in a wide way
The redemption accomplished on the cross was not only by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself; it was accomplished by the Triune God
The three cubits as the height of the altar signifies that it is built by the Triune God and according to the Triune God
The horns upon the four corners of the altar signify the power of the cross of Christ to reach the four corners of the earth
In history, especially today, it has been seen that the efficacy of Christ's redemption has reached the uttermost part of the world
Unlike the ark which was overlaid with gold signifying Gods nature the altar was overlaid with bronze signifying Gods righteous judgment
The fact that all the utensils were made of bronze signifies that all things related to the cross are for God's judgment
The King James Version says compass, another version says border, and still other versions speak of a margin or rim
Those who hold to this view appeal to Leviticus 9:22, a verse which says that Aaron 'came down from offering of the sin offering'
Verse 4 says And you shall make for it a grating a network of bronze and you shall make upon the net four rings of bronze upon its four ends
The grating, the network of bronze, inside the altar stretched horizontally from side to side at the middle of the height of the altar
Does it not seem that the heat of the fire would pass through the bronze covering and cause the acacia wood inside to become charred?
One writer has suggested that the network was actually at the bottom of the altar and reached halfway up the sides of the walls
The significance of this is that it is not possible for us to understand thoroughly the mystery of the cross of Christ
You can also say that on the cross Christ bore our sins, that we were crucified with Him, and that even the Devil was destroyed on the cross
We are told clearly that the rings are upon the four ends of the network, and the rings must be outside the altar
Both for the burning of the sacrifices and for the move of the altar, the grating with the four rings is necessary
In the foregoing message we pointed out that the altar should be related to a person, for it was made of acacia wood overlaid with bronze
Verse 14 says, 'I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels'
Not many Christian preachers have given messages concerning the inward aspect of Christ's sufferings on the cross
Apart from the eternal Spirit, the redemption of Christ could not be effective; it could not be powerful and full of strength
We may talk about the cross, about the death of Christ on the cross, and about the fact that we have been crucified with Christ
It is very crucial that we realize that the efficacy and power of Christ's redemption depend upon the eternal Spirit
If we preach the cross of Christ without the Spirit, we shall not have the power to move others, to touch their heart and their spirit
It is somewhat mysterious how these rings could be connected to the grating inside the altar and yet themselves be outside the altar
On the one hand, the Spirit is manifest; on the other hand, it is mysterious, for the Spirit is connected to Christ's redemption
The four rings signifying the eternal Spirit are connected to the grating, which signifies the inner content of Christ's redemption
When we preach the cross with the redemption of Christ, this preaching must be connected to the eternal Spirit
In our experience we shall have a grating with four rings, the redemption of Christ connected to the eternal Spirit
We need to see that two things take place simultaneously: the burning of the fire and the moving of the Spirit
We have seen that if it were not for the rings, the grating could not be held in place at half the height of the altar
Concerning the ledge, we may also say that the ledge signifies the strengthening power upholding Christ under God's judgment
No doubt, at the time of the crucifixion, the Lord Jesus needed strengthening, upholding, covering, and protection
We have seen that the ledge probably protected the acacia wood inside the bronze covering from the heat of the fire
Without some kind of protection, the acacia wood certainly would have been charred by the heat transmitted through the bronze
Exodus 27:6 and 7 say, 'And you shall make poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood; and you shall overlay them with bronze
Its poles shall be put into the rings, and the poles shall be upon the two sides of the altar when it is carried'
Verse 8 says, 'You shall make it hollow with planks; as it was shown to you in the mountain, so they shall make it'
The altar was made with planks to be hollow and of a size sufficient to contain all the utensils of the tabernacle
The initial experience of the cross of Christ at the time we were regenerated is the base of all our subsequent experiences of Christ
When we read the record concerning the altar of the burnt offering in 2718 it seems that there is not much for us to say regarding the altar
Neither in the Old Testament typology nor in the New Testament revelation is the cross described in a detailed way
38:5 and 7 clearly say, 'And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staves
In light of these verses, we cannot hold the concept that there were two sets of rings, one inside the altar and the other outside
The Scripture does not tell us how the rings could be attached to the grating and yet still be on the outside of the altar
According to Hebrews 9:14, Christ offered Himself to God and accomplished redemption through the eternal Spirit
By means of this eternal Spirit the redemption accomplished by Christ will be brought to the ends of the earth
The fundamentalists have the grating without the rings; the Pentecostals have some kind of rings separate from the grating
For the most part, we are opposed not because of the grating, but mainly because of our testimony concerning the rings
They have not been enlightened from the Word to see that Christ was in the likeness of the flesh of sin and even became sin
As we have pointed out, most of the opposition is related to our testimony that Christ today is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
The accusations concerning Christ being the Spirit involve the Trinity, the Person of Christ, and the mingling
We have pointed out that the grating is at half the height of the altar, halfway between the top and the bottom
The dimensions of the ark were two and one-half cubits in length and width and one and one-half cubits in height
The grating signifying Christ's all-inclusive and completed redemption was placed on a level with the height of the ark
With the altar of the burnt offering we have a height of three cubits in two sections, with each section measuring one and one-half cubits
Since the altar was five cubits wide and five cubits long, the ledge on each side could have been a half cubit in width
If the ledge did not serve as a protection, how would the walls have been protected from the heat of the fire?
We need to have more understanding, more apprehension, of the cross and of Christ's redemption according to the New Testament
Because the revelation concerning the cross is presented piece by piece, it is not easy to see a complete picture
In 27:1-8, verses 1 through 3 are on the outward appearance of the altar, but verses 4 through 8 are on the inward contents of the altar
The contents of the altar are the grating and the four rings, through which were placed the poles used in carrying the altar
Since such matters are not so deep or mysterious, it is somewhat easy for expositors to understand their significance
In the human body, the skin, the flesh, and the bones are not as mysterious as the inward parts, especially the soul and the spirit
We have seen that the grating was at half the height of the altar, reaching from side to side halfway between the top and the bottom
When Paul speaks of the redemption of Christ in Romans 3:24-25, he definitely says that God made the redeeming Christ our propitiation-cover
Because of shallow inadequate teaching not many Christians realize that the redemption of Christ rests upon the power of the eternal Spirit
When the time came for the Lord Jesus to die on the cross, He did not go to the cross according to His own wishes or desire
Certainly when He died an all-inclusive death on Calvary, He would not do this apart from the leading of the Holy Spirit
The power, the strength, and the efficacy of the redemption accomplished by the grating depends on the four rings
In the New Testament whenever the redemption of Christ is preached, it is preached with the power of the Holy Spirit
When Peter preached the gospel on the day of Pentecost, he did not say that those who were baptized would receive redemption
In Galatians 3 he says that Christ bore our curse on the cross so that through Him we may receive the promise of the Spirit
Those who preached this gospel knew about Christ dying for our sins and they knew about heaven, but they did not know the Spirit
It is crucial for us to realize that apart from the Spirit the redemption of Christ is a lifeless redemption, a dead redemption
Just as a person is dead apart from the spirit, so the redemption of Christ is dead apart from the Holy Spirit
Now this One has come into all the redeemed ones and is present with them, as revealed in Acts and the Epistles
If we preach the redemption of Christ without the Spirit, we are pitiful preachers, and we are preaching a dead redemption
For this reason, the Lord Jesus told the disciples to wait at Jerusalem until they received power by the coming of the Holy Spirit upon them
If we analyze the situation among Christians today, we shall see that there are the fundamentalists and the Pentecostalists
On the one side we have fundamentalists with the grating and no rings; on the other side, we have Pentecostalists with rings but no grating
All the Epistles from Romans through Revelation reveal more concerning the rings, concluding with the sevenfold Spirit
The four Gospels portray the grating, and all the Epistles present a full picture of the four rings with the two poles
We have pointed out that the grating is located at half the height of the altar and reaches from one side to the other
Within the shell of the altar there was a grating, a network, and upon this grating were the wood and the sacrifices which were burned
As the offerings and the wood burned, the ashes fell down to the ground, but the smoke ascended as a sweet savor to God for His satisfaction
The sweet savor was for God's satisfaction, and the ashes were a proof that the offering had been accepted by God
To understand how the grating typifies the redeeming Christ, it would be helpful to compare the grating to the propitiation-cover on the ark
In the same principle the grating signifies Christ the Redeemer in His redemption that is it signifies Christ Himself in His redemptive work
Psalm 22:14, which speaks of the sufferings of Christ on the cross, says, 'My heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels'
Although the picture of the altar portrays this, we still cannot understand in full all the details related to Christ's death
As He was bearing the burning of God's righteous judgment, He, as a human being, certainly needed something to sustain Him
May we all be impressed with the redeeming Christ as signified by the grating and the altar of the burnt offering
In other words, the all-inclusive Spirit is identical to Christ, and Christ is identified with the all-inclusive Spirit
According to this concept, Christ has ascended to heaven and remains there, and the Spirit has come to earth in His place
We have seen that the entire grating with the weight of the wood and the sacrifices was upheld by the four rings
The grating could stand in place and bear a heavy load for the burning judgment of God because the grating was upheld by the four rings
Today there are millions of so-called Christians who have Christ only as a historical Redeemer and redemption only as a doctrine
Remember, the altar was about seven and a half feet square, and it was made of acacia wood overlaid with bronze
It must be a church with the four rings, not a church which has been deprived of the Spirit, but a church that remains in the Spirit
In other words, it is the Body which carries the cross of Christ, which carries the redeeming Christ in the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
As we consider the type of the altar, we see that the altar with the grating, the rings, and the poles signifies the entire New Testament
We have put our shoulders under the poles, and we are carrying the redeeming Christ in the all-inclusive Spirit
We need to realize Christ and His redemption, and we need to experience the Spirit who is the issue of the redeeming Christ
When they bore the poles, they also bore the rings, and when they bore the rings, they bore the grating with the entire altar
Since the altar was three cubits high, the grating was positioned one and a half cubits above the bottom of the altar
The ark was two and a half cubits in length, one and a half cubits in width, and one and a half cubits in height
We have seen that there were one and a half cubits below the grating and another one and a half cubits above the grating
The standard of the redemption of Christ was up to the requirement of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory
Christ died on the cross to accomplish the all-inclusive redemption for us according to the standard of the ark
If you closely examine the record of the ark in Exodus, you will see that the ark is related to God's righteousness, holiness, and glory
The one who presented the sacrifice could see the ashes and thereby have evidence confirmation proof that he had been forgiven and accepted
As a result, this redemption has an efficacy, and this efficacy is according to the same standard for God's satisfaction
We realize that the efficacy of Christ's redemption is such that it satisfies God according to His requirements
You may have had this kind of experience when you were saved, although you may not have had the words to describe it
The requirements of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory had been fulfilled by the redeeming death of Christ
If you challenge God in this way, asking what else He can demand of you, He may reply, 'I have no further demands
In the same principle, without the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, Christ and His redemption would become empty and powerless
In Catholicism there are stories and also certain superstitions, but all this is without the life-giving Spirit
The goal of the Lords recovery is to recover the reality life livingness strength power and impact of the matters revealed in the Scriptures
If you gather together the various matters revealed in the Scriptures without the Spirit, you will have a religion
The life-giving Spirit is the life pulse, the reality, the power, and the impact of all the doctrines and stories in the Bible
God's salvation is Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God
On the one hand, we may say that the life-giving Spirit issues from Christ; on the other hand, we may say that Christ issues in the Spirit
If the grating, the rings, and the poles were taken away from the altar, the altar would become a useless, empty shell
We all need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the grating was on the same level as the propitiation-cover of the ark
Related to the propitiation-cover of the ark there was the threefold demand of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness
The effectiveness, the efficacy, of Christ's redemption is also according to the standard of God's requirements
The problems have been solved, and the ashes remain as a confirmation that it is now possible for us to be with God
If we seek to know the spiritual significance of the court of the tabernacle, we shall find that this is not easy to understand
We need to realize that in the building of the tabernacle, the furniture, and the outer court, there are three main categories of materials
Some of the materials, such as the rams' skin and the goats' hair, come from land animals, but the porpoise skins come from sea animals
As we have pointed out elsewhere, the plant life is for generation, for production and propagation, and the animal life is for redemption
At this point, we need to ask a crucial question: How can righteousness and holiness be related to the image of God?
In 2 Corinthians 3:8 and 9 Paul says that the ministry of the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit and also a ministry of righteousness
In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul first says that the ministry of the old covenant was of death and then, that it was of condemnation
Regarding righteousness and life there are two sides: the side of righteousness unto life, and the side of life unto righteousness
In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul is speaking from the standpoint of the second side that is of a condition a state of death resulting in condemnation
Even today, if we continue to live in the old creation, we shall be in a condition of death, a condition which is under God's condemnation
In this Life-study of Exodus we have strongly emphasized the fact that the law, the Ten Commandments, is a portrait of what God is
The last six commandments are concerned with honoring parents, murder, adultery, stealing, bearing false witness, and coveting
The first four commandments are related to God's holiness, and the last six commandments are related to God's righteousness
Many of us have to admit that our daily life is not a life in the kingdom, a life where everything is regulated, governed, and ruled
He said that we must hunger and thirst after righteousness and even be persecuted for the sake of righteousness
The church is filled with the Spirit of life, and this Spirit of life issues in a state, a condition, that is altogether righteous
Since linen signifies righteousness, this means that a person approaching the tabernacle from a distance would see righteousness
Because the church is the kingdom of God, and the kingdom of God is righteousness, there should be no disorder in the church
Outside the church there is confusion, disorder, and uncleanness, but inside the church everything is clean and in a proper order
Outside the church, nothing is under the rule of God, but inside the church everything is under the control and regulation of the Spirit
Regarding the length of the outer court, we have the numbers one hundred, twenty, and five, five coming from a hundred divided by twenty
The width of the outer court was fifty cubits, divided by ten pillars into ten sections measuring five cubits each
The outer court was a rectangle with the length, one hundred cubits, twice the measurement of the width, fifty cubits
The number twelve will be there: twelve foundations, twelve gates, twelve pearls, twelve months, twelve fruits
The new covenant ministry ministers the processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit into us so that a certain condition may result
The bronze overlaying the altar came from the censers of two hundred and fifty of the children of Israel who were judged by God
The fact that the white linen hung on pillars of bronze indicates that the righteousness of God comes out of God's judgment
Whatever we are, whatever we do, whatever we say, and whatever we have are all the number six, under God's condemnation
It is God's judgment that produces the righteousness which is the expression of God as the boundary and sphere of His dwelling place
In the last two chapters of the Bible, Revelation 21 and 22, we have a building made of these three categories of material
Whatever God is doing today-in preaching the gospel, edifying the saints, or establishing churches-is part of His building work
Although the tabernacle was rather small, ten cubits wide and thirty cubits long, it is unique in every aspect
We know from the book of Revelation that the New Jerusalem will have a wall one hundred forty-four cubits high
The hangings of the court signify Christ as God's righteousness to be the expression of God's building as its boundary
Whenever the tabernacle with the outer court was erected in the wilderness, the people could see white linen as the sphere of God's building
Often there is a shortage of such a boundary or expression among Christians today because they are short of Christ
From inside the church everything should be golden; that is, there should be the expression of God in His holy nature
In particular, with the tabernacle and its court, we see the expression of God in righteousness outwardly and holiness inwardly
With the hangings we see two main things: righteousness signified by the white linen, and responsibility signified by the number five
As a husband or wife, as a parent or child, as an employer or employee, and even as a neighbor, we must fulfill our responsibilities
Wherever we are, at school, at home, at work, in our neighborhood, or with our relatives, we must bear our responsibility
If we do not have righteousness, then we shall be short of the expression of God in Christ as our righteousness
With the outer court we can see bronze and linen, bronze signifying God's judgment and linen signifying God's righteousness
If we are living Christ, we shall experience in His life a judging element, an element that puts us under the judgment of God
Some may think that God's judgment is the same as the inner sense which keeps a saved person from doing certain things
The phrase of bronze governs both the sockets and the pillars just as the phrase of silver refers both to the hooks and the connecting rods
The bronze pillars signify Christ judged by God being the standing and supporting strength of the separation of God's building
Christ is not only the base of the separation; He is also the standing and supporting strength of the separation
In order to express Him to others, especially to outsiders in the world, we need to be judged in our daily living
My intention here is not simply to give teachings from the types as admonitions or exhortations to good behavior
The number sixty here signifies Christ in the likeness of the man of flesh being judged by God according to His righteousness
The point here is that if we live Christ, the judged life of Christ will make us sockets and also standing and supporting pillars
We, the pillars, are joined together by the strength of the redemption of Christ, which comes out of God's righteous judgment
Unless we have come into the sphere of the outer court, there is no way for us to enter into the Holy of Holies
If we would enter the innermost section of the tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, we must first pass through the section of God's righteousness
In studying the types in the Old Testament, we need to pay attention both to the contents and to the appearance
The types in the book of Exodus have these two aspects-the aspect of the contents and the aspect of appearance
In the previous messages concerning the outer court, we saw the contents and the appearance of the outer court
The gate of the court of the tabernacle, like the entrance of any kind of building, has a particular appearance
The first impression one would have of the tabernacle and the court was that of the gate and the hangings on the two sides of the gate
Exodus 2714 and 15 say And the hangings for the one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits their pillars three and their sockets three
As we consider the front of the court of the tabernacle, we should pay attention to the numbers three and four
The number fifteen, composed of three times five, signifies the responsibility borne by Christ matching the requirements of the Triune God
The fact that there were three pillars and three sockets on each side signifies that both the base and the standing matched the Triune God
The number twenty here, composed of four times five, signifies Christ bearing the responsibility for men, the creatures
The four openings with the four pillars and the four sockets signify the gate being open toward men from the four ends of the earth
It does not require very much skill to interpret this picture, since the spiritual alphabet is right before our eyes
On each side we have the number three signifying God, and in the middle we have the number four signifying man, the creature
Chapter sixteen of John is, of course, a continuation of chapters fourteen and fifteen and is itself followed by chapter seventeen
If you intend to repent, believe in the Lord, and receive Him as your Savior, you must become a person bearing the Triune God as a testimony
If a person does not repent for this purpose, then he should not try to enter the gate of the court of the tabernacle
The changes in elementary education over the years illustrate the capacity of young ones to understand many things
In the same principle much of todays preaching of the gospel is too shallow and gives others a very superficial understanding of the gospel
Most of today's gospel preaching gives people only the first three letters of the spiritual alphabet-A, B, and C
In the book of Acts we see that thousands were saved for the purpose of the raising up and the building up of churches
When we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus, we came into God's salvation and also entered into God's building
As part of the twenty-six letters of the spiritual alphabet, it is something we should have learned at the beginning
Those who confuse aspects of culture with God's salvation have not learned thoroughly the alphabet of God's salvation
As a result they unconsciously mix certain aspects of their culture with Gods salvation and confuse human culture with the salvation of God
When someone speaks about a certain aspect of God's salvation, they may be very confident that they understand
What we see signified at the front of the court of the tabernacle is man bearing as a testimony the Triune God involved with man
Having considered the appearance of the gate, let us now see what is the basic material used to produce such an appearance
According to John 16:8, when the Spirit of reality comes, He will convict the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment
Our hatred and our love, our pride and our humility, along with all of our virtues, must pass through the gate of God's judgment
If we would come into Gods building we must pass through the gate of judgment and experience Gods judgment on everything we are have and do
If we have not experienced this judgment in a thorough way, we must make up this lesson and pass through the bronze gate
Hallelujah, whatever God judges, Christ redeems, and whatever Christ redeems is linked by this redemption to God's righteousness!
When in our experience we enter into the outer court of the tabernacle, we find that the most striking element is bronze
27:19 says, 'All the utensils of the tabernacle in all its service, and all its pegs, and all the pegs of the court shall be of bronze'
We have pointed out that the utensils the furniture and the pegs in the outer court along with the pillars and the sockets were of bronze
Do you know why certain saints come into the church life and after a short period of time become unstable and then disappear?
The reason for their instability is that they do not have the bronze pegs; they lack God's judgment as their strength and stability
Everywhere we see bronze signifying judgment: bronze sockets, bronze pillars, bronze pegs, bronze furniture, bronze utensils
There were the silver hooks, the silver connecting rods, and the silver sockets for the tenons of the standing boards of the tabernacle
Everything in the tabernacle is gold golden boards golden utensils a golden showbread table a golden lampstand and a golden incense altar
Even we need to touch the very depths in the Holy of Holies and to be with God, and also to become one with Him
We enter into this realm only by passing through the gate of God's judgment, where everything related to us is judged
We also have the ground the way and the means to enter into the gold into Gods nature and to enjoy the divine nature as everything to us
By enjoying the divine nature, we have the inward expression of God, that is, holiness as the expression of God's nature, of God's being
John 16:8 says that the Spirit of reality 'will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment'
He will exercise God's judgment on the world in a positive way, not that people may perish, but that they may be saved
In order to have a pleasant married life, both the husband and the wife need to live a life that is always being judged
Whenever a husband feels that he is justified, that he is right in every way and in everything, he will automatically condemn his wife
Suppose the husband condemns himself and feels that there is nothing good in him, that not even his good intentions are acceptable to God
If a brother and his wife are willing to be under God's judgment, spontaneously God's righteousness will be upon them
If the husband justifies himself and the wife justifies herself, then visitors in their home will not see anything of God's righteousness
The hooks used for holding the linen to the pillars were of silver, and the connecting rods were also of silver
When sinners outside this building hear the glad tidings and repent, they experience an inward convicting through the Spirit of reality
If we submit to this divine judgment and condemnation, we shall simultaneously experience the redemption of Christ
We all need to learn to preach the gospel according to what is revealed in the typology of the gate of the outer court
We should not preach a gospel that has been lowered down to what we think is the level of people's understanding
Of bringing people up to the level of the gospel, many of us have lowered the thought of the gospel when presenting the truth to unbelievers
They did not know God, they did not know anything about the gospel, and they had never heard the name of Jesus Christ
We need to realize that within man there is a God-created talent, ability, to receive God and to receive and understand His gospel
We may emphasize one point: without Christ life is vain and people are empty, but with Christ there is reality
Man was created for God, and within him there is the ability to understand the things of God, and there is a hunger for these things
As we preach the gospel in an uplifted way, we must believe that the hearers have the ability to understand what we are saying
We need to know the significance of the numbers three and four and of the materials, the elements, of bronze, silver, and linen
We need to know judgment, redemption, and righteousness, and to know that the Triune God is a God of judgment, redemption, and righteousness
After completing the section on the tabernacle, we would expect to come next to the priests, especially to the garments of the priests
Although these garments do not seem to have anything to do with the lighting of the lamps, chapter twenty-eight begins with the conjunction
We need to find the reason for this sequence, especially why Moses links together the lighting of the lamps and the priestly garments
Because there were no windows in the tabernacle, there was the need for the lighting of the lamps inside the tabernacle
The altar was a place of slaughter, and it was the duty of the priests to slaughter the animals and offer them to God as sacrifices
The second and third items of the priestly service were the lighting of the lamps and the burning of the incense
As we have seen, the lighting of the lamps could not be done by common people, but could be done only by holy ones, by priests
In the New Testament sense, a priest is not only possessed by God in full, but is entirely filled and saturated with God
For this reason, we emphasize the fact that the lighting of the lamps was a priestly service, a service of the priests
It was not a natural light, that is, a light that comes from the sun during the day or from the moon and the stars at night
Chapter nine of Judges speaks positively of three kinds of trees: the olive tree, the fig tree, and the vine tree
Just as olives pass through a process to produce olive oil, so the Spirit of Christ has passed through a process
As the olive tree Christ grew on earth and then passed through a process that included incarnation human living crucifixion and resurrection
As the fulfillment of the type of the tabernacle, the church today is the real tabernacle, God's dwelling place
It is possible for a group of believers to come together to meet as the church, and yet these believers may meet in darkness
At certain times, there was a kind of light in the meetings, but it was a natural light, the light of the sun, moon, or stars
In addition to such natural light, there was sometimes a man-made light, a light that comes from someone's concept
The one who lights the lamps is a holy person, a priest, a person possessed by God, saturated with God, and living absolutely for God
Whenever a group of believers comes together for a meeting without any who are holy priests, that meeting will be in darkness
As a result, in that meeting there will be natural light or man-made light, but no divine light, no holy light
A young sister may give a short word of testimony, and in her testimony there will be the lighting of the lamps
According to this way, the types in the Old Testament are merely shadows of various matters in the New Testament
We have heard the terms clergy and laity, and we often declare that we do not want anything of the clergy-laity system
Whenever such a speaking takes place in the meeting, the lamps are lighted, and the meeting is full of divine light
If in our daily living we do not have the expression of Christ, then whatever we do in the church meetings will be hypocrisy
The conjunction 'and' at the beginning of chapter twenty-eight indicates that the priestly garments are needed for the lighting of the lamps
Throughout the centuries, especially since the Reformation, Christians have been debating the matter of how to meet
If we are asked in what way we meet in the church life, we should reply that we meet in the way of lighting the lamps
Meeting together to light the lamps in the sanctuary comprises every aspect of our spiritual experience in the Christian life
As we have pointed out, in order to be qualified to light the lamps in the Holy Place, we must have every aspect of the priestly garments
If we have the priestly robe but not the ephod or the breastplate, we are not qualified, for we are lacking in the expression of Christ
When we come to the meetings to light the lamps, we may be short of the real experience of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God
Sometimes in the pray-reading of certain saints and in their calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, there is no olive oil
They do not have the oil which comes from Christ as the olive tree, but they have oil from some inferior source
Should someone pray-read or call on the Lord in a light way, he certainly is not lighting the lamps with pure olive oil
The pure and holy pray-reading, calling on the Lord's name, and praising should not be mixed with lightness or joking
Pray-reading, calling, or shouting in a natural way never causes the holy light to ascend, and it never enlightens the other saints
The pure olive oil is oil that has passed through incarnation and crucifixion, and has entered into resurrection
As those whose gathering is the sanctuary of God, we need to light the lamps in the sanctuary, that is, in the tent of meeting
Of course, the physical building in which we meet is not the sanctuary, or the Holy Place; it is the gathering which is the sanctuary
Everything we do in the meeting-our speaking, singing, praising, calling, shouting, pray-reading-must cause the holy light to ascend
The reason we still need the lighting of the lamps is that, for the most part, we are not yet in the Holy of Holies
Even though we have the light ascending in the Holy Place, we are still in the Holy Place, not yet in the Holy of Holies
We are lighting the lamps before the testimony, which is on the other side of the veil, hoping that the veil will be taken away
Once we enter the Holy of Holies, the shekinah glory will replace the light we cause to ascend in the sanctuary
We need to have these qualifications in order to be before the testimony with the expectation of coming into the Holy of Holies
By lighting the lamps we can see the way leading into the Holy of Holies, the way leading into the depths of Christ within God
If instead of seeing an aspect of Christ, we see something common, natural, or worldly, there must be something wrong with the light
By our singing, testifying, speaking, and sharing, the light must shine to present the various aspects of Christ
As we consider the picture of the lighting of the lamps with olive oil, we have a portrait of spiritual experience
We need the experience of Christ as the olive tree in His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
Our understanding of the lighting of the lamps is not mainly doctrinal; rather, it is very much related to our Christian experience
In our experience we need to be priests, we need to have the lampstand with the wicks, and we need to have the oil
If we do not have these garments, this means that we are lacking in the experience of Christ and in the expression of Christ
When they come into the meetings, many saints suffer a spiritual killing because they are not clothed with priestly garments
Is the reason: we cannot have the tabernacle without the priesthood, and neither can we have the priesthood without the tabernacle
In the typology of these chapters, God reveals that His redeemed people are both the tabernacle and the priesthood
The Greek language has two different words to denote the priesthood as a body of priests and the priesthood as a priestly service
In 1 Peter 2:5 the priesthood is not the service of the priests; rather, it is a group of priests who live, serve, and work together
If the church as the house of God were not constituted of life and built with life, how could it be the priesthood?
On the one hand, we, the believers, are a spiritual house; on the other hand, we are a priesthood, a body of priests
We may have appreciated the beauty of certain materials, but we would not have a meeting hall, a building in which to meet
We know that the priesthood requires the building up of the believers because the priesthood is a spiritual house
Deep within, you may not have the assurance that you have truly been built into the local expression of the Body of Christ
As the materials for God's building, we have been chosen, predestinated, called, saved, forgiven, justified, reconciled, and regenerated
Although we are such materials, we must still ask ourselves if we have been built up with others into God's house
We all need to see that the church has a twofold function, the function to house God and the function to serve Him
According to the second chapter of Genesis, the divine life is presented to man in the form of the tree of life
Verse 10 goes on to say, 'And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads'
As The Vision of God's Building makes clear, these matters are related to the crucial points of life and building
The New Jerusalem will contain the same three materials mentioned in Genesis 2: gold, pearl , and precious stones
The historical books, all the books from Joshua through Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther, are concerned with the building
The three precious materials in Genesis 2-gold, pearl, and onyx stone-are found in the tabernacle and the priesthood
We have seen that on the breastplate and the shoulder plates of the ephod worn by the high priest there were precious stones
In the New Jerusalem there will likewise be pearl instead of silver, for by then there will be no further need of redemption
For this reason, in 1 Corinthians 3:12 Paul mentions gold, silver, and precious stones; he does not speak of pearl
If this brother is not built into God's building, his apparent spiritual wealth will become spiritual bankruptcy
As long as you are willing to be built into God's building and actually are built in, the problems of opinion and peculiarity will disappear
According to these verses, the nourishment is for the building, the spiritual house, and the spiritual house is for the holy priesthood
The dear ones in that place under the Lord's hand had learned different spiritual lessons and had some spiritual experience
If we do not allow the Lord to have the building among us, we shall be a failure as far as God's purpose is concerned
The ephod was altogether for building; it was for the linking together of the breastplate and the two shoulder plates
The two shoulder plates on which were engraved the names of the tribes of Israel were also connected to the ephod
When the high priest stood before the Lord to seek His leading, he had to wear the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim
If the high priest did not have the breastplate, he could still worship God, burn the incense, and light the lamps
Because of our human frailty, our expectation may be that the Lord's recovery would increase and multiply rapidly
In His sovereignty, instead of allowing this to happen, the Lord would permit the recovery to be opposed and also to be purified
The robe was a long garment that went from the shoulders down to the feet, covering the body of the priest in full
My concern in this message is that we have a general understanding of the significance of the priestly garments
If a policeman wore some other kind of clothing, even very fine, expensive clothing, he would not be qualified
If someone without the proper uniform tried to act as if he were a policeman, you would not show him the same respect
That person would not have the qualification signified by the uniform, and he would not be separated by this uniform from others
The words 'holy' and 'sanctify' indicate that a priest of God should be separated to Him, set aside for His purpose
The fact that the element of gold was part of the garments typifies that divinity, the divine nature, is part of the expression of Christ
The four Gospels reveal that in the life and daily living of the Lord Jesus we can see the divine glory and also the human beauty
The Greek word rendered 'praises' in the King James Version is better rendered attributes, excellencies, or virtues
In 1 Peter 2:9 the virtues, or excellencies, are the divine glory, the divine attributes, and the human beauty, the human virtues
What is expressed in our living is not merely a matter of doctrine; it is a matter that is very practical and experiential
Most of the priestly garments, however, were both for the priests, the sons of Aaron, and for the high priest, Aaron
Some of us are very sensitive to the temperature and need to wear the right clothing to keep us from being too warm or too cold
The ephod in particular was not used to cover the high priests nakedness or to protect him from cold it was altogether for glory and beauty
We have pointed out that glory here refers to the divine expression, the divine attributes, and that beauty refers to the human virtues
If the sisters consider their clothing from this point of view, the style of clothes they wear may be somewhat different
He carries us like the high priest wearing the ephod to which the shoulder plates and the breastplate were securely fastened
According to the picture of the plates fastened to the ephod, we are tied to Christ by His divine glory and human beauty
My point here is that when we realize the divine glory and the human beauty of Christ, we are spontaneously fastened to Him
When we consider the divine glory and human beauty of the Lord in the Gospels, we are spontaneously fastened to Him
By reading the story of the Lord's life on earth, we see His divine glory and His human beauty, and we are fastened to Him
The scarlet signifies Christ's redemption accomplished by His sacrificing Himself through the shedding of His blood
As we have seen, it was composed of Christ's divinity, His kingliness and heavenliness, His redemption, and His fine humanity
Such a garment would be much more impressive than a uniform worn by a five-star general with many stripes and decorations
The more you consider His glory and beauty, the more you are held to Him, fastened to Him, and have the sense within that you are safe
Those pieces were for the purpose of joining the two ends of the ephod and also for holding the golden settings for the onyx stones
The ephod with the breastplate and the shoulderplates portrays the fastening power of Christ through His divine glory and human beauty
As we have pointed out, when we read the four Gospels, we can see the Lord with His divine glory woven into His human beauty
In other words, every aspect of Christ typified by the materials and colors of the ephod is revealed in the Gospels
According to 28:12, Aaron was to bear the names of the children of Israel before the Lord upon his shoulders for a memorial
When God looks at Christ, He sees His redeemed people, who have been transformed into onyx stones held in settings of gold
As we shall see in forthcoming messages, the breastplate signifies the building together of God's redeemed people upon Christ
The ephod was beautiful in itself, but the onyx stones fastened to the shoulders of the ephod added even more beauty to it
That mounting added beauty to the precious stones, just as a proper mounting on a ring adds beauty to a diamond
On the one hand, the diamond is the beauty of the ring; on the other hand, the fine plaited setting adds beauty to the diamond
We have seen that the blue symbolizes heavenliness, the purple signifies royalty or kingliness, and the scarlet signifies redemption
The weaving together of the gold and the linen into one piece of cloth signifies the mingling of divinity and humanity
We see the anointing; however, we do not see that we are attached to Christ by His divine glory and human beauty
The more we see concerning the ephod, the more we shall be fastened to Christ in our experience, and the more secure we shall be
Thank the Lord for this picture of the ephod showing that we are fastened to Christ, held to Him, and girded together with Him
Exodus 28:6 says, 'And they shall make the ephod of gold, blue and purple, scarlet, and fine-twined linen, the work of a skillful workman'
The ephod was made of linen thread and golden thread and with five colors: golden yellow, pure white, blue, purple, and scarlet
Because we use the word mingling in relation to the divine nature and human nature of Christ, we have been condemned as heretical
From the time of Paul and John in the first century, there have been many different teachings concerning the Person of Christ
Our book entitled Concerning the Person of Christ gives seven different schools of thought regarding the Person of Christ
On page 112 of the same book Ruth Paxson goes on to say, 'In the God-man, God made a new union with the human race'
Although the New Testament reveals that Christ is the Godman we cannot find a verse telling us that Christs two natures were woven together
Many Christians have the concept that Christ's divine nature was added to His human nature much like a piece of gold is wrapped in linen
No doubt you strongly believe that Christ is both God and man but have you ever thought about how the two natures of Christ are put together
Were these two natures side by side within Him, or was Christ's divine nature placed on top of His human nature?
Was Christ's human nature somehow surrounded by His divine nature, or did His human nature cover His divine nature?
His process with all the sufferings is portrayed by the gold becoming the thread woven together with the linen
If you read the account of the way He spoke to His parents when He was twelve, you will realize that He spoke to them in a kingly manner
When the Lord Jesus became angry with those in the temple and made a whip of cords to drive them out, He was angry in a kingly way
To those who criticized Him concerning this, He said that He did not want this woman to be bound by Satan any longer
Also, when He was angry and cleansed the temple, He manifested both His kingliness and the golden yellow of His divinity
Can you point to a chapter of the New Testament that portrays the Lord Jesus in the way He is portrayed in the ephod?
You may take a thousand words to describe someone's nose or ear, and still your description would not be complete
Because the shoulder-pieces were of one piece with the ephod, they should not be regarded as separate from the ephod itself
These pieces were one with the ephod as a whole and, joining the two parts together, they were strong enough to bear the onyx stones
In order for the ephod to bear such heavy stones, it was necessary for the shoulder-pieces to be thick and strong
The two natures of Christ are mingled to bear the expression of God signified by the gold and the expression of man signified by the linen
Christ also bears the expression of His heavenliness kingship and redemption typified respectively by the blue the purple and the scarlet
When some hear this, they may say, 'Perhaps you as an older brother in the Lord are signified by the onyx stone
If you did not have the element of onyx stone in your being, you would have no interest in hearing this kind of message
Of course, it takes time for the fallen element to be removed and the created element to be transformed and uplifted
The sufferings experienced by the Lord Jesus caused Him to be formed into a beautiful setting to hold us as the precious stones
The more we behold the Lord's beauty and appreciate it, the more steadily shall we be fastened to Him and by Him
From reading the New Testament we cannot see the beauty, the filigree, of the Lord's fastening strength and power
We can see it by considering the picture of the ephod with the shoulder-pieces, settings, and golden cords in Exodus 28
We have pointed out that the shoulder-pieces were part of the ephod and therefore were made of the same materials
If there were not such an expression in this universe, there would be nothing that could either bear us or fasten us to Christ
Just as the materials and colors used to make the ephod were woven together, all these aspects of Christ's expression are mingled together
If the onyx stones were simply fastened to the ephod without being placed in beautiful golden settings, they would be short of beauty
The onyx stones become the beauty of the ephod, and the ephod with the golden settings becomes the beauty of the onyx stones
They were a memorial of the church set in Christ, a memorial of Christ holding the church, God's redeemed people
Have you ever thought that the breastplate here is a very fine, even the finest, revelation concerning the church?
In a forthcoming message we shall see that the breastplate of judgment actually functioned as a heavenly typewriter
If you use a typewriter when you compose a letter, you will press the typewriter keys in order to impress certain letters on the paper
We shall see that the function of the breastplate depended on the transparency of the stones shining with light
Strictly speaking, the priestly garments were not merely for covering nakedness, for health, or for glory and beauty
Not only is the breastplate the first item of the priestly garments; it is also the central item of all these garments
We have seen that the breastplate of judgment functioned as a heavenly, divine, and spiritual typewriter to make known God's leading
What is the significance of the workmanship and material of the breastplate being the same as that of the ephod?
The phrase 'work of a skilled workman' signifies the way the church is formed, that is, the formation of the church
The materials of the ephod and the breastplate signify the constituent of the church, that with which the church is constituted
The church is formed in the way Christ is formed, and the church is constituted of the same elements of which Christ is constituted
In Exodus 28 we have a picture of the church being within the span of Christ's hand, within the capacity of the Lord to care for her
In the New Testament, of course, we see the care of the Lord, but it is not portrayed in the way found in Exodus 28
No matter where we may live, even in a very immoral city, the Lord's hand is wide enough to preserve us, large enough to keep us in His care
Although you may work in an environment filled with temptations and sinful things, you should not try to excuse your weaknesses or failures
Because the hand of the One who cares for us is wide, strong, and capable, we can be a perfect testimony of the Lord in any situation
The breastplate being a span in length and width indicates that the span of Christ's care for the church is unlimited
We have seen that the breastplate was of the same workmanship and material as the ephod and that it was squared and doubled
These twelve stones do not signify God's redeemed people in a separate or individualistic way, but in a corporate way
The twelve stones have been built together to become one entity, and the name of that entity is the breastplate
If this is the situation, then the Lord's bearing of one believer does not have anything to do with His bearing of another believer
Over a period of time, water saturates the wood, carrying away its natural element and replacing it with another kind of element
Once this living water came into us, it began to wash away our natural life and to add more of the divine element into our being
If the process of transformation cannot be completed in this age, God will have a way to complete it in the next age
God's way, however, is the most simple way, a way seemingly without artistic beauty, but a way full of spiritual significance
The number four signifies creatures, and three signifies not only the Triune God, but the Triune God in resurrection
The twelve stones signify the mingling of God with man for the completion of Gods eternal purpose and the administration of Gods government
We read of seven lampstands, seven stars, seven churches, seven Spirits, seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls
It certainly is not accidental that the number twelve is found both with the breastplate and the New Jerusalem
God's plan is to have something signified by the number twelve, that is, the mingling of the Triune God with His creatures
According to the significance of the breastplate, what Christ bears on His heart is an eternal church, not a temporal church
Not even in these fourteen Epistles can we find the details regarding the church that are shown in the type of the breastplate in Exodus 28
Just as the breastplate was borne on the heart of the high priest, so the church typified by the breastplate is on Christ's heart
Hallelujah, we are being mingled with the divine life and the divine nature, and we are undergoing the process of transformation!
As we are transformed and mingled with Him we spontaneously become parts of the heavenly alphabet signified by the stones on the breastplate
It is easy to read these verses concerning the breastplate in a natural way and not be very interested in them
Now, thousands of years later, it is difficult for us to explain definitely the meaning of each of these Hebrew words
They denote a group of transformed people, those who have been transformed from something natural into something divine
These transformed, mingled believers are also set in gold, the divine nature of Christ, and thereby built into one entity
We need to see the vision of the church conveyed by the breastplate, and, having seen this vision, we must be faithful to it
Adam did not form a mission board, and he did not have plans, programs, and schedules for the carrying out of a work
In these messages on the ephod we are speaking concerning Christ with what He is bearing, that is, Christ with the church
It is an especially difficult task to study the typology of the tabernacle, the priestly garments, and the offerings
If you have ever studied the writings of the Brethren, you will see that they pay much attention to the two areas of typology and prophecy
Two ribbons, made of linen, not of gold, were attached to the two bottom ends of the breastplate and bound the breastplate to the ephod
Verse 22 mentions the two chains of gold that connected the top ends of the breastplate to the bottom ends of the two shoulder plates
Verse 23 says, 'And you shall make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and put the two rings upon the two ends of the breastplate'
Verse 24 goes on to say, 'And you shall put the two cords of gold on the two rings at the ends of the breastplate'
One end of the chains was put on the ends of the breastplate, and the other, on the golden settings of the shoulder-pieces
The breastplate without the shoulder-pieces would indicate that we are held by Christ, but not that we are upheld by Him
By this picture we can see that we, God's redeemed people, are both held in love and are upheld by Christ's bearing strength
At the bottom of the breastplate the connecting element is Christ's humanity, signified by two ribbons of linen
In one sense the church is connected to Christ by His divinity, and in another sense the church is connected to Christ by His humanity
If we did not have this picture, we could not see so many details about the relationship of the church to Christ
Although this gives a sense of love and strength, the impression is not the same as that afforded by the picture in Exodus 28
Verse 30 says, 'Aaron shall bear the judgment of the sons of Israel upon his heart before Jehovah continually'
In David Baron's book The Ancient Scriptures and the Modern Jew there is an appendix containing an article on the Urim and the Thummim
According to this article, the twelve names on the breastplate included eighteen of the twenty-two letters in the Hebrew alphabet
On the breastplate with the additional piece called the Thummim all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet could be found
According to this article, the Urim was an illuminator inserted into the breastplate underneath the twelve stones
When the Urim and the Thummim were added to the breastplate, they caused it to become the breastplate of judgment
The writer of this article illustrates the function of the Urim and Thummim by referring to the case of Joshua and Achan
It was also by the darkening of certain stones on the breastplate that the family and eventually the person were found out
In this situation the breastplate functioned like a spiritual and heavenly typewriter to spell out the name of Achan
When the priests were slain by Saul, one of the sons escaped to David, and David then followed the Lord by the Urim and the Thummim
What we have covered thus far regarding the Urim and the Thummim are some of the historical facts according to scholarship
It is not my burden in this message to speak about historical facts; rather, it is to show the spiritual application
Before making a decision, they should consider the saints in their locality, asking what the condition of the saints is
Based upon their reading of the condition and situation of the saints, the leading ones will have the guidance of the Lord
Today it is important for all the leading ones to read the condition and situation of the saints in their locality
If our condition is poor, like that of many Christians, there is no ground, no basis, for the Urim and the Thummim
The adding in of the Urim and the Thummim depends upon the breastplate the twelve stones the inscribing the chains the ribbons and the rings
According to the appendix in David Baron's book, the Urim had twelve illuminators to enlighten all twelve of the transparent precious stones
Even if the stones had been enlightened by the illuminators and thereby shone with light, there would not have been any content
When the light shines through us, others will be able to read the letters, the content of Christ, inscribed into us
How is it possible to have the Lord's leading if we have not fulfilled the basic conditions signified by the breastplate?
According to 28:29 and 30, the breastplate was not only a memorial before the Lord, but was also a plate of judgment
Some of these ordinances concerned punishment for smiting others, and some were related to making recompense for damage to others' property
When we were on Exodus 21 through 23, we pointed out that these chapters are supplements to the Ten Commandments
If we would understand the Urim and the Thummim, we should study the Old Testament and also consider our spiritual experience
Leviticus 8:8 says, 'And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim'
Concerning the Urim and the Thummim, we have been helped by an appendix in David Baron's book The Ancient Scriptures and the Modern Jew
The placing of the Urim and the Thummim into the breastplate caused the breastplate to become the breastplate of judgment
According to the history in the Old Testament, the Urim and the Thummim were placed upon a number of different persons
Although Aaron bore the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim, it is doubtful that he ever made use of the Urim and Thummim
Moses was an extraordinary person, and the Bible tells us that God spoke to him directly, without any means, instrument, or intermediary
Numbers 12:8 indicates that the Lord spoke with Moses 'mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches'
In Deuteronomy 33:8-10 we see what kind of person is qualified to obtain revelation through the Urim and the Thummim
God smelled the fragrance from the burnt offering, and He especially delighted in the fragrance from the incense within the tabernacle
If we are truly one with God, we must offer the burnt offering and burn the incense so that He may enjoy their sweet fragrance
Now we can see the qualifications of the priests, those who have the function to use the Urim and the Thummim for God to speak to His people
The priests were godly ones, they maintained a direct relationship with God, and they offered the burnt offering and the incense to God
Samuel 236 says And it came to pass when Abiathar the son of Abimelech fled to David to Keilah that he came down with an ephod in his hand
David received answers to two practical questions through the Urim and the Thummim used by Abiathar the priest
Samuel 28:6 says, 'And when Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets'
Some Christians like to hear someone speak in the way of the Old Testament prophets and declare, 'Thus saith the Lord'
Two is the number of testimony, and these two items, the Urim and the Thummim, indicate that Christ is the witness, the testimony
The appendix in The Ancient Scriptures and the Modern Jew says that the Urim contained oil that was burned with fire from the altar
In our experience of Christ as the illuminator, the shining One, we have the cross, the Spirit, and Christ Himself
In the foregoing message we pointed out that the Urim and Thummim were added into the breastplate to make it the breastplate of judgment
We also considered the qualifications of those who used the breastplate and how it was applied to various people in the Old Testament
Now we shall go on to consider the significance of the Thummim and how the Urim and the Thummim may be applied to our experience today
The Hebrew word for Thummim means completers, perfecters, and it typifies Christ as the completer and perfecter
The letters inscribed on the twelve stones in the breastplate typify Christ as the letters in the heavenly alphabet
According to the appendix in David Baron's book, four letters of the Hebrew alphabet were not inscribed on the stones set in the breastplate
If some stones had been missing, there would have been a dark spot on the breastplate, indicating that something of Christ is missing
Although the saints may experience Christ and have Christ inscribed into their being, they are still short of Christ
No matter how much we have experienced Christ and have had Him inscribed upon us, we shall still be in darkness if we depend on ourselves
Even though we may be rich in the experience of Christ, something of Christ is still lacking and can be made up by Him alone
Even after experiencing Him over a long period of time, we must admit that something of Christ is still missing
We can never exhaust Christ, for although we may enjoy His inscription, there is still something more of Him that we need for completion
If you carefully examine the situation of Christians today, you will find out what poverty there is concerning the inscription of Christ
A certain believer may be very good, but he may still be opaque, lacking both in transformation and in the inscribing of Christ
No doubt, they have been redeemed by the blood, but although we have known them for years, we have never met their regenerated spirit
A particular saint may be a good brother or a nice sister, but how much of Christ has been inscribed into that one?
It is possible to have thousands of local churches with tens of thousands of saints, but with little experience of Christ
We have seen that each of the twelve precious stones on the breastplate was inscribed with one of the names of the tribes of Israel
The brothers and sisters may be very good, but it is difficult to see in them the clear and definite inscription of Christ
It is one thing to be a good brother or a nice sister; it is a very different matter to have the definite experience of Christ
Before you came into the church life, you may have been edified in certain ways, but how much of the inscription of Christ did you have?
You may have to admit that, although you were saved and regenerated, you did not have anything of Christ inscribed into you
Although they labored on the mission field for years, they still did not have the clear and definite experiences of Christ
Even if we are like the twelve precious stones on the breastplatetransformed transparent and inscribedwe still are not complete or perfect
Even if we have the definite experience of Christ and the clear inscription of Christ, we still are not complete
If as a local church we would be used by God as a breastplate, we all must be transparent, and we must have Christ inscribed into us
The more we consider the situation and condition of both the saints and the churches, the more burdened we shall be
We shall be deeply concerned about the lack of transparency, the lack of inscribing, and the shortage of light
God's way of speaking through the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim is the opposite of what we would expect
Our natural concept would be that God's speaking through the breastplate came from the stones that were shining
Paul's Epistles and also the seven epistles of the Lord Jesus to the seven churches in Asia were all written according to this principle
They were written according to the negative situation of the churches, not according to the positive things found in the churches
Although his writing was based on the negative things, in this Epistle he ministered positive things-the riches of Christ-to the church
The problem among Christians today is that because there is so much darkness, there is no way for God to expose darkness
If in a particular church it is not possible to find out what is wrong, this is an indication that the church there is in darkness
If this speaking were only through positive situations, there would be no need of judgment, for everything would be positive and justified
Paul wrote certain of his Epistles according to the darkness, according to the negative condition, of the saints in the churches
If we do not try to minister Christ to others, we may not realize how short we are concerning the experience of Christ
When we try to speak to others about the experience of Christ, we may find that we ourselves are still very short of experience
We shall realize that, even if we are full of Christ, we still have a shortage, for something of Christ's riches is still lacking
Only through experience can we understand what it is to have Christ inscribed into us and to have Him complete us
In a foregoing message we pointed out that, humanly speaking, garments are for covering, for warmth, and for beauty
No one has ever seen a bride whose wedding garment was so long that it filled the place where the wedding was held
In that case He would not be expressed by a long garment with the train filling the temple, for He would not have any fullness
If someone were to wear a garment that did not properly cover his body, this would indicate that this person was short of virtue
Based upon biblical usage, such a long robe surely signifies the virtues of Christ, and these virtues are His expression
In the Bible a long garment with a long skirt signifies the fullness of the virtues of the one clothed with that garment
Stalin thought that since the churches had been closed for years, there probably were not many Christians left
To his great surprise, at Easter, 1944, crowds of Christians gathered into the church buildings for Easter worship
Upon Christ, signified by the garments, we have the church, signified by the breastplate and the two shoulder-pieces
Also, there are various colors: blue signifying heavenliness, purple signifying kingliness, and scarlet signifying redemption
The church is in Christ, on His breast; the Church is upon Christ, upon His shoulders; and the church is joined to Christ
The basic interpretation of this long robe is that it signifies both the individual and corporate Christ as God's full expression
Even though we are on earth, we have been born from above, from heaven, and have a heavenly life with a heavenly nature
If you see a ripe pomegranate with its seeds, you will receive an impression that a pomegranate is full of life
The church has humanity for the expression of the fullness of life and also divinity for the sounding of the golden bells
It is difficult to tell which comes first, the sounding of the bells or the expression of the fullness of life
The proper church life is full of the expression of life in the pomegranates and of the warning from the sounding of the golden bells
If in the church life we have bells without pomegranates, there will be gossip and criticism, not the ringing of golden bells
If pomegranates are placed alternately with bells, gossip and criticism will disappear, and instead there will be a proper, divine sound
In order for pomegranates to be placed alternately with bells in the church life, we need to grow in life and eventually blossom in life
Through his speaking others may be warned, for they shall hear the sound of golden bells placed alternately with pomegranates
If the church is proper and is truly Christ's fullness, His train, then on the skirt there will be pomegranates and bells
Only by experience can we understand the significance of the typology of the long robe with pomegranates and bells
The sounding is not from a human source; it is from a divine source, even divinity, as indicated by the fact that the bells are golden
In the church we have the beauty of life expressed in our humanity and the divine sounding from the golden bells
Exodus 28:36 says, 'And you shall make a plate of pure gold, and engrave on it, like the engravings of a signet, Holy to Jehovah'
These linen breeches were trousers short pants reaching down to the knee so that they covered the naked flesh from the loins to the thighs
The high priest wore a tunic, the long robe with pomegranates and bells, the ephod, the shoulder-pieces, the breastplate, and the crown
We need to know the significance of the clothing worn by all the priests-the linen turban, the tunic, the girdle, and the breeches
As we carefully read the account of the priestly garments and study this account, we see that these garments are signs
The golden plate is a sign of holiness and the turban the tunic the girdle and the breeches all made of linen are a sign of righteousness
As we consider the garments worn by the high priest, we see gold in the shoulder-pieces, in the breastplate, and on the head plate
In Ephesians 4:24 Paul says that the new man, the church, is created in righteousness and holiness of the truth
Having covered the matters of holiness and righteousness, we must go on to speak concerning the priests themselves
A priest always wears holiness and righteousness as his garments, holiness in the divine nature and righteousness in humanity
Let us now consider in more detail the plate upon the turban, the tunic, the turban, the girdle, and the breeches
Verse 37 says, 'And you shall put it on a ribbon of blue, and it shall be upon the turban; at the front of the turban it shall be'
The other three main offerings-the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering-were for fellowship with God
A portion of the holy gifts offered to God was separated for God Himself to enjoy, and the remainder was for the people's enjoyment
If that portion which was separated unto God was touched by anyone who was not a priest, that would have been a serious transgression
Some of this was burnt on the altar and offered to God for His satisfaction; the rest was for the enjoyment of the priests
These stages include the holy land, the holy produce, the holy tithe, and the holy portion separated to God and to His priests
He bears the responsibility to make us all holy not only in the first, second, and third steps, but also in the fourth step
The tunic of fine linen of woven work signifies the covering of perfect righteousness in a humanity that has been dealt with
The tunics signify Christ experienced as beauty the girdles Christ experienced as strengthening and the turbans Christ expressed as glory
God came in to make other coverings for them: 'Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them'
Even though the tunic covered the loins and the thighs, the breeches served as a double covering for this part of the body
These linen coverings signify Christ as our righteousness to cover our entire fallen being so that we may be priests
The Christ who covers us should also be our High Priest, our mark, our brand, and our declaration that we are holy unto the Lord
With such a holiness in divinity and righteousness in humanity, we have the proper expression of a person living before God and serving Him
As we have pointed out, this involves a fourfold holiness, a series of four steps in which we become more and more holy
It is even more difficult to explain what is that portion of the tithe that is separated to be absolutely for God and His priests
We know that, according to typology, Christ, our High Priest today, is safeguarding the holiness God has among us
It is difficult to go further to explain how we may have in our experience a higher and higher degree of holiness
According to the traditional Chinese understanding, to be holy is simply to be upright; it is to be right with others in every way
They are the so-called holiness churches and follow regulations concerning such things as clothing, hair style, and behavior
The Brethren, who were raised up about one hundred sixty years ago, pointed out that in the Bible holiness does not mean sinless perfection
They referred to the Lord's word in Matthew 23:17 and 19 concerning the temple sanctifying the gold and the altar sanctifying the gift
They showed that this was to make the gold holy in position by changing its position from a common place to a holy one
The Brethren emphasized positional sanctification as illustrated by the gold in the temple and the gift on the altar
In this kind of sanctification, neither the gold nor the gift is changed in nature; it is changed only in position
In 1 Thessalonians 4:3 Paul says that the will of God is our sanctification, and in verse 7, that God has called us in sanctification
We have the foreknowledge of the Father, the sanctification of the Spirit, and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ
According to the first chapter of 1 Peter the blood of Christ redeems us not from sin but from our vain manner of life received by tradition
Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth unto unfeigned brotherly love, love one another from the heart fervently'
The result of the operation of the Triune God for our participation in His salvation is that we live a holy life and love the brothers
We have pointed out that the concluding word regarding the priestly garments in Exodus is related to holiness and righteousness
As our high priest, Christ is working to bring us all the way from the first stage of holiness to the fourth stage
God also required that the top portion of this produce be brought to His dwelling and offered to Him on the altar
The produce of the holy land and the top portion of the produce were for God, but they were not for God in an absolute way
The children of Israel were to build a house, a sanctuary, for the Lord to dwell among them and for His people to serve Him
Now in chapter twenty-nine we have a section dealing with the sanctification of Aaron and his sons to be priests
When an animal is set apart from the herd or flock, a mark may be put on it to indicate that it has been set apart
Those, such as the Jews, who pray to God without praying in the name of the Lord Jesus, pray to Him in a way that is empty-handed
In relation to the filling up of Aaron's empty hands, the sin offering was the first offering presented to God
Having our hands filled is not a matter of consecration; it is to sanctify us, to set us apart, to make us different from others
If our hands are filled with Christ, those in our family, neighborhood, or place of employment will realize that we are different
Because they were among the people of God, Aaron and his sons had experienced the Passover, even while they were yet in Egypt
If someone functions only in this way for a period of time, he will no longer have a pleasant taste when he declares this in the meetings
The Christ who sets us apart is not a mere doctrinal Christ; He is the Christ we experience as the offerings filling up our hands
If we understand this, we have the proper foundation to consider the details of the sanctification of Aaron and his sons to be priests
Exodus 29:4 says, 'And you shall bring Aaron and his sons near unto the door of the tent of meeting, and wash them with water'
For this reason, it was necessary for Aaron and his sons to be brought near to the door of the tent of meetings and washed with water
The washing of Aaron and his sons with water signifies the washing away of the defilements of the earthly touch, with the water in the Word
In Ephesians 5:26 Paul says, 'That He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word'
That sanctification began with the washing of the word, for the Lord told them that they were clean because of His word
Verses 5 through 9 indicate that after Aaron and his sons were washed, they were clothed with the priestly garments
Following that, the turban was put upon his head, and upon the turban there was the holy crown, the golden plate
Once Aaron had been clothed in this way, his garments became upon him a complete and perfect expression full of beauty and glory
If Aaron had stood near the tent of meeting clothed in his priestly garments for a long period of time, he may have said, 'I'm hungry
For this reason, in Exodus 28 we have the clothing of the priests, and in chapter twenty-nine we have the food for the priests
If as children of God we are to be sanctified to be priests serving Him, we need both outward clothing and inward nourishment
To earn a living means to earn what we need to guarantee that we have clothing, food, lodging, and transportation
Our outward emptiness is filled with Christ as our clothing, and our inward emptiness is filled with Christ as our food
We have seen that the priests needed to be clothed with the priestly garments outwardly and to be filled inwardly with nourishing food
The flesh of the bull, and its skin, and its dung, you shall burn with fire outside the camp; it is a sin offering'
The first burning, described in verse 13, is the burning on the altar of the fat, the appendage on the liver, and the kidneys
It was like the burning of incense, a burning that was not for judgment or purification, but for God's enjoyment
The burning of the fat and the inward parts produces a sweet savor for God's satisfaction; He is fully satisfied with it
The second kind of burning, described in verse 14, was the burning of the flesh, the skin, and the dung outside the camp
The trespass offering deals with our sins but the sin offering deals with our sin, that is, with our sinful nature
If we would be priests serving God, we need to realize that even though we have been saved, we still have a sinful nature
The sweetness and richness of Christ's perfection satisfies God, ascending through burning for His satisfaction
To be a priest, it is not adequate simply to confess that we have been defiled by the earthly touch and need to be washed
If we would be priests serving God, we need the outward washing of the word, and we also need to put on Christ as our garment
We cannot enjoy Christ adequately without realizing that we have a sinful nature and need Christ to be our sin offering
Suppose when David was tempted to commit that sin, he remembered that he was sinful and offered a sin offering to God
With respect to many other things, we shall not have any trust in ourselves, for we shall know that we are still sinful
We have seen that Aaron and his sons laying their hands upon the head of the bull signifies the believers being identified with Christ
According to verse 11, Moses was required to slaughter the bull before the Lord at the door of the tent of meeting
We all must realize that, apart from Christ, we are utterly empty, void of anything to satisfy God and ourselves
In order to fill our inward emptiness, Christ had to solve our basic problem with God, the problem of our sinful nature
Christ has become the sin offering to solve our basic problem with God so that our inward emptiness may be filled
If we realize and admit that we have a sinful nature, will it be possible for us to argue with others or fight with them?
If in the morning you offer Christ as the sin offering, surely during the day you will enjoy Him, perhaps as a ram, bread, cakes, or wafers
May we also realize that we still have a sinful nature and that daily, early in the morning, we need to offer Christ as our sin offering
If we offer Christ as the sin offering with this realization, we shall be preserved, and we shall have the way to enjoy more of Christ
Peter 2:5 says that we are a holy priesthood offering up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ
Under the influence of this word, we may have a mistaken concept concerning the sanctification of God's saved ones to be His priests
There is a great difference between consecration and sanctification, and an even greater difference between sanctification and ordination
Suppose instead of being sanctified according to what is described in chapter twentynine Aaron were ordained in a traditional religious way
In order for him to be God's priest and to serve Him as a priest, he must have something with which to serve God
Suppose instead of being ordained Aaron were merely consecrated to the Lord, offered to Him and presented to Him
The sanctification of Aaron and his sons to serve as priests is very different from both ordination and consecration
According to what is revealed in chapter twenty-nine of Exodus, the priests need to have their hands filled in order to serve God
He had crossed the Red Sea, enjoyed the heavenly food and the living water and received a divine education at Mount Sinai
Truly he was a saint, one who was saved and brought out of Egypt and one who had experienced the things of God in the wilderness
As we have pointed out, it is not ordination or consecration, but the filling up of our hands with the riches of Christ
The preciousness of chapter twenty-nine of Exodus consists in the fact that it reveals the way for us to be priests
Exodus 29:4 says, 'And you shall bring Aaron and his sons near unto the door of the tent of meeting, and wash them with water'
Verses 8 and 9 also speak of clothing the priests: 'And you shall bring his sons near, and clothe them with tunics
The bread the cakes and the wafers of course were of the vegetable life in contrast to the animal life represented by the bull and the rams
Some of the blood was put on the horns of the altar, and the remainder was poured out at the base of the altar
The tender, sweet parts of the bull were burned on the altar, and the rest, the flesh, the skin, and the dung, was burned outside the camp
Should a brother continually realize that he has a sinful nature, he will be restricted from arguing with his wife
It is very important for us to see that if we would be priests in a practical way, we must experience Christ as the sin offering
The sanctification of Aaron and his sons to serve God as priests required two rams, in addition to the young bull for the sin offering
Concerning the first ram, 29:15-18 says, 'And you shall take one ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram
You shall cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its inwards and its legs, and put them upon its pieces and upon its head
You shall burn the whole ram on the altar; it is a burnt offering to Jehovah, a sweet savor; it is an offering by fire to Jehovah'
Have you ever realized that in Christ, with Christ, and through Christ you need to be slaughtered and also cut into pieces?
The Bible indicates that whoever wants to serve God as a priest will be slaughtered and cut into pieces by Him
When some hear about the priests being slaughtered and cut into pieces in Christ, they may protest and say, 'No, we don't agree with this
In order to serve God as priests, we must be identified with the slaughtered and cut Christ, the Christ who was cut into pieces by God
Verse 18 says that the whole ram was burned on the altar as an offering by fire to the Lord, a sweet savor to Him
We must first offer Christ as our sin offering; we must realize constantly that we are sinful in nature and even sin itself
As our burnt offering for our sanctification as priests Christ shed His blood for our peace and He Himself was burned for Gods satisfaction
From this offering there was a twofold issue-the blood sprinkled upon the altar and the sweet fragrance ascending to God
The blood of the first ram was sprinkled upon the altar, but something different was done with the blood of the second ram
Notice that the blood was put on the tip of the right ear, upon the right thumb, and upon the first toe of the right foot
After Aaron and his sons had been cleansed by the blood in this way, they were sanctified to serve Him as priests
Now Aaron and his sons were fully sanctified, for the garments covering their entire body had been cleansed and anointed
Aaron was anointed not only as a type of Christ, but also as a sinful person who was being sanctified to serve God as a priest
The right shoulder was burned for God, and the right breast was first waved before God and then given to Moses to be his portion
Both the left shoulder and the left breast were heaved up before God and then given to Aaron and his sons to be their portion
According to the New Testament, the goal of God's salvation is to make all those who believe in Christ priests of God
If a person is saved but fails to become a priest to serve God, he cannot fulfill God's purpose or satisfy His desire
From the typology in the Old Testament, we see that God first redeemed His people, then saved them, and then educated them
Because the priesthood is universal, there should not be some believers who are priests and others who are laymen
All those who believe in Christ, all the redeemed and saved ones, should be educated and sanctified to be priests of God
As revealed in the New Testament, God's desire is that all who have been redeemed in Christ should be His priests
There is no detailed account in the New Testament of how we may actually be sanctified to serve God as priests
If we have a heart to seek a full sanctification in our experience, we must come to chapter twenty-nine of Exodus
Physically speaking, uncleanness may come from two sources, one source from within us and the other from outside of us
It is not necessary to touch anything to get dirty, for we can be made dirty simply by what is in the atmosphere
Exodus 29:4 says, 'And you shall bring Aaron and his sons near unto the door of the tent of meeting, and wash them with water'
We need to wash away the uncleanness caused by perspiration and also the uncleanness which comes from the contact with the things on earth
The priestly garments not only covered the nakedness of Aaron and his sons; these garments also qualified them to fill the office of priest
These verses clearly indicate that in order to serve as priests, Aaron and his sons had to be clothed with the priestly garments
The innermost layer was the breeches, a garment that covered the area from the loins to the knees, the most unclean part of the body
It is important for us to realize that, as fallen human beings, we are unclean and also naked in the sight of God
Those who would serve God as priests must realize that they are unclean and need to be washed and that they are naked and need to be clothed
Even though we have been washed and clothed and have solved the problems of uncleanness and nakedness, what about our fallen nature?
From experience we know that when we are identified with Christ in His death, we have the realization that we have become a heap of ashes
The last step in the sanctifying of the priests is the offering of the second ram, the ram for a peace offering
What we have here is neither consecration nor ordination; it is the filling of the hands of the sanctified ones
We have seen that the washing, the clothing, and the presenting of the bull as the sin offering have solved three problems
Because of this hunger, there is the need for the last step in the sanctification of the priests-the offering of the second ram
Verses 19 and 20 say, 'And you shall take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram
The thighs and the breasts were four major parts of the second ram, in addition to the inward parts, used for the peace offering
Since the breast signifies love, the waving of the breast as a wave offering signifies the resurrected Christ in love
According to the Gospels and the first part of Acts, the Christ who is now in resurrection came back to His disciples in love
The wave offering signifies Christ in resurrection, and the heave offering signifies Christ in exaltation, in ascension
God is satisfied, Moses is satisfied, and all the priests are satisfied, for they all enjoy Christ, the all-inclusive One
The left shoulder and the left breast were given to the ministering priests, and the right breast was Moses' portion
We have something in our hands with which to serve Him: the all-inclusive Christ as the topmost holy portion for God's satisfaction
Because the priests ate the offerings, they were not merely sanctified positionally, but were also sanctified dispositionally
Toward God, therefore, they now were rich, for they had Christ in resurrection as the burnt offering to ascend to God for His satisfaction
They also had Christ in resurrection as the wave offering and in ascension as the heave offering to satisfy themselves as well as God
They could be satisfied with Christ in resurrection as the wave offering of love and Christ in ascension as the heave offering of power
If we understand Exodus 29, we shall have a proper understanding of the significance of sanctification in the New Testament
As a result, our uncleanness is removed, our nakedness is covered, our sinfulness is dealt with, and our emptiness is filled
Outwardly we now have something of Christ to satisfy God, and inwardly we have something of Christ to satisfy ourselves
Moses, however, had been charged to sanctify him, that is, to equip, qualify, and empower him to serve God as a priest
In order for this to take place, he had to be identified with Christ, one with Him, as indicated by the laying of hands on the sin offering
By eating Christ as the peace offering we are saturated with Him and transformed by Him and therefore are no longer natural
When the breast of the wave offering and the shoulder of the heave offering are taken into us, we are saturated and transformed
When Christ as the ram of the peace offering gets into us in this way, we are constituted of Him to become a ram
The inward parts and the fat of the sin offering and also the bread, the cake, and the wafer of the peace offering were God's portion
We thus have the holy land, the holy produce, the holy tithe, and the holiest part of the tithe as the top portion for God's enjoyment
We need to be impressed that these statutes are related to three matters-to the priests' garments, to the priests' food, and to God's food
The result is that God comes to meet with the priests, to speak with them, and even to dwell among them and among all the sons of Israel
If we try to read and study this portion without a brief sketch and a knowledge of its conclusion we shall have difficulty with these verses
We may read these chapters even twenty times and still may not be able to point out in a brief way what is revealed in these chapters
They needed to realize that they were born in sin, that they had a sinful nature, and that they needed a sin offering to solve this problem
To be sanctified they needed the four steps of washing, clothing, dealing with the sinful nature, and filling without and within
Before these messages on Exodus 28 and 29 were given, did you see these four steps of the sanctification of the priests?
God first says that He will meet with us, then that He will speak with us, and eventually that He will dwell in our midst
In these verses God seems to be saying, 'I want to dwell with you and not just visit with you for a short time
Chapters twenty-eight and twenty-nine of Exodus reveal that God wants us to invite Him to dinner, that He wants to come and eat with us
Preparing to have dinner with God can be illustrated by the Chinese custom of preparing to receive an honored guest for dinner
Aaron, the high priest, is like the father in the host family, and his sons, the priests, may be compared to the children in this family
In this country some who invite a guest for dinner may not be thoroughly prepared when the time comes to receive their guest
According to Exodus 29, we should not only serve God with food, but we should also give Him something to drink
These chapters reveal what we must do to have God meet with us, speak with us, eat with us, and, eventually, dwell among us
While they are busy cleaning the house, sweeping the yard, and cooking the food, others may ask them what they are doing
If we see this goal the reason for all the steps in the sanctification of the priests we shall understand what is revealed in these chapters
Days shall the son that is priest in his stead put them on, when he comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place'
These verses speak only of the garments worn by the high priest, first by Aaron and then by his sons, his descendants, after him
Concerning the holy garments, verse 29 says that Aaron and his sons were to be anointed in them and to have their hands filled in them
In order to have the anointing and the filling of hands, the high priest had to be clothed with the holy garments
Now we see that in order for the high priest to be anointed and to have his hands filled, he had to first be clothed with the holy garments
Many in Pentecostalism do not experience a genuine anointing, because they are not properly covered with Christ
Is the basis a life of constantly wearing Christ, a life of wearing Him a full course of time, or is it the instant wearing of Christ?
Those who wear Christ constantly and then come to the meetings of the church to serve have depth, weight, and riches
Exodus 29:31-42a is concerned with the holy food for the priests and for the daily offerings of the filling of hands of the priests
The ram here is not the first ram, the ram of the burnt offering, but the second ram, the ram of the peace offering
The children of Israel enjoying the harvest anywhere indicates that the children of God can enjoy the riches of Christ in any place
The children of Israel did not have the right to enjoy the top tenth of the harvest in the place of their choice
Numbers 18:26 says that of the tenth offered by the children of Israel from their harvest, a tenth was separated for the priests
In addition, you may attend an evangelistic campaign conducted by a particular group of Christians and enjoy Christ there
If we try to save Christ, God will say, 'Instead of saving that portion of Christ, offer it to Me and let Me eat it
They were washed with water, they were clothed with the priestly garments, and they were satisfied with holy food
Being a priest involves three steps related to the priests themselves and another step related to God's satisfaction
Even after Aaron and his sons had been washed, clothed, and satisfied, they were not yet qualified to serve as priests
In chapter twenty-nine of Exodus the most difficult matter to grasp is that of the priests serving God with food for His satisfaction
Along with these parts of the second ram, the priests were also given bread from the basket which also contained bread for God's food
The preparation would be much more complicated if the governor of the state were coming to her home for dinner
We have three items of the animal life-a bull and two lambs-and three items of the plant life-fine flour, oil, and wine
In quantity God's food was one bull, two lambs, a tenth of an ephah of fine flour, and the fourth of a hin each of oil and wine
The bull was for a sin offering, and the two lambs offered with the flour, the oil, and the wine were for a burnt offering
In a foregoing message we pointed out that, according to Exodus 28 and 29, God wants us to invite Him for dinner
Most of those who are persuaded in a gospel meeting to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ realize only that they are sinful in their deeds
Many Chinese, thinking that Confucius was not wrong in any way, honor him, respect him highly, and regard him as a saint
No matter how good Confucius may have been outwardly, he was still a sinner in nature, just like everyone else
According to 2935 and 36 for seven days every day of the priests sanctification a bull as a sin offering was to be offered for propitiation
Perhaps the inward parts and the fat, which were burned on the altar, may be regarded as a kind of food offered to God
In the foregoing message we pointed out that if we would be brought into oneness with God, we need to offer the sin offering
In principle the matter of sanctification through the sprinkling of the blood is revealed elsewhere in the writings of Moses
The altar on which propitiation has been accomplished and which has been anointed with oil has become most holy
When we speak of a good morning, we should refer not to a greeting, but to having a good morning through offering the sin offering to God
If we present Christ as the sin offering to God in the morning, we shall have a good morning, a morning of propitiation
When we offer Christ as the sin offering there will be no problem between us those who invite God to dinner and God the One who is invited
Of problems, we shall have the redeeming blood and the anointing oil signifying propitiation and sanctification
Now there is peace between the inviting one and the invited One, and we can proceed to serve God food for His satisfaction
The matter of propitiation needs to be understood according to the background of the practice in ancient times
The lambs with the flour, the oil, and the wine were offered to God by priests who had been washed, clothed, and satisfied
The lambs, of course, are of the animal kingdom; the flour, the oil, and the wine are of the vegetable kingdom
If we would answer this question, we need to realize that these matters were not merely objective to the Israelites
Rather, they were quite subjective to them, because they were things grown, raised, and reaped by the children of Israel
In other words, these items were the produce of their labor, a produce that belonged to the children of Israel
If we would raise Christ as a bull for our sin offering, every morning we need to practice offering Christ as our sin offering
Just as we need to wash our hands before eating, we need to wash ourselves by offering Christ as our sin offering
You may have the feeling that the meetings of the church in your locality are quite good or that they are improving
Just as we need to raise Christ as a bull for propitiation, we need to raise Him as a lamb to be food offered directly to God
We also need to grow Christ as wheat to produce flour, as olives to produce oil, and as a grapevine to produce wine
If in our experience we pour out the self that lives Christ, we shall grow the grapevine to produce wine for a drink offering
We need to practice every day offering Christ to God as the sin offering because our nature, our being, is sinful
In the sight of God sin which has its source in Satan and which has entered into man is the element of our fallen nature and of our old self
If you read the New Testament carefully, you will see that nowhere are we told that Christ bore our sin on the cross
According to John 1:29, John the Baptist declared, 'Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world'!
In saving us, God does not eradicate our sinful nature at the time of our repentance, conversion, and regeneration
On the one hand, we are a new creation and have a new nature; on the other hand, we are still in the old creation with the old nature
Some teach that once a believer receives the baptism of the Holy Spirit, he becomes absolutely holy and can no longer sin
Accepting the concept of eradication or absolute holiness has led some to excuse sinful things by calling them weaknesses or shortcomings
In some cases, those who hold onto the concept of eradication or of absolute holiness have fallen into gross sin
According to the Bible, we are a new creation in Christ, but in our fallen nature we are still in the old creation
Until we have experienced transfiguration, the redemption of our body, we shall continue to need the sin offering
Daily we should remind ourselves that we are sin and that we need Christ as the sin offering to clear up the situation between us and God
According to Exodus 29, God's food consists of two lambs, a meal offering containing flour and oil, and a drink offering of wine
The 'one righteous act' is in particular ascribed to that single act of Christ in which He was obedient to God unto the death of the cross
The picture in Exodus 29 indicates that throughout the course of our Christian life, we should daily offer Christ as the sin offering
The more we practice offering Christ as the sin offering, the more in our experience He will grow to be a large bull
If we try to offer Christ in the meetings without experiencing Him day by day, we shall be performing like actors in a theater
We have this obedient One as our obedient life, even as our obedience to God, and He lives in us a life of obedience
On the one hand, Christ is the bull for our sin offering; on the other hand, He is also the lamb by whom we live
Of taking the trespass offering in a proper way, she later may simply try to apply the Lord's blood to her situation and claim His cleansing
If a brother daily takes Christ as his sin offering, he will automatically become obedient to God and also meek
To understand a matter in a doctrinal way is one thing, but to view the same matter experientially is very different
Years ago, a certain bookstore in China sold all of Brother Nee's books with the exception of The Spiritual Man
In ancient times, the children of Israel brought the firstlings of their flocks and of their herds to Mount Zion to offer to God
Many Christians have never heard that Christ may be offered not only for propitiation, but also as food for God's eating
According to the Bible, certain offerings were not for atonement, not for propitiation, but were for God's eating
Exodus 29:38-40 says, 'And this is what you shall offer upon the altar: two lambs a year old, every day continually
According to these verses, two lambs a year old were to be offered every day, one in the morning and the other in the evening
In The All-Inclusive Christ we have pointed out in detail that wheat and barley are both types of Christ as our life supply
When we offer Christ to God in the morning as our sin offering, we shall be brought into a clear situation with God
As we live Him, He will become our life supply, and He will also produce something within us that is good for eating
From the time we sincerely begin to offer Christ as a sin offering, we indicate that we mean business with the Lord
The more we raise Christ and grow Christ, the more we shall have Him as the animal life and the vegetable life in the church meetings
The term pneumatic Christ does not denote a spiritual Christ; rather, it refers to Christ as the Spirit, as the pneuma
It would not be logical to say that the bull, the lambs, the flour, and the wine are Christ but that the oil is something other than Christ
If a brother and his wife both offer Christ as their sin offering, their words and activities together will be full of oil
If a brother has sufficient oil, even the exchanging of words with his wife will be replaced with something that is sweet and pleasant
The way to gain the oil is to deal with the mingled spirit, to use our spirit, and to live, walk, speak, and do everything by the spirit
Rather, we should bring two lambs, a tenth of an ephah of flour, a quarter of a hin of oil, and the same amount of wine
In particular, we need to have a proper understanding of the daily offerings for the sanctification of the priests
If we consider all these types in the light of our experience, we shall realize that their significance is wonderful
In 1 Corinthians 10:6 Paul, referring to the children of Israel in the wilderness says, 'Now these things occurred as types of us'
As an example, those who hold this view of typology would refer to Paul's word concerning Sarah and Hagar in Galatians 4
According to this view, unless the New Testament says so, we should not apply any particular matter in the Old Testament to Christ
Many Bible teachers, including those who hold this fourth attitude toward types, admit that Joseph is a type of Christ
Paul clearly says as much in 1 Corinthians 5:7, where he tells us that our Passover, Christ, has been sacrificed for us
In particular, one hymn speaks of the fact that sooner or later all believers must pass through the cold waves of Jordan
Certain teachers among the Brethren and perhaps others as well, have taken the captivity and the return from Babylon as types
My aim is to point out that our attitude toward the entire Old Testament is that we approach it in the way of God's dispensation
We have a bull for a sin offering, lambs for a burnt offering, oil and flour for a meal offering, and wine for a drink offering
The bull for the sin offering, the two lambs for the burnt offering, the flour, the oil, the wine-all these are parts of the picture
It is more difficult to understand the significance of the flour mingled with oil and of the wine poured out as a drink offering
If we are faithful and dig into the Word, we shall eventually learn the significance of the meal offering and the drink offering
With the Bible, the Holy Spirit, and our experiences, we can trace the meaning of the flour, the oil, and the wine
We may travel along these tracks until we reach our destination-in this case a proper understanding of the types in Exodus 29
Even if we try to describe his face in thousands of words, we still shall not have an accurate understanding of its appearance
According to my realization, most Christians, including many of us, do not have an adequate regard for the Old Testament
Along with the descriptions and definitions in the New Testament, we need the types, the pictures, in the Old Testament
The situation of the meetings is still too much under the influence of what we inherited from traditional Christianity
In these messages on Exodus 29 we have been considering the sanctification of the believers to serve God as priests
What is revealed through the types in Exodus 29 is absolutely different from the practice of traditional Christianity
The aspects of Christ are pictured in the Bible, but they are not part of your experience; they are not found in your daily life
Our way of living the Christian life may have its source in ethics, culture, religion, and the natural concept
We may be like Bible students studying the Old Testament who study the types in Exodus 29, but do not live according to them
It is possible to be under the Lord's ministry for years without applying in our daily life the revelation we have received
Even what we gain from the Lord's ministry may do nothing more than influence our traditional way of living the Christian life
Although you do not follow this kind of tradition, in principle your way of living the Christian life may also be traditional
As you and the Lord enjoy such a relationship, you will realize that you are still sinful, and you will offer the sin offering
Living in the Lord's presence will make us conscious of the fact that we are sinful, even that we are sin itself
Often in our actual practice, our way of speaking to the Lord is very different from the way we speak to the members of our family
Why not contact the Lord in the same kind of living, spontaneous, and intimate way you contact those who are close to you?
Have you noticed that in the Gospels the disciples did not pray to the Lord Jesus in a way that was religious, formal, or traditional?
We should learn from this example to cease from our old way of praying and live a life according to what is pictured in Exodus 29
If you interrupt him and begin to speak about other matters, that would indicate that you do not care for what he is saying
It certainly would not be proper for him to do all the talking and then, when he is finished, to say goodbye and leave
According to this concept, if we testify at the beginning of the meeting, we break the rules or regulations of the meeting
The influence of the old, Oriental culture was so strong that it took a while before we could follow the modern way
When we are in a situation where we must choose between two cultures, we need to exercise discernment to know which is better
We need the proper discernment to know which atmosphere we should be in, the atmosphere of Christianity or of the Lord's recovery
He is the fine flour for the meal offering composed of flour mingled with oil, which signifies the life-giving Spirit
May we put all these matters into our daily life and make them a reflection of Christ according to the picture of the Old Testament types
We should not be dry; we should have the oil of the life-giving Spirit not only poured upon us, but also mingled with us
If we are not under the pressing of the cross, we cannot have any wine to drink, much less have wine to pour out for the Lord and for others
After so many messages on chapter twenty-nine, we come now to a wonderful matter in chapter thirty-the golden incense altar
To apply these types in a practical way to our daily life as Christians requires a certain amount of experience
As we read chapters twenty-five and twenty-six, we may wonder why there is no mention of the incense altar in this section
It is described after the revelation of the tabernacle with the rest of its furniture and the equipping of the priesthood
In other words, the incense altar comes in only after the tabernacle with all the rest of its furniture has been revealed
We have seen that the incense altar is described after the chapter concerning the sanctification of the priests
By the end of chapter twenty-nine the tabernacle with its furniture is ready, and the priesthood is also ready
Some may think that the priestly service ought to begin at the altar of burnt offering, not at the incense altar
According to the divine record in Exodus, this service begins at the golden incense altar, which is the second altar
In the sight of God, the priestly service begins at the incense altar, at the place where prayers are offered to God
Many Christian teachers and Bible readers have thought that some error or misconstruction must somehow have occurred
We may use different terms to describe this one matter: economy, administration, practice, dispensation, move, government
When the prayers of the saints ascend to God with the incense of Christ, God executes the policies of His administration
The prayers in Revelation 8 no longer are merely the prayers of the individual Christ, but have become the prayers of the corporate Christ
To be sure, the bank will not recognize your name; instead, it will recognize the name of the person represented by you
In a very real sense, because you are representing that person, you are that person, for you are acting in his name
The picture portrayed in the Bible as a whole corresponds to the diagram of the tabernacle and the outer court
Speaking of the Lord Jesus, John the Baptist said, 'Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world'!
As we go on from the altar in chapter one of John and the laver in chapter three, we come to the showbread table in chapter six
The bread on this table is in verse 33: 'For the bread of God is He who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world'
By His death and resurrection Christ has prepared the way for us to enter into the Holy of Holies, that is, to come into God Himself
In Anaheim we have the burden to pray that these hungry ones will come to the showbread table to feed on Christ
The number is still small and the progress is slow but it is an undeniable fact that more of the Lords people are coming to His dining table
After we experience the feeding and the enlightening in the Holy Place, we need to enter into the Holy of Holies to touch God's testimony
In the Lord's recovery we do not care merely to carry out a work; we are here for the carrying out of God's testimony
In a very real sense we are not in a field laboring; rather, we are in the Holy of Holies touching the testimony
As the incense ascends through the burning at the golden altar of incense, the execution of God's administration is taking place
Some of those who oppose the Lord's recovery made a decision some years ago to do whatever they can to destroy the recovery
It is a serious matter for anyone to deal lightly with the heavenly White House, the center of God's administration
In the foregoing message we pointed out that the Gospel of John may be regarded as representative of the entire Bible
It is Christ Jesus who died, but rather who was raised, who is even at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us'
If it were not for Christ's intercession, no one would accept His death, experience His resurrection, or be one with Him in His ascension
In order for people to be motivated to experience Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension, His intercession is necessary
All these experiences are dependent on the motivation that comes from the interceding Christ and the interceding church
The Bible first shows us the altar, the cross of Christ, and then the laver, the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit
As those who are seeking the Lord, we in the recovery both individually and corporately must learn one thing-to pray
If we consider the diagram of the tabernacle and the outer court, we shall see that the incense altar is the center
When we lose our temper or when we murmur, complain, and gossip, we are in the outer court, that is, in the flesh
None of the matters concerning which we have received light may be effective in our experience; it may seem that nothing works
If we do not have the center the incense altar none of the aspects of the tabernacle and the outer court will be effective in our experience
According to my study of the Bible, after we come to the ark in the Holy of Holies, we need to come back to the incense altar
For the maintaining of our relationship with God, we need prayer not only from Christ individually, but also from His Body corporately
Exodus 302 gives us the size of the incense altar A cubit its length and a cubit its widthit shall be squared and two cubits its height
The blood of atonement sprinkled on the incense altar made that altar an efficacious, effective, turning point
The crown of gold around the incense altar signifies the glory of Christ's divinity being the preserving power of His intercession
As the tabernacle, the incarnated God, this invisible, abstract, and mysterious One, becomes real, practical, and concrete
Christ is both the incarnated God into whom we may enter, and He is also the offerings that are good for us to eat
The means by which we are qualified to enter into the tabernacle, into the incarnated God, is Christ as the offerings
If we did not have Christ as the offerings, the tabernacle might still be present, but we would not have a way to enter into it
At the altar in the outer court we experience the offerings, and we have the blood to cleanse us and the meat to fill us inwardly
Perhaps you have been a Christian for years without realizing that to pray at the incense altar is to pray in God and with God in us
Those who pray merely in a natural way may be quite far from God, and their prayer may not have the element of God in it
If we see that to burn the incense is to pray Christ, we shall feel ashamed of the way we have often prayed in the past
At the incense altar we should not offer the burnt offering or the meal offering; neither should we pour out a drink offering
When we come to the last part of Exodus 30, we shall see that the incense typifies the resurrected and ascended Christ
On the other hand, with respect to God's dispensation, it is the throne of grace, the place where God dispenses His grace to people
In chapters two and three of Revelation we have the church, and chapters four and five portray the throne of God
The throne in Revelation 4 and 5 is the throne of authority, the throne of the divine administration over the entire universe
As a result, fire comes down to earth to execute the divine judgments recorded in the remainder of the book of Revelation
It is important for us to see that the execution of God's administration is motivated by the prayers offered to Him from the incense altar
Should we continue to pray about transportation, housing, and jobs, God may say, 'Why do you pray about so many strange things?
Thousands and thousands of prayers are offered to God by Christians, but there is very little execution of God's purpose
Who today knows how to pray in such a way as to motivate the throne of grace to dispense God's life supply as grace to all the needy ones?
When we pray we should pray in God we should pray with God within us as our energizing supply and we should pray with Christ as the incense
In order to pray at the incense altar, we must first be filled and satisfied by eating the holy food, our portion of the offerings
When some pray for the church, they do not pray directly for the church, but instead pray for business matters related to the church
We should not burn strange incense, and we should not even burn at the incense altar what is acceptable to God at the offering altar
In the same chapter Peter passes over the millennium and speaks directly concerning the new heavens and the new earth in eternity
Christ has a great deal of incense, but where are the prayers that are qualified to receive the incense of Christ?
Exodus 30:27 and 28 say that both the altar of incense and the altar of burnt offering were anointed with the holy anointing oil
The altars were also connected by the blood of the sin offering offered for propitiation, or atonement, on the day of Atonement
A portion of the blood was also brought into the Holy of Holies, and the remainder was poured out around the altar in the outer court
From both the burning on the offering altar and from the burning on the incense altar a sweet savor ascended to God for His satisfaction
The burning on the offering altar was a burning of judgment, but the burning on the incense altar was a burning of acceptance
In particular, the first kind of sweet savor, that from the altar of burnt offering, is reflected in the second, that from the incense altar
The sweet savor ascending to God from the altar of burnt offering is reflected in the savor that ascended to Him from the incense altar
The offering altar is the altar of Christ's death, and the incense altar is the altar of Christ's intercession
In their experience many Christians have only one altar, the first altar, the offering altar in the outer court
In our reading of the Bible, we can realize that the golden altar of incense must in some way be related to prayer
If we consider this matter in a deeper way, we shall see that actually the incense altar does not refer to our prayer
Today before God not only is the individual Christ interceding, but the corporate Christ, the Head with the Body, is interceding as well
If you consult the diagram printed in message one hundred forty-seven, you will see that the incense altar was located inside the tabernacle
Since the incense altar is in the tabernacle, whoever would pray at the incense altar must be inside the tabernacle
In this message we shall try to cover some of the details related to the depths of the significance of this altar
With the tabernacle and the outer court there are two altars: the altar of burnt offering and the golden altar of incense
The incense altar in the tabernacle is for prayer, and the altar of burnt offering in the outer court is for offering sacrifices
Once we have experienced the first altar, we shall have the base, the standard, the ground, to come to the second altar to pray
The fire that burned on the altar in the outer court was used to burn the incense at the incense altar in the tabernacle
When some hear that the Lord Jesus wants us to be burned to ashes, they may say, 'Christ is the One who is reduced to ashes by burning
Thank the Lord that today we have the blood as the sign and assurance that our sin and our trespasses have all been dealt with
Those who pray at the second altar must first be burned to ashes; that is, they must no longer be a natural person
Our conduct, our sight, and our virtue together equal our natural being, which is versus Christ as God's testimony
If we have become a heap of ashes, will we still have our natural conduct, our natural sight, and our natural virtue?
We know it by the fact that we still have our natural conduct, our natural sight or view, and our natural virtues
A person who prays, intercedes, at the second altar is one who has spiritual light in place of his natural sight
Nothing that we pray at the first altar, the altar of burnt offering in the outer court, can be an intercession
When we pray at the first altar, it is very difficult to pray in such a way that we are not occupied with ourselves or our situation
By the time we come to the second altar, we have passed through the cross, the table, the lampstand, and the ark
Have you ever before realized that the veil covering the ark is versus the ark and that it signifies your natural being?
We have four matters: our natural conduct, our natural sight, our natural virtue, and, the composition of these three, our natural being
Many would regard such a brother as an outstanding Christian, for he is full of good behavior, sight, and virtue
It indicates that if we would pray intercessory prayers at the incense altar, we must become ashes; that is, we must become nothing
Having traveled through the various stations of the tabernacle, we may now come to pray, to intercede, at the golden altar of incense
After we have gone to the altar of burnt offering, the table, the lampstand, and the ark, we arrive at the golden altar of incense
Whenever we open our mouth to pray at the incense altar, the prayer that will issue forth will not be personal, individual prayer
At that time we shall be in our experience a real member of Christ, a genuine part of the Body-Christ, the corporate Christ
After we have experienced the first altar, the table, the lampstand, and the ark, we may come to the incense altar and remain there
Once we arrive at the incense altar, we should stay here longer than at any other place in the outer court or the tabernacle
The tour begins at the altar in the outer court, passes through the table, the lampstand, and the ark, and stops at the incense altar
Because the incense altar is our destination, once we arrive there we should remain and continue there in prayer
The reason we cannot pray such prayers at the first altar is that we are not yet the kind of person to offer intercessory prayers
If we have been enlivened by the Lord, we shall realize that many Christians pray with strange incense or with strange fire
To have strange fire is to have some kind of motive within us that is natural and that has not been dealt with by the cross
If we would understand a particular paragraph, we need to know what precedes this paragraph and what follows it
In a simple way we may say that the relationship between them indicates that Christ's ministry of intercession is based upon His redemption
We also need to ask why, at this juncture, the children of Israel needed a ransom, or why they needed the propitiation silver
It is not easy to explain why the children of Israel needed the propitiation silver in Exodus 30 since they had already been redeemed
Why is the redemption in chapter thirty not related to the blood of the animal life but rather related to silver?
Most translations simply use the word 'offering'; others use the word 'contribution,' something the redeemed ones pay to God
Darby, however, was faithful, and his New Translation of 30:13 uses the expression 'the heave-offering for Jehovah'
The margin of the New American Standard Version says 'heave offering,' although the word 'contribution' is used in the text
Otherwise, an improper translation will become a thick covering that will keep us from seeing the truth in the original text
Why did the children of Israel need something further related to redemption when they had already been redeemed in Egypt?
Why was the Passover lamb for everyone, but the propitiation silver was only for males twenty years of age and upward?
We have emphasized the fact that in Egypt all the children of Israel, from the youngest to the oldest, both male and female, were redeemed
The propitiation silver, therefore, was only for males twenty and above; that is, it was only for those who were able to go to war
Those who were numbered in chapter thirty not only were able to go to war; they were those who could be formed into hosts, camps, armies
The census here is not common or general; it is a military census, a census related to the drafting of men into the army
In order to become God's expression, it was necessary for them to be brought to Mount Sinai to receive a particular education from the Lord
They needed to offer the sin offering for their inward sin and the trespass offering for their outward trespasses
The blood of the sin offering and the trespass offering would then open the way for them to come into the tabernacle
The bread on the table of the bread of the presence indicates that God's people should no longer live by themselves
They should not care about their good behavior, good conduct, and natural character, because God cares only for Christ
As we have pointed out in a previous message, the veil signifies our natural being constituted of our conduct, our view, and our virtue
Once the veil has been rent and we enter into the Holy of Holies to contact the ark, we experience Christ as our testimony
If He wants to move in a certain direction, there is no thoroughfare, no freeway, because the enemies seek to block the way
God must fight in order to destroy all His enemies This was the reason the children of Israel were told not to have mercy on the Canaanites
In particular, God's people need to pray for the formation of the army of the Lord, an army to fight for God's move on earth
In verse 12 the Lord told Moses to take a sum, a census, of the sons of Israel according to those who were numbered of them
We need to be impressed with the fact that when God's chosen people arrive at the incense altar, they intercede for God's move
The following message, a continuation of this one, will cover other important matters related to the propitiation silver
We have pointed out that, in order to understand the significance of the propitiation silver, we need to ask several important questions
Why did the children of Israel need the propitiation silver in chapter thirty since they had already been redeemed?
Why is the propitiation silver paid only for males twenty years of age and older and not for all the children of Israel?
We can understand why the propitiation silver is mentioned immediately after the description of the incense altar
According to the book of Numbers, the numbering of the males aged twenty and upward was for the formation of the army
In Exodus 30, immediately after the record concerning the incense altar, we have a word regarding the census and the propitiation silver
The ransom silver was related to redemption as it applied to those who were qualified to be formed into God's army
Suppose some of God's chosen people who were under the age of twenty wanted to put in the half-shekel of the ransom silver
More than two-thirds of God's people, all the females and the males under the age of twenty, could not be numbered in this military census
The spiritual significance of this is that if we would be in the army to fight for God's move, we need to mature
There is the urgent need for more of us to grow, reach maturity, and thereby become qualified to be formed into an army
The sisters should not be disappointed to hear that only the males among the Israelites could be formed into God's army
Because your spiritual age is at least twenty years, you are qualified to be numbered among those who are able to go to war
The propitiation silver is a heave offering, and the heave offering signifies the resurrected and ascended Christ, the Christ in the heavens
According to the type of the propitiation silver, the Christ by whom we fight is not the crucified One-He is the ascended One
From experience we know that whenever we go to war by ourselves and not by Christ as the ransom silver, we suffer a plague
At least some among us have had the experience of fighting the spiritual warfare not by themselves but by Christ as the ransom silver
The heave offering is an advancement beyond the wave offering; that is, the ascended Christ is an advancement over the resurrected Christ
If the Lord's recovery is to move on, a number of saints need to experience all the aspects of the outer court and the tabernacle
We may be so burdened to pray for the Lord's move that we shall not have the heart to pray for personal matters
Even if we outwardly have some prayer for personal matters or for our health, inwardly those things are not our real concern
As a result of the prayer at the incense altar, the Lord conducts a military census of the saints in the churches
These saints are one with this Christ and experience Him to such an extent that He becomes the sockets of the church in their locality
The propitiation silver provided the material for the sockets, the caps, the hooks, and the fillets of the pillars
Some teachers of the Bible misinterpret the significance of the propitiation silver and say that it is simply a type of Christ's redemption
Concerning the propitiation silver in Exodus 30, all those who were numbered were required to pay a half-shekel of silver
According to chapter thirty of Exodus, the half-shekel had to be paid by every male twenty years of age and older
Through the single matter of the half-shekel payment God did something for the building of the tabernacle and the formation of the army
The propitiation silver is related to Christ's redemption, but it is not a direct type of redemption, for in this type there is no blood
Rather, the Christ typified by the propitiation silver is the uplifted One, the ascended One, not the crucified One
Verse 16 says, 'It shall be a memorial for the sons of Israel before Jehovah to make propitiation for your souls'
We have emphasized the fact that the propitiation silver could be paid only by males twenty years of age and upward
If we do not grow up and reach the age of twenty, we shall not be qualified to be drafted into the army to fight for God's move on earth
In some countries the young people may be afraid of being drafted and wish that they could stay under draft age
In other words, the half-shekel of silver signifies the ascended Christ experienced by us and paid by us as the poll tax
When the gatherers of the poll tax came to Peter in Matthew 17, they asked Peter if his master paid the half-shekel
Of going to the Lord for the answer to the question concerning the half-shekel, Peter answered that his Teacher did pay the poll tax
Those who collected the poll tax wanted to know if the Lord Jesus paid the half-shekel according to what Moses said
If Peter had understood what he had heard on the mountain, he would have answered, 'No, it is not necessary for my Teacher to pay this tax'
Matthew 17:25 says, 'And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon?
The fact that the amount of the propitiation silver was a half-shekel indicates that God's requirement of us in this matter is not too high
The requirement of functioning in the meetings is likewise not very high; it is only a half-shekel from each one attending the meeting
Leading ones, be careful that the amount of the poll tax you pay in the meetings is not more than a half-shekel
Even though you have been enriched by God-thank Him for this-you need to be limited and not pay so much tax in the meetings
Those who say that they do not have a half-shekel should be encouraged to gain a half-shekel to pay in each meeting
The situation today is that certain rich ones may put in millions of shekels, whereas most of the Christians do not pay anything at all
You need to pay just a half-shekel, yet this half-shekel is a full payment and a complete unit, for it is ten gerahs and one bekah
A group of those who pay too much tax may function like a corporate pastor, and the rest of the attendants may be like laymen
For this reason, in verse 13 the shekel is called the shekel of the sanctuary, a shekel weighed according to God's holy standard
If we all pay the half-shekel in each meeting, how strong, living, rich, uplifted, excellent, and wonderful our meetings will be
By now we should be clear that the propitiation silver is for the building up of Gods dwelling place and also for the move of Gods testimony
Eventually, as we shall see later on, after God's dwelling place had been built, the propitiation silver served as the maintenance fee
With God's building, with His testimony, there are gold, silver and bronze; however, there is neither iron nor clay
In Exodus 30 first we have the incense altar overlaid with gold, then a heap of silver pieces, and then a laver made of bronze
What makes it possible for God's testimony, the ark, and also for the entire tabernacle, God's dwelling place, to move on earth?
The tabernacle is the central camp, and around the tabernacle the twelve tribes of Israel were formed as camps
All the males twenty years of age and upward were numbered and had to pay the half-shekel of the propitiation silver
The males aged twenty and upward paid the propitiation silver and were drafted to form the army to fight for God's move
Whoever was qualified and paid the half-shekel could be in the army to fight for the move of God's testimony on earth
These sacrifices included the burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, sin offering, and trespass offering
It was also necessary for the priests to come into the Holy Place to arrange the bread on the table and trim the lamps
Without the army, the tabernacle and everything related to it would be at a standstill; it would have no way to move
If the laver were removed from the outer court, everything else in the tabernacle and outer court would still be complete
The Bible, however, speaks of two kinds of defilement: the defilement that comes from sin and the defilement that comes by the earthly touch
We may be defiled in another way by means of the earthly touch, by having contact with the things of the world
Whenever we are defiled by the earthly touch, we need to be washed not by the blood, but by the water in the laver
If we pray or function without washing in the laver, we shall bring death to ourselves and also spread death to others
Even if we have God's dwelling place and all its furniture, we shall not have a way to put these things into operation
It is unfortunate for emphasis to be given to the altar the table the lampstand the ark and the incense altar but not so much to the laver
The bronze on the altar signifies judgment, but the bronze on the laver signifies the result, the issue, of God's judgment
After passing through God's full judgment and entering into resurrection, the crucified Christ became the life-giving Spirit who washes us
The bronze used to overlay the altar came from the censers of the two hundred fifty rebellious ones who were judged by God
The bronze on the laver came from the looking glasses of the women who assembled at the door of the tent of meeting
Whereas the bronze on the altar was a reminder of God's judgment, the bronze on the laver was a mirror to expose God's people
When they saw themselves in the mirror, they were convinced that they were dirty and they were willing to wash themselves
The bronze at the altar reminds us of God's judgment, and the bronze at the laver reminds us that we are dirty and need to wash
When we are at the laver, the bronze should remind us that whatever is sinful, earthly, and fleshly has been judged by God on the cross
Although we have confessed our sins, we still need to deal with defilement, with the dirt that comes from the earthly touch
On the one hand, this will lead us to experience Christ as our life supply and as the food that is offered to God
Each washing will be a reminder not to go to certain places, contact certain persons, or be involved in situations that will defile us
If we remain in a condition of defilement, we shall not be able to pray, serve the Lord, or function in the meetings
The laver was put between the tent of meeting and the altar to continue the work of the altar for the entrance into the tabernacle
As we have pointed out, this washing signifies the washing away of the defilement that comes from the earthly touch
The priests needed to wash in the laver when going into the tent of meeting or coming to the altar to minister
As the last part of verse 21 points out, this was to be an eternal statute, an eternal principle for all generations
Without the propitiation silver, there would not be a way to have God's dwelling place built up or a way for God's dwelling place to move
Now we can understand why the propitiation silver and the laver of bronze immediately follow the golden incense altar
If we understand the position of the ointment, then we shall know the relationship between it and the tabernacle
In the wilderness God's people tasted the heavenly food, the manna, and also drank living water out of the cleft rock
At Mount Sinai they received the revelation from God that He wanted them to build a tabernacle for Him to have a dwelling place on earth
Beginning with chapter twenty-five of Exodus, we have a detailed description of the tabernacle and all its furniture and utensils
In foregoing messages we have pointed out why the draft for the formation of God's army follows the description of the incense altar
Following the description of the laver, we have the record concerning the holy anointing oil, the compound ointment
In other words, there was the need for the tabernacle, the furniture, the utensils, and also the priests to be anointed with this oil
Coates speaks of the Spirit of the Man of Gods pleasure and also of the Spirit of another Maneven of the Man who is at Gods right hand
It certainly was good for the children of Israel to enjoy the Passover, the manna from heaven, and the water from the rock
A number of hymns have been written about manna, and some deeper Christians have written hymns on the living water
All this is blended to form the compound ointment, and this ointment is for the anointing of God's chosen and redeemed people
What is involved with God's anointing us is much more complicated than His creation of the heavens and the earth
After thirty-three and a half years, He died on the cross, He was buried in the tomb, and He took a tour of Hades
We all need to learn to partake of the anointing and to offer Christ to God at the incense altar as sweet incense for God's satisfaction
According to John 19, when Nicodemus and others were preparing to bury the body of the Lord Jesus, they used myrrh
The aromatic liquid of myrrh not only reduces pain, but also can be used for healing the body when it gives off the wrong kind of secretion
According to the sequence of the spices, this calamus signifies the rising up of the Lord Jesus from the place of death
The mingling of the spices with the oil can be compared to the mingling of fine flour and oil in the meal offering
Eventually, after the tabernacle was built up and the priests were made ready, there was not only the olive oil, but the compound ointment
Psalm 133:2 describes how the anointing oil flowed down from Aaron's head to his beard and then to the skirts of his garments
In 1 John 2:20 and 27 we are told that we have received an anointing and that this anointing teaches us all things
The five hundred shekels of myrrh is composed of one hundred times five, signifying one unit of full responsibility
According to 30:23, the measurement of the cinnamon was 'half as much, two hundred and fifty, and of fragrant calamus two hundred and fifty'
It is no accident that with the spices there are three complete units and that the middle unit is divided in half
Verse 30 says, 'And you shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and you shall sanctify them to serve as priests to Me'
Verse 29 says, 'And you shall sanctify them, and they shall be most holy; whatever touches them shall be holy'
Exodus 30:31 says, 'And you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil to Me throughout your generations'
The command not to pour the anointing oil upon the flesh of man indicates that the anointing is not to be applied to men of the old creation
You realize that you are being painted with the Spirit of Christ, for you are in the new creation, not in your old nature
When we act and behave according to our flesh, we are in the old creation and are regarded as strangers in the sight of God
Verse 33 goes on to say, 'Whoever compounds any like it, or who puts any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people'
The command not to make anything like the anointing oil in its proportions means that we should not imitate it
Because Christianity has been in existence for centuries a great many people including unbelievers have been influenced by Bible teachings
The children of Israel stayed at Mount Sinai to receive the law and the ordinances and then to receive the revelation of the tabernacle
Bible teachers have pointed out that the oil in Exodus 30, as elsewhere in the Old Testament, typifies the Spirit of God
Some have even taught that the oil poured by Jacob on the stone in Genesis 28 signifies the Spirit poured upon God's chosen people
Although these teachers of the Bible have seen the significance of the oil, they have not seen the significance of the ointment
He did not see that myrrh signifies the all-inclusive death of Christ and that cinnamon signifies the effectiveness of Christ's death
With the ingredients of the holy anointing oil and the measurements, we have symbols of the death and resurrection of Christ
As Andrew Murray makes clear in the fifth chapter of The Spirit of Christ, the term 'the Holy Spirit' is not used in the Old Testament
Although the Holy Spirit was present at the conception of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit was not yet until Christ was resurrected, glorified
No doubt, when John was writing these verses, he had in mind the picture of the holy anointing oil in Exodus 30
If we would have the anointing of the compound Spirit, we must have God's dwelling place and a corporate priesthood
After the Lord Jesus was born, the magi expressed their appreciation of Him by offering Him gold, frankincense, and myrrh
The aloes used with myrrh to anoint the body of the Lord Jesus for burial may also be regarded as a kind of spirit
When a plant, a grain, or some other substance is subjected to pressure, we can extract from it the spirit of that substance
We can apply this principle to the Lord's death and ask this question: What is the extract of the death of Christ?
In speaking concerning the subjective experience of the cross of Christ, Jessie Penn-Lewis emphasized the Spirit
With respect to the subjective experience of the cross, he did not emphasize the Spirit as much as Jessie Penn-Lewis did
The fact of our identification with Christ in His death is in Romans 6, but the experience of this is in Romans 8
The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit, the extract, of Christ's birth, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension
They claim that being seated with Christ in the heavenlies is a positional matter and that we should simply take the fact by faith
In the past centuries a number of saints experienced the Spirit, even though they had not been enlightened concerning the compound Spirit
When they prayed, they were stimulated by the Spirit and spontaneously experienced the element of the death of Christ included in the Spirit
Because they were in the Spirit, they experienced the extract of the death of Christ contained in the Spirit of Christ
There was no need for them to reckon themselves dead, and it was not necessary for them to take the position by faith
When we are in the Spirit experiencing the extract of Christ's death, our flesh, our temper, and our natural disposition are put to death
We even come to hate this natural goodness because we realize that it is something derived from our natural birth
After praying and contacting the Spirit, we realize that God does not want anything that has its source in our natural life
If we Christians live like this, we are making an imitation of the ointment, something that is strictly forbidden in Exodus 30
If we do not see the matter of the compound Spirit, in our daily living we may be the same as those who imitate the Spirit
In the West something very similar is practiced under the name of Christ and in the atmosphere of Bible teaching
The teachings of Confucius exert a moral influence in China and that the teachings of the Bible exert a moral influence on western culture
Artificial flowers may have the same color, shape, and appearance as real flowers, but they do not contain the element of life
Their humility, patience, and love outwardly may seem to be the same as the fruit of the Spirit described in Galatians 5
In their case also there is a kind of living that is artificial and lifeless, an imitation of the compound Spirit
In the Song of Songs certain spices have a spiritual significance either with respect to the Lord Himself or to the one seeking Him
As those who come to Him, we also are living stones, being built up a spiritual house and into a holy priesthood
Verse 30 says, 'And you shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and you shall sanctify them to serve as priests to Me'
These verses make it very clear that the compound ointment was strictly for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle and the priests
After the children of Israel came into the wilderness, they began to enjoy the manna and the living water out of the cleft rock
The children of Israel, therefore, enjoyed at least three things-the Passover, the manna, and the living water
It is important for us to realize that they had all this enjoyment before the tabernacle and the priesthood were revealed
Even without the tabernacle and the priesthood, they could have the enjoyment of the lamb, the manna, and the living water
If we are clear concerning the situation of the children of Israel, we shall be able to see where today's Christians stand
If in your enjoyment of Christ you are before the tabernacle and the priesthood, then you cannot have any share in the compound ointment
When asked whether your enjoyment of Christ is before or after the tabernacle and the priesthood, you may find it difficult to answer
It is extremely significant that in Exodus 30 we have a record of the divine revelation concerning this compound ointment
Although there are four kinds of spices, there are actually only three complete units of five-hundred shekels each
According to Exodus 26:3, five curtains were joined to one another, and the other five curtains were also to be joined to one another
As we have mentioned several times, in the Bible the number five, formed of four plus one, signifies responsibility
The numbers three and five together signify the Triune God in resurrection bearing responsibility for His people
Because they are in such a stupor, they are satisfied with their condition, even though that condition is far from satisfactory
In particular, we need to seek to touch the depths of the divine revelation concerning the compound ointment in Exodus 30
Some even related the compound ointment in Exodus 30 to John's word regarding the anointing in 1 John 2:20 and 27
Although they had some light, they did not say definitely and in detail why the Spirit of God needed to be compounded
After the revelation of the tabernacle and the priesthood, God gave a formula for the compounding of oil and spices to make an ointment
The New Testament is composed of the blood that sanctifies us and the Spirit of grace, the Spirit who supplies us with the Triune God
The Spirit of Jesus Christ has the bountiful supply of all the elements of humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
As we have pointed out in a foregoing message, the spirit of a certain substance is the extract of that substance
Whenever God came to contact people in the Old Testament, He was the Spirit of Jehovah with the element of the Trinity
Also, the angel of the Lord said to Joseph, 'Fear not to take Mary your wife, for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit'
The term 'the Spirit' is all-inclusive, for it includes all the elements of all the other titles of the Spirit
Whenever we come to the Bible, we must come with a sober mind, with a mind that has been unloaded and de-drugged
We need to have a spirit that is not filled, occupied, with anything, and we need to have a heart that is pure, seeking only the Lord
Hebrews 1029 illustrates the fact that every title of the Spirit is significant for each title points to a particular element of the Spirit
After the Lord's resurrection, His word concerning the Spirit as another Comforter, as the Spirit of reality, was fulfilled
The Lord went on to say that in that day we would know that He is in the Father, that we are in Him, and that He is in us
On the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples, breathed upon them, and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
The Spirit still is the Spirit of God , still the Spirit of Jehovah, the Spirit of the Lord , and still the Holy Spirit
If the Spirit did not contain the elements of incarnation, human living, and crucifixion, why would He be called the Spirit of Jesus?
Even though he was a prisoner, he could rejoice because he had the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
When all the aspects and elements of the Spirit are put together, we have a totality, an aggregate, known in the New Testament as the Spirit
According to John 7:38 and 39, the Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, will become rivers of living water flowing out of us
In 1 Peter 1:2 Peter speaks not of the sanctification of the Holy Spirit, but of the sanctification of the Spirit
In the book of Revelation John does not use the titles the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Lord, or the Holy Spirit
The Spirit is the Triune God after He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
Having passed through this process, the Triune God is now this consummate Spirit as the blessing of the New Testament
Now, as children of Abraham, we should follow his steps to enjoy the Spirit as the unique blessing of God's New Testament economy
Only those who are for the building of God and the priesthood of God can have the enjoyment of the compound, all-inclusive, processed Spirit
Peter 4:14 says, 'If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you'
The Spirit of Jehovah has the element of the divine Trinity, the element of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Many had been sanctified in the sense of being separated unto God, but none of these sanctified ones was made holy with God's nature
Now through the process of sanctification, we who believe in Christ are also being constituted of God's nature
It is the incarnation of the holy divine nature into our humanity so that we may become holy in nature, even as God Himself is holy
The aspects of the Spirit as the Spirit of God the Spirit of Jehovah and the Holy Spirit are all preliminary to Gods New Testament economy
Apart from the Spirit of reality, in our experience we could not have divinity, the Trinity, or the holy nature of God
The purpose of His going was for Him to have a change in form, a change from the form of the flesh to the form of the Spirit
When His family returned to the holy land after fleeing to Egypt, it was not possible for them to stay in Judea
The Spirit is also the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the Spirit of life, the life-giving Spirit, and the Lord Spirit
The Spirit of Jesus Christ includes incarnation, humanity, human living, suffering, crucifixion, and resurrection
As we have pointed out, the Spirit is a totality, an aggregate, of all the elements of all the titles of the Spirit
Long before the incarnation, even from the foundation of the world, the fact of the crucifixion of Christ existed in the sight of God
Peter's brief writing concerning the Spirit indicates that the sanctifying Spirit is the Spirit of Christ who indwells us
To the suffering saints, the Spirit was not only in them as the indwelling of the divine element, but the Spirit was also upon them as glory
The Spirit of glory is the indwelling Spirit, the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of grace, becoming the glory shining upon the believers
The late Premier of China, Chou En-Lai, instructed that his body be cremated and that his ashes be scattered from an airplane
After a person is regenerated, he has three lives: a bios life, a psuche life, and a regenerated spirit with the divine life
Of trying to systematize the revelation concerning the Triune God, we should simply believe whatever the Bible says concerning the Trinity
John's Gospel and Epistles were written at a time when different heresies concerning the Person of Christ were creeping in
According to one of these heresies, it was claimed that Christ was divine, but it was denied that He was human
According to another heretical teaching, Christ was human, not divine; it was claimed that He was a man, but not God
Throughout the centuries, a number of great teachers have used the term 'God-man' to express the fact that Christ is God and man
In the same principle, to the basic element of olive oil the four spices were added to produce a compounded ointment
If we understand the ingredients of this Spirit, we shall be able to understand the function of the compound Spirit
The first element is the only God, the unique God, signified both by the olive oil itself and also by the quantity of olive oil, a hin
One hin of olive oil as the base of the compounded ointment signifies the unique God as the base of the compound Spirit
In the New Testament God is no longer merely God with the single element of divinity, for He has been mingled with other elements
Of these five elements, one-the oil-is the base, and the others-the four spices-are the ingredients for compounding
After passing through this process of blending, compounding, the Spirit of God is no longer simply the Spirit with one element
The second unit of five hundred shekels is split in half: two hundred fifty shekels of cinnamon and two hundred fifty shekels of calamus
We are told in Genesis 1:26 that when God was about to create man, He said to Himself, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness'
The Lord seemed to be telling Philip, 'You have been seeing Me all these years, and still you ask Me to show you the Father?
The answer to this question is the Lord's word concerning the Spirit of reality abiding in the disciples, not only among them
The Lord seemed to be saying here, 'The Spirit of reality will come not only to be among you, but also to be in you
The disciples heard the words recorded in John 14 several weeks before they were given the charge in Matthew 28:19
In that verse the Lord told the disciples to baptize the nations into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
We can see from John 14 and Matthew 28 that before the ascension of the Lord, the Trinity was fully revealed to the disciples
The disciples were commanded to baptize the believers into the name, not the names, of the Father, Son, and Spirit
The first unit signifies the Father; the second the Son, who was cut, was put to death, on the cross; and the third, the Spirit
Paul's statement reveals that even after His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, the Lord Jesus is still a man
Many Christians have the concept that Christ was a man only from the time of His incarnation until the time of His burial
In heaven Jesus sitting, Christ the Lord is there enthroned; As the man by God exalted, With God's glory He is crowned
A man is now in heaven As the Lord of all enthroned; This is Jesus Christ our Savior, With God's glory ever crowned!
For this reason, Paul tells us in 1 Timothy 2:5 that there is one Mediator between God and men, the Man, Christ Jesus
If someone is suffering from a disease caused by certain bacteria or germs, he may take a certain medicine to kill those germs
The death of Christ spoken of in Romans 6 has become an ingredient of the indwelling Spirit spoken of in Romans 8
The medicine of the Spirit thus contains the effectiveness of Christs death as the element to kill the germs the harmful bacteria within us
As soon as he opens his mouth to quarrel with her, he will experience the element of Christ's death operating within him
Sometimes she may leave the store without buying anything, because she paid attention to the Spirit within her
Many of us can testify that whenever we have this kind of experience, we feel that we are with the Lord in the heavens
We have seen that the olive oil signifies the unique God, and that the four spices signify man as the leading one in God's creation
Do not listen to those who say that there is not such a thing in the Bible as the mingling of divinity with humanity
Verses 14 and 15 say that the hangings on either side of the gate were to be fifteen cubits with three pillars and three sockets
If we believe that everything in the Bible has a significance, then we should believe that the numbers three and five signify something
According to typology, the tabernacle with its furniture and the priests were anointed with the compound ointment
We may use as an illustration painting a wall with oil-based paint, a paint that includes oil as the base along with other ingredients
The anointing of the compound Spirit inoculates the believers against the heretical teachings concerning the Person of Christ
Before John speaks of the anointing in 1 John 2:20, he speaks of the antichrists in verse 18 and refers to them again in verse 19
According to the full context of this Epistle, the anointing functions to inoculate the believers against heretical teachings
In the next message we shall consider in more detail the anointing of the compound Spirit as seen in 1 John 2:18-27
In the previous two messages we have considered the ingredients of the compound Spirit and the anointing of the compound Spirit
The anointing of the compound Spirit is also to inoculate the believers against the heretical teachings concerning the Person of Christ
We shall consider this portion, of course, in the light of the type of the compounded ointment in Exodus 30:23-30
As a result of their attempt to separate the Father from the Son, and the Son from the Spirit, they have three Gods
That attempt results in the heresy of tritheism, the belief that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three Gods
In verse 23 John goes on to say, 'Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also'
Antichrist and the false prophets teach that Christ is separatefrom Jesus and that the Son is separate from the Father
In chapter thirty of Exodus we see that the anointing of the tabernacle and the priesthood was the function of the compounded ointment
We do not need anyone to tell us that the Father is separate from the Son, or that the Father is one with the Son
If we consider the context, we shall see that the word 'teach' is related to Jesus Christ and to the Father and the Son
We should not listen to nonsensical heresies that say that Jesus is not the Christ or that the Father and the Son are not one
We should not pay attention to those who separate Christ from the Father or who deny that Christ is the Spirit
John 4:2 says, 'In this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is out of God'
In verse 3 John goes on to say, 'And every spirit which does not confess Jesus, is not out of God; and this is the spirit of the antichrist
If the Lord had never come in the flesh as a creature, how could He have had the blood to shed on the cross for our sins?
For this reason, we say that regarding His humanity, including all the elements of His physical body, the Lord Jesus is a creature
If this preacher actually believes this way, he should be categorized with those in 1 John 4 who deny that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
Arius asserted that Christ was created by God, but was created before the ages, preceding all other created things
The Bible reveals that Christ is the very God who exists from the beginning and who is self-existent and without beginning
According to the complete revelation of the Bible, Christ is both the Creator and the creature, because he is God and He is man
Oh, may the Lord open our eyes to see that the Christian life is not a matter of teaching, improvement, adjustment, or correction!
We should live the Christian life according to the teaching of this compound anointing, not according to anything else
Of the teaching of the anointing, Christians have theology, regulations, organization, and teachings related to improvement of character
Why does it speak both of the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ and of the one who denies the Father and the Son?
At the time of the apostle John certain heretical teachings tried to separate Jesus from Christ, and Christ from the Father
All genuine Christians would agree that Jesus is the Christ that Christ is the Son of God that the Son of God is God and that God is triune
We need to see that Jesus, Christ, the Son of God, God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all one all-inclusive Person
Some admit that Christ is the Creator, but they deny strongly that He is also a creature with respect to His humanity
According to John 14:17, the Spirit of reality will not only be among the disciples, but will also be within them
The Lord's words in John 14 indicate that the Three of the Godhead-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-are one
All these ingredients have been compounded to produce the compound Spirit, the anointing in 1 John 2:20 and 27
As he was innoculating the believers against heresy, John used a metaphor-the metaphor of the compound ointment in Exodus 30
The Father includes the source of life; the Son, the expression of life; and the Spirit, the imparting, or giving, of life
In chapter two of 1 John we see the elements of the compound Spirit: Jesus, Christ, the Son, the Father, and the eternal life
Toward the end of the section concerned with the revelation of the tabernacle two things are described: the anointing oil and the incense
We have seen that this oil is a fine and all-inclusive type of Christ being the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
Eventually, this coming One passed through death and resurrection and has become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
Without adequate spiritual experience, we shall not be able to understand the type of the incense or interpret it
We have seen that with the tabernacle there were two altars: the bronze altar in the outer court and the golden altar in the Holy Place
Of course, with the burning of the offerings on the bronze altar in the outer court something did ascend to God
We have a short hymn in our hymnal that speaks of the two-way traffic between God and us and between us and God
Perhaps you have never imagined that our going to God is our prayer and that this prayer should be Christ Himself
In one of the messages on the golden incense altar we pointed out that the incense altar is the administrative center of God's plan
The prayer that ascends to Him as a sweet-smelling fragrance is God's administration and carries out God's plan
At that point the priests had two needs-they needed the blood to cleanse them, and they needed food to nourish them
There is one kind of eating at the bronze altar, and there is a continuation of our eating at the showbread table
There at the ark we contact God, and God's presence leads us to the golden altar of incense, the place of prayer
If you have had even some amount of experience, you will understand my word and feel very good about it, knowing that it is true
Have you ever paid careful attention to these two pictures in Exodus 30, the one of the ointment and the other of the incense?
Exodus 30:38 speaks clearly concerning this: 'Whoever makes any like it, to smell it, he shall be cut off from his people'
We have emphasized the fact that with the ointment the priests and all the parts of the tabernacle were anointed
In the foregoing message we saw the two-way traffic between God and us portrayed by the ointment and the incense
The middle unit, formed of cinnamon and calamus, was divided into two parts, each measuring two hundred fifty shekels
According to the numbers and items of the ingredients, there are three in one, that is, three kinds of spices with pure frankincense
Three is the number of the Triune God, and four, the number of the creature, the human being, used in a positive sense
Here we have God mingled with man, God compounded with man, divinity mingled and compounded with humanity, to produce the incense
According to John 12:24, Christ is the grain of wheat that falls into the ground, dies, and produces many other grains
The animal life, however, is for redemption, for it is a life that can be slain and from which blood may be shed
In John 1:29 we see the redeeming life of Christ: 'Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world'!
The onycha, therefore, the second of the spices, surely signifies the second of the Trinity, the One who was crucified for our redemption
With the incense the three spices signify Christ's death for generating and redeeming, and the frankincense signifies His resurrection
The incense is nothing less than Christ Himself with all the process through which He has passed and with all He has accomplished
With the incense four elements, the three spices and the frankincense, are tempered with salt to give the number five
You may still pray if you have bias in your spirit, but deep within you may realize that this is not the kind of prayer the Lord desires
From their experience they know that prayer which issues from impure motives or from bias in our spirit is offensive to the Lord
The prayer of some can be likened to the eruption of a volcano: it bursts forth with the release of many unclean things
In the first message on the incense we considered the two-way traffic between God and us and between us and God
The Lord had to go away; that is, He had to pass through death to open the way for God to come into fallen man
In order for us to be redeemed, there was the need for the second of the Godhead, signified by onycha, to be slain on our behalf
The Lord Jesus became a little 'animal' living in the marshes of this corrupted world for thirty-three and a half years
On the one hand, He Himself lived a life absolutely for God; on the other hand, He wept for those who did not care for God
When galbanum is added to these spices, the offensive odor of the galbanum strengthens the sweet fragrance of the myrrh and the onycha
The galbanum not only strengthens the fragrance of the other spices; it also causes the incense to retain its fragrance
In a sense, Christ's death is not pleasant, but it truly strengthens and preserves the other elements, and it expels the serpent
By this we see that Christs death has three functions to redeem fallen sinners to produce sons of God and to expel the old serpent the Devil
In the prescription for the ointment recorded in Exodus 30, definite quantities are designated for each ingredient
For this reason, in Ephesians 3:18 Paul tells us that Christ is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth
The unlimitedness of Christ is indicated by the fact that no measurements are given for the stacte, onycha, galbanum, and frankincense
Verse 35 says, 'And you shall make of it incense, an ointment, the work of a perfumer, salted, pure, and holy'
In order for our experiences of Christ to become a sweet fragrance to God, these experiences must be seasoned, ground, and eventually burned
Only when our experience of Christ has been salted ground and burned shall we have the incense to offer to God as a sweetsmelling fragrance
In these three messages on the incense we have covered a number of deep matters related to spiritual experience
The record of the building up of Gods dwelling place in Exodus is in three sections the first 31111 the second 351019 and the third 3530362
The shadow of God will keep these things away from us and cause us to remain in a peaceful situation and condition to do the building work
Regarding the building up of God's dwelling place, there is a real conflict, a severe fighting between God and His enemy
Especially the elders must realize that in order to build up a local church we need to be under the shadow of our God
According to verse 3, this filling up with the Spirit of God involves four matters: wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and workmanship
We may also take the matter of listening to messages as an illustration of the difference between knowledge and understanding
In listening to a message we first may have the knowledge of the verses and then an understanding of what the verses mean
As a minister of the Word continues to open the Word to you, you eventually begin to see what is revealed in the verses being considered
When Moses was with the Lord on the mountain, God showed him the design of the tabernacle and all the furniture and utensils
If a history examination is based on the material in the textbook these students will receive an excellent grade because they have knowledge
Should the professor ask them other kinds of questions, questions that go beyond the textbook, these students may not know how to answer
They may know the material in the textbook, but they do not understand how to put all this material together to present a certain view
In order to answer such a question, not even understanding would be sufficient; it would be necessary to have wisdom
Perhaps through these illustrations you can get some idea of the difference between knowledge, understanding, and wisdom
If those who made the tabernacle did not have wisdom, they would have wasted a great deal of time before they found the right way
When he comes to a crossroad, especially a crossroad where three highways come together, he may be confused and not know which way to go
When some hear this, they may wonder how it is possible for elders in the Lord's recovery to be lacking in knowledge
We may use family life as a further illustration of the difference between knowledge, understanding, and wisdom
We all may be wise-hearted and have a part in building the most noble structure in the entire universe-God's dwelling place
Of viewing the matter in this way, we all need to realize that the noble work of building up the church is for every one of us
In the foregoing message we began to consider the workers of the tabernacle, the furniture, and the priestly garment
We emphasized the fact that the building up of God's dwelling place, the church, is a noble work to be done by all the saints
In this message we shall go on to consider more details related to the workers of the tabernacle, the furniture, and the priestly garment
To cut stones for setting is to help the saints to be transformed into stones and to be adjusted to fit into God's building
We all need to learn to fellowship, in the meetings, and in spiritual contact with the saints to cut stones for setting and to carve wood
The brothers and sisters in the churches should not place the burden of the building up of the church only on the shoulders of the elders
The reason the church in your locality is not built up is that many of the saints are not doing their share of the building work
For years it has been my practice to encourage the saints to take responsibility to do what needs to be done in the church life
No matter whether you are high or low, as long as you are one of God's children, you must be included in the work of building
Verse 10 says And the finely woven garments both the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to serve as priests
For a time it is possible for the truth to be veiled but eventually, the veil will be removed, and the truth will be discovered
Be assured that all our writings concerning the Spirit are done carefully and with consideration according to the pure Word of God
We also need to learn how to work in gold, silver, and bronze, in cutting stones for setting, and in the carving of wood
In 311217 after a long record concerning the building up of Gods dwelling place there is a repetition of the commandment to keep the Sabbath
We need to find out why this particular commandment is repeated after the record concerning the full revelation of God's dwelling place
In this section we see the design of the tabernacle and its furniture and a full revelation regarding the priesthood
If we only know how to work for the Lord but do not know how to rest with Him, we are acting contrary to the divine principle
In six days God created the heavens, the earth, and everything necessary for man to exist for the fulfillment of God's purpose
As soon as man came forth from the creating hand of God, his first day, which was God's seventh day, was about to begin
The significance of this is that to God the Sabbath was rest after work, but to man it was rest first and then work
Perhaps you have read Exodus 31 a number of times without ever being impressed by the fact that God needs to be refreshed
Sisters who make their own clothing may enjoy a good rest after they have finished making a particular garment
He could look upon His handiwork, at the heavens, the earth, and all the living things, especially at man, and say, 'Very good'!
If we do not know how to have enjoyment with God and how to enjoy God Himself, we shall not know how to work with Him
If we do not know how to enjoy God and be filled with God, we shall not know how to work with Him, how to be one with Him in His work
When Peter stood up with the apostles to preach the gospel and thereby do a work for God, they all were one with God in His work
According to the principle in the Old Testament, man's day of rest is a day that comes after God's work has been completed
God had already created the expanse, the atmosphere, on the second day because He knew that without air man would not be able to live
He had enjoyment with God, he lived with God, he walked with God, and eventually he was ready to work with God
Perhaps after enjoying rest with God on his first day, Adam worked to care for the garden for another six days
You should not think that because you are working to build My dwelling place, you can work every day continually
If you try to do a good work for Me by yourselves, leaving Me aside, that would be an insult to Me, for that is a sign of the Devil's people
The sign is that we rest with God, enjoy God, and are filled up with God first, and then we work with the very One who fills us
After six days' work, man again first enjoyed what God had accomplished, and then he worked again the following six days
A covenant is stronger than an agreement, an agreement is stronger than a promise, and a promise is stronger than ordinary words
Once we sign such a contract with God and give God the assurance that we intend to keep it, we should not break the contract
If we break our agreement with God, He may take us to the heavenly court and blame us for not keeping our contract
On the day of Pentecost Peter was not only trusting in the Lord; he was filled with the Lord, even drinking Him
If He were supplying Peter everything he needed, and Peter turned aside from the Lord, Peter would have broken the contract
When we enjoy the Lord and then work with Him, for Him, and by being one with Him, spontaneously we are sanctified
In the church life we may do many things without first enjoying the Lord, and without serving with the Lord and by being one with the Lord
Any service to the church that is without the enjoyment of the Lord and that is without the oneness with Him brings in spiritual death
If we do not come to the altar of burnt offering to experience Christ as the offerings, we shall not have rest
In the same principle, if we do not come to the ark within the veil and to the incense altar, we shall not have rest
Everything related to God's dwelling place leads us to one matter-to the Sabbath with its rest and refreshment of the Lord
In the past we have pointed out that in studying the Bible, a basic need is to touch the spirit of the writer expressed in his writing
After the decree of the law and before the breaking of it, God called Moses to His mount to give him the tablets of the law
Before giving Moses these tablets, God first gave him the design of the tabernacle and instructions concerning the priesthood
While God was giving the law, He knew that man would not be able to keep it; therefore, He prepared this way of grace
It was not God's intention, therefore, to trust in the law; His trust was in Christ as the prepared way of grace
It may have been made during the last two or three days, when the people could no longer bear to wait for Moses to come back
The first three commandments are related to not having any other god, not making images, and not using the Lord's name in vain
The fourth commandment concerns the Sabbath, and the last six commandments involve our relationships with others
If we have God and allow no idols to replace Him, the very God whom we enjoy will become to us the ability to keep His commandments
We are able to fulfill this charge because, according to the New Testament, we have the Lord within us as our enjoyment
As we have pointed out, if we have God and do not allow idols to replace Him, the God we have and enjoy will be the strength to keep the law
If we have God in us as our enjoyment we would never have another god we would never make an image and we would not take Gods name in vain
Eventually, the disciples, including Peter, John, and James, were filled with the Lord Jesus, and He became their enjoyment
Another principle implied in this portion of Exodus concerns what an idol is, or what is the principle of an idol
In Exodus 32 the gold rings were taken from the ears of the wives, the sons, and the daughters and used to make the idol, the golden calf
The wives, the sons, and the daughters of the children of Israel wore gold rings in their ears for the purpose of self-beautification
Before the people had the idol of the golden calf, they already had the preliminary idols hanging from their ears
People in undeveloped countries do not have as much self-beautification, although they may have in their temples idols of wood or stone
Another principle related to idolatry is that idolatry is Satan's usurping of what God has given us in order to make it a waste
Before the children of Israel left Egypt, God caused the Egyptians to give the children of Israel gold and other precious things
Before this gold was used for the building up of God's dwelling place, Satan came in to usurp the gold and use it to make an idol
If the children of Israel had loved the Lord to the uttermost, they would never have wasted the gold by using it for earrings
In chapter thirty-five the people were commanded to offer gold and other materials for the building up of God's tabernacle
Before we use these things to worship and glorify God, the enemy tries to come in to usurp what God has given us and to waste it
Another principle is implied by the fact that the people did not make an image of Moses, or one of a horse or other work animal
According to verse 18, Moses heard the sound of singing, and according to verse 19, he 'saw the calf and the dancing'
The picture here indicates that the calf signifies enjoyment and that the children of Israel were worshipping what they enjoyed
Verse 5 says that when Aaron saw this, 'he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation and said, A feast to Jehovah-tomorrow'!
Exodus 32:4 says that Aaron took the gold and 'fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it into a molten calf'
Whereas others are not able to make idols because they do not have the skill, these ones have the ability to fashion gold into idols
If you were to argue with one of today's Aarons concerning this matter, he would probably say, 'We are not worshipping an idol
At least two million people had been rescued out of the hand of Pharaoh and brought out of the land of tyranny
Even in the days when they were making the idol and worshipping it, they still gathered the manna that came down from the heavens
They made an idol and worshipped it as the very God who had brought them out of Egypt and led them to Mount Sinai
What was revealed to Moses concerning the tabernacle was a type of today's revelation concerning God's dwelling place
The priesthood revealed to Moses was a type of the New Testament priesthood revealed through the Lord Jesus in the heavens
Moses received a revelation concerning the tabernacle for God's dwelling place and the priesthood for God's service
After the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens, He gave the revelation concerning the dwelling place of God and God's priesthood
As we read the New Testament Epistles, we can see the pattern and design of God's dwelling place and His priesthood
It was an idol that was worshipped, but it was worshipped in the way that God's people were supposed to worship God
If we have a clear, heavenly view, we shall realize that much of the worship among Christians today is a mixture
After Aaron made the golden calf, the people said, 'This is your God, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt'
32:5 and 6 say, 'And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation and said, A feast to Jehovah- tomorrow!
We see that an altar was built before the idol, and the people offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings
The worship of the golden calf by the children of Israel is a picture of the impure worship among Christians today
After the golden calf was made, the people declared that it was the Lord who had brought them out of the land of Egypt
Do you have the assurance that the so-called worship services that take place in today's cathedrals and chapels are a pure worship of God?
Holy songs may be sung to God and prayers may be offered to God, but actually the worship is to someone or something other than God
Do you use that gift properly for God's purpose, or do you use it to build up something other than God's purpose?
If you study the history of the church and the biographies of different preachers and evangelists, you will see that many have built idols
After a period of time some brothers, unhappy with the situation in that group, decide to start another meeting in the same locality
We may worship something other than God with offerings that should be offered to God and in the way in which we should worship God
God's intention was that the gold given to the children of Israel would be used for the building up of His tabernacle
We see the principle that idolatry involves abusing what God has given us and not using His gifts for His purpose
When Moses and Joshua came down from the mountain, they heard the sound of singing, and they 'saw the calf and the dancing'
Spiritual gifts, such as the gifts of teaching and preaching, should not be abused or usurped for our amusement and entertainment
If we truly see this principle, we shall realize how pitiful and even tragic is the situation among Christians today
Again and again, golden calves have been fashioned, and the result of the worship of these golden calves has been division
Exodus 32:21 says, 'And Moses said to Aaron, What has this people done to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them'?
The claim may be made that certain things are done by God when they are actually accomplished by human effort, promotion, and advertisement
Moses was not the first to know that the children of Israel were practicing idolatry at the foot of the mountain
According to verse 9, the Lord also said to Moses, 'I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people'
The Lord was saying that the people were hopeless, that He would consume them, and that He would make of Moses a great nation
In verse 7 the Lord said to Moses that the people were his people and that he had brought them out of the land of Egypt
It was necessary for the Lord to take care of His name and not to allow Himself to be slandered by the Egyptians
After saying this, Moses urged the Lord to repent, and then he reminded Him of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Israel
He stood upon God's faithful word, the unchanging promise, that He had given to Moses' forefathers as a covenant
Verse 14 indicates that Moses' appeal was effective: 'And Jehovah repented concerning the evil which He spoke of doing to His people'
Once we heard words of anger spoken by the Lord, we might have run down to the bottom of the mountain to deal with the idolatrous people
Seeing that the people were broken loose 'Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, Whoever is for Jehovah, come to me!
Verse 28 says, 'And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people on that day about three thousand men'
As a result, the sons of Levi were separated from their brethren to replace the nation of Israel for God's priesthood
In other words, the Levites denied even their closest relationships with those who were worshippers of the golden calf
According to Exodus 19, God intended that the entire nation of Israel would be a priestly nation, a kingdom of priests
The killing of the idol worshippers separated the Levites from their brethren and qualified them to have the priesthood of God
Through the centuries impure worship, the worship of the golden calf, has disqualified a great many Christians from serving God as priests
We have suffered persecution, opposition, slander, and libel because we are not willing to lose our priesthood
The crucial point here is that we need to be pure, and we need to kill the impure worship, the worship of the golden calf
The recovery depends on a group of Levites who are faithful to God and who do not lose the qualifications to be God's priests
In this message we come to the record of a very particular matter, a record that reveals that Moses was a companion of God
Moses was on the mountaintop with the Lord, and the Lord was revealing to him the design of the tabernacle and its furniture and utensils
At the end of the forty days Moses spent on the mountain with God the children of Israel did evil in making a golden calf and worshipping it
God brought the people out of Egypt, led them through the wilderness, and brought them to Mount Sinai, where He gave them training
In principle, we may have the assurance that God would not give up His people or abandon His project with them
The problem God faced with His people can be compared to certain problems between husband and wife or between parents and children
As we shall see, the way Moses expressed his petition to God indicates that his relationship with God was an intimate one
It seemed that there was no possibility for God to come in to forgive this offense or to say anything to the people
Moses was raised up by God during the first forty years of his life, and he was trained by Him during the next forty years
The children of Israel may have tried to excuse themselves for making the golden calf by the fact that Moses was gone so long
If Aaron and the children of Israel had been allowed to excuse themselves, they probably would have blamed Moses for being gone too long
In 32:30 Moses seemed to be saying to the children of Israel, 'You have committed such a great sin that it seems you cannot be forgiven
During the forty days he was with God, Moses gained a thorough knowledge of God's heart concerning the children of Israel
Moses knew that not even the people's sin of worshipping the golden calf could change the desire of God's heart
Although this offense created an extremely difficult problem, Moses had the assurance that God could be propitiated
It is not sufficient merely for us to know the Word concerning the economy of God and the ground of the church
If you know the Word concerning God's economy and the church, you may be only a man of the Word, but not a man according to God's heart
The sin committed by the children of Israel in worshipping the golden calf caused a problem not only to God, but also to Moses
We are not told however that Moses considered the situation for a long period of time or that he fasted and prayed to seek the Lords leading
The word 'companion' includes the elements of friendship, but it goes much further to include the thought of intimate association
Because God regarded Abraham as His friend, He knew that He could not conceal from him what He was about to do
In keeping with His principle, God knew that He could not do anything for Lot without someone to intercede for him
Because Moses knew what was on God's heart, everything he did concerning the worship of the golden calf was pleasing to God
In the foregoing message we saw that Moses was not only a friend of God, but also a companion, an associate, of God
If the elders only have to be involved with positive brothers and sisters, what the elders are would not be manifest
The evil situation among the children of Israel provided an opportunity for Moses to be manifested as a companion of God
He did not tell God that he ground the calf into powder, scattered the powder on the water, and forced the people to drink the water
If we had been Moses, we may have said something like this: 'Now, if You will forgive their sin, everything will be all right'
The latter part of Moses' word in verse 32 makes it clear that he was propitiating for the people at the risk of his spiritual destiny
He did not pray in an ordinary way for the children of Israel; instead, he conversed with God intimately in their behalf
The Lord promised Moses that His angel would go before him, and in the day of His visitation He would visit the people's sin upon them
God, the first party, agreed to let the offenders go, but He still insisted that He would deal with the people at a later time
Jacob said to his household and everyone with him, 'Put away the strange gods which are among you, and be clean, and change your garments'
We are told that 'they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods that were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears'
As we mentioned in a previous message, the ornaments worn by the children of Israel were for their self-beautification
The people should have put on sackcloth and ashes as a sign of true repentance, repentance from a broken heart
In chapters thirty-two and thirty-three we see the result of Moses' work as a mediator between God and the children of Israel
Exodus 337 says Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp far off from the camp and he called it the tent of meeting
It came about that everyone who sought Jehovah would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp'
All the children of Israel who wanted to seek the Lord went out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp
Moses an experienced person knew that God according to His holiness would no longer stay among the people for the camp had become idolatrous
We need to ask ourselves if we are still in the 'camp,' or if we have gone forth unto the Lord outside the camp
In 33:12-17 we see that Moses bargained with God for His presence to go with the people He had set apart as the way for them to take
If we read this portion of chapter thirty-three carefully, we shall see that God's glory is His presence, and His presence is His way
According to 33:21-23 the Lord said to Moses, 'Behold, there is a place with Me, and you shall stand upon the rock
We have the problem of God's angel and His presence going with the people, yet God still said that He Himself would not go with them
In these verses we see that God's face is His glory, that His glory is His presence, and that His presence is His face
After Moses pitched his tent outside the camp, God's glory was at the door of the tent, but it was not within the camp
From 32:30-33:23 we learn the serious lesson that we need to know God's heart and also be a person according to God's heart
Only this kind of person can share a common interest with God and be used by God to carry out His enterprise on earth
We may understand these divine, spiritual, and mysterious things by the types, figures, and shadows in the Old Testament
We have seen that if it had not been for Moses as God's companion, everything would have ended there with the breaking of the covenant
Moses knew that this purposeful God had a very strong intention, and that no one could stop Him from doing what He intended to do
Because it was necessary for God to keep His standing, His position, He needed a companion to be the mediator between Him and His people
Now in order to recover the situation between God and His people, it certainly was necessary for the broken covenant to be recovered
According to verse 4, 'Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him'
If we read chapter thirtyfour carefully we shall see that God did not tell Moses explicitly to meet with Him in the morning of the next day
Proverbs 4:18 says, 'The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day'
When Moses went up the mountain to meet with the Lord, he was not to bring with him anyone or anything except the tablets of stone
When it is time to meet with the Lord on the mountaintop, a brother should leave his wife at the foot of the mountain
Only toward the end of His long conversation with Moses did God write upon the tablets 'the words of the covenant, the ten words'
In these verses we have a lengthy record of God's conversation with Moses, a conversation that covered many points
Moses, of course, may have been frightened at that time, and he did not presume to say anything about what the Lord was doing
As long as God could have the temple as His testimony on earth, the situation with His people would be all right
In typology this indicates that God is doing marvelous things for us and with us with the intention of bringing us into Christ
According to the record in the Old Testament, it was not an easy matter for the children of Israel to enter the good land
Outwardly they were frustrated by circumstances and by the enemy; inwardly they were frustrated by certain things within themselves
God's marvelous doings are for the one goal of bringing His people into the good land for the building up of the temple
If we have idols, things that preoccupy us and keep us from enjoying Christ, we have already lost the battle against the enemy
The experience of Christians testifies that much of what God has done has been nullified or destroyed by preoccupations, by idolatry
Others may be able to spend much time reading a newspaper, but they easily become tired when reading the Bible
On the positive side, these commandments are related to God; on the negative side, they are related to idolatry
In verses 21 and 22 He goes on to speak of keeping the Sabbath and observing the feast of weeks and the feast of ingathering
The keeping of the commandments must be secondary; it must be the issue of feasting with the Lord and resting with Him
If we feast with the Lord every day and rest with Him during the day, everything will be all right in our daily living
The feast of unleavened bread was held immediately after the feast of Passover in the month of Abib, at the beginning of the year
We may say that the first day was the feast of Passover and the following days were the feast of unleavened bread
For us today to keep the feast of unleavened bread means that we live a clean life, a life without sin, without leaven
Toward the end of the year, at the feast of ingathering, God's people had the full enjoyment of the produce of the good land
The feasts that were observed in the intervals were not as crucial as far as the enjoyment of the good land was concerned
The important point here is that the record in Exodus 34 indicates that God wanted His people to have the full enjoyment of the good land
If we deduct eight hours spent in sleeping, this would allow us to rest with the Lord at least forty-eight times during the day
On the day of Pentecost , fifty days after the resurrection of Christ, there was the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
Regarding the types of the feasts and their fulfillment, we see that the New Testament and the Old Testament correspond to each other
We need to clear all the leaven, all the sinful things, out of our daily life so that we may have the enjoyment of Christ
If we have the feast of unleavened bread, we shall also have the feast of Pentecost for the enjoyment of Christ
Let us now go on to consider 34:23 and 24: 'Three times in the year every male shall appear before the Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel
If you go up to feast with Me three times a year, this feasting will keep away the covetous enemy from your land'
Because of our lack of understanding, we may still expect the enemies to be kept away from us even when we do not enjoy the Lord
The Lord has promised to dispossess the nations, enlarge the borders of the good land, and keep away the coveting enemies from the good land
He will demolish all our preoccupations and usurpations, enlarge the borders of Christ, and guard the enjoyment of Christ
In this message we shall go on to consider the five conditions that must be fulfilled in order for us to feast with the Lord
For more regarding the firstling of a donkey being redeemed with a lamb, see Life-study of Exodus, Message 27, pages 305-307
Having our natural life replaced with Christ is a condition both of feasting with the Lord and resting with Him
It is not hard for us to realize that if we still live in sin, yet claim that we have been redeemed, we shall not be able to enjoy Christ
We still must fulfill the condition of clearing away all leaven, the requirement of not mixing Christ's redemption with a sinful life
What is the significance of not allowing the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover to remain until the morning?
We should not leave anything for the next 'morning'; that is, we should not postpone the enjoyment of Christ until the coming age
Exodus 34:26a says, 'You shall bring the first of the firstfruits of your ground to the house of Jehovah your God'
We should not share these experiences of Christ with anyone until we bring them to the church meetings for God's satisfaction
Those who have adequate experience know what it means to bring the topmost experience of Christ to the church meetings for Gods satisfaction
Now we come to the last condition, a condition that may seem very strange: 'You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk'
If we enjoy Christ daily and rest with Him hourly, we shall live Christ, and Christ's life surpasses the highest standard of morality
If we have the proper spiritual experience, we shall realize that these five conditions are crucial to our daily enjoyment of Christ
If we remain unclean beasts under a heavy burden, we cannot have the enjoyment of Christ as the feasts, and we cannot rest with Him
According to the sequence, the next condition is that, as redeemed ones, we should not mix the redeeming blood with a sinful life
The third condition is that we enjoy our present portion of Christ to the uttermost and not leave any part of it for the next age
As an illustration of the third condition, we may speak of a mother who tells her little child to finish his food, to clean his plate
They may give a child something to eat, and if he does not like it, they will offer him something else instead
The last condition is that we should not kill any believers, especially young ones, in the sphere of the life supply
In this message, after a word of introduction and review, we shall consider God's infusion of Himself into Moses
He may have been happy as he prepared the two tablets of stone for this purpose and brought them with him to the mountaintop
After Moses arrived there and God descended to him, God did something else instead of giving Moses the Ten Commandments
What God spoke to Moses before giving him the Ten Commandments the second time was according to the real desire of His heart
God's intention was to dispense Himself into His chosen people so that they would be fully infused with Him in order to express Him
The Lord said, 'You shall not bow yourself down to another god, for Jehovah-Jealous is His name-is a jealous God'
Why did He speak to him about such things as redeeming the firstling of a donkey with a lamb and about not boiling a kid in its mothers milk
In verse 27 the Lord is telling Moses that according to the 'mouth of these words' He made a covenant with him and with Israel
If we fulfill these conditions, we shall feast with God and rest with Him in full enjoyment for the fulfillment of His purpose
Exodus 34:28 and 29 say, 'And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread, and he did not drink water
We see that after God wrote the words of the covenant upon the tablets, He sent Moses down to the foot of the mountain
When we come to the Bible, we may regard it as 'tablets' and take every word as a commandment for us to fulfill
We may not realize that it is not God's desire to give us a word of commandment; God's desire is to infuse Himself into our being
Verse 30 says And Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses and behold the skin of his face shone and they were afraid to come near him
Moses did not know that his face was shining, but Aaron and the children of Israel knew it, and they were frightened by his shining face
We have pointed out that when Moses went to God, he took off the veil, but when he spoke to the people, he put the veil on
Paul says that Moses 'put a veil on his face, that the sons of Israel should not gaze unto the end of that which was being done away'
For the people to see the fading away of the shining would have been for them to see the termination of the law
Exodus 34:28 says, 'And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread, and he did not drink water'
It seems that Moses did not do anything for those forty days except receive God's enlightening and His infusing
Something wonderful was taking place during those forty days: God was infusing Himself into Moses and saturating Moses with Himself
If we see the significance of this, we shall receive much help concerning our fellowship with the Lord and our Christian life
It is the Lord's speaking about the enjoyment of Him, His speaking about feasting and resting and the conditions for enjoying Him
In this message we shall begin to consider a section containing five chapters, chapters thirty-five through thirty-nine
In these chapters we have a record of the making of the tabernacle with its furniture and the holy garments for the priests
Since we have covered most of the details related to these matters in previous messages, we do not need to consider all these details again
Rather, in this message and in the message following we shall consider certain basic matters found in these chapters
It seems that this has nothing to do with the making of the tabernacle with its furniture and the garments for the priests
Apparently these three verses, 35:1-3, have nothing to do with the making of the tabernacle with its furniture and the priestly garments
There is an important connection here, but we need adequate spiritual experience in order to understand this point in the Word
If God wanted to review with Moses the details of the law, why did He not speak about honoring parents or the commandment related to murder?
These conditions are also meaningful for us today in their spiritual interpretation according to our experience
In Exodus 34 we see that, according to the natural life, all those who would enjoy Christ are donkeys needing to be redeemed
In a similar manner the way for us, unclean beasts of burden, to enjoy Christ and rest with Him is for us to be replaced by Christ
After we have been replaced by Christ and have cleared away all leaven, we need to exhaust today's portion of Christ
We need to bring the topmost experience of Christ to the house of God, to the church meetings, and there offer this portion to God
When we are enjoying Christ, we should not cause anything of death to enter into the realm, the sphere, of the nourishing life
In Exodus 34 three feasts are mentioned: the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of weeks, and the feast of ingathering
Although according to Leviticus 23 there were seven annual feasts celebrated by the children of Israel, only these three are mentioned here
According to the record of the seven annual feasts, the most crucial feast was the Passover, which was for salvation
The reason is that the record here is not related to salvation, but is related to the enjoyment of Christ following salvation
If we want to enjoy Christ and rest with Him and with God, the first thing we must do is have a clearance of the past
Following those ten days, Pentecost came, and Christ was poured down upon the disciples in the form of the Spirit
The feast of Pentecost is enjoyed by those who have been saved and who are now living a clean life, a life without leaven
If we have such an enjoyment of Christ during the day, then at the end of day we shall enjoy Christ to the fullest
Many times during the day, perhaps every fifteen or twenty minutes, we should take a short break to rest with Christ
God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made'
If he rests with the Lord before putting on that article of clothing, he may realize that he should not wear it
According to Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 12, the significance of the Sabbath is to remember the Lord as our Creator and Redeemer
There is a principle, a spiritual regulation, that before doing anything we need to remember the Lord and rest with Him
Let us rest with Him in remembrance of Him as our Creator and Redeemer and also as our Savior, Lord, Master, and life
Moses came down to tell the people to make the tabernacle with its furniture and to make the garments for the priests
The materials offered for the building of the tabernacle typify the Christ experienced by us in different aspects
Some translations do not point out that these offerings were heave offerings, wave offerings, and freewill offerings
Suppose some of the Israelites were empty-handed, having nothing to offer to the Lord for the building of the tabernacle
If a brother experiences Christ in the buying and wearing of a tiepin, that will become an aspect of Christ experienced by him
The important point here is that we should not have anything by ourselves, but we should have everything by Christ and with Christ
If a brother experiences Christ in this way, he will gain Christ, even in a situation where he is about to argue with his wife
Among many Christians today there is a shortage of the subjective teaching concerning the practical experience of Christ in our daily life
Before showing her husband a long face, a married sister should first abide in the Lord and pray to Him concerning it
The next matter to be covered in these chapters is the preparing of the workers, the preparing of the gifted ones to function
For the work of building His dwelling place, He can raise up one from a kingly tribe and also one from a lowly tribe
Exodus 35:21 says, 'And they came, everyone whose heart stirred him up, and everyone whose spirit made him willing'
For the building up of the tabernacle, a material dwelling place for God, there was the need for the Spirit of God
In order to be an elder a coworker or one who shares in the building up of the church we need wisdom understanding knowledge and skill
The sequence of the making of the tabernacle and its furniture is different from the sequence of the revelation
For this reason, the first item to be made was the tabernacle, and then the furniture was made as the content of the tabernacle
After the altar of incense, we have the holy anointing oil and the pure incense , the altar of burnt offering , and the laver of bronze
There is no mention of the bronze used in making the laver because that bronze came from the looking glasses of women who loved the Lord
We have the turban for the high priest, the turbans for the priests, and the breeches and girdles for both the high priest and the priests
At the end of chapter thirty-nine, the work was completed, and everything was presented to Moses for his examination
The first is God's commandment concerning the erecting of the tabernacle and the placement of the furniture and utensils
In the book of Exodus there are actually four records related to the tabernacle and its furniture and utensils
According to our experience, we begin with the altar of burnt offering and proceed onward until we reach the ark
If we compare the books of Romans and Ephesians, we shall also see a contrast between God's side and our side, between God's end and our end
As far as the tabernacle and its furniture are concerned, the book of Exodus does not begin from our side and proceed to God's side
Some may say that because God is sovereign and almighty, He can do whatever He desires and can easily reach us
In order for the holy and righteous God to reach man, He must act in a way that matches His holiness and corresponds to His righteousness
In order for God to come from heaven to earth to reach us, His righteousness must be upheld, and His holiness must be honored
God's coming requires a number of steps, or turns, from the ark in the Holy of Holies to the altar in the outer court
The driver of a car may first turn right and then left, but all these turns are necessary for him to reach his destination
If you were to talk with them about other matters in the Word of God, they may say, 'Does this have something to do with my salvation?
Eventually, in the last of the sixty-six books of the Bible, we have a book concerned with the testimony of Jesus
According to Revelation, the ark of God eventually consummates in a tabernacle which will be the New Jerusalem
In our reading of the book of Exodus, we need to pay careful attention to the significance of the ark of testimony
In reading and studying the Word of God, we should not be controlled by our natural mind, religion, or culture
Exodus 40:2 says, 'On the first day of the first month you shall raise up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting'
It is very significant that God commanded Moses to erect the tabernacle on the first day of the first month of the second year
Pentecostal people would say that to have this second blessing is to experience the baptism of the Holy Spirit
The first month of the holy calendar is called the month of Abib, which means green ears, and signifies a new, fresh beginning in life
When in our Christian life we experience the building of God's dwelling place in a practical way, we have the second beginning
To have the second beginning with the building of the dwelling place of God is much better than tongue-speaking, inward filling, or holiness
Both at the end of Exodus and at the end of Revelation we see the glory of God filling the tabernacle, God's dwelling place
The fact that the words 'as Jehovah had commanded Moses' are repeated again and again indicates something important
We are told that Moses raised up the tabernacle and placed its sockets and put up its boards and put in its bars and raised up its pillars
We are told that Moses 'spread the tent over the tabernacle' and 'put the cover of the tent over it from above'
The curtains were placed above the boards to form the ceiling, and the layers of coverings were put on top of the curtains to form the roof
According to the New Testament, the propitiatory cover is the throne of grace , where God meets with His people
According to verse 22, Moses placed the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil
Opposite the table, on the south side of the tabernacle, Moses put the lampstand, and he lighted the lamps before the Lord
Are you enjoying only the cloud upon the tent of meeting, or are you also enjoying the glory within the tabernacle?
Such saints need more experience of the church life in order to enter into the tabernacle and see the glory that is inside
The tabernacle is related to God's testimony, but the tent of meeting is related mainly to God's interest on earth and to His move
Anyone who entered into the tabernacle would see not the shell, but would see the inward glory of the tabernacle
Young people, do not be disappointed by my word, and do not throw away the shell because you do not yet have much of the inward glory
We must admit that what we are enjoying today is something deeper and more inward than what we enjoyed in Elden Hall
It is mainly the young ones who are excited and exciting, for they are enjoying the cloud outside the tent of meeting
Those in the outer court may gather around the altar of burnt offering and see the cloud covering the tent of meeting
Whatever God's people did and wherever they went was according to the situation with respect to God's dwelling place
The Lord's recovery, which is based upon the full revelation of the holy Word, is very different from the traditional way of religion
The living house of the living God is our leading concerning whether we should stay or move, whether it is time to fight or work
Exodus begins with slavery in Egypt and ends with the tabernacle covered by and filled with the glory of God on account of His redemption
At the end of Exodus we do not have a coffin containing a dead body; we have a tabernacle containing the glorious God
No longer are we dead and in the world but now we are part of a living and moving tabernacle for the accomplishment of Gods purpose on earth
The individual Israel produced in Genesis bore God's image and expressed Him, and he represented God and exercised His authority on earth
Such a vision, such a revelation, will revolutionize our concept, change our daily life, and even transform our being
With the tent of meeting what we have is not merely an individual expression; we have a people as God's corporate expression
The entire Bible will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal tabernacle, a tabernacle filled with glory
Eternity will reveal what the Lord has been doing within us and among us for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose
