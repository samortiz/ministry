I remember you every time I pray. Thank and praise the Lord that He led me to Hangchow and caused me to obey Him. I remember how rebellious and disobedient I used to be. Now God Himself has enlightened me so that I completely obey Him. Before I went to Hangchow, I thought, "I definitely cannot enter the `Little Flock' even though I was baptized in Ta Chiang." Brother Chiang Shun T'ien exhorted me to go the meetings in Hangchow, and I said at the time that I would go, but I never went. Thanks be to the Father who loves us. He did not let me go and caused old Brother T'ien P'ing Fang to come to Kirin. He only said one word, and I changed my mind about going to the conference in Hangchow. I used to oppose the "Little Flock" to the uttermost. I did not only oppose it myself, but I also told others to oppose. However, I was very willing to read books by Brother Nee, and I often told others about them, but I was unwilling to go that way. At first I felt that the "Little Flock" was a sect, but now I know that if I call others a little flock, I myself am part of the big flock (the world) and am not saved! Thank the Lord for allowing me to completely understand the meaning of Luke 12:32 in this conference in Hangchow. It refers to all those in the Lord from the past and present and all over the world. They are those purchased by the Lord's blood, all the believers with the Lord's life. It also helped me to understand that sects are a sin which divide the Lord's Body into thousands of divisions. I also understand that the life I used to live, like a life in Haran, was a suffering. Praise the Lord; He caused me to leave these hateful denominations and walk in His way.</p><p>After returning from Shanghai, the Lord led three of us safely back to Kirin. We did not meet with any difficulties. After returning to Kirin, we suffered a little. One person came to exhort us, and another person came to visit, and some from the denominations despised us. The Lord led us all through these things. I also went to Hsin Ying Kou Bible Seminary and resigned from my position as a financial board member. Last Wednesday a denomination in Kirin also elected Mr. Hua Su Sheng and myself as deacons. We did not accept. Sister Chang En Chao resigned from her position as a worker in the deacons' meeting last Wednesday (thirty-five dollars a month) so she could walk in the Lord's way. The way is narrow and difficult; please pray for us much.</p><p>Three Lord's Days ago I went to Changchun for the table meeting and gave a short testimony. There are three brothers and two sisters in Kirin. We do not have a table meeting yet, but we meet on Thursday and the Lord's Day evening for prayer and Bible study meetings. On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday evenings we pray. There are also two brothers from the denominations who come to pray with us. All the denominations in Kirin are afraid of us. They say, "The Little Flock has come, so we must be more careful; they steal lambs like the Seventh-day Adventists." There were a few times when I wanted to send a letter to the denominations in Kirin, regarding my intention to leave the sects, but I have not done it. Brother T'ien said I should wait quietly first. It will still not be too late to wait for Brothers Nee and Luan to come. I am afraid of frustration from the denominations, so I have not done it yet. Tonight is Thursday. During the prayer meeting we received your petition booklet and a letter from Brother Ma saying that Brother Nee's illness was better and that he would come to Manchuria in February. We heard before that he would come in December. Now it has changed to February. It must be February of next year, right? Brother Chiang Shun T'ien's letter said that Brother Nee was waiting to get well from his sickness before coming to Manchuria. I think he must mean that he will come after his illness is better. We are praying unceasingly to the Lord to heal Brother Nee's illness. We also are begging God to take away Satan's frustrations so that you can come quickly. The brothers and sisters desperately need you to come!</p><p>Presently we feel very lonely. We really do not want to enter the denominational cathedrals. (Since returning from Shanghai, I have not gone once.) Therefore, the few brothers and sisters really want the Lord to quickly give us a place to meet and to raise up more people to walk in the way with us.</p><p>Brother, the work in Manchuria is very critical. We need you brothers to come quickly. We believe there will be a big change in the denominations in Kirin. God will call out His people personally to maintain His testimony. We are looking to the Lord and waiting on Him. We ask Him to arrange all matters. The Lord's grace is sufficient for us. Thank and praise the Lord. Please greet the brothers and sisters in Hangchow for me!</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Luke Kuo<br />December 7, 1934 in Kirin</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 26: Collection of Newsletters (2) & Watchman Nee's Testimony &nbsp; pg 46</div><br></body></html>
