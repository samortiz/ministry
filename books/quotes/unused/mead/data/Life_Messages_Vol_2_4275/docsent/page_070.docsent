   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"INTO "</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 3:36 we are told: "He who believes in the Son has eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word "in" here is literally "into."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We believe into the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The same Greek preposition is used in Romans 6:3: " Baptized into Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We were put into the Lord Jesus, just as we were put into the water at baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The step of being baptized into Him takes the one foot of believing and the other foot of being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We believe into Him and are baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What does baptism mean?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It does not refer to life, but rather death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"As many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death" Rom 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The death of the Lord Jesus left Him with a wound.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the site of this wound we are baptized into Him, are grafted into Him, and grow together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By being baptized into His death, we are grafted into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This grafting is a union and a growth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The joining activates the growth process.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The life juice of the tree gets into the grafted branch, and it begins to grow in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For two trees to be grafted, there must be a close similarity between them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A banana tree cannot be grafted to a grape vine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The same is true with a skin graft.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the skin to be used in a graft is foreign to the body, the body will reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How then can our human life be grafted to God's life?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is because the two lives are to some extent similar.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man was made in God's image and according to His likeness Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But, you may ask, how can God have an image when He does not have any form?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Idols are images because they have a form, but what is God's image?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some explain image as meaning the inner attributes, with the term likeness denoting the outward form.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, I would explain image as referring to one's expression, while likeness refers to one's stance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If I stand with my hand raised in a salute, my image is my expression, but my likeness is that of a soldier!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I jump and leap on the platform, my image is still my expression, but my likeness is that of a hart!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When God created man in the beginning, He created man with His image, or expression, or face.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then He also made man according to His likeness, that is, according to His stature; for this He used the dust of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may ask how God could have a physical form.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a difficult question.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is, however, an instance of God's appearing in the form of a body before the Lord's coming to earth in the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Genesis 18 Abraham was sitting at the door of his tent one hot summer day, when three men approached.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Two were apparently angels cf.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Gen 18:22 , but one was clearly Jehovah the Lord 18:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He came as a real person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He ate the meal Abraham prepared for Him, after having His feet washed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He talked with Abraham in an ordinary way, not like the Creator issuing decrees from a heavenly throne.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As He was going on His way, Abraham accompanied Him a little distance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This closeness constrained God to open to him and reveal what He would do, as one would share with a friend.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Is this God in Genesis 18 a man?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Who is this Jehovah?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is surely the same as the Lord Jesus in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is beyond theology's ability to explain, but we can see from this passage that man has a body after God's likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the time of creation, God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Hebrew word translated breath in this verse is translated spirit in Proverbs 20:27: "The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, searching all the inward parts of the belly" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The breath of life in Genesis 2 becomes the spirit of man in Proverbs 20.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The human spirit is the breath of life from God that enters into man and becomes his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The spirit may well be what Confucius was referring to when he said that there is a bright virtue within man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His thought was that this bright virtue needed to be developed and further brightened.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Bible, however, shows us that this spirit needs to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In our spirit, which was formed from God's breathing into man the breath of life, there is not the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, the spirit must receive another life by being "born of the Spirit" of God John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The spirit of man is his most precious part.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is what distinguishes him from animals.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once this breath of life got into man's nostrils, he became a living soul, with a personality that in reality is in the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Man's emotions, desires, and intelligence correspond with God's. God has such feelings as love; He has desires; and He has thoughts, wisdom, and intelligence.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In a sense we are like a photograph of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The photograph is not God Himself, but it is His image.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is foolish to accept Darwin's theory that man evolved from lower animals.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All the plant and animal life created by God in Genesis 1 were designed to reproduce after their kind vv.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>11, 12, 21, 24, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But when it came to the creation of man, instead of saying "after his kind," it says "after our likeness" v. 26 . Man is not in the category of animals.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is a picture of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God created man like Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are not God, anymore than a picture of the President is the President.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But we must not demean ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we see that we are God's image, we shall realize that we are vessels of honor prepared unto glory.</S>
