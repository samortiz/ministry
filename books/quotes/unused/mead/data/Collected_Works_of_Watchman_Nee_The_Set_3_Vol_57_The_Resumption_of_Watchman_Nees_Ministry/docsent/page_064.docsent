   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REPORT OF THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to give a report concerning the work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For many days, we have been waiting before the Lord, inquiring of Him as to the way to go on in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We think that we first have to concentrate our efforts together to maintain the testimonies along the coastal provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The apostles remained first in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later, Philip went to other places to preach the gospel Acts 8:1, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As far as our number is concerned, we do not have enough to meet the need of the places along the coast.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The political situation in northern China is very unstable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, we should concentrate on Foochow and Shanghai, and we should have a start in these two places at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Presently, we have over thirty co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The number is not large.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not have other co-workers wait in their localities for too long.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To maintain a local testimony, there is not too much difference between the effort of ten people and that of twenty people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the Lord is merciful to us, Hong Kong can be linked up with Canton, in the same way that Nanking and Hangchow are linked up with Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These are only suggestions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you think that this is right before the Lord, we can go ahead and try these things out.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brother Chang Wu-chen, Chang Chi-jie, the two brother Chows, Hsu Jung-jieh, Weigh Kwang-hsi, Sister Liu Hwei-fen, Kwei Ru-yu, Wang Hsu-ching, Juo Fu-ru, Miao Yun-chun, Mrs. Lin Pu-ji, Mrs. Lee Yin-shin, and Mrs. Weigh Kwang-hsi should go to Fukien to join the first term of training.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those co-workers who should remain in Shanghai are Brother David Hsu, Chang Yu-zhi, Chu Chen, Du Chung-chen, Ren Chung-shiang, Witness Lee, Jiang Shui-wu, Sister Ruth Lee, Phoebe Chang, Pearl Wang, Chow Ching-mei.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For Nanking, there are Brother Chang Yu-lan, Chi Yun-tung, and others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Hsia Hsi-ling will return to Tientsin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He should drop his job sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brother Lan Tsi-yi will return temporarily to Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Later, if he can find others to substitute for him, he can also come to Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As far as the nature of the work goes, there is the need to resume the literature work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We still need to publish books and magazines.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We hope that there can be the following publications:</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1 The Present Testimony For the more matured ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The content will be of a deeper nature.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>4 Collection of Newsletters and The Open Door Dealing with practical problems in the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We ask Sister Ruth Lee to be chief editor of these papers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is the need for mass publication of gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The editing and compilation of the hymnal will be taken care of by Brother Tang, Brother Chow, Brother Lee, and myself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The publication and distribution of these papers will be the responsibility of Chang Hsi-nien.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To all the other brothers and sisters: The money that you have earned in the past, you can keep it for your own use.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From now on, all the money that you make, other than what you need for your own expenses, should all be given to the work of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To the sisters who take care of their families: We hope that you will bear a good testimony at home.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To the brothers and sisters who are still in school: You should continue to go to school.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is a great possibility that in the future all of you will have to give up everything to preach the gospel.</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Communists have arrived in Tsingtao.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Your coming out is not a running away, but a move under orders.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the other brothers and sisters are left in the Communist-controlled areas.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many want to leave and do not want to stay.</S>

   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Mrs. Lee has ways to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Without the proper care, they may be difficult to manage in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today God's work requires that all the brothers and sisters give up everything they have.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Individually, we should all try to save as much money as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The co-workers have given up their all.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The publication of the magazines alone will need so many hundreds of millions in local currency because of war-related inflation .</S>

   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the co-workers' lodging here in Shanghai, even getting food has become a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should never say that money is not needed in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We hope that God will bless us more and will bless the brothers and sisters to have more income.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Everyone who has handed himself over has given his heart and body to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everyone has his responsibility, and unless all of us give everything we have, we cannot go on.</S>
