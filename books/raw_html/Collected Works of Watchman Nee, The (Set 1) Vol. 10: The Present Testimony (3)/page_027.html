<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Peace and Joy</H2><P>What is the peak of Christianity? It is a complete union with God and the entire loss of self. Currently, psychology also claims that man is able to unite with the unseen "heart" and be lost within it. Apparently, this claim is the same as that in Christianity, but in reality they are totally different. Dr. Frank Buchman, who is presently popular, belongs to this school of psychology. The books from his school have been translated into Chinese and published by the Literary Promotion Society. One of his teachings is meditation. He teaches that meditation is all that man needs to communicate with God. He does not suggest that people read the Bible in the morning. Instead, he suggests that they just meditate and pray. He also claims that the first thought after people pray is a thought from God and that people should act and behave that day according to this thought. Little do they realize that this kind of meditating on God is just another type of silent cultivation, quiet meditation, and mind-contemplation. What result do they have from their meditation? They claim that meditation will make a person peaceful and joyful. It is true that if one meditates on anything for an hour, he will have a so-called peace and joy. Even if one meditates on some nonexistent matter for an hour, he will still have peace and joy. Many people's meditation is only a kind of psychic function. But Christianity is entirely different. We have no need to meditate on God because we have God's life. We can know God in our intuition. Whether or not we sense God in our feeling, we have the leading of the intuition within which teaches us to know God. In addition, we have God's word in the Bible which tells us so. Whatever God's Word says, we believe. We have faith and do not need to care about our feeling. This is what makes us different from psychology.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. Works of Wonders</H2><P>In addition, we have seen works of wonders. Personally, I do not object to these works. I have witnessed several people healed by God immediately. Today, we are not against those who say they can heal illness. We are only against the cases where wrong principles are applied in healing. Someone asked me, "Are you against speaking in tongues?" I replied, "I am not against speaking in tongues, but I am against all tongues spoken by the wrong means." Concerning strange dreams and visions, we are also not against them. I myself have once seen great lights. These things are recorded in the Bible and we accept them. But I am against all the strange dreams and visions obtained through improper methods. For example, the healing mentioned in the Bible is accompanied by the laying on of hands and the applying of ointment. However, if someone lays his hand on another person's head, and, at the same time, forcibly massages that person's back and neck with the other hand, and asks, "How do you feel?", the person receiving the massage would certainly feel heat around his neck. This is low-class hypnotism and is despised even by the hypnotists. We know that behind our head there is the spinal cord with nerves extending from the brain all the way down our spine. Although the one who performs the massage does not know that this is a kind of hypnotism, actually he is employing hypnotism. The person who is massaged may feel a stream of heat flowing as electrical currents all the way to his shoulder and back and may feel that he is healed. Actually, this is only a manifestation of the latent power within man's soul. Even if the person is healed, I would not admit that this healing is from God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>5. The Baptism of the Holy Spirit</H2><P>Let us go on to the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Recently in Shantung I also shared about the baptism of the Holy Spirit and asked others to pray for it. But I do not agree with the practice of shutting many people together into a small room to fast, pray, and sing choruses for days and nights. Some fast for days, and their physical strength is exhausted. The room is small, and the air is stagnant. In this kind of environment, they repeatedly sing short choruses. If someone does this, his mind will be numbed after a while, his will will become passive, and his mouth will automatically utter a kind of confused and nonsensical voice or language. In this way, his latent power will be exposed.</P><P>In meetings where people pray for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, sometimes they shout only one word, "Hallelujah," repeatedly. After hundreds and thousands of times of repeated shouting, their heads will be dizzy, and their minds will become numb. Then it will be easy for them to discover a kind of strange vision. This is not the baptism of the Spirit; it is only a baptism of the soul. What they have received is not the power of the Holy Spirit but the power of the soul; it is just the manifestation of the latent power. Therefore, the power they receive is only acquired through human training and is not from God. This is not the right way to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. However, these ones force others to follow them. They act according to their past experiences, not according to God's teaching.</P><P>Some may ask after hearing this, "According to what you say, are there no real works of wonders at all?" Yes, there are. If any work of wonder comes from God, we thank God for it. But we have to exercise the proper discernment. If something does not come from God, it must be from the latent power of man's soul. When I was in Shantung, I heard that a woman who was mentally disordered and paralyzed for many years was completely healed. If her healing indeed came from God, I would thank God for it. But the healing she received was through the kind of laying on of hands mentioned above.</P>
