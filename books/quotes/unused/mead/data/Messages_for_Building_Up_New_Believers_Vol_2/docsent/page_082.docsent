   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some Weaknesses Being Unbearable</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us consider the problem of weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are two ways to deal with weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some weaknesses are intolerable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are like difficult personalities, too hard for some to accommodate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A marriage will not be successful if there is the presence of such weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Others weaknesses are bearable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After considering, one may decide that he can live with such weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of course, he must try to discover the other party s weaknesses before they are engaged.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some try to discover their spouse s weaknesses after they are married.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is useless to find faults then; this will only damage the family, because no one can change those weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is impossible to change them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One must take note and consider well before he enters into a marriage whether or not he is able to live with the other party s weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Weaknesses Should Not Be the Same</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here is a word of reminder: Do not presume that those with similar weaknesses can get along with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many people think that those with different weaknesses cannot get along with one another, and that those with similar weaknesses can.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This cannot be farther from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some couples who have the same weaknesses argue, quarrel, and fight with each other all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One has a hot temper, and the other also has a hot temper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may think that it is wonderful for both to have the same temperament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually difficulty is compounded when both have the same weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When there is a difference in personality, the conscience is not involved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When there is a matter of weakness, the conscience is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When both the husband and the wife are believers, any weakness in one party will be consciously felt by both parties.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The burden of responsibility will be compounded, and the problems will be compounded as well.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is why we say that a couple should have similar personalities but different weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I remember a husband who carelessly left things around the house; he never tidied up his room.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His wife was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One made messes and the other made more messes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You would think that they would have been at peace with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the two of them quarreled every day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The husband would say, Do you not think that leaving things around like this is messy?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The wife would reply, Why do you not tidy them up?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do you not know that I am very busy?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please remember that one burden is heavy enough; two become unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The result will be a compounding of family problems.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Never assume that trouble will be less when both parties have the same weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Similar weaknesses result in problems.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In fact, the problems will be doubled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the weakness is with one person, he can bear it alone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But when both have the same weakness, the burden becomes too heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is hard enough for one to bear his own burden.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is impossible for him to bear the other s burden on top of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Young brothers and sisters should realize that some weaknesses can be tolerated even when found in both parties.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But some weaknesses are compounded when they are found in both parties.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such weaknesses are intolerable.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is better that the weaknesses of the two persons be different.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Of course, sometimes even couples with similar weaknesses can get along with each other; there is no rigid rule concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One simply has to watch for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>H. Character</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For a marriage to be successful, both parties must have character attributes that the other one appreciates.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The wife must not despise the husband, and the husband must not despise the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once there is contempt of any kind, the family is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Both sides should respect the other s character.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The husband must respect his wife s character, and the wife must respect her husband s character.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, we have not only the matter of personality and weakness, but also the matter of character.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For example, it is excusable for a wife to hide things occasionally when she speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But it becomes a problem of character if she lies all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some husbands by nature are somewhat selfish; they care only for themselves and not others.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But they cannot carry their selfishness so far as to lose their wife s respect.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Within a family, the husband must have some character traits that the wife respects.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is different from the matter of compatibility of personality.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is difficult enough for a couple to adjust to friction and conflict in personality.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If, in addition to this, there is any contempt in character, the very foundation of the family is shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then nothing can be done to save the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sometimes we see husbands who are very obnoxious.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At other times we see wives who are very calculating; they will do things that are profitable only to themselves, and nothing more.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Clearly these are character flaws.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They are not merely weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is a matter of contempt and disrespect.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Once such elements exist, the basic ingredient of a marriage is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is why we have to ask ourselves whether we can tolerate the other side s character.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some people are quite cruel.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They are harsh to others, no matter who they may be.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They are insensitive to others problems and feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They only want to express their own feelings, caring little if others are hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is not a matter of incompatibility of personality but of a character flaw which opens the door for disrespect.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Some people have no control over themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They do not have any self-discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They are wild in everything, including their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When a problem arises, their anger flares up.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Why does a person lose his temper?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He loses his temper because he is selfish and because he is only after his own satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the final analysis this is not a problem of temperament or weakness, but a problem of character.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Once this element comes in, contempt and disrespect also come in.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Therefore, before two persons marry each other, they have to discover the admirable attributes in the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is particularly true with marriages among God s children; there should always be some noble traits on each side.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If a man has nothing in him that others can appreciate, this man is not qualified to marry.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>You must have at least one or two noble traits in the eyes of God before the other party will respect you.</S>
