<h1 class="title">&ldquo;WHERE ARE YOU?&rdquo;&mdash;IN SINS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Gen. 3:9; John 8:21, 24, 34; Rom. 7:24<br />
<em>Concentrate on some sins that can touch the feeling of the unbelievers. Be free to apply.</em></h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Lying<br />
<span class="normal">There are many, many kinds of lies: lying openly and secretly, deceiving with looks and deceiving with words, lying with words and with actions, lying with evil intention and with good intention, white lies and black lies, big lies and small lies, lying with hands and lying with the head, lying with true words and with false words, lying to others and lying to yourself. You deceive others and you deceive yourself. You know that there is heaven and hell, but you say that there is neither; your conscience is bothered, but you say that you are at peace.</span></li>
<li>Stealing<br />
<span class="normal">There are also many ways of stealing, including secret deals and scandals: cultured stealing, barbaric stealing, big stealing (bandits and robbers), small stealing (taking ballpoint pens, stationery, etc.).</span></li>
<li>Covetousness<br />
<span class="normal">Covetousness is without end. Someone talks about something good, and immediately you begin to think how nice it would be to have that yourself. Were there no laws to punish you and no criticism from the public to restrain you, you would have taken what you coveted.</span></li>
<li>Hatred (envy)</li>
<li>Lasciviousness, adulterous thoughts</li>
<li>Habits: dancing, movies, gambling, smoking, drinking, whoring, making evil friends</li>
<li>How to be delivered from sins
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord Jesus died to bear all our sins.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus was resurrected to set us free from the bondage of sins.</li>
	<li>We must confess all the sins we have committed, and ask for the Lord&rsquo;s blood to cleanse us.</li>
	<li>We must accept the Lord into us to be our life, that we may be freed from sins. Describe how Christ comes into man to become his life and enables him to be freed from sins.</li>
	</ol></li>
