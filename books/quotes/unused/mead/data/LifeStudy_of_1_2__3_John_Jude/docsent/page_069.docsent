   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO THE ANOINTING Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:20-27 THE ANOINTING AND THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider 2:20-27.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 20 says, And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse speaks not of the ointment but of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word anointing denotes something experiential that is taking place within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The anointing is the moving and working of the indwelling compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This all-inclusive life-giving Spirit from the Holy One entered into us at the time of our regeneration and abides in us forever v. 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 20 says at the end, you all know.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some manuscripts read, you know all things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I believe that the proper rendering should be you know all, not you all know.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 21 John says, I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this verse the word truth is used twice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we consider verses 20 and 21 together, we shall realize that the anointing surely must have something to do with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 20 says that we have an anointing, and verse 21 says that we know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this verse the truth is closely related to the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually the anointing is the moving and working of the truth, which is the reality of the Divine Trinity, especially of the Person of Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>22-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The knowing in verse 21 is the knowing by the anointing of the indwelling and life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a knowledge in the divine life under the divine light, an inner knowledge initiated from our regenerated spirit indwelt by the compound Spirit, not mental knowledge exercised by stimulation from without.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>DENYING THE FATHER AND THE SON</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verse 22 John goes on to say, Who is the liar if not he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the antichrist, who is denying the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The statement that Jesus is the Christ is related to the truth, and the truth is related to the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These three matters are all related to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First we have the anointing, then the truth related to the anointing, and then the statement that Jesus is the Christ related to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 22 indicates that the antichrist is the one who denies the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After speaking of Jesus being the Christ, John speaks concerning the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that the Father and the Son are related to Jesus being the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In these three verses we have four crucial matters: the anointing, the truth, Jesus being the Christ, and the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The anointing teaches us the truth, the truth is that Jesus is the Christ, and Jesus being the Christ is a matter that includes the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to verse 22, to deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we deny that Jesus is the Christ, this means that we deny the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates strongly that Jesus, Christ, the Father, and the Son are one.</S>
