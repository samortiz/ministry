   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Heavenly Condition of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church is heavenly not because it does not have a board of directors, does not elect elders by voting, and does not collect donations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Neither is it heavenly because it has a group of elders who have been appointed by apostles and who manage church affairs nor because it puts out an offering box during the meeting for the saints to give willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is heavenly because it is under God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why do people want to vote for and elect elders?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is because there is no authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why are there boards of directors?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is because such boards are related to human ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why are there worldly methods?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is because the methods of the world are related to human ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more we submit to God s authority, the fresher and brighter the heavenly color in us will become.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Philippians 3:20 says, Our commonwealth exists in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that we are heavenly citizens who submit to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be a heavenly citizen is a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only those who submit to God s authority are heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that the significance of being heavenly is that a person submits to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To be heavenly is to allow heaven to rule in us and to let God establish His throne in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Methods cannot make us heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are heavenly only by submitting to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are different from others merely as the result of certain methods, we are still of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, in the Lord s Day meeting many Christian groups pass a collection plate in order to receive donations; however, on our part, we put out an offering box and leave it to the brothers and sisters to offer willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This difference is only a matter of method, and neither method makes the church heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether or not the church is heavenly in regard to the giving of material offerings is determined by whether or not God s authority rules in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The denominations elect elders by voting, whereas among us, apostles appoint elders.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nevertheless, this difference is a matter only of method; it does not cause us to be more heavenly than the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No method is able to make us heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the difference is a matter only of method, then the election of elders is just as earthly as the apostles appointment of elders.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The question is not a matter of method but of God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only God s authority makes us heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The reason we do not have elections is that elections do not allow God to freely exercise His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, if the apostles do not allow God to freely exercise His authority in the appointment of elders, we should reject such a method.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To appoint elders in this way is not heavenly but earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only when God is allowed to have the authority will the church be heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the same in regard to preaching the word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are heavenly only when we allow God s authority to be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In some places, the ones who minister the word take turns speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This week Brother Chang will speak, next week Brother Lee will speak, and the following week Brother Wang will speak.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Taking turns is altogether a worldly method, and we should reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To preach the word, a person must be willing to submit to God s authority and allow God s authority to have a free way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only this kind of preaching is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not methods that make us heavenly; rather, it is God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The most important matter for maintaining the heavenly nature of the church is that the church stays under God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that in every matter in the church there is God s throne, or God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whether or not a church is heavenly is determined not by whether things are done one way or another or by whether they are done in a way that is scriptural or unscriptural but by whether they are carried out in submission to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must continually learn the lesson of submitting to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is altogether not a matter of doctrine or of the interpretation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On our part, we do not elect elders, because electing elders is not according to the Bible; rather, in accordance with the Bible, the apostles appoint the elders among us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Likewise, those ministering the word among us do not take turns in preaching the word, because there is no such practice in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, although we are scriptural, being scriptural does not necessarily mean that we are heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only when we allow God to rule are we heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is true in the appointing of elders, in the preaching of the word, and in the managing of finances.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must always ask whether God s authority is being carried out in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the question of questions, the unique question.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All earthy people are rebellious toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everything earthy is the serpent s food, that is, something for Satan to devour.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, now there is salvation; that is, heaven has come to earth through the Lord s incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Moreover, in His resurrection the Lord has brought people from the earth to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He has caused those who would not and could not submit to God s authority to be willing and able to submit to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the Lord was resurrected, He brought His redeemed ones to the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The emphasis of His bringing them to the heavenlies is not related to place but to nature.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church, in her nature, is altogether submissive to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The church being heavenly is not a matter of method or outward appearance but a matter of having authority inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Are matters among us in the hands of man or in the hands of God?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Is man ruling, or is God ruling?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This determines whether or not we are heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we do everything according to the Bible yet do not have God s authority, we are not heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be heavenly means that God s throne is present and that the heavens are ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To be heavenly is to cast out God s enemy and to deal with Satan who is in rebellion against God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To be heavenly is to put the enemy to shame under God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To be heavenly means that although God s enemy rebelled against God s authority, the saved ones submit to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To be heavenly is not a matter of being blessed or of being in a certain situation or condition; rather, it is a matter of nature.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>For example, the nature of glass is that it is brittle and breaks if it drops to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In contrast, the nature of rubber is soft; thus, no matter how it is dropped, it will not break.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Similarly, the church has its particular nature, that is, a nature that submits to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Today, apart from the church, no one submits or is even able to submit to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, because the church is heavenly, it is able and does submit to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Since the church is heavenly, whenever we depart from God s authority and do not submit to God s authority, we lose the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The church is of resurrection and is spiritual and heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the church there is nothing that cannot and does not submit to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The entire church can and does submit to God s authority because it is in its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Through resurrection Christ brought the church into such a nature.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Christ has a nature that submits to God s authority, and the church also has this nature.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The reason that the church is able to rule is that it is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The reason that the church can bind whatever has been bound in the heavens and loose whatever has been loosed in the heavens is that the church is heavenly Matt 16:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The reason the church is able to represent God to rule over everything on the earth is that the church is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As soon as the church loses its heavenly nature, it immediately falls under the authority of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Hence, the church must be heavenly.</S>
