When we grow in life and function as members of the Body, we will spontaneously grow up into Christ. This growing up into Christ, the Head, equals the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness to Fulfill<br>the Aspiration and Prayer of the Lord</H2><P>The oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God fulfills the aspiration and prayer of the Lord in John 17. The first kind of oneness is the oneness in the Lord's aspiration and prayer. Then, in the second kind of oneness, the oneness of the Spirit, that aspiration and prayer was accomplished but was not yet fulfilled. Finally, in the third kind of oneness, the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, the oneness in the Lord's aspiration and prayer is fulfilled. This third kind of oneness is the practical oneness for us to live in the church life.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 10: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (2) &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
