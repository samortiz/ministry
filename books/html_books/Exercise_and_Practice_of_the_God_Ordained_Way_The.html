Lord, we praise You that You are the Victor. You have been put to death, yet You live and are living forever. Because You live, we have hope in Your living life. Lord, thank You for tonight. We are here to listen to Your word. Once again, Lord, open up Yourself to us. We want to open ourselves to You. Cover us that there would be a communication, a fellowship, between You and us in our spirit. We want to speak in You. Lord, speak in our speaking. When we touch Your throne, we cannot forget Your enemy, the evil one, the power of darkness. Lord, we accuse him and ask You to put him to shame. Chase him away, and put him in the corner. Lord, help us. We hide ourselves in You and under Your precious, prevailing blood. Amen.<h2 class=head1>AN INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2><p>This series of messages is a part of the full-time training. In this training, I will take care of only two matters-life and the new way or, rather, the God-ordained way. I will give two messages a week on the matter of life and two on the new way. Concerning life, I will first cover the experience of life and then the growth in life.<p>Concerning the new way, the God-ordained way, this matter has been missed and much neglected by the Lord&#8217;s children. Even today, a small number have opposed and rejected the new way. Therefore, I have a burden to put out the things which I have received of the Lord and with which the Lord has burdened me concerning His ordained way for us to serve Him in the church life.<h2 class=head1>THE FOUR MAIN STEPS OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h2><p>Concerning the God-ordained way, the New Testament is full of revelation. God wants us to serve Him, but in the New Testament no one is allowed to serve God according to his own concept. We have to serve God according to God&#8217;s concept. God&#8217;s ordained way has been fully and clearly revealed in the New Testament, yet Christians through all the centuries, from the last part of the first century down to today, have neglected it.<p>What we call the new way is simply this God-ordained way. We must see that this new way is very ancient. It is not old but quite ancient. It was even there with John the Baptist and the early apostles in the first century. Then why do we call this the new way? It is because everything that belongs to God, regardless how ancient it may be, is still new. With God, there is no oldness, everything is new. God is new, but we are always old. With us, things become stale. We may do some service, we may preach the gospel, yet in a stale way. We may help the young believers, but the way we do it may not be that fresh, like the fresh dew early in the morning. We may even perfect some of the saints somewhat, yet our way may be too old, too stale. This is why there is no prophesying to build up the Body of Christ as unveiled in 1 Corinthians 14. Very few Christians through all the generations have known how to prophesy, that is, to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to minister the Lord to others, that the Body of Christ might be organically built up. Therefore, this matter has actually been put aside. Based upon this, we have to say that this is a new way to us today. So we must endeavor to put aside the old and pick up the new. This is not easy, but we must come back to the Bible to see and to practice the God-ordained way.<p>In the past few years, I have collected all the points related to the God-ordained way and condensed them into four main steps.<h2 class=head2>As the Priests of the Gospel Preaching the Gospel by Visiting People Where They Are</h2><p>First, we are the priests of the New Testament gospel. Therefore, we must act, behave, live, and move as priests of the gospel. All of us have to visit people where they are to get them saved, to bring them to Christ. Although many have been preaching the gospel, most of the preaching of the gospel today is not scriptural. Although some preach things that are according to the Scriptures, the way they preach is not scriptural. They do not preach the gospel of the New Testament according to God&#8217;s ordained way. We have to realize first that we are the New Testament priests of the gospel. We all know that the main work a priest does is to offer sacrifices to God. We must do the work of the gospel as a priest to produce some sacrifices for God. From my youth as a Christian, I learned that we Christians are priests of God, but I did not know what sacrifices we should offer. I was taught that we should offer our praises and thanks to God as sacrifices. I also learned that we should give material things to God, His children, His church, His servants, and so forth as sacrifices. But these are too minor. The major sacrifices we should offer to God are the sinners saved by the gospel through our preaching. In Romans 15, Paul says that he was &#8220;a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable&#8221; (v. 16). Paul offered the Gentile believers saved through his preaching as a sacrifice to God. We all must have this kind of concept. How many people have you brought to Christ since you have been saved? As one of God&#8217;s priests, could you not bring one person to the Lord in one year, three hundred sixty-five days? This is logical and fair. If not, suppose you were the Lord, what would you say? I believe you would fire such a priest.<p>Some have criticized door-knocking, saying, &#8220;I went out for two months and did not gain anyone.&#8221; Then I would answer: &#8220;What about the other ten months? Does a mother bring forth a child every day?&#8221; God&#8217;s natural law regulates. A child should be in its mother&#8217;s womb for nine months. If a mother wants a second child, it is not so easy because nine months of one year are gone. She has only three months left, so she has to borrow from the next year. This is God&#8217;s regulation. Once a mother has conceived, she learns the lesson of patience day after day for two hundred seventy days. If we preach the gospel like such a patient mother, in at least nine months, we could bring one to the Lord.<p>You may think this would be small, but actually it is not small. Suppose each one of us will get one yearly. Surely the church will be doubled within one year. God&#8217;s way seems too slow, yet it goes very fast. God created only one man, Adam. But today there are billions of Adams on this earth. It is very slow, yet the most prevailing. I recently studied some statistics. In the past one hundred fifty years, two heretical groups have been the most successful in increasing their numbers. They did this by the way of door-knocking. One group is the Mormons, and the other is the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses. I studied statistics put out by the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses for the twelve nations in which their work was the most prevailing last year. In Japan, they figured out that they need to spend more than six thousand hours to get one person. This means that even if they work ten hours a day for two years they may get only one. Even if you could get only one person in one year, although it seems slow, it is much better than doing nothing. You may have gone out for two months and gained no one. So why not try another two months? Why not try the third two months, the fourth two months, and the fifth two months? If you could not gain one this year, try the next year. Our problem is, first, we do not realize that we are priests of the gospel, and second, we do not persevere in our practice. Some may say, &#8220;Peter spoke once on the day of Pentecost and three thousand were saved, and then a few days later, five thousand were added.&#8221; There is such a history in the Bible, but today who can say, &#8220;I speak, and I gain three thousand&#8221;? That is not God&#8217;s ordained way. God did not say that if a woman would be faithful and believe in Him, one day He would suddenly give her three thousand children. I believe Adam brought forth many children, but I do not believe he brought forth one dozen a year. Some have said that we should bear fruit every month like the tree of life in the New Jerusalem. To talk this way is one thing, but to practice it is another. I would not count on that way. It would be good if each of us would gain one person within three years. If every member in the church could bring one person to the Lord and into the church life within three years, the church would increase by one third each year.<p>But how many among us even do this? Our way to preach the gospel is too old and stale. I still remember D. L. Moody&#8217;s story. He once vowed that he would not go to sleep without speaking the gospel to at least one person each day. Then one night near midnight, he realized that he had neglected to speak the gospel to anyone that day. He went out, but nobody was on the street. He could only find a policeman, so he went to him and tried to get him to believe in Jesus. But the policeman became very offended and angry. Later though, he became interested and found out who the man was that had preached to him. Eventually, that policeman got saved.<p>If you would have this kind of patience, this kind of spirit, surely within three years you would gain one. If you would have D. L. Moody&#8217;s spirit, even within three months you would gain one. It would be easy for you to gain four per year. Today, most of us are not living in small villages but in big cities. These big cities are big fishing ponds. Sometimes I feel that the fish are just longing to be caught, but we do not act, we do not move. So, we must pick up this new way. We are priests of the gospel. We must touch people. We must gain people. We must bring people to Christ. Every year we should bring forth one or two spiritual children that we may present them to the Lord as a present, an offering, a sacrifice.<p>Since I saw and began to speak concerning the new way, there has been much opposition. But, thank the Lord, most of the churches and most of the saints in the recovery have accepted the new way. However, to accept the new way is one thing; to practice it is another. Because of this, I am burdened to urge all of you who are in this meeting and all the other saints who are in the recovery throughout the world to practice the new way. We all have to learn to practice the new way that the Lord may have a way to go on among us today for the carrying out of His New Testament economy in building up the Body of Christ.<p>In Luke 14 the Lord says, &#8220;Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled&#8221; (v. 23). Have you ever compelled, forced, somebody to believe in the Lord Jesus? Some people are too spiritual, saying: &#8220;We cannot save people. Let the Lord do it. Do not force people. Do not compel people.&#8221; Yet the Lord Jesus tells us to &#8220;compel them to come in.&#8221; It seems more spiritual to say: &#8220;Just wait. Let the Lord do it.&#8221; But according to the Bible this is wrong.<p>There are too many things we can see in the New Testament that we do not practice. According to the New Testament, we first have to see that we are priests of the gospel and that we need to offer some sacrifices to God. Please do not say that you are only a sister, that you are old, that you are weak, that you are sick, or that you are not a professional preacher. The Lord Jesus would never let you take any of these excuses. Second, as a priest of the gospel, you must take action with patience. It is not so easy to get one person saved, and it is not easy to raise up one person. I have heard that some have brought many to the Lord, yet they were not able to bring one into the church life. If this is your case, it is because you did it without patience and faith. If you have the patience and faith, surely at least one of them will be brought to the Lord and will be brought into the church life. If you do not have the patience and faith, when you go to visit people, surely they will not believe. You may think: &#8220;This one is too shallow. There is no need to bring him into the church life. And that one is very rude.&#8221; When you want to save a person, you must love that person. Without love, without care, you cannot bring people to the Lord. Whether this one is lame, crippled, blind, or deaf, you must love him. Some of the saints among us in the past did not like these kinds of persons. They liked &#8220;perfect persons,&#8221; so they did not have the patience and faith that they could eventually bring people to the Lord. We must learn to exercise our patience and faith. God has assigned us to be priests, but we do not have patience and faith to keep practicing the priesthood. Now we have to pick up the priesthood and practice it with patience and faith that we may eventually offer some saved sinners as sacrifices to God. We must practice this by endeavoring with endurance, with longsuffering, with patience, with love, with care, and with faith.<p>A blind American sister, Fanny Crosby, wrote the hymn, &#8220;Rescue the perishing, care for the dying&#8221; (Hymns, #921). That hymn really inspires me. But for you to sing this hymn is only thunder without rain. You only sing; you do not go out to rescue anyone. The Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses have the patience to spend over six thousand hours to get one person. We have the pure gospel, the highest gospel, yet we do not have the increase because we do not go out to get it with patience and faith. You must go out. In one week you may gain nothing. In one month you may gain nothing. But by the end of one year, you will gain one, at least one drop of rain. Yet this is not too little. You have to treasure this one. It is good that the Lord has given us a new start. As priests of the gospel, we all have to go out and practice our New Testament priesthood.<h2 class=head2>Nourishing and Caring for the New Believers</h2><p>The second step is the feeding, the nourishing, of the new ones. This is much harder than gaining the sinners. To bring forth a child is hard but not as hard as raising a child. Day and night the mother and father would sacrifice everything for that child. However, among the Christians, very few would do this work. Sometimes we brought someone to the Lord, but after two months they died prematurely because they received no care. The New Testament is full of this matter of feeding. In the following messages, we will see how Paul did the nourishing, the feeding. Paul says that he cared for the believers as a nursing mother would cherish her own children and that he entreated and consoled them as a father his own children (1 Thes. 2:7, 11).<p>We must learn to feed, to nourish, the new ones whom we have brought to the Lord. They are just like newborn babes that need the feeding, the nourishing. In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus talked to Peter about the feeding of the small lambs (21:15). Most students and teachers of this Gospel concentrate their teaching and fellowship directly on the matter of life. However, after John seemed to conclude his Gospel in chapter twenty, he added one more chapter. In this additional chapter, the Lord checked with Peter: &#8220;Peter, do you love Me? If you say you love Me, you have to do one thing-feed My lambs.&#8221; All the mothers know that to feed or to nourish a little child is not a simple thing. When we look at the situation today, among the believers who are not pastors and preachers, who is doing this kind of feeding work? You cannot feed the lambs occasionally. You have to do it regularly, just like nourishing a little baby. You have to do it, not only daily, but many times a day and at certain times. Then the babe will be nourished; otherwise, it may die.<p>Even among ourselves today, we cannot see much feeding. Therefore, we are not serving the Lord according to the Scriptures. Do you believe that the word of the Lord, &#8220;Feed My lambs,&#8221; is spoken only to Peter but not to you? I do not believe so. Peter stood there before the Lord representing all of us. Whatever the Lord spoke to him is the same to us. Therefore, we must learn and endeavor to get into the practice of feeding the lambs. Regardless of who we are, as long as we are a believer, we are charged by the Lord to feed His lambs. One day, we will all stand before the Lord at His judgment seat to give account of ourselves in this matter (Rom. 14:10, 12).<h2 class=head2>Perfecting the Believers and Prophesying for the Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2><p>The third step, after the matter of feeding, is the perfecting of the saints. There is nearly no perfecting work being done on the believers today according to the truth of Ephesians 4:12. The last main step is to prophesy for the church, the Body of Christ, to be built up. Generally speaking, this practice does not exist today.<p>By all that we have talked about above, we can see that both Christianity and we ourselves are not practicing these four steps. The way we are taking to preach the gospel is not so scriptural. The feeding of the lambs is nearly absent. The perfecting of the saints has been neglected-nearly no one has been perfected. Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as the prophesying for the building up of the church, the Body of Christ, as an organism. Most of the Christians are building up a congregation for a facade, a show. Where is the organic building of the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ? This organic building could only be done by all the saints endeavoring to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, in the church meetings. But today, there is not such a thing.<h2 class=head1>FOUR PRINCIPLES OF OUR SPIRITUAL SERVICE</h2><p>Now we will fellowship some of the principles of the spiritual service which we should render to God. There are four principles we all have to see.<h2 class=head2>Our Service Must Be in the Body</h2><p>First, we must see that our service, our serving of God, must be as a member in the Body. This is why Paul, after so much teaching in the first eleven chapters of Romans, brought the saints to the matter of the Body in Romans 12. He said, &#8220;I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice&#8221; (v. 1). Based upon this, he went on to talk about the Body service (vv. 4-5). He said we all are members of one Body. Look at the members of your body; not one is independent. Every one, big or small, is moving, acting, functioning, in the body. Look at today&#8217;s situation. Needless to say we cannot see the Body, we cannot even see a proper group of Christians serving together. There are so many opinions, concepts, and different views. Who is wrong, and who is right? Eventually, everybody is not only wrong but also detached from the Body. You may be very right, but you are right and detached. Your hand may be clean, but it is detached. It would be better to be dirty and remain in the body, than to be clean and detached.<h2 class=head2>Our Service Must Be in Our Spirit and by the Holy Spirit</h2><p>The second principle of our spiritual service is that we must serve in our spirit and by the Holy Spirit. Without these two spirits, our service is nothing. Paul says, &#8220;God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel&#8221; (Rom. 1:9). He also says that we are those &#8220;who serve by the Spirit of God&#8221; (Phil. 3:3). We know this, but we do not practice it. Being filled with the Spirit and having the outpouring of the Spirit does not depend upon our feeling. It depends upon how much we are willing to take Christ&#8217;s cross. The cross must come; then Pentecost follows. We must take Christ&#8217;s death; then the Spirit will follow the crucified Christ. This is where our power is.<p>We must also learn not to serve by our natural ability or skill. We must learn how to look unto the Lord, how to trust in Him, and how to receive His death and put His death into our daily experience. We must also have the proper, adequate prayer. Then we will be people full of the Spirit. The Spirit will fill us within and clothe us without. We will be people having the Spirit acting in our spirit and working through our spirit, and we will use the power of the Spirit by exercising our spirit. This is needed in all of these four steps: in preaching the gospel, in nourishing the new ones, in perfecting the saints, and in prophesying. So many saints cannot prophesy because they are short of the Spirit. They are short of the Holy Spirit, and they do not know how to use their spirit, how to exercise their spirit. If they would practice to exercise their spirit to touch the Holy Spirit, eventually it would be easy for them to prophesy.<h2 class=head2>Our Service Must Be by Life</h2><p>Another principle is that our service must be by life, not by ability or gifts. We must learn how to minister life to others. Whenever we meet someone, we must learn how to exercise our spirit to dispense the living Christ with His living word into this person as life. Both feeding and nourishing imply the impartation of the life supply. The feeding of a child by its mother is a kind of life dispensing. Likewise, the matters of perfecting and prophesying could only be carried out by the Spirit with life.<h2 class=head2>Our Service Must Be for the Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2><p>Lastly, our service must be for the building up of the Body of Christ and not for our own work. Regardless of how long we have been serving in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we may not have rendered much building up to the Body of Christ.<p>We all need to see these four principles of our spiritual service to God. Our service must be: in the Body, in our spirit and by the Holy Spirit, by life, and for the building up of the Body of Christ.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO</h1><h1 class=title>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOSPEL PREACHING IN THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Luke 10:1-6; Matt. 28:18-19; Luke 14:21-23; 2 Tim. 4:2a; Acts 8:4, 29; 16:6-7</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the exercise and practice of the gospel preaching according to God&#8217;s ordained way. We praise the Lord that since the Lord&#8217;s ordained way was brought into the recovery, most of the saints and the churches have received it and are continuing in it. However, our exercise and practice of the new way is weak. We may accept the Lord&#8217;s ordained way, but we do not have much exercise or practice of it. What we need today is not merely to know what the new way is; we need to exercise in the new way.<p>If we are going to play a certain kind of ball game, we have to practice with the ball again and again. When I was young, I did not know how to ride a bicycle. Bicycle riding was not popular seventy or eighty years ago in the city where I was living. However, when I was living and working in Shanghai, I realized that I needed to learn to ride a bicycle. Some came to me and tried to teach me how to ride. I told them that I did not need teaching; I just needed to practice. First, I had to learn to get on the bicycle. I tried different ways, and sometimes while trying, I fell. Nevertheless, I learned how to get on the bicycle. Then I had to learn how to pedal the bicycle, but I did not learn by being taught. I fell down again and again, but I kept getting back on. Within about two days I was riding the bicycle with no problem. In the same principle, if we have such a spirit to practice the new way, we will be successful. We need to exercise to practice the new way.<h2 class=head1>THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL BEING THE FIRST THING TO PRACTICE IN THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h2><p>The first thing we need to practice in the God-ordained way for the New Testament service is the preaching of the gospel. We preach the gospel to get sinners saved, to bring them to the Lord. However, this is not the goal. The goal of saving sinners is to build up the Body of Christ. We have a burden to save sinners, but it is not only to rescue the perishing. If soul winning is the only goal of our gospel preaching, we are too shortsighted. We must have God&#8217;s sight according to His economy. From eternity past God had an economy. In His economy God wants the people created by Him to be saved for the building up of the Body of Christ. What God desires is not a group of saved sinners. God desires the Body of Christ. We must have a high and long-range view. With this view, we should bear the burden to preach the gospel. When we preach the gospel with this view, we are practicing our priesthood. The first aspect of the New Testament priesthood is for us to preach the gospel to make the saved sinners spiritual sacrifices to be offered to God for His acceptance (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5).<h2 class=head1>THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p>The New Testament opens with the preaching of the gospel. Before the Lord Jesus came, John the Baptist&#8217;s work was not only to baptize people but also to preach the gospel. He said, &#8220;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&#8221; (Matt. 3:2). John not only baptized people but also preached the gospel that people might be saved and brought to Christ. Following John, the Lord Jesus came. He also preached the gospel (Matt. 4:17). Luke 8:1 says that the Lord &#8220;journeyed from city to city and village to village, proclaiming and bringing good news of the kingdom of God.&#8221; Besides the cities on earth, there are many villages, smaller lodging places, that we need to visit. The Lord Jesus also sent out the twelve to do the same thing He did (Matt. 10:5). Even this was not adequate, so He sent out seventy to visit every city and place where He Himself was about to come (Luke 10:1). In our going out for the preaching of the gospel, we should not merely go to visit the cities. We have to visit all places. Even the Lord&#8217;s sending of the seventy was not adequate, so after His resurrection, He sent all His disciples, charging them to disciple all the nations (Matt. 28:19).<p>For the preaching of the gospel in the New Testament, John the Baptist went out, and then Jesus Himself. Then He sent the twelve and the seventy, and now He has sent all of us. He has sent all His disciples to visit the cities and every place for the discipling of all the nations (Matt. 28:19). Today the gospel has reached all races, all peoples, and all nations. However, the goal of the gospel is not only to save sinners, to win souls, but also to obtain materials for the building up of the Body of Christ. My burden is for us to see the urgent need for all of us to be in the exercise and practice of preaching the gospel in the God-ordained way.<h2 class=head1>FRUIT-BEARING BEING THE REAL ENJOYMENT OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2><p>Paul said, &#8220;For woe to me if I do not preach the gospel&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:16). Not preaching the gospel is a woe. The Lord Jesus said that if we, His branches, do not bear fruit, we will be cut off (John 15:2, 6). To be cut off is to lose the enjoyment of the full, rich supply of the vine tree. This is why many Christians are so poor in the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. They have lost the full enjoyment of the riches of Christ due to the fact that they have not borne fruit. If we do not bear fruit, we will be cut off.<p>Even though we do not bear fruit, we are still in the Lord, but we cannot have the real enjoyment of the rich supply of the life-juice of the vine tree. As long as we do not have the enjoyment of the rich supply of Christ&#8217;s life-juice, we have been cut off. Whether or not we have been cut off is determined by whether we have the real enjoyment of the riches of Christ. This is very serious. The main lack of many Christians is that they do not have a life of regular fruit-bearing. We must rise up to practice fruit-bearing.<h2 class=head1>AVOIDING DEBATE AND REDEEMING OUR TIME TO SAVE SINNERS FOR THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>Many Christians are fighting, debating, and arguing. Without exception, as long as Christians are occupied with fighting and debating, the result will be barrenness. Even though they feel they are fighting for the Lord and defending the truth, the issue of their fighting is that there is no fruit. Many times I have seen a group of Christians doing quite well until they began debating. Once they began to debate in the name of defending the truth, they began to decline in number.<p>Whenever debating comes in, the best way to stand against it is to &#8220;Go!&#8221; We should not care for debating but for getting people saved. We must go to get a number of people saved. Some may say that we are wrong if we care for numbers. However, the Bible cares about numbers. There is even a book of the Bible called Numbers. God told Moses and Aaron to count, to number, the people (Num. 1:2). We should number the people in the church in our locality (Acts 2:41; 4:4; 21:20). If we do this, we will be aware of our negligence in bearing fruit. Our urgent need is to go to get people saved. Instead of debating, we should prefer to save at least one person today. When we baptize someone into the Triune God, we feel glorious. The glorious way is to save sinners and count them.<p>If someone comes to us to debate about the truth, we should simply say that we do not have time for that. Then we may ask him if his parents and relatives have been saved. If they have not been saved, we can pray with him for them. We should not debate concerning what is right and what is wrong. We have not been appointed to be a judge, and we do not have time for debating. We must give our time to save sinners and to feed and nourish the young ones in order to help them grow.<p>We must go to visit people and preach the gospel to them. The Lord did not tell us to go to the &#8220;right&#8221; persons and not to go to the &#8220;wrong&#8221; ones. He simply told us to go! First, we should go to visit the homes (Luke 9:4). Then we should visit every city and place (Luke 10:1). Eventually, we must go to the entire world (Matt. 24:14; 28:19; Acts 1:8).<h2 class=head1>PICKING UP THE BURDEN TO PREACH THE GOSPEL BY GOING OUT TO VISIT PEOPLE</h2><p>Our first burden in this training is that every trainee would be burdened to go to visit people in order to preach the gospel to them. We must pick up this burden. We have no way to excuse ourselves. The Lord sent Himself first; then He sent the twelve and the seventy; and now He has sent all the disciples. The book of Acts records that a great number were saved in Jerusalem through the preaching of the gospel. On the day of Pentecost, three thousand were saved (Acts 2:41). Then Acts 4:4 says that &#8220;the number of the men came to about five thousand.&#8221; There were thousands of saved ones in Jerusalem, yet they would not go out. They all had become stuck in that city. Then the persecution came, and this forced them to go out (Acts 8:1). Acts 8:4 tells us that those who were scattered went about preaching the glad tidings of the word. Because of the persecution, they went out and the gospel was spread. As a result of their going out, the kingdom was spreading to many places and the church was being built up (Acts 9:31).<p>We must be the ones going out. If we cannot go out every day, we should go out at least once a week. Everyone can do this. At least one evening or one afternoon each week, we have to go out. We should go first to our &#8220;Jerusalem,&#8221; which means we have to go to our close relatives-our parents, uncles, aunts, cousins, in-laws, etc. Then we must go to Judea, to Samaria, and eventually to the remotest part of the earth (Acts 1:8).<p>We do not know who the chosen ones are. The Lord has chosen people &#8220;out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation&#8221; (Rev. 5:9). Only the Lord knows who is chosen. Luke 14 says we should &#8220;go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city&#8221; (v. 21), and then &#8220;go out into the roads and hedges&#8221; (v. 23). This means that we should go everywhere. We should not discern who is high or who is low. As long as they are people, we should bring them to the Lord. The Lord said to go out and bring in &#8220;the poor and crippled and blind and lame&#8221; (v. 21).<p>Some debating ones may say that we force people to believe and to be baptized, but the Lord charges us in Luke 14 to &#8220;compel&#8221; people to receive His salvation (v. 23). Before we were saved, we were not willing to seek after the Lord; we had to be compelled, forced, to receive His salvation. If we compel people to receive the Lord, we may wonder whether some of them are genuine believers. But only the Lord knows who the tares and the wheat are (Matt. 13:29-30), and the Lord did not tell us to try to discern the difference between them. The Lord told us to go to disciple the nations and baptize them into the name of the Triune God (Matt. 28:19). As members of the church, our first responsibility is to rise up and exercise to go out and preach the gospel in the new way.<h2 class=head1>THE ELDERS NEEDING TO TAKE THE LEAD IN THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>I would like to say a word to the elders. If you are a gospel preaching elder, the church in which you bear the responsibility will be a gospel preaching church. Therefore, the elders must take the lead to exercise in, to practice, and even to promote the preaching of the gospel. Every believer must go out to preach the gospel. I would beg every church to stand up and to rise up in the preaching of the gospel. The gospel preaching needs to be promoted in every locality.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THREE</h1><h1 class=title>DEFINITE STEPS NEEDED FOR PRACTICING THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1; 1:14; 1 Cor. 9:16-17; Luke 14:21-23</h1><p>In this message, I will fellowship first concerning the present situation among the churches in the Lord&#8217;s recovery and then present some definite steps which are needed for practicing the New Testament priesthood of the gospel.<h2 class=head1>OUR NEED TO RISE UP TO PRACTICE THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL TO GAIN PEOPLE FOR GOD&#8217;S KINGDOM</h2><p>To build up any nation there is the need of people. With only a handful of people, a nation cannot be built up. God wants to gain a large number of people for His kingdom. Some may disagree, saying that in Luke 12 the Lord referred to His disciples as a &#8220;little flock&#8221; (v. 32); but that was when the Lord Jesus was on this earth before His death and resurrection. He had not yet gone to the cross to die, to accomplish redemption, and He had not yet been resurrected. At that time He had only a handful of people with Him, mainly only twelve; so it was right for Him to call them a &#8220;little flock.&#8221; But after His death and resurrection, He spoke to them differently. He said: &#8220;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations&#8221; (Matt. 28:18-19). To disciple all the nations is to gain them to establish a kingdom. For this kingdom there is the need for a large number of people. Therefore, on the day of Pentecost, about three thousand were added to the church (Acts 2:41). Shortly after Pentecost, &#8220;the number of the men came to about five thousand&#8221; (4:4). Then in Acts 6 it says that &#8220;the number of the disciples in Jerusalem multiplied exceedingly&#8221; (v. 7). We must consider how our own situation compares with that revealed in the Bible.<p>We are here as a testimony of the Lord&#8217;s move on this earth in His recovery. Today in the United States, there are more than two hundred churches. This number is quite high, but very few local churches in the United States have over two hundred members. In southern California alone, there are twenty-five churches, but each church has only a small number of saints. We have had such a small number for nearly twenty years. During this time, the lack of increase in our numbers has been quite bothersome. This lack of increase has been not only with the churches in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, but also with all of Christianity. When I came to this country in 1958, I was told that half of all Americans were Christians. Today, after thirty-one years, it has increased just a little. The leading ones of the big denominations are bothered by their lack of increase. In Great Britain, nearly all the big denominations have been decreasing over the past fifteen years.<p>Within the last few years in the United States, the Southern Baptists have begun to take the way of door-knocking in their preaching of the gospel. They have done this because they realize that the way they have been preaching the gospel has not been working so well.<p>One of the brothers recently showed me a newspaper article which said that twenty years ago in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a church was raised up with seventeen people. But now they have ten thousand members. In twenty years, they increased from seventeen to ten thousand members. The article indicates that they did this by door-knocking, by visiting people in their homes.<p>In doing anything, if there is no profit or improvement, the way must be wrong. None of us should be self-content with the present numbers in the churches. Fifteen years ago the number of saints in southern California was bigger than it is today. This lack of increase troubled me to such an extent that I turned my whole attention to this matter in October 1984. At that time I purposely went to Taiwan to study this matter. Gradually, I found out that our way is wrong. Christianity&#8217;s way is wrong, and our way is also wrong because it has somewhat come out of their way. Although some improvements have been made, our way has been and still is in the same category as that of Christianity&#8217;s. In the matter of the gospel preaching, there is not much difference between our way and theirs.<p>I am sharing this because I am burdened that we all would wake up and no longer be contented with the present situation in the churches. We should be tired of coming together and seeing the same faces in meeting after meeting. We need some new members. If there were a lot of new ones in this meeting, everyone would be excited. The reason so few are saved and baptized among us and the reason that most of the baptized ones do not remain in the church life is because our way is wrong.<p>What has been the result from our old way? We all have to admit the fact that we have not had the proper increase in the churches. Some local churches were much larger in the mid-1970s than they are today. This is a shame to the Lord, and we should feel shameful. We should not be contented, and we should not deceive ourselves. It is a shame for us to remain in the recovery, day after day and year after year, with little or no increase. My burden is that we would all wake up and rise up to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel to gain people for God&#8217;s kingdom.<h2 class=head1>THE FOUR MAJOR STEPS OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h2><p>The Lord showed me the new way, and I presented it to the saints, beginning in Taiwan. Since that time, the new way has been opposed, despised, belittled, mocked, and even slandered. Some of us even today would not use the term the new way. It seems that to mention the new way is a shame. This is wrong.<p>Although some have said that the new way, the God-ordained way, is wrong, no one has dared to condemn any of the four major steps of the God-ordained way. No one can condemn the preaching of the gospel by the New Testament priests of the gospel going to visit people in their homes. They may say: &#8220;What is new about preaching the gospel? We did that a lot.&#8221; But that was in the way which is really old, and this is in the way that is revealed in the Scriptures as God has ordained. This is new. Even the term the New Testament priests of the gospel is new to us, although it is clearly mentioned in Romans 15:16.<p>To serve sinners by visiting them where they are is the God-ordained way to preach the gospel. By the time of Acts 8, there were thousands of believers in Jerusalem, but the Lord allowed a great persecution to come upon them so that they were scattered abroad to preach the gospel. They did not hold big meetings. They simply went to visit people and shared with them the good news of the word (vv. 1, 4).<p>The second step of the God-ordained way is the feeding of the lambs, the care for the new babes. We must feed them properly day by day that they may live and grow. Certainly no one can say that this is wrong. The third step is the perfecting of the saints according to Ephesians 4:12. We do not practice this, but it is in the Word.<p>The last step of the God-ordained way is to prophesy for the building up of the church as revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. This is altogether not practiced today. Many still consider that to prophesy is merely to predict, but 1 Corinthians 14 does not refer to this kind of prophesying. To prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 is to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to minister Christ into others that they may grow up in Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ. Who can oppose such a marvelous practice? These are the four major steps that I have condensed from my study over the past four and a half years. These four steps are what we call the new way. It is new to us because we have not practiced it. This new way is the way that God has ordained for us to serve Him.<h2 class=head1>PRACTICING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY PERSISTENTLY</h2><p>Although you may not oppose the new way, you may not practice it persistently. You cannot go out to visit people just for a period of time and expect to gain quite a number for the Lord. In a hot and dry place like southern California, you cannot water your flowers or your lawn only once or twice within one or two months. That does not work.<p>The Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses put out some statistics for the twelve countries in which they gained the most people in 1987 and 1988. In Japan, they spent more than six thousand hours to get one person. If they worked ten hours a day for one year, that would only be three thousand six hundred fifty hours. They spent over two years, working daily for hours, to gain one person. Their persistence has produced results. We all love the Lord, and we love to see people saved. We are for the preaching of the gospel. In one year, in three hundred sixty-five days, can we not bring one person to the Lord? This is both logical and fair. Many of us, however, have been in the church for years, yet no one has been saved through us. This is because our way of gospel preaching has been wrong.<p>If we went out to visit people for the gospel twice a week for two or three hours each time, we may get fifteen or so baptized after two months. But suppose not one was brought into the church life. Would we stop going out? To stop going to visit people with the gospel means we do not have the persistence, patience, or faith needed to be a New Testament priest of the gospel. In one year, we may only be able to bring one into the church life out of many baptized ones. That may seem too poor, but if every member in a church brings one new one into the church life in a year, the church is doubled.<p>We all must exercise our persistence, patience, and faith to visit and preach the gospel to people. In Luke 14, the Lord told us that when there were still vacancies in His salvation, He sent out His slaves to get people to fill His house. He first sent them &#8220;into the streets and lanes of the city,&#8221; and then He sent them &#8220;into the roads and hedges,&#8221; not just to invite them, but to &#8220;compel them to come in&#8221; (vv. 21-23). We need to compel people to believe in the Lord Jesus.<p>If we baptize a number and still do not bring one into the church life, we must exercise the Lord&#8217;s persistence, patience, and faith. We should say: &#8220;If I cannot gain one this year, I will gain one next year. If I do not gain one next year, then I will gain one the following year.&#8221; Eventually, we will gain someone for the Lord&#8217;s testimony. If each saint gains one new one every three years, the church will have a thirty-three percent increase yearly. According to my study, no church on this earth has ever increased consistently by thirty-three percent for many years. The way of persistently preaching the gospel by visiting people is not only profitable but also prevailing. We must all go out to exercise and practice this God-ordained way to preach the gospel. Whether we are meeting together with twenty, one hundred, or one thousand, we all must practice our New Testament priesthood of the gospel by going out to visit people with persistence, patience, and faith. Then we will surely bring some into the church life, and many others will also believe and be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.<h2 class=head1>THE DEFINITE STEPS NEEDED FOR PRACTICING THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>We need to see the definite steps needed for practicing the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. We may agree with the new way, but this does not mean much. We must also exercise and practice it.<h2 class=head2>The Elders&#8217; Leadership and Stirring-up Action</h2><p>The first definite step needed for practicing the New Testament priesthood of the gospel depends on the eldership. The elders in every local church should exercise their leadership in preaching the gospel. As the New Testament priests of the gospel, they have to preach the gospel, and they have to stir up a gospel preaching atmosphere in their local church. The elders must take the lead to create such an atmosphere so that their church can be a gospel preaching church according to God&#8217;s ordained way. All the elders need to forget about the old way and pick up the new way. They should go out by themselves to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel.<h2 class=head2>The Saints&#8217; Determination and Consecration</h2><h2 class=head3>Presenting Our Bodies to God as a Living Sacrifice</h2><p>The saints need to make a determination and consecration. We must all make a strong determination that we will practice our God-given New Testament priesthood. Because of our determination, we have to consecrate ourselves, to present our bodies as living sacrifices to God (Rom. 12:1). The best way to exercise and to practice is to preach the gospel to our close relatives-to our parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. By doing this we will learn.<h2 class=head3>Praying and Being Revived</h2><p>Then we have to pray desperately. In our prayer, the Lord will shine over us. We will be exposed under His shining, and we will see all our failures, defects, and imperfections. We can then make a thorough confession and be revived by the Lord. We should not remain in our present passive situation. We must be aggressive and take the initiative in the spiritual life.<h2 class=head3>Going to Visit Sinners on Definite Days</h2><p>After being revived through our prayer, we must go to visit sinners on definite days to redeem our time. We must set aside a certain day and time each week and only use it for our priesthood of the gospel. We should not say that we have no time. As long as we have time to do other things, we surely have time to visit sinners.<h2 class=head3>Exercising Persistence, Patience, and Faith</h2><p>Then we must exercise persistence, patience, and faith. If we do not gain anyone in one year, we must thank the Lord that He has given us another year. We must be persistent. We still have to preach the gospel. If we speak Christ to others week after week, we will surely gain someone. Eventually, we will reach the goal. We all must exercise in the gospel with persistence, patience, and faith.<h2 class=head3>The Churches&#8217; Participation and Prayer</h2><p>To practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel requires the churches&#8217; participation and prayer. The churches should participate in the saints&#8217; labor of visiting sinners with the gospel. The churches should also have prayer meetings to pray desperately for this. It is a great matter for the church to participate in and pray for the saving of sinners.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>POINTS FOR FULFILLING THE PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; John 15:16; 1 Cor. 15:58; 2 Tim. 4:2</h1><h2 class=head1>COMING TO THE LORD AND GOING TO SAVE SINNERS</h2><p>In our hymnal, there is a precious hymn which says:<p class=hbody>&#8220;Must I go, and empty-handed?&#8221; Must I meet my Savior so? Not one soul with which to greet Him: Must I empty-handed go? (Hymns, #930)<p>The story behind the writing of this hymn is very touching. A number of years ago, a certain saint was dying and was full of regret for not having brought anyone to the Lord. A servant of the Lord told this saint that he would write a hymn that would help others in the coming years to rise up to take the time while they are still living to save sinners. The matter of saving sinners is something which all of us need to seriously consider. If we were to go to meet the Lord this very day, what would our condition be related to this matter?<p>Within the past four and a half years, the Lord has led me to raise up this matter of gospel preaching. I did not have any intention to raise up a doctrine or concept. My burden, which I believe was of the Lord, came from my realization that most Christians today, including us, do not have the real and sincere burden to save sinners. Some may have such a desire, but they do not have the proper way to carry out their burden. Therefore, the result has been poor.<p>I began to study the Word to see the way which God ordained related to gospel preaching. From such a study we have now seen that the way which is ordained by God is for the believers to go to people. In the New Testament, the word &#8220;go&#8221; is a big word. Another big word is the word &#8220;come.&#8221; I gave one or two crucial messages concerning these two words while I was in Shanghai more than forty years ago. I said that in the New Testament, there are two words which are crucial. The Lord says, &#8220;Come to Me&#8221; (Matt. 11:28; John 6:37; 7:37). Then after we come to the Lord, He tells us to &#8220;go&#8221; (Matt. 28:19). He desires us to come to Him and then go to others. After the word &#8220;come&#8221; is the word &#8220;go.&#8221;<p>Actually, the preaching of the good news is the very propagation of Christ Himself in His person and in His wonderful redemptive work. As long as we preach Him through the power of the Holy Spirit, such propagation should not be opposed or criticized. If there had been no opposition within these past three years, by now many thousands of sinners would have been brought to the Lord, and there would have been a very high revival among us. Instead, this matter of visiting sinners to preach the gospel to them has become a subject over which some would debate. What a shame this is!<p>In the New Testament, the primary matter is to come to the Lord and to come to Him continually. We need to come to Him. Then after coming to Him to touch Him, He will tell us to go! The more we come to Him, the more He will trouble us to go. It may be that He will trouble us to go to another country or to go to our parents. My experience is that, almost without exception, whenever I come to the Lord, He always charges me to go.<p>He charges us to go with Himself. We must go to our relatives and to everyone with Christ. God&#8217;s kingdom is spread by our going and by our preaching. This is God&#8217;s ordained New Testament principle, but without our willingness to go, His principle cannot be carried out.<p>He has never charged His angels to do this because the preaching of the gospel is fully based upon the principle of incarnation. God lives with man, and man works with God. Without the mingling of God with man, without the incarnation of the divine person with the human person, God cannot accomplish His purpose. In Acts 10 an angel went to Cornelius and told him to send men to Joppa to get Peter (Acts 10:3-6). This was done so that Peter could come to Cornelius in order to preach the gospel to him. As a young person reading this portion, I asked myself, &#8220;Why would the angel not preach to Cornelius?&#8221; Later, I saw the principle that we are saved by men, not by angels. As men we should not only go and preach the gospel but also pray for the ones to whom we would preach. Without our going, our preaching, and our praying, men cannot be saved.<p>We do not need to pray to see if it is the Lord&#8217;s will for us to preach the gospel. If we are considering marriage, then we should pray very much. However, related to preaching the gospel, the Lord simply says for us to go and disciple the nations (Matt. 28:19). Paul said we should preach the gospel &#8220;in season and out of season&#8221; (2 Tim. 4:2). This means that we need to preach the gospel whether the opportunity is convenient or inconvenient and whether we are welcome or unwelcome. Whether the time is in season or out of season, we have to preach the word. The Lord said, &#8220;Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them&#8221; (Luke 14:23). We have to go to gain the people for the Lord.<p>Once we go to preach the gospel, we will be revived, and we will see the church in our locality revived. The Devil is the one opposing the preaching of the gospel. If he can stop us from preaching the good news for another five years, the issue will be death. This is his goal. Within the last few years, the saints in Taipei have become convinced that they need to preach the gospel. They are all of the same mind to go to preach the gospel. Because of this their attendance at the Lord&#8217;s table, which was three thousand five years ago, has now become five thousand.<h2 class=head1>POINTS FOR FULFILLING THE PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL</h2><h2 class=head2>Not Needing to Wait for Others</h2><p>I have the burden to stir us up to go out to preach the gospel, but in order to preach the gospel effectively we need to practice certain practical points for fulfilling the priesthood of the gospel. Some may say that they do not know how to preach the gospel. If we have this feeling, we should still go and preach the gospel. We should not wait! A good number of us may have been stirred up. If we have seen the need for us to preach the gospel, and we are burdened, we should pray and fellowship with some who are close to us. They may also have the same burden. Then we can go. There is nothing wrong with our going. There is no need for us to wait for the elders to do something. Furthermore, the elders do not need to wait for someone else to do something. Anyone who is burdened should just go to preach the gospel.<p>A brother gave a testimony concerning how his grandfather labored to visit people for Christ. His grandfather worked in a bakery in Germany. His work began early in the morning at four o&#8217;clock, and he worked there over ten hours a day. Upon returning home, he washed and dressed, took his Bible, and went to visit people. He did this nearly every day. He went to the unbelievers and to the believers. This was his habit. Through his going to visit people, he helped a large number of saints each year. I believe some surely were saved through his contact with them.<p>If you could gain one person within a year, that would be wonderful! In preaching the gospel, we need to be like farmers. All the farmers know how to trust in God. Farmers have to labor patiently and persistently, but regardless of how much they labor, without God&#8217;s blessing, a single storm can destroy all their work. We should go out to visit people as farmers. We should labor with patience and put all our trust in God.<p>We do not need to wait for anyone. We should just go. Some saints may say, &#8220;To preach the gospel is good, but I don&#8217;t feel I should go.&#8221; They may not say this openly, but deep within them they may have such a feeling. Therefore, we should not wait on others. If we decide to wait for others, heaven and earth may pass away before they pick up the burden to preach the gospel. We should not wait; instead, we should gather one or two who are close to us. We may want to get one younger one and one older one to go with us.<p>Where shall we go? We can go anywhere! We should go to visit people by knocking on their doors. This &#8220;door-knocking&#8221; is our going by faith. If we gain one within a year, that is very good. Throughout history it is difficult to find a church that has grown by thirty percent yearly. But if we all gain only one within three years, the church where we are will have a thirty-three percent yearly increase. If we continue to go to people&#8217;s doors for three years, I believe we will gain at least one person. Instead of reasoning, we should simply go to preach the gospel.<p>It is good if we can give the Lord either two afternoons or two evenings weekly. There is the way to do this, especially in this country. Many of us are off from work on Saturday and the Lord&#8217;s Day. We can give part of these two days to the Lord. Also, on the other days of the week we may work only eight hours a day, which gives us time in the evenings. If we give the Lord two of our evenings each week for visiting people, we will still have five evenings for other matters. We should go out regularly and consistently every week. Our going out is not for our pleasure but for His pleasure. It may be a suffering to us, but it will be a pleasure to Him. If we have a desperation to live in this way, we will gain some for the Lord. We may not gain one the first week, but in the following weeks at least one will be gained for Him.<p>We do not need to try to get too many. It is best not to try to baptize more than you can care for in a good way. We all know God&#8217;s principle in nature. It takes nine months to conceive one child. A mother can only have one delivery within a year. Therefore, we should give the best care to one whom we have baptized. This is more profitable than to have a large number of baptisms if we do not have the way to care for them.<p>Within a certain period of time, perhaps two or three weeks or even two months, we will see two or three baptized. Then we need to spend time with them, caring for them as our babes. We need to feed them, nourish them, and cherish them. Our cherishing will make them happy. We may need one or two years to take care of them. Then they will grow. We will bring forth fruit, and our fruit will remain. Bearing remaining fruit is a long-range labor. It does not depend on luck, but upon our diligence, patience, persistence, faith, prayer, and labor. If we love the Lord and desire to live for His kingdom, we will go persistently and regularly to preach the gospel and care for the new ones that we gain.<p>From the very beginning of the Lord&#8217;s recovery in mainland China, Brother Nee did much preaching of the gospel. He was a student in a small college of about five hundred students. After he began to see the recovery, the first thing he did was to preach the gospel. He preached to everyone, and his preaching reached all the students. Then when I came to the recovery, we used to go out to the streets to preach during the evening. Many people were brought in. At the beginning of the recovery, the preaching was very high and very prevailing.<p>When we went to Taipei, we printed enough tracts for every citizen in Taipei. Then we printed gospel posters with big characters and posted them at the railway station, the bus stops, the crossways, and all the crucial places. The posters said things like &#8220;God loves the world&#8221; and &#8220;Believe in Christ.&#8221; We formed gospel teams. Every Lord&#8217;s Day afternoon, we went to a park in Taipei that had an area with about three thousand seats. Every Lord&#8217;s Day afternoon, we filled that place and collected more than four hundred names. The next day, Monday evening, the saints came together, and we classified the records of the names according to their streets. Then we distributed their names to the saints so they could care for them. Hundreds were saved through this effort, and many of them are now elders in the churches. Some of them even have grandchildren in the church life now. In recent years we have been too silent. In those early times in the church life, we stirred up the whole city with the gospel. Eventually, everyone in Taipei knew there was a group of people preaching the gospel.<h2 class=head2>Going by a Team</h2><p>When we go to preach the gospel, we should go in teams of three. After many years of experience and study of the Bible, we have found that this is the most economical and effective way for gospel preaching. We must first be stirred up and then pick up another two saints to form a team to go to visit people.<p>There is no need to wait for the elders to announce a prayer meeting to pray for this or to prepare a register with names and regulations for the teams. We should forget all this and just go! Then maybe the elders and others will follow us to preach the gospel. We should not try to &#8220;unify&#8221; the church into the practice of gospel preaching. From 1949 through 1955 in the church in Taipei, the gospel atmosphere was quite high, but still the entire church was not &#8220;unified&#8221; into the practice of the gospel preaching.<p>In going out as a team, it is best that there are both brothers and sisters. It is best to have at least one brother for baptizing the believers, and it is best to have at least one sister so that if a female is baptized, the sister can take care of her. A team of three, with two brothers and one sister or one brother and two sisters, would be very good. Our experimenting and testing in Taipei has shown that this way will produce results. We need to go in the trained way. I may go to play the piano for two years, yet without being trained I will still not know how to play the piano well. In order to preach the gospel effectively, we must pray and endeavor to learn the secret of gospel preaching.<h2 class=head2>Getting Ourselves Prepared</h2><p>To prepare ourselves to preach the gospel, we first must consecrate ourselves, give ourselves, to the Lord. We must tell the Lord: &#8220;Lord, I was saved by You. I belong to You. You redeemed me. You purchased me. You bought me. I am Your property. I am Your asset. I belong to You, so now I give You Your full rights. I am here.&#8221; Then we must pray and prepare ourselves to use some material in order to preach the gospel to someone. We may want to use some Bible verses, but still we need training in order to be able to talk with someone. We may prefer to use The Mystery of Human Life. It is not simple to use this booklet. We have to get ourselves into it until we can nearly recite every paragraph and every section. We can practice at home with the members of our family. Thirty-eight thousand were brought to the Lord through the use of The Mystery of Human Life. We have to give ourselves to be trained. If we humble ourselves, we can be trained.<p>We even have to learn how to knock on a door. This means that our knocking must sound &#8220;sweet.&#8221; When the people within open the door, the first sentence out of our mouth should cause them to open the door wide, and the second sentence should open their heart. Our wrong attitude or tone of voice may cause them to close the door. We can practice knocking on doors at home. A husband can knock on his wife&#8217;s door, and let his wife criticize him. It is not too much for us to practice like this. When a young girl is learning to play the piano, she sits for hours at the piano. She is always being adjusted by her teacher. Her teacher is always showing her how to hold her fingers, how to sit at the piano, etc. Otherwise, she cannot learn to play the piano well.<p>In the same way, we must give ourselves to be trained in how to talk with people and how to bring people to the Lord. We must learn when to bring them to the Lord and what words to speak to them. We must exercise and practice. We even have to learn how to be coached by our companions. This means that we must learn to be adjusted. As we practice, we will improve week by week. We need to consider whether people would be caught by our way of talking to them. We have to study and be patient, always learning and always trying. We should never be disappointed or discouraged. Rather, we should always exercise to be encouraged.<h2 class=head2>Trying to Make an Appointment before Visiting Others</h2><p>It is very helpful to try your best to make an appointment with certain ones whom you are going to visit through others who know them. You can make an appointment through your relatives, through your classmates, or through your colleagues. After preaching the gospel to your colleague, you may ask him to recommend you to his relatives or neighbors. Then you can telephone this person before going to visit him so that you may get to know him over the phone. We must learn to pick up many ways to go to people to get them saved. This is just like doing business.<h2 class=head2>Avoiding Offending Others</h2><p>The church in our locality may not be stirred up to preach the gospel, yet we may be stirred up. Those of us who are stirred up to preach the gospel need to be careful not to have an attitude that will offend those who have not yet been stirred up. In the church, we must be very general in our attitude, but we must be very faithful in our work. We should neither oppose door-knocking nor be too much for door-knocking. We should always be general in our attitude. There is no need to boast, but rather, we should always exercise not to offend one another. Whatever we do should be done in a wise and proper way.<h2 class=head2>Bringing New Ones to the Church Meetings</h2><p>We should bring the new ones to the church meetings right away. We were cautious in bringing the new ones to the church meetings in Taipei at first because the church meetings had become old. This was a valid concern, but also somewhat of a loss. If you baptize one and only go to his home for a few weeks, it becomes more difficult to bring him to the meetings of the church. It may create a habit in him of just loving and preferring to have home meetings. If you go out today and one gets baptized, you should suggest to him that tomorrow you will bring him to a meeting of the church. You must do everything you can to help him get to a church meeting. The best way is to give him a ride. This is the proper care of the newly baptized ones.<h2 class=head2>Inviting the Unbelieving Ones to the Church Meetings</h2><p>It is also good to invite the unbelieving ones to the church meetings. We can let them know when the church in our locality will have a meeting. We can offer them a ride and bring them with us. It is good to have some tracts or other literature to leave with them which have the address of the church meeting hall. Then on a certain day, the Holy Spirit will work to burden them to go to the church meeting.<p>Paul said that our labor is not in vain in the Lord (1 Cor. 15:58). If we will labor for the Lord in many ways, some results will issue forth. You may visit someone this week, and it may seem that nothing has happened. Then another gospel team may go to visit them, and they will be baptized. Such a thing happened in Taipei. One man was finally convinced by the fifth gospel team that came to visit him. He got baptized, fully expecting a sixth team to come to him if he put it off longer. He became convinced because of the persistence of the saints. He rejected them four times, but he received the Lord when the fifth team came to visit him. This is a good example of our need to go and to continue to go. We must go until the unbelievers become convinced and subdued. We should not only go to them, but also invite them to come to the meetings. We should invite everyone. We should keep going until they get convinced and subdued. Sooner or later they will receive the Lord and be baptized. We all must be very exercised to see this carried out.<h2 class=head2>Having Home Meetings with the Baptized Ones Right after Their Baptism</h2><p>After bringing someone to the Lord and baptizing him into the Triune God, we should begin to have home meetings with him right away. We should not delay in having the home meetings.<h2 class=head2>Giving Testimonies of the Good Cases in the Church Meetings without Long Storytelling</h2><p>After gaining some for the Lord, it is good for us to testify of some of the good cases in the church meetings in order to encourage others. Such testimonies in the meetings of the church will be convincing to others. However, these testimonies should not be too long, or they will become boring. If we will speak for one or two minutes, others will also have time to testify, and more saints will be convinced by many testimonies.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>HOW TO CARRY OUT A SUCCESSFUL CONTACT WITH THE SINNERS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 15:16; Rom. 15:16</h1><p>In the New Testament, the Lord&#8217;s first call to us is, &#8220;Come&#8221; (John 1:39; Matt. 4:19). Then after we have followed the Lord, His first charge to us is, &#8220;Go&#8221; (John 15:16; Matt. 28:19). The Lord charges us to &#8220;go forth and bear fruit.&#8221; To carry this out there is the need for us to contact the sinners. However, to my observation, not many Christians are successful in contacting sinners. In this message we will fellowship concerning how to carry out a successful contact with the sinners.<h2 class=head1>REALIZING OUR SOLEMN RESPONSIBILITY TO GO FORTH AND BEAR FRUIT</h2><p>To bear fruit we first need to be clear that if we have been saved by the Lord, we have also been charged by the Lord. This is a serious matter in the Bible. Our Lord is also our Master. One day the Master will come and set up a judgment seat, and He will call us to come before Him and be judged (Rom. 14:10; 2 Cor. 5:10). In Matthew 25:14-30, we are His slaves, and He is the Master. He has given each of us some talents as capital with which to do business for Him, and He requires that we make a profit. The slothful slave came to his lord and said, &#8220;Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter; and I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours&#8221; (vv. 24-25). He did not lose anything of his lord&#8217;s, yet he was rebuked. His lord said to him: &#8220;Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter. You ought therefore to have deposited my silver with the bankers, and when I came I would have recovered what is mine with interest&#8221; (vv. 26-27).<p>This parable in Matthew 25 applies to each of us. We were redeemed; we were &#8220;bought with a price.&#8221; Therefore, we are His slaves, and He is our Master (1 Cor. 7:22-23). The first thing the Master wants us, His slaves, to do is to invest the talent or capital He has given us, that is, to do business for Him. The profit from our doing business for the Lord is the fruit. We are not only slaves; we are also branches, ministers, and priests. As slaves we must use what the Lord has given us to do business for Him; as branches in the vine, we must bear fruit; as ministers of Christ, we must minister Christ into others; and as the New Testament priests of the gospel of God, we must handle the gospel daily. We all must realize our solemn responsibility before the Lord to be faithful in each of these aspects.<p>To the worldly people today, it seems that the Lord is silent. They have heard about Christ; they have heard about Jesus; but they do not care. They would say: &#8220;Where is Christ? Where is Jesus? You have been preaching and talking about Him. But where is He?&#8221; The unbelievers may talk in this way, and many believers may have similar feelings. Inwardly they may say: &#8220;Christ told us He was coming quickly, but nearly two thousand years have passed and He is not here yet.&#8221; Because of this kind of thought, most Christians today live sloppy lives. In doing so, they disobey or disregard the Lord&#8217;s charge to go forth to save sinners.<p>Many Christians love John 15 because it teaches us how to abide in the vine, how to enjoy the riches of Christ. However, in verse 16 the Lord says, &#8220;You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain.&#8221; The Lord did not choose us without a purpose. His choosing was for His appointing. He has appointed us for three things: first, we should go forth; second, we should bear fruit; and third, our fruit should remain. In this matter we have no choice; the Lord requires that we accept our appointment.<p>Regardless of how much we have spoken concerning this, there are some who think: &#8220;That is good! There is nothing wrong with preaching the gospel. If He has burdened that brother so much, then he should go. But I do not feel burdened to go. Surely, if the Lord wanted me to go, He would have burdened me.&#8221; We may not speak this, but this may be in our heart. One day, when we stand before the judgment seat of Christ, we will have to give an account of what we have done. If we have not been faithful, we will have to tell the Lord why we did not bear fruit, and the Lord will rebuke us. He may even remind us of this message concerning John 15:16 and ask why we would not take His charge to bear fruit.<p>Some say that they are busy and do not have any time. This is not true. If our house were on fire, we would not say: &#8220;I am too busy. I do not have time to take care of the fire.&#8221; What we have time for depends upon what we consider is more important. But regardless of whether we have the time or not, whether it is in season or out of season, we have no choice. It is not up to us. He is the Master, and He has charged and is still charging us to go forth and bear fruit. He will not let us go. This is very serious. If we do not bear fruit, we will be cut off from the enjoyment of the riches of the vine (John 15:2a, 6).<h2 class=head1>BEING SERIOUS AND DESPERATE TO GO FORTH AND BEAR FRUIT</h2><p>If we see that we have been charged by the Lord, we will have a heart to carry out a successful contact with the sinners. We must be serious, earnest persons. We all have to do a job to make a living. The sisters, as wives and mothers, have to take care of their households. But if they have seen that they have been charged by the Lord, their hearts will not be fully occupied with their households. Although they take care of their responsibilities properly, their deep desire should be to go out to visit people with the gospel, to contact and gain sinners.<p>The Lord is hungry for sinners. In John 4 He told His disciples: &#8220;I have food to eat of which you have no knowledge&#8221; (v. 32). The Lord&#8217;s food was to gain the sinners. When He gained that immoral woman, she became His food. That satisfied His hunger. We all must realize that the Lord is hungry and is waiting to be satisfied.<p>The lack of gospel preaching today in Christianity is shameful. Christians may like to talk about many things in the Bible except fruit-bearing. In John 15 abiding is not merely for abiding. Abiding is for fruit-bearing. The Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away&#8221; (v. 2). To be taken away is to be cut off from the vine. Many Christians have already been cut off; they do not have the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. Some may say, &#8220;I have not brought one person to the Lord for six years, yet I enjoy the Lord very much.&#8221; This is based upon their feelings, not upon the fact. The fact is that they have not borne fruit. Fruit-bearing is the real evidence that we genuinely enjoy the Lord. His Word tells us clearly that if we do not bear fruit, we will be cut off.<p>We have to realize that we have been charged by our Master, and then we must be serious and desperate to go forth, to bear fruit, and to keep our fruit. This depends upon the Lord&#8217;s appointment in John 15:16. This appointment indicates that He has prepared an environment to accommodate our every need so that we can bear remaining fruit. The Lord has prepared and arranged all of our situations so that we can carry out our appointment. Verse 16 is like a mother telling her children, &#8220;I have cooked that you should eat.&#8221; If they do not eat, they will miss the opportunity. Today, many Christians are missing the opportunity. The Lord has appointed; He has arranged everything. Especially for those of us in the United States-what a good appointment we have received! We have not been appointed to live alone on a high mountain. People are everywhere. Furthermore, He has given many of us jobs for only eight hours a day, five days a week. Every evening we have three or four hours, and every weekend we have two days. This is according to the Lord&#8217;s arrangement and appointment. In addition, the Lord has given us many relatives. There is an environment and situation that is just right for us to gain people. When we meet the Lord, we will have no excuse because, by His appointment, He has prepared the environment with all the situations that we need for bearing fruit. The only problem is that we would not go forth. We must take this very seriously. It is not a matter of merely fulfilling our duty; it is a matter of life or death. We must be serious, earnest, and desperate to go forth to gain people for the Lord.<h2 class=head1>PRAYING FOR THE SINNERS&#8217; SALVATION</h2><p>To have a successful contact with sinners, we must be those who pray at all times (1 Thes. 5:17; Luke 18:1). While we are working, we must be praying for one or two of those with whom we work. We should pray: &#8220;Lord, remember these ones that I am burdened for. You desire all men to be saved. Remember them and visit them with Your salvation.&#8221; We must be persons who pray day and night without ceasing. God&#8217;s desire for man&#8217;s salvation requires our prayer for it to be carried out (1 Tim. 2:1, 4).<h2 class=head1>LEARNING TO SPEAK CHRIST, TO SPEAK BY THE SPIRIT, AND TO SPEAK ACCORDING TO THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>In contacting sinners, we must learn to speak Christ. This is not easy. It is easy to talk about common things, but to speak Christ requires much exercise. Not only must we speak Christ in a general way, but we must also learn to speak Christ in a particular way. The enemy is very subtle. Whenever we share the gospel with a sinner, sooner or later the sinner will try to stop our speaking. When we are speaking Christ, our mouths should never be stopped by the unbelievers. This cannot be learned easily and requires much practice. Every time we go out to preach the gospel, we should first practice speaking Christ for at least ten minutes in our home. We all must practice speaking Christ. If we practice speaking Christ all the time, it will become easier for us, and we will become rich in speaking Christ. Then, regardless of how the unbelievers respond to us, we will be able to speak Christ to them in a particular way that they may be saved. Sometimes we may need to speak a short story concerning Christ, but this should not be a long &#8220;sea story.&#8221; If we practice, we all can learn to speak Christ to the sinners.<p>We must also learn to speak by the Spirit. If we are going to speak, we must speak by the Spirit. To speak Christ and to speak by the Spirit will save us from all kinds of meaningless talk. But I cannot tell you what you should speak. The Lord said, &#8220;When they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you shall speak; for it shall be given to you in that hour what you shall speak; for you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you&#8221; (Matt. 10:19-20). When we speak to people, our heart should be always looking to the Lord. We should not speak anything but Christ, and we should speak only by the Spirit. These are the governing principles. If we keep these two principles, the Spirit will lead us to speak the right words.<p>Now that we have been charged by our Master to go forth and bear fruit, we need all these items as our preparation. We need to be serious, earnest, and desperate in our desire to bear fruit. We need to pray for the sinners&#8217; salvation continually, and we need to learn to speak Christ, to speak by the Spirit, and to speak according to the leading of the Spirit. We can practice these things in two ways. First, we can speak Christ by the Spirit in our homes. We can speak Christ to the air and speak to the air by the Spirit. While we are speaking, we should practice looking unto Him to receive the leading of the Spirit. We can all practice in this way. The other way to practice is to go to your close relatives and speak Christ to them by the Spirit under the Lord&#8217;s leading. By this kind of practice, we will learn a lot.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO GO FORTH AND BEAR FRUIT</h2><h2 class=head2>As a Team</h2><p>When we go to contact the sinners, we should not go by ourselves but as a team. According to our study, it is best to have a team of three with two brothers and one sister or one brother and two sisters. Because we are going to baptize people, there should be a brother to do the baptizing. Furthermore, the ideal team would have an old one, a young one, and a middle-aged one. To have these three different age levels is very useful. It may be hard to form such an ideal team, but we should do the best we can. Once we have formed a team, each member must learn to bear his own particular responsibilities.<h2 class=head2>With the Proper Coordination</h2><p>When we go out to preach the gospel, we must first learn how to knock on a door or ring a doorbell in a proper way. If we go to a sinner and ring the doorbell in a wild way, this may offend him, and he may not open the door to us. Even if he opens the door, he may not talk to us because we have made him unpleasant and unhappy. We must learn to do everything in a way that is pleasant to people. No one can teach us this; we must learn it by practice.<p>The team members must be frank with one another in determining who is the best for each responsibility. Who is the best one to ring the doorbell? We should not be too polite or humble but frank and honest with one another, and we should not be offended by the other team members. One on the team is the best to ring the doorbell in a way that does not offend people. Another may be best at greeting people when they come to the door. We have to learn this as a team. We all were born with different dispositions and appearances. We should have a person greet them with a smiling face that would make everyone happy. Among the three on a team, one may be best at ringing the doorbell, another may be best at greeting people with a pleasant face, and the third may be very smart in answering people. This is a team with a proper coordination. In principle, we must practice in this way. These small steps lay a foundation for our contact with sinners.<h2 class=head2>Answering according to the Spirit</h2><p>If we want to be successful, we must learn to answer people in a proper way. The way we answer means a lot. If we answer properly, this man will be saved. If we do not answer properly, this man may perish. It is a matter of life or death. For this matter we have to pray very much, &#8220;Lord, help us in answering people.&#8221; If we pray much and trust the Lord, the Holy Spirit will surely give us the best words at the right time. It depends upon how the Lord would lead us. Sometimes the Spirit may lead us to say, &#8220;We are not Mormons or Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses,&#8221; because at that moment, they were considering that we might be Mormons or Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses. They were tired of that kind of person. We must learn not to speak in a common way. By following the leading of the Spirit, we can answer people properly. Then our speaking will not offend them, but it will stir up some interest within them.<h2 class=head2>Taking Control of the Situation</h2><p>After we go into someone&#8217;s home, we should not be shy or fearful. We do not need to be afraid. If they will not ask us to sit down, maybe one on the team would say: &#8220;Let us sit down. We would like to read this little booklet with you, The Mystery of Human Life.&#8221; When we get into their home, we should not leave the situation under their control. We must learn to take control of the situation in a pleasant way. Then it will be easy for us to speak. We can go directly to the booklet The Mystery of Human Life. To use this booklet, we must become very familiar with its contents, and we should not follow it legally or read every word. In a living way, in a striking way, in an attracting way, we should present the points to them from this booklet. Then when they are ready, we can lead them to call upon the name of the Lord. We should not speak too much, and we should not waste any time.<p>While we are talking to a person, we also have to discern what kind of person he is. About thirty years ago in Taipei, I classified human beings into more than thirty classifications. Some people were born stubborn, and some were born humble. Some people will agree with anything. From their talk, you can realize that they are loose persons. To them, whether they go to heaven or hell, whether they are baptized or not, whether they believe Buddha or Jesus, it is all about the same. We should not put any trust in such a person. Even if he is willing to be baptized, perhaps we should not do it. We may waste our time on such a one. We have to exercise much discernment in this matter.<h2 class=head2>Selecting the Promising Ones to Raise Up</h2><p>In our going, we should not be anxious to get many people baptized. We should not bring forth too many children. If we baptize twenty-one, these twenty-one will exhaust us. We will not be able to raise one properly. If each of us baptize only three, we can spend all our energy to raise up these three children in a proper way.<p>When we talk to people, we should exercise to realize what kind of persons they are. Then the Spirit will lead us to know what to do. We should not be so anxious to get them baptized. If no one is baptized tonight, we still have tomorrow. If no one is baptized this week, we still have next week. If no one is baptized this month, we have next month. Even if we cannot baptize one this year, we have next year. We all must have this kind of attitude. Our goal is first, to get people saved, and second, to get the saved ones into the church life for the building up of the Body of Christ as a living testimony. Through our experiences we have learned that to bring people to Christ is not as hard as to bring the saved ones into the church life. If we brought one out of twenty baptized ones into the church life, that would be marvelous. If we went out about once a week, maybe for only forty-five weeks in one year, we could easily baptize twenty to thirty. Then if we could get one out of these twenty to thirty into the church life, that would be wonderful. This is a word of experience. We should not be anxious but learn how to exercise our discernment.<p>If we practice earnestly, after three or four weeks of going out, we can surely get two or three baptized. Although our discernment is not always accurate, in principle, we have to exercise our discernment regarding these two or three. If we realize that none of these are that promising, we should go on to get more baptized until we can get two or three that we consider to be quite promising. Then we should stop getting people saved for a while and use our time to take care of these newly baptized ones. Because it is difficult to bring someone into the church life, we must do this in a selective way. Of course, we have to realize that our selection might not be so accurate. While we are selecting, we must trust in the Lord that He will lead us. Then we can concentrate our labor and our time to feed and to raise up these few just like our own children, and we can be quite hopeful that they will be brought into the church life. If we can bring only two out of thirty baptized ones into the church life within a year, that will really be marvelous.<p>If we take this fellowship and put it into practice by teams, each team can baptize about thirty people within one year. I believe that two to four of these can be brought into the church life. I do not expect all the church members to go out to preach the gospel in this way. Some are not so healthy or have other reasons. After much study I feel that as long as one-third of our members practice visiting people for the preaching of the gospel, we will have good success. Out of one hundred fifty meeting together, fifty must be burdened and charged to go out in this way.<h2 class=head2>The Need for Instruction</h2><p>Visiting people in this way is not easy. We cannot do it according to our natural way. It is something we must learn. In order to do anything skillfully, we must be trained. If we desire to play basketball, we cannot play it in a natural way. We must be coached. If we want to play the piano, we need instruction and training. In like manner, to preach the gospel successfully, we must be trained. In Philippians 4 Paul says, &#8220;The things which you have also learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things&#8221; (v. 9). Because Paul was a person absolutely for God, he not only received the vision, but he also practiced what he saw. Then he trained Timothy, saying, &#8220;I write to you...that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God&#8221; (1 Tim. 3:14-15). Timothy did not know how to walk, how to behave, in the church of God, so Paul instructed him. Every chapter in 1 Timothy is full of instruction. Paul instructed Timothy in a detailed way. Surely Timothy had to exercise. When he spoke to a young sister, he had to practice the proper way (5:2). When he spoke to a young brother, he had to speak in a different way (5:1). Today we desire to learn of the Lord so that we can be useful in His hand. Eventually, the Lord will gain a people through whom He will be able to fulfill His New Testament economy to build up His own Body. Then He will come back.<h2 class=head2>Immediately Spending Time with the New Believers</h2><p>After we baptize someone, we should stay to talk to him. If time allows, we should talk to him for two hours. We should not go away quickly. After a mother delivers a child, she should nourish this little babe with milk right away. We have to stay as long as possible to give the new ones their first feeding. Then we should go back at least within three days. If we do this, we will surely raise up some of these new believers. In raising them up, we must try to bring them into the church life. If we carry out the proper feeding, nourishing, and cherishing of the new ones, there will be a good possibility that they will be brought into the church life.<p>This is the way for us to carry out a successful contact with the sinners. When I say successful, I mean that we would not only bring them to Christ and baptize them but also raise them up as genuine believers growing in life and bring them into the church life. I hope we would all try to take this way and practice what we have fellowshipped in this message.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIX</h1><h1 class=title>THE GLORY AND JOY OF THE BELIEVERS IN BEARING FRUIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 15:8-11; 1 Thes. 2:7, 11, 19-20</h1><p>The first crucial item in the Lord&#8217;s move on the earth is gospel preaching. We are stressing not only gospel preaching but also the God-ordained way of preaching the gospel. Today gospel preaching among most Christians is virtually bankrupt. Supposedly the United States is the top Christian nation on the earth. There may be as many as one hundred twenty million Christians in the United States, and many Christian broadcasts are sent over the air waves. However, very few of these millions of Christians have the burden to personally go out to preach the gospel of Christ. This is the present situation among most of the Christians in America.<h2 class=head1>THE FATHER BEING GLORIFIED BY OUR BEARING FRUIT</h2><p>We may like the matter of abiding in the vine, abiding in Christ, which is found in John 15. We may desire to be those enjoying the unsearchable riches of the vine. However, John 15:8-11 does not stress abiding only; it also stresses fruit-bearing. If we bear fruit, the Father will be glorified. The Father will not be glorified just by our abiding. He will be glorified only if we are bearing fruit. Only fruit-bearing can release the Father&#8217;s divine life. When we bear fruit, the very divine life which is in the Son, the vine, is released.<p>As we are abiding in the Son, we are absorbing the life which is in the vine. We are participating in the unsearchable riches of the life-juice of the vine. Sooner or later, the life we have been absorbing will be released. When this life-juice is released, it issues in fruit-bearing. Fruit-bearing is the issue, the result of our enjoyment of Christ. It is this releasing of the life-juice that expresses God. In the releasing of the life-juice, the Father is glorified.<p>An illustration of such a release can be seen in the carnation flower. If the carnation does not bloom, then its glory, its beauty, remains hidden. When the carnation does bloom, the inner life of the carnation has been released. This is the glorification of the carnation. We cannot appreciate the beauty of the carnation if it has not blossomed. The carnation is hidden, and the beauty of its life is not yet expressed. Once it blossoms, its life is expressed; its life is glorified. The blossom is the glorification of the carnation. In the same way, our fruit-bearing is God&#8217;s glorification.<p>Some in Christianity may say that we glorify God by doing something good. They do not realize that the Father does not want us just to do good things or just to express Him in Christian ethical duties. He wants us to express Him in bearing fruit for the vine tree&#8217;s increase and enlargement. The increase and enlargement of the vine is the Father&#8217;s glorification. Have you noticed how particular the Lord&#8217;s words are in this portion of John 15? He says, &#8220;In this is My Father glorified&#8221; (John 15:8). &#8220;In this&#8221; refers to fruit-bearing. If we bear much fruit, the Father is glorified.<p>In John 15:9 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;As the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love.&#8221; We Christians like to talk about love. We like to say that God loves us. From my youth, I was taught to sing the hymn which says, &#8220;Jesus loves me this I know, for the Bible tells me so.&#8221; Here the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;As the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you.&#8221; What kind of love is this? The Father has loved the Son in the Son&#8217;s expression of Him. The Father is happy and joyful that the Son is His expression. The Son has loved the disciples in the same principle. The Son wants the disciples to be His expression. An illustration of this principle is in the book of Genesis. When God created man in His own image (Gen. 1:27), this was an expression of His great love.<p>God loved the Son that the Son may express God, and the Son has loved us that we may express Him. &#8220;As the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love&#8221; (John 15:9). To abide in His love makes us His expression. He tells us of His love, and then He charges us to express Him. To bear fruit is to express the Son. The Son charges us to bear fruit which means that the Son loves us to the uttermost. What a privilege! What a right the Son has given us that we may bear His fruit. Just as the Father charged the Son to express the Father, the Son charges us to express the Son. He charges us to abide in His love, not just to abide in Him. It is not adequate simply to abide in Him. We must abide in His love.<p>We abide in His love by bringing Him forth into people for His expression. Our preaching the gospel is to bear fruit, to bring forth Christ into people, making them Christ&#8217;s fruit, Christ&#8217;s expression. When we bring Christ into a sinner, he becomes Christ&#8217;s very expression. Verses 8, 9, and 10 of John 15 are all connected. If we keep the Lord&#8217;s commandments, we will abide in His love (v. 10), we will bear fruit (v. 8), and the Father will be glorified (v. 8). When we bear much fruit, the Father is glorified more.<h2 class=head1>THE NEW BELIEVERS BEING OUR GLORY AND OUR JOY</h2><p>In John 15:11 the Lord said, &#8220;These things I have spoken to you that My joy may be in you and that your joy may be made full&#8221; (v. 11). To be branches of the divine vine and to bear fruit to express the divine life is a matter of joy-a joyful life. Many saints have had the experience of being in ecstasy when they have baptized one into the Triune God. They have testified that after bringing one to the Lord, they were unable to sleep well throughout the whole night because the Lord&#8217;s joy had become their joy.<p>First Thessalonians 2:19-20 says, &#8220;For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting? Are not even you, before our Lord Jesus at His coming? For you are our glory and joy.&#8221; In John 15:11 the Lord refers to our joy being made full. In 1 Thessalonians 2 Paul refers to our joy again. What is our joy? Our joy is the fruit that we bear. These two portions of the Word are related. John 15:11 should be referenced to 1 Thessalonians 2:19-20.<p>What is our joy? What is our glory? What is our crown of boasting? Christ&#8217;s joy is our joy. The Father&#8217;s glorification is our glorification. In John 15 and in 1 Thessalonians 2, we have these two words-glory and joy. To Paul the fruit borne by him was his glory and his joy.<p>When the Lord comes and you stand before Him, who will stand with you and for you? What will you say? Suppose you have never brought anyone to the Lord. This means that you have never borne any fruit. You may say: &#8220;Lord, look at Your talent. Your talent is in my pocket. I didn&#8217;t lose it. I&#8217;ve been keeping it.&#8221; For us to say this to the Lord when He comes will be a shame to us, not a glory or a joy (Matt. 25:24-30). My burden is to pass on this God-ordained way to you. If you will take the God-ordained way, you will be a new person, a person bearing fruit.<h2 class=head1>THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL AS A PART OF OUR DAILY CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2><p>Who is preaching the gospel in these days in the way which God has ordained? Some Christians are preaching the gospel, but their preaching is mostly being carried out in an old, traditional way. There is an urgent need for some of the Lord&#8217;s people to be brought into the realization that we should be gospel preachers who impart Christ into others, thus making others a part of Christ, an expression of Christ, which is a glorification of the Father. This must become a regular part of our daily life. Gospel preaching should not be an occasional matter. We need to preach the gospel regularly as a part of our Christian life. Even though we have been fellowshipping this matter for almost five years, not many have entered into such a regular gospel preaching Christian life. Our main burden is to drop the old, traditional way of preaching the gospel and to pick up the God-ordained way of preaching the gospel as a part of the Christian life.<p>This God-ordained way of preaching the gospel as a part of our Christian life is very workable. It depends upon whether we would take it and whether we have heard the Lord&#8217;s word spoken to us. His word to us is that we should abide in Him that we may bring forth fruit that He may be expressed and enlarged. For the Lord to give us such a charge is the greatest love. If the president of the United States would charge you to represent him, how would you feel? Such a charge would make you feel very dignified. His charge to you would be an expression of his love toward you. You would not tell him you are too busy or simply not interested in representing him.<p>Since I have been speaking concerning the God-ordained way for the past five years, many helpful matters have been discovered. But who among us would care to see the God-ordained way carried out? In the United States, God has arranged the situation for His children to live a proper life according to His Word, but most of God&#8217;s children in this country have abused God&#8217;s arrangement. Many Americans need to work only eight hours a day, leaving at least two to three hours in the evening free for them to do other things. Many are also free two days each weekend. Seeing how much free time we have, could we not separate just two or three hours during two of these days each week? Many of us can do this. If we live a regular life and budget our time, we can easily separate two periods of two or three hours each for fruit-bearing. This is the keeping of the commandment of the One who loves us, who has exalted us to such an extent that we can be His expression.<p>This is what the New Testament teaches, but today there are not many Christians on this earth who will live such a life. Even if one-third of the saints in a locality have such a practice, the situation will be glorious. We can begin our labor in the gospel with our closest relatives. They are our &#8220;Jerusalem.&#8221; From our closest relatives, the circle of our gospel preaching can be enlarged to Judea, to Samaria, and then to the remotest part of the earth (Acts 1:8).<p>There must be a beginning point. We must be very definite in our going out to preach the gospel. We must make a budget. We should not be uncertain in any point. Furthermore, we should not have an unrealistically large budget. If we try to go out every day, we will probably fail. For the long run, it is probably best to go out just two days each week. This is a more practical budget for those brothers and sisters who must work at a regular job and for the sisters who have families to care for at home. Set your budget to go out twice a week during two set days, each time for two or three hours. Do it regularly, constantly, and definitely, unless you are too ill to go out. Disregard your emotions and just go out. Budget yourself in this way.<p>Your going out must always be in a very regulated way. It is good to go in the Body. Visit people as a team. Even if you are going to see one of your close relatives, it is very good to bring one or two saints with you, especially if your relative may know one of the saints. He may have an open ear to such a one.<p>Once you have baptized two or three, you should consider spending more time with them. It may be that you will not have the way to go out to bring additional new ones to the Lord for a period of time. Instead, you may need to spend all your time caring for your two or three new ones. You probably will need one year&#8217;s time in order to raise up a person in the Lord. It is very similar to rearing children. All mothers know that rearing children is neither fast nor easy.<p>You may begin to realize that the two or three whom you are laboring on are not very promising. You should not drop them, but you have to consider whether or not it is profitable to spend so much time with them. If it is not profitable, you should go out to get two or three more. Laboring in the gospel is like the work of a farmer. When one farms, he must discern the soil, the land. Nothing may grow on a certain piece of land. If this is the case, the farmer must leave it and farm the land that really produces. We still must exercise to be careful because our discernment may not always be dependable.<p>If we practice this way year round, surely we can bring at least one promising one into the church life each year. It depends upon the degree to which we will give ourselves for such a life. If we really give ourselves for this, it may be that each of us can bring three persons into the church life each year. We do not need to be a full-timer to achieve such a result. It simply depends upon our regular labor. We must labor regularly every week and every year, regardless of the weather or other factors. We must learn to preach the gospel as a child learns to play the piano. Without training, nothing can be learned.<p>After gaining people we must spend adequate time to nourish, to cherish, and to raise them up as our spiritual children. Paul likened himself to a nursing mother (1 Thes. 2:7) and an entreating father (1 Thes. 2:11). He was both a mother and a father to his spiritual children. The shortage among us has been in not raising up the children. After delivering the children, many times we have forgotten about them. We must take the new way in caring for our spiritual children. Please do not think that such a practice comprises the entire church life. Our going out twice a week for two or three hours should be just a small part of our church life. Additionally, we should attend the Lord&#8217;s Day morning meeting, the prayer meeting, and other meetings of the church. Going out to visit people twice a week is just a part of our normal church life.<p>Endeavor to be trained to go out. Fellowship with the saints in your locality. If you come together as a team, you will find the best way to get people to open to you and the best way to answer their questions. If you do this regularly for one year with a humble spirit and attitude, empty and willing to learn, you will become a real expert in preaching the gospel.<p>Christianity has been praying for a revival for many years. We should not pray in this way. We should pray: &#8220;Lord, raise up one-third of the saints to preach the gospel. Let these one-third make up their mind and pick up the burden to practice this new way as their duty, as a part of their daily Christian life.&#8221; If in every church one-third can be raised up in this way, there will be a real revival among us after only one year&#8217;s time. This kind of revival is not by emotion but by the fact of fruit-bearing. If two-thirds of the saints can be raised up in this way, we will see at least one hundred percent increase yearly.<p>A good number of us must make up our minds to take this God-ordained way of preaching the gospel and practice it by forming teams to go out regularly to visit people to bring them into salvation. We must go to them again and again to have home meetings with them and to nourish them, to cherish them, and to feed them. After a while, we will bear remaining fruit as a result of our going in the way ordained by God.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>BEING FLEXIBLE IN THE WAY OF REACHING PEOPLE IN GOSPEL PREACHING</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Luke 14:15-23; 1 Cor. 9:19-23</h1><h2 class=head1>THE FOUR STEPS OF OUR NEW TESTAMENT SERVICE</h2><p>Our service to the Lord in the New Testament includes preaching the gospel and meeting regularly for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose. After much study I found that there are four steps in this New Testament service.<p>The first step is the preaching by the New Testament priests of the gospel to save sinners for God&#8217;s satisfaction (Rom. 15:16). The second is to feed the new believers. Right after their baptism, we should begin to feed, to nourish, the new ones. John 21:15 says: &#8220;Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon...do you love Me more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My lambs.&#8221; Here the Lord specifically tells us to feed His lambs, the new believers. Right after the delivery of her child, a mother begins to nourish, to feed, her baby. Without the proper nourishing, a newborn babe will die.<p>The third step in our New Testament service is the perfecting of the saints. It is not enough just to feed the young saints; we also have to perfect them. After a certain amount of growth in life, they have to be perfected that they may be able to build up the Body of Christ in the same way the gifted persons do. The Lord has given gifts to His Body-apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers-&#8220;for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&#8221; This is clearly revealed to us in Ephesians 4:11-12.<p>The fourth step is that all the saints should be trained in order to be brought into the practice of prophesying for the Lord in the church meetings. This point is clearly revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. According to this chapter, to prophesy does not mean to predict, or foretell, but to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord Himself that we may minister or dispense Him into others. With the genuine prophesying, people will not receive mere doctrines or teachings, but our speaking will minister Christ to people as their food supply.<p>Thus, there are four steps of our New Testament service revealed in the Bible: to preach the gospel, to feed the lambs, to perfect the saints, and to prophesy for the building up of the church.<h2 class=head1>REPLACING THE LORD&#8217;S DAY MESSAGE MEETING WITH THE ORGANIC PROPHESYING BY THE SAINTS</h2><p>First Corinthians 14:26 reveals that when the church comes together, each one has something of the Lord to share with others. This is very different from a meeting where a preacher or minister gives a message to a congregation. Over a period of time, this kind of meeting with one man speaking and all the rest listening will kill the development of the spiritual functions within every member. Therefore, we all have to pursue, desire earnestly, and seek after the excelling gift of prophesying (vv. 1, 12, 39).<p>Among Christians today we cannot see the practice of the organic prophesying for the building up of the church, and there is no record of such a corporate practice in Christian history. Brother Nee saw the need for church meetings in mutuality over fifty years ago. In 1937 he spoke the messages which are published in The Normal Christian Church Life. In this book Brother Nee says that the big Lord&#8217;s Day morning meeting with one man speaking and the rest listening has no place among the meetings of the church. In 1948 Brother Nee gave the messages contained in Church Affairs. At this time he was much stronger. He said that the Lord&#8217;s Day message meeting in which one person speaks and the rest listen is according to &#8220;the customs of the nations&#8221; (2 Kings 17:8, NASB). He charged us all to persistently push against this unscriptural tradition and work to tear it down.<p>On the one hand, to have one man speaking edifies the saints; but on the other hand, to have only one man speaking annuls and kills the spiritual function, ability, and capacity of every believer. Because of this practice, many Christians have been fully annulled in their spiritual function and capacity. Very few know how to speak for the Lord. This is the situation in Christianity today, and among us it is nearly the same.<p>I began a thorough study of the New Testament service in October 1984. In my study I remembered Brother Nee&#8217;s words. In 1948 he strongly repudiated the big Lord&#8217;s Day message meeting and asked all of us to exercise considerable strength to overthrow this damaging tradition. I had heard all these things, yet in 1949 when I came out of mainland China to Taiwan, I did not put these things into practice. Later, I was full of regret for this and asked the Lord to forgive me. Then I sounded the trumpet, saying that the Lord&#8217;s Day morning meeting with one man speaking and all the rest listening should be annulled.<p>Although I sounded the trumpet in this way in Taiwan in 1984, for over three years I did not propose for the church in Taipei to stop their Lord&#8217;s Day message meetings. Over three thousand saints attended these meetings. They were all influenced and deeply impressed that the best meetings were first, the Lord&#8217;s table, and second, the Lord&#8217;s Day morning message meeting. They liked the message meetings because they were all nourished by the messages that were given Lord&#8217;s Day after Lord&#8217;s Day. To suddenly stop this kind of meeting would have been a damage to the church. Instead, I spent over three years to train the brothers and sisters. Then in November of 1987, the elders in Taipei decided that it was time for them to stop the Lord&#8217;s Day morning message meeting, and they began to practice the organic prophesying as revealed in 1 Corinthians 14.<h2 class=head1>REACHING PEOPLE BY GOING TO WHERE THEY ARE</h2><p>In this message I have no intention to stir up a so-called revival. In over sixty years of Christian experience, I have found that the way of big revivals does not work. What really works is the way ordained by God and revealed in the New Testament. The God-ordained way to preach the gospel is by every believer going to visit people to preach the gospel to them personally and directly. The New Testament charges us to &#8220;go!&#8221; (Matt. 28:19; Mark 16:15). We must go to reach people by visiting them where they are. To visit people for the gospel preaching is not merely to knock on doors; it is to reach people where they are. The Lord Jesus Himself went to reach people (Matt. 4:18-22; 9:9; John 4:1-42), and He also sent the twelve to do the same (Luke 9:1-6). Then He sent seventy to go into every city and place to find the homes of the sons of peace (Luke 10:1, 4-5). Physically speaking, as one person, the Lord could not go to many villages to visit that many people, so He sent the seventy to do this visiting work.<p>The basic principle in preaching the gospel is for you to go to people; do not ask them to come to you. If you will go to them, you will see that this makes a big difference. Go to a sinner&#8217;s home to visit him. Sit down with him and talk to him. Take the lead to pray with him, asking him to follow you. Then you could say: &#8220;Because you have prayed to the Lord Jesus and have believed in Him, you are now qualified to be baptized. Let us baptize you in the bathtub.&#8221; This is absolutely different from inviting people to come to you. Many of the saints have been quite successful in preaching the gospel in this God-ordained way.<h2 class=head1>BEING FLEXIBLE IN OUR WAY OF REACHING PEOPLE</h2><p>We must be flexible in our way of reaching people in the gospel preaching. What does it mean to be flexible? Human beings are very legalistic. We easily make everything a legality. In the full-time training in Taipei, because there were so many large high-rise apartment buildings, we instructed the trainees to always turn to the left after leaving a door. In that kind of building, there might be over eighty units on one floor, so this kind of instruction helped the trainees make efficient use of their time. But in the United States, we do not have so many large high-rise apartment buildings. Many people live in single houses. To rigidly practice this kind of &#8220;turning to the left&#8221; in the United States may not work so well because the situation is quite different.<p>The best way for the saints to visit homes is to form teams. Ideally, a team should have three persons, one older, one younger, and one middle-aged, with either one sister and two brothers or one brother and two sisters. But in the United States, many have taken this as a legality. Because we could not get an older one or a younger one, we would not form a team. Therefore, nothing is done because of our legality. We all must learn to be flexible. This does not mean that I am annulling my previous fellowship. If you practice those things, they will work; but it all depends upon the situation.<h2 class=head1>DIFFERENT WAYS TO REACH PEOPLE WITH THE GOSPEL</h2><p>Do not think that the only way to reach people is by going as a team of three. There are many ways to visit people. In this message, I will present a number of different ways to reach people with the gospel.<h2 class=head2>Visiting Our Close Relatives</h2><p>The first and best way is to visit your close relatives. Suppose you go to visit your grandfather. Although your grandfather loves you, he may not listen to you, so you should take some mature brothers with you. Then when you go to visit your grandfather, he will listen to these brothers and get saved and baptized. What you could not do in twenty-five years of preaching to him, these brothers could do in a short visit.<p>You also have many other relatives to reach with the gospel. You should make a list of all your relatives and go to visit each one. You do not need to knock on strangers&#8217; doors. A stranger may slam the door in your face. Those are &#8220;cold doors.&#8221; You better go first to the &#8220;warm doors.&#8221; Your close relatives would never slam the door. You have the right to visit them. There are so many &#8220;warm doors,&#8221; so many close relatives, for us to visit with the gospel.<h2 class=head2>Visiting Our Neighbors</h2><p>The second group of people we have to visit is our neighbors. We all have neighbors, and we may have lived by our neighbors for many years. We are Christians who love the Lord and are in His recovery. We are seeking Christ and desire to live Christ, abide in Christ, enjoy Christ, and experience Christ; yet after so many years, our next-door neighbor may still not be saved.<p>Is this a proper situation? The Lord says: &#8220;He who abides in Me...bears much fruit. [But] every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, [the Father] takes it away. You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain&#8221; (John 15:5, 2, 16). The Lord said, &#8220;I appointed you.&#8221; Because we are branches in the vine, we have been chosen and also appointed. Our appointment, our future, and our destiny is to bear fruit. This is why Paul says, &#8220;For necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:16). We all must have this kind of realization.<p>Some may say, &#8220;As long as I have been saved, I will go to be with the Lord in the heavens.&#8221; Surely they will go to the heavens, but in the heavens the Lord will ask, &#8220;How much fruit have you borne for Me?&#8221; If we do not bear fruit, there is the danger that we will lose the enjoyment of Christ in this age. Then in the future at the Lord&#8217;s coming, He will ask us to give Him an account of ourselves (Rom. 14:10, 12). If we have not gained a profit for the Lord, He will say, &#8220;Cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness&#8221; (Matt. 25:26-30). This word in Matthew 25 is quite serious.<p>The Lord has burdened me to warn all of the brothers and sisters concerning our solemn responsibility to bear fruit and the serious consequences of not doing so. If I did not warn you, I would be responsible before the Lord, and your blood would be upon my hands (Ezek. 3:18-19; Acts 20:26-27). If you do not bear fruit, you will be cut off from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ today, and in the future, you will be condemned as an evil, slothful, and useless slave and cast into the outer darkness. This is the necessity that has been laid upon you to preach the gospel.<p>We should not be discouraged; the Lord still allows us to live. Even as an old one, I believe the Lord will give me more years to live that I might bear more fruit. We need only bring one person to the Lord and to the church within one year. Some may feel that it is too hard to bear one fruit per year. I would tell them to try going out for fifty-two weeks, only once a week. If within fifty-two weeks they still could not gain one, they should not worry; the Lord is teaching them patience. They must continue to go out for another fifty-two weeks without worrying about not gaining one. They must simply do their duty one week at a time. If after the second year they do not gain anyone, they still have the third year. If in three years they could bear only one fruit, they should not consider that a small thing.<p>According to my study of history, there has never been one church on this earth which has continually increased by thirty-three percent each year. If every saint could get one person saved within three years, this would produce a thirty-three percent increase each year. In history, there never has been such a church, so we should not despise gaining only one in three years. If we could all do this, it would be marvelous.<p>Many sisters do not have a job, but they stay home to take care of their little children. A sister can build up quite a good relationship with her neighbors so that all the neighbors know that she is a good and proper person and that she is training her children very well. They may like to have their children go to her home, and she can open a small childrens&#8217; meeting class with about five children. The best time is in the afternoon when the children come back home from school. Many mothers would like to have a good neighbor to take care of their children, and their children need the other little ones to be their friends. Gradually, she could have more children, perhaps as many as fifteen. Through these children, every family&#8217;s door will be open to her.<p>There are many ways to reach people. If you cannot think of a way, pray: &#8220;Lord, I want You to tell me what I should do. I am desperate. I must bring some person to You. You must give me a way.&#8221; The Lord may tell you to just go out and stand in front of your house every day from five to six in the afternoon. You would stand there and do nothing but watch all your neighbors coming home. This may seem very strange, but after one week, someone may stop and talk to you. This is your opportunity.<p>In a big denomination in Seoul, South Korea, they trained the sisters to contact their neighbors. Seoul is a big city of about ten million people. They have many large high-rise apartment buildings. Many ladies go to the grocery store with their children. They have to buy their things and bring them home while trying to care for their children. That denomination found out that there was such a need, so they sent some sisters to wait at the elevator door for the ladies returning from the grocery store. When one would come to the elevator, they would say: &#8220;May I help you? I will carry this bag for you. I will take care of this child.&#8221; That opened many doors to those sisters.<h2 class=head2>Visiting Our Friends, Colleagues, and Schoolmates</h2><p>We must also visit our friends, colleagues, and schoolmates. Everyone has a friend, a colleague, or a schoolmate. If you are teaching school, all the teachers and staff are your colleagues. If you are a student, you have many classmates. First, we should try to build up a good feeling between ourselves and our colleagues or schoolmates. Then we can talk to them about Christ and make an appointment to visit them. We can ask them to give us a time to speak with them. They may try to avoid this, but if we are persistent, eventually they will give us a time to visit. Then when you visit, it is always good to bring a saint with you.<h2 class=head2>Using the Telephone to Make Appointments</h2><p>We all must learn to use the telephone wisely. The telephone can be very useful. Today there are some telephone salesmen who make over a million dollars a year. They are constantly calling people, one after another. We can use the telephone to make appointments with people to talk to them about Christ. We may even use the telephone book to call people. Simply pick a name and call: &#8220;Sir, I got your name from the phone book. I am a Christian who loves the Lord Jesus and would like to talk to you for a short time.&#8221; Most would reject you, but maybe three out of a hundred would receive you. Then you can visit these three.<p>Nearly every day my mailbox is full of business advertisements. This is a bother to me, and I throw all of these advertisements away. One day I asked, &#8220;Why do these businesses waste their money by printing and mailing all these things?&#8221; Then I found out that if they receive only a one percent response, they will not lose any money. Usually they will get a three percent response, and they make money. We should not expect that every house will have a son of peace. Actually, most doors will have wolves (Luke 10:3). In one night we may knock on twenty-five doors and meet nothing but wolves who reject us. This happened to many saints, but when they came to the last door, they got inside and found a son of peace. We do not know when we will find a son of peace. For a hundred and four weeks we may not get one. Yet the next day we may find a son of peace. We simply have to exercise our persistence, patience, and faith. I do not believe someone can go out continuously, regularly, once every week for fifty-two weeks, and still not catch one fish. If you are persistent, surely you will catch one. The Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses and the Mormons do not have the way to make many appointments because they have a bad name. Not many would give them an appointment. But we are different; we are Christians. We can call people on the phone and tell them: &#8220;I am not a Mormon or a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness. I am a Christian loving the Lord.&#8221; Surely some will answer in a positive way, and this will open some doors.<h2 class=head2>Making Appointments by Purchasing Something</h2><p>If a brother goes into a stationery store to buy some stationery, and there are no other customers in the store, he can buy something, and, of course, the salesman will be happy. You should not miss such an opportunity to speak to people. It may be good to have a card printed with your name, address, phone number, and something to indicate that you are a real Christian. Then at such an opportunity, you can hand the salesman your card and say, &#8220;I would like to talk with you about Christ for only a few minutes.&#8221; Do not talk too much because that is his business time. Two minutes would be enough. Then say, &#8220;May I come to see you?&#8221; This is the way to make an appointment by purchasing something. If you are going to buy three things, do not buy all three things in one store. Buy one thing at this store, and then go into the next store and try to make another appointment. Your purchase is the bait. The sisters have to consider how many things they buy in a month. There are many opportunities to speak Christ to people.<p>All of these people are here for us. You may not have any intention to buy anything, but when you see a salesman standing there with nothing to do, you may buy a pair of socks for a few dollars. You can buy this in order to open his heart. Surely this is worthwhile; we are here for Christ. Also, you may buy the socks in a size that would fit this salesman. Then after you purchase these socks, you may say: &#8220;Sir, my intention is not to buy the socks; it is to preach Christ to you. I would like to give this pair of socks to you as a gift.&#8221; This may seem like an odd thing, but it can stir up people&#8217;s interest so that we can reach them with the gospel.<p>We need to save some of our time for going out to reach people. In whatever way we go, we must pray, &#8220;Lord, send me the best son of peace.&#8221; We must believe that the Lord will answer this prayer. Also, if we pray, the Lord will give us many different ways to reach people. We should not be so legal. We must exercise our wisdom. When the sisters go to the beauty shop, they must go purposefully. They should even go more often with the intention of talking to someone. Then all those who are working in the beauty salon would open their doors to these sisters. In this way, we can get some doors opened to us warmly. Human beings are made by God for His purpose. As long as we can touch them, they will be saved, but do not expect to do a quick job. We must reach people with patience, gradually. If we are faithful to the Lord every week, we have to believe that we will bring at least two to the Lord every year. Each one of us can do it. It all depends upon our labor, persistence, endurance, and patience.<h2 class=head2>Making Appointments by Selling Something</h2><p>Some of you can get the best product that can be sold door to door. Then you go out, not to preach Christ but as a salesman. Most people would open the door for a salesman. You should sell the product very cheap. You can show them that you get only five percent discount, and you would give this five percent to them. After the deal is made, you say, &#8220;I sold this to you so cheap because I am not for selling; I am for preaching Christ.&#8221; Give them one of your name cards, and ask for a few minutes to speak to them. Most buyers would give you some time. Then after a little talk, you can make an appointment to come back. This is another way to reach people with the gospel.<h2 class=head2>Gaining Entrance to Closed Neighborhoods</h2><p>No one&#8217;s door is closed forever. People open their doors nearly every day, but we must find a way to keep them open. One brother told us that he visited an upper-middle-class community, and no one would open their door because no one knew him. So he began to visit that neighborhood regularly, not to knock on doors but simply to walk back and forth. Many of the residents saw him quite often in that neighborhood, and eventually someone talked to him and opened to him. If you can get one person to invite you into his home, after two or three weeks, some others may also be open to you.<p>Another way to reach people is to form a singing team of about six saints and go to an upper-class community. Sing proper Christmas songs throughout the neighborhood at about seven o&#8217;clock in the evening. Maybe they would be eating or just finishing their dinner. Then go the second night and sing again. Go every night for one week and see what will happen. You may not need to knock on any doors. Some will come out and say: &#8220;You have nice singing, marvelous singing. We all like it. We would like to know who you are.&#8221; By this way, some doors will be opened to you.<h2 class=head2>The Way of Faithfulness and Prayer</h2><p>We should not be bound to any one way in our gospel preaching. The Lord will not lead us in only one way. In Luke 14, first the lord charged his servant to go to the streets and lanes of the city (v. 21). The servant came back and said, &#8220;What you have commanded has been done, and still there is room&#8221; (v. 22). Then his lord said, &#8220;Go out into the roads and hedges&#8221; (v. 23). The Lord is flexible, and He changes His leading. To visit and talk to people is much easier on the streets and in the lanes of the city than on the roads, the highways. To whom can we talk on the highway? We could wait there for someone to run out of gasoline and stop right in front of us. That would be a good chance to talk to that person. If we are wise, we would have prepared some water so we can say: &#8220;Sir, are you thirsty? I have some water.&#8221;<p>We may think, &#8220;How could I meet a person in this way every week?&#8221; But in fifty-two weeks, we can meet one. If we go out once a week to stand beside the highway just waiting for someone to run out of gas, for fifty-two weeks, we can be sure we will meet one person. Even if we do not meet one, the Lord will surely consider us to be faithful servants. We must also pray, &#8220;O Lord, send me one.&#8221; The Lord will answer us; He will send us one. This dear one who was driving the car may have his cousin with him, so we will also meet his cousin.<h2 class=head2>Preaching out of Necessity</h2><p>One thing is for sure. If we stay at home, we will gain nothing. We have been at home for years. Who did we reach with the gospel? It is worthwhile for us to pursue any way by which we can minister Christ to others. However, our crucial need is not a way but a desperation to gain someone for Christ. We must be desperate. We should not tolerate our barrenness. If we do not bear fruit, the Lord will cut us off from His enjoyment, and He will judge and punish us at His coming. It is a necessity that we preach the gospel, for woe unto us if we do not (1 Cor. 9:16). If we are desperate, surely the Lord will give us a saved sinner to offer up as a sacrifice to God.<p>If all the saints had been practicing the door-knocking since it was introduced in 1986, I believe all the churches would have doubled by now, but the Devil has been working to damage the saints and destroy their faith by putting doubt into their hearts. We must tell the Devil that we do not have the time nor the ear to hear all this nonsensical talk. We would rather be desperate and go out to reach people. I believe our Lord, the Lord whom we serve, will be happy to see this.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>THE UNIT OF GOD&#8217;S SALVATION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Luke 19:5, 9; Acts 16:31; 1 Cor. 1:16a</h1><p>In considering the exercise and practice of the God-ordained way to preach the gospel, we must include the unit of God&#8217;s salvation. Most people, whether Christians or non-Christians, think about God&#8217;s salvation as involving individuals. The natural mind thinks of one person as the unit of God&#8217;s salvation. This kind of thinking is contrary to God&#8217;s economy, God&#8217;s plan. God&#8217;s ordained way is to gain households, not just individuals. God revealed His unit of salvation even in the Old Testament. God did not save simply Noah and his wife from the flood-He also saved their sons and daughters-in-law (Gen. 7:7). Eight persons were included as a part of Noah&#8217;s household (1 Pet. 3:20; Heb. 11:7). That was the first complete type of God&#8217;s salvation exercised over people.<p>In Exodus 12, the Passover lamb was eaten according to households. If a household was too small for the lamb, they were to share their lamb with a neighboring house (vv. 3-4). Furthermore, the blood of the Passover lamb was put on the doorposts and the lintel of the house in which they were instead of upon any individual. To take the Passover as an individual is contrary to God&#8217;s economy. Jesus Christ, as the Passover lamb, is not only for individuals; He is for a whole house. If we do not take care of the household as the unit of God&#8217;s salvation, we are violating the principle of God&#8217;s economy.<p>When we invite people to come to a meeting of the church, many will come by themselves. If we go to visit people in their homes, we will reach their whole household. From this we can realize that &#8220;door-knocking&#8221; reaches the household not only one person. When we knock on people&#8217;s doors, we are observing the principle of God&#8217;s economy. It is a shame if we despise the God-ordained way of reaching people with the gospel. We must take this God-ordained way of preaching the gospel, which is according to the biblical revelation.<h2 class=head1>AVOIDING THE WINDS OF DIFFERENT TEACHINGS</h2><p>If we are really for the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we must stand against any teaching that is contrary to the truth. The unit of God&#8217;s salvation being a household is according to the truth; therefore, we must stand for this truth. We must realize that we are being sent out by the Lord to reach households, the entire unit of God&#8217;s salvation. If we pay attention only to individuals rather than households in preaching the gospel, our God may be offended. Our going out to reach people should include their whole family.<p>Many of us are still under the influence of erroneous teachings. The Apostle Paul describes such teachings as &#8220;every wind of teaching&#8221; (Eph. 4:14). If a wind of teaching is wrong in an obvious way, no Christian will listen to it. If someone tells us to worship idols, for example, we will not pay attention to him. Instead, some may say to us, &#8220;Well, of course, we should not worship idols, but God is too abstract. We need a picture of Jesus. A picture of Jesus is not an idol.&#8221; It is strange that all the &#8220;pictures of Jesus&#8221; depict such a handsome person. According to history, such pictures have their origin in artwork produced during the Middle Ages. This artwork is totally opposite to Isaiah&#8217;s portrayal of the Lord Jesus. Isaiah 53:2 says, &#8220;He hath no...comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.&#8221; He was not handsome according to the natural way of thinking. This proves that the pictures on the walls of some Christian homes are not pictures of Jesus, yet some would even worship these pictures. Such pictures are deceitful, perverted, and even demonic.<p>In 1936 I visited a province in the central part of China. One day a very devoted person came to me and told me that a close relative of his had become possessed by a demon. He asked me what they should do. First, I asked if there were any idols in the home. After thinking about this, he told me that there were none. I asked him to check again to see if there were some pictures in the home which might be items of worship. He admitted that there was a &#8220;picture of Jesus.&#8221; When I encouraged him to destroy that picture, he was hesitant because, as a Christian, he did not want to be guilty of destroying a &#8220;picture of Jesus.&#8221; I explained to him that it was not a picture of the real Jesus but that an artist had made a handsome picture claiming that it was the Lord Jesus. Many times demon possession is a result of the worship of such idolatrous items. Once this brother saw the actual situation, he burned the idolatrous picture, and the demon was gone.<p>If someone came to you to tell you to worship idols directly, you would refuse to do it. Therefore, they come in a perverting, deceiving manner. In Manila there is a square with a large Catholic cathedral which is called the place of &#8220;the black Jesus.&#8221; They built a statue, an image in stone, and designated it as &#8220;the black Jesus.&#8221; They say that Jesus is not only for the white people but also for the black people. One of the feet of this statue is nearly worn away because so many people have touched it for centuries. Touching the feet of this &#8220;black Jesus&#8221; is considered as an honor to them. This practice is the issue of a wind of teaching that is off from the central lane of God&#8217;s economy. Ephesians 4:14 says the wind of teaching is related to the sleight of man and also to man&#8217;s craftiness. Man&#8217;s craftiness is connected to a system of error. Whose system is this? This is Satan&#8217;s system. Satan&#8217;s intention is to spoil, to destroy, the building up of the Body of Christ. That is his unique goal.<p>According to the Scriptures, the main way to preach the gospel is to visit people. Any teaching that is different from this or opposes this is a wind of teaching. To invite people to come to our meeting place is not the main way of preaching the gospel. God&#8217;s ordained way of preaching the gospel is primarily concentrated on our going forth to visit people where they are.<p>The Lord Jesus took the lead in going forth to visit people. He even went forth to the despised city of Jericho. In the Bible, Jerusalem is a blessed city, while Jericho is a cursed city. Jerusalem is on a mountain, Mount Zion. Jericho is down in a valley where it is hot and dusty. In Jericho the Lord Jesus went to the home of Zaccheus, a chief tax collector. In Luke 19:5 He told Zaccheus, &#8220;Today I must stay in your house.&#8221; A few verses later He declared to Zaccheus, &#8220;Today salvation has come to this house&#8221; (Luke 19:9). The Lord referred to the house two times with Zaccheus because He has a regard for the unit of the household. If someone opposes the truth of this unit of salvation, the saints will be distracted and discouraged. The result of such a wind of teaching is that it destroys the building up of the Body of Christ. Any opposition to preaching the gospel by visiting people, by knocking on their doors, is from the Devil. To preach the gospel by going out to visit people&#8217;s homes in order to reach households is according to the truth of the Scriptures.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED TO KNOW AND PRACTICE THE TRUTH</h2><p>My burden is to speak the truth. Since my ministry began in this country in 1962, over eleven hundred churches have been raised up on the earth. Before 1962 there were already one hundred churches, and most of them were in the Far East. Now there are more than twelve hundred churches on this globe. Each church has been brought forth through the releasing of the truth. If we are to continue in the God-ordained way, we all have to know the truth, and we have to take the way of the truth.<p>Putting the truth into practice requires much wisdom. When we go to visit people with the gospel, a seventeen-year-old girl may receive the Lord. Should we baptize her right away? We must look to the Lord to be our wisdom for the proper discernment. In some cases, baptizing such a young person may help the parents to receive the Lord. However, we should not baptize this young person quickly. We may need to check with her parents so that they will not be offended. The same situation may arise if a wife is saved apart from her husband&#8217;s presence. It could cause an offense to the husband if we attempt to baptize his wife right away. If we exercise wisdom, the whole family will be open to receive the Lord and be baptized. We must always be very regulated, very polite, and very wise.<p>If we do not exercise such wisdom, we will not gain the homes as the unit of God&#8217;s salvation. We must go with a view to building up something over the long run. Eventually, we will build up a proper reputation not only in our neighborhood but also in the whole city. This was certainly the case in Taipei. Today the people in Taipei regard the saints highly and are quite open to the saints&#8217; visiting their homes to preach the gospel of Christ. Over a period of time, this kind of positive relationship should be built up in the neighborhoods of the cities in the United States.<p>I hope that many of us will go out to visit people for the gospel quite often. It may be helpful to go singing. There should be such a good atmosphere for preaching the gospel in each neighborhood. It may also be helpful for some saints to move to a new neighborhood after a certain period of time so that a good atmosphere can be created there as well. If we will go out to preach the gospel in different ways, we will see a profitable result in a few years. It depends upon the way we take. I hope we all will pick up the burden for preaching the gospel and be willing to receive the training to practice in a proper, positive way. As the years go by, something profitable will be built up, and people will realize that there is a group of Christians who love the Lord and who are going out to visit people for the spread of the gospel of Christ.<p>Furthermore, when we go and visit people for the gospel&#8217;s sake in their homes, we should speak to them and behave ourselves in a way to build up an atmosphere and a situation that we could reach the entire household. And our gesture in speaking and in behaving should be expressed in the way that can stir up their respect so that they would expect that we would talk to their entire family.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINE</h1><h1 class=title>MUCH FRUIT AND REMAINING FRUIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 15:5, 8, 16; 1 Thes. 2:19-20</h1><p>Prayer: O Lord, we come back to You again. We believe we have been gathered by You into Your name. Lord, we have seen Your beauty and have been captivated. We love You, so we love the sinners. Because we love You, we have an interest in the sinners. Lord, You loved the world and came here to save the sinners. We also would have this same love and burden. We look unto You for this. Lord, attract us that we may run after You. Lord, defeat the enemy and rescue us from his usurping hand and from the deceiving world. Lord, we are here because You have been with us. We know You, and we love You. Amen.<h2 class=head1>PASSING THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION TO BEAR MUCH FRUIT</h2><p>In this message I will continue to share concerning the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. In John 15:5 the Lord says, &#8220;I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit.&#8221; We must pay close attention to the words &#8220;much fruit.&#8221; Here the Lord does not refer just to fruit but much fruit. To bear only fruit is not adequate; we must bear much fruit. In verse 8 the Lord says, &#8220;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit.&#8221; To bear one fruit is not sufficient to glorify, or express, the Father. To express the Father, to glorify Him, we must bear much fruit.<p>This can be illustrated by a carnation plant. Before it blossoms, its beauty, its glory, is not expressed. But when it blossoms, the carnation is glorified, and its beauty is expressed. When Christ was crucified on the cross, all the opposing ones despised Him. He was put to death, but after three days He rose from the dead. In resurrection, He appeared to Mary at the tomb and said, &#8220;Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God&#8221; (John 20:17). Through His death and in His resurrection, He was glorified; and in the Son&#8217;s glorification, the Father was also glorified. In His death and resurrection, He bore much fruit; He brought forth His disciples as His many brothers to express and glorify the Father.<p>Today, by choosing us and appointing us, He is sending us to go forth and bear fruit. Yet, to bear fruit requires the process of death and resurrection. The Lord Jesus went through this process; He cut the way. Today we should follow Him by letting ourselves be put to death. We cannot practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel in a natural way; instead, we need to pass through the process of death and resurrection. When we hear about knocking on people&#8217;s doors for gospel preaching, we may consider that this is something easy or common and that anyone can do it. However, if we keep going out to visit people week after week, we will eventually have to pass through death.<p>To go out just once or twice, or even thirty or forty times, will not work. A fruit tree that bears much fruit has gone through many dealings and sufferings. It is not a simple or easy thing to go out to knock on people&#8217;s doors and tell them about the Lord Jesus. On the one hand, it is easy for a tree to bear fruit because the life within it produces fruit. On the other hand, a tree can only produce fruit once a year. For you to go out to knock on people&#8217;s doors for the gospel for three months might be easy. But for you to go out consistently for years might exhaust you. I do not believe the Lord would charge you to go out every day; once a week would be enough. Also, you do not need to go out every month; ten months a year would be adequate. You may go out for five months and then rest for one month. Then you could go out again for five months. If you do this consistently, eventually you might get tired out and disappointed.<p>To bear fruit is not so easy. This is why the Lord compares our preaching of Him to fruit-bearing. Preaching is easy; but bearing fruit is not that easy. We should keep going out to preach the gospel for a complete year regardless of whether we bear fruit or not. We may go out for five months in the first half of the year and gain no one. Then in the second half of the year, after going out for four and a half months and gaining no one, we may feel hopeless and give up. We may say: &#8220;This way does not work. Forget about it. I have been wasting my time.&#8221; I have seen this happen many times.<p>I was saved in the spring of 1925. That year I began to go to the countryside with tracts that I had written by myself. I did this again and again, yet I gained no fruit. Then my patience and endurance came to an end, and I simply gave up. I have encouraged you to go out to visit people and to find many different ways to do it. But what will you do if you go out for a whole year and still gain no fruit? I am afraid you may stay home and stop going out. You may lose your interest and confidence and say, &#8220;This way does not work.&#8221; However, if you go out for one year and gain nothing and still go out the next year, I am quite sure you will gain some fruit in the second year. Even if you would not gain anything the second year, you still have to go out for a third year. I am very concerned that some of you may become disappointed and stop going out.<p>I do not expect that you will gain one person every year, but I expect and have the full assurance that within three years you will gain at least one. If everyone will gain one within three years, we will have a thirty-three percent increase each year. This means that if we have ninety meeting together, after one year they will increase to one hundred twenty. Then after another year, this one hundred twenty will increase to one hundred sixty. According to Christian history, there has never been a church that has had a thirty-three percent increase every year. This may seem slow, but for each of us to gain one person every three years is really quite fast. If we do this for ten years, we will have the highest rate of increase in all of Christian history. If a church of two hundred fifty would increase by one-third each year, the entire population of the earth would be gained in less than sixty years.<h2 class=head1>LABORING PERSISTENTLY WITH ENDURANCE TO BEAR REMAINING FRUIT</h2><p>These figures are accurate, but I do not have the same confidence in our practice because we do not have patience. We get disappointed so quickly and quit. We need to be earnest in our intention to bear fruit. If we will go out just once a week for only forty-four weeks a year for three full years, we could gain six as remaining fruit. I do not mean that you will baptize only six, but among all those whom you baptize, six will become remaining fruit. The Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I appointed you that you should...bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain&#8221; (John 15:16). The Lord&#8217;s desire is for remaining fruit. The problem is that we have never built up a habit to labor persistently over a long period of time. We expect to learn the new way, practice it for two months, and gain a lot of fruit. Otherwise, we get disappointed. We must all learn to take the slow way of fruit-bearing.<h2 class=head2>Learning by Practicing</h2><p>I have studied and even experimented with the new way very much. I can assure all of the saints in the churches that they will be successful if they will be faithful to go out for two to three hours every week, week after week, for forty-four weeks a year. While the saints are practicing this, they will learn many things. In the past sixty years, I did not learn many things from others. I learned simply by my practice. No one taught me how to write the footnotes. No one taught me how to write a poem, a song, or a hymn. Over sixty years ago I began to write; I wrote a tract on the wonderful way to save souls. That writing was somewhat childish, but I continued throughout the years to practice and practice and practice. Eventually, I wrote the hymn, &#8220;O glorious Christ, Savior mine&#8221; (Hymns, #501). If you will practice persistently, you will eventually learn the proper way.<h2 class=head2>Needing the Elders&#8217; Stirring Up</h2><p>I do not expect that all the saints will go out, but I do expect the elders to bear the burden to stir up at least one out of every three to practice the gospel preaching in this way. Let the others rest. Some are too old, some are too young, and some are too weak, but they are all dear brothers and sisters. We must love all the dear saints, the weaker ones as well as the stronger ones.<p>If the elders will be diligent, I have the assurance that they can stir up one-third of the saints to preach the gospel by reaching people. If you take this word, you do not need any more teaching. You only need to practice. To ride a bicycle, you do not need any teaching; you only need to practice again and again. Eventually, you will ride quite well. This is how I have learned, so I have the confidence that you do not need any more teaching; you simply need to practice. I assure you that if you continue to practice diligently, you can gain two solid new ones within one year. You might not need to go by teams; you could do this by yourself.<p>You must be so definite and persistent. If no one will go out with you, you should still go out for the Lord one day a week for two or three hours. There is no need of so many teachings. Just go! If there is a door, knock on it. If people are on the street, talk to them. Practice every way. In one year, you can baptize at least ten, and out of these ten, two will be remaining fruit.<p>If the elders stir up just one-third of the saints, every year this one-third can triple. If fifty are stirred up, they may baptize over five hundred and bring at least one hundred into the church life as remaining fruit. However, to do this, these fifty must go out for two or three hours every week for ten months each year. Otherwise, we cannot expect any success. Today in the United States, it is easy for us to do this. We have so many &#8220;warm doors&#8221; to knock on, the doors of people we know. Through these &#8220;warm doors,&#8221; I believe many more doors will be opened to us. One &#8220;warm door&#8221; will open up two more doors. We do not need to be concerned with how many people we baptize; we simply must labor, labor, labor!<h2 class=head2>Gaining the Whole Family</h2><p>When you go out to visit people, do not care for the number, but care for the family. Our goal is not to get only one individual. Our goal is to get one family. When we talk to people, our talk must pave the way to get the whole family. If it is only a couple, we have to have the goal not merely to gain the wife or the husband but to gain both. If the mother is pregnant, we must have the intention that we will gain this child also. We should gain every member of the family.<p>This message is very practical. Simply go out and practice. Go out for ten months every year, once a week for two to three hours. Try this with patience. Do not be concerned with the numbers; simply pay attention to practicing continuously. I assure you that you will get ten baptized, and of the ten, two will remain. Do not worry about the other eight. Even though they may not come into the church life, they will be in the New Jerusalem.<p>When you go, always exercise to gain the whole family. If you are preaching the gospel to a seventeen-year-old young man, you have to consider his parents. By baptizing this young man, you may spoil your work on the whole family. You have to exercise your wisdom to decide whether you should baptize him or not. If you do not baptize him, this does not mean that you give him up. Rather, this is a kind of preparation for you to get his parents and to get his whole family. If you go out persistently, you can gain at least two solid families each year.<h2 class=head2>Forming a New Local Church</h2><p>We must go out in a way that is according to the Bible. In the full-time training, we have formed the trainees into teams of three. We sent two teams each to about eight new cities and instructed them what to do. They must go there to knock on doors to get people saved and baptized, but without an expectation that they will get a large number baptized. After sixteen weeks of labor, these six saints can gain at least ten to twelve as remaining fruit. When they baptize one, they immediately have to give him some nourishment before leaving. Then they have to make an appointment with him to come back the next day or the day after. In not more than three days, they must come back to visit him. They should immediately begin home meetings with all the newly baptized ones. They must go back regularly and frequently to have home meetings.<p>When the first Lord&#8217;s Day comes, they should bring the new ones from these new localities to the nearby church meetings to give them an impression of the church. Then on the next Lord&#8217;s Day, they should meet with all these newly baptized ones in their new localities. The six trainees could meet together on the Lord&#8217;s Day to have the Lord&#8217;s table with the three or four newly saved and baptized ones in that new locality. In this way, after one or two weeks there will be a new church raised up. This does not mean that all the ones who will come to the Lord&#8217;s table with them will remain. On the one hand, the trainees will meet with the new ones in home meetings, in small group meetings, and on the Lord&#8217;s Day; on the other hand, they will still go out to get more new ones for the remainder of the sixteen weeks. Because the trainees go out at least three times a week, they can gain at least eight in their new city in sixteen weeks. Then when they go away at the end of the term, there can be a small church of eight to twelve in that city, and the nearby churches may spend some time to help them and teach them. In this way they can have contact with the nearby churches to have fellowship. After about two months, we will have another term of training, and some new trainees can go to help them.<p>This is the practical way we are taking to form new local churches. After four months, I expect to have seven or eight new small churches established in these nearby cities. The biblical way is for the local churches to be raised up from a small number. Not long after the day of Pentecost, persecution came upon the thousands of believers in Jerusalem and scattered them. Acts 8 tells us that, except for the apostles, all the saints in Jerusalem were scattered (v. 1). We do not know the details, but we are told that these thousands of saints &#8220;who were scattered went about the land bringing the good news of the word&#8221; (v. 4). Wherever they went they preached the gospel, and no doubt, churches were raised up by them. If you go out to a new city and three or five begin meeting together with you, all of you are a local church. If you practice the God-ordained way, you will see the propagation of the churches. Eventually, every city can have a small church.<p>My burden in this message is that you who go out to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel would not bother or criticize those who do not go out. I would also ask those who do not go out to allow the others the liberty to go out and not to criticize them. Then the Lord will have a way. What I have been sharing with you is only one-fourth of the proper church life. We should go out in this way only once a week. This leaves many days for the remainder of the church life-the big meetings on the Lord&#8217;s Day, the prayer meeting, the small group meetings, etc. If we practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, the church will be like a vine continually propagating on the earth. We should be simple and take the biblical way, the God-ordained way. We should not try to do too much too quickly. We must be balanced and steady. We should go out faithfully once a week for about two or three hours. While we are practicing, we will learn how to discern people, how to say the right things, and how to prepare the way to gain the whole family.<h2 class=head2>Conducting Ourselves Wisely</h2><p>As a young man or a young lady, you must have a proper bearing when you go to talk to people. Do not talk to people loosely or lightly. Even though you are young, you must have a certain dignity so that people will regard you with respect. Your speaking should win people&#8217;s respect. Then they will put their trust in you. Even though they are older and you are younger, they will respect and take whatever you say. You all have to learn this; it is very important. Do not say things lightly or quickly. If you build up trust with people, you can always go back to visit them.<p>Once you gain a person, do not forget that the goal is to gain the whole family. Therefore, in your wording, in your expression, and even in your tone of voice, you must learn to express gravity and dignity to win people&#8217;s confidence. Then you will always be able to go back to visit them. Never expect to have a quick work. Simply labor consistently and persistently, and while you are laboring, exercise your wisdom concerning how to labor. Every day&#8217;s work must prepare the way for the future. No farmer expects to sow today and reap tomorrow. This is against God&#8217;s ordained principle in nature. You have to be careful and diligent to do everything in the proper way so that your crop will grow. Eventually, you will reap a harvest.<p>The elders must try their best to stir up the saints to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. They should be able to get at least one-third of the saints to do this. If more would rise up, that would be wonderful. But if the Lord can get one-third of the saints to practice the priesthood of the gospel, the results will be marvelous. We should not try to baptize too many in a quick way. We must preach the gospel and minister Christ to others with much discernment. Then gradually, the church will reap a harvest. After five years, the practice of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel will become prevailing on the earth.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TEN</h1><h1 class=title>LEARN TO BE HUMAN</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Isa. 49:15; 1 Tim. 5:1-3</h1><p>God&#8217;s unit of salvation is the household (Luke 19:5, 9; Acts 16:31; 1 Cor. 1:16a). We have to learn to be human in order to take care of such a household. If we remain in our natural man, this will be a very difficult task. In our natural, old man we do not have a tendency to love anyone but ourselves. We do not love the elderly, the middle-aged, the young, the children, or even the infants. Many Christians will admit that they really loved no one but themselves before they were saved.<p>Some may argue that many young people love each other when they are engaged to be married. But why would so many separate or divorce after marriage? They separate from each other or become divorced because marriage no longer fits into their self-interest. Separation and divorce are expressions of self-love. While they are dating, a young couple may express great love toward each other. Eventually, the real love, self-love, becomes expressed. One may say, &#8220;I am yours. I belong to you.&#8221; Later it becomes obvious that actually he cares only for himself.<h2 class=head1>PROPER CARE FOR THE UNIT OF GOD&#8217;S SALVATION</h2><p>To properly care for the unit of God&#8217;s salvation, we must love every member of that household. We have to love every man and woman, from the oldest to the youngest. It may be that the little children in a certain home are naughty or unruly. Consequently, we may want nothing to do with them. But if we do not take proper care of such children, their parents may become offended with us and reject the gospel of Christ. If we are going to gain the whole household, we must learn to love every kind of person who is a part of that household-strong, weak, healthy, sick, young, old, and even the infants.<p>In 1955 and 1957, we invited Brother T. Austin-Sparks to visit us in Taiwan. At that time, he was close to seventy years of age. He told us that according to his experience he had learned that every mother considers her child to be either the most beautiful or the most handsome. If she has a girl, that is the most beautiful girl on earth. If she has a boy, that is the most handsome boy on earth. Many mothers brought their children to meet Brother Sparks. If the child was beautiful, he would say so to the mother. But if the child was not beautiful, he realized that he would offend the mother by saying such a thing to her. The mother would also be offended if he said nothing. So he handled the situation by saying, &#8220;Oh, what a child!&#8221; When the mother heard this expression, she was very pleased.<p>When we go to visit households with the gospel of Christ, we must learn not to be offensive to them. Rather, we must learn to take care of their needs. If we are unwise, the parents&#8217; hearts may be damaged, and the door within them will be closed to us. Further words from us will find no entrance or penetration.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED FOR PREPARING OURSELVES TO VISIT HOUSEHOLDS</h2><p>We all have to learn how to get ourselves prepared to preach the gospel to the whole household. Even our gestures should invite their respect. Before we speak something, our gesture or actions should stir up a respect in them toward us. We may be talking to a young adult in the family, yet we may affect an older adult in the same family by our actions. This may open up the older one to receive the gospel. At the proper time, that one may be ready to talk with us because a respect has been created by the manner in which we have visited the household. From this kind of example, we can realize that to preach the gospel to a family requires much learning. How a particular household would be opened to us depends upon our behavior, our manner of speaking, and the attitude we express to all the members of that household. If we really mean business for the Lord, we will have a desire to gain the whole household for His purpose. We must be very human with them in order to gain them for the Lord.<h2 class=head1>LABORING AS SOLDIERS TO GAIN THE VICTORY</h2><p>Many of us have been reared in America and have been influenced by the atmosphere of looseness which is so common in this country. This has caused a weakness in the character of many young people. For example, the Bible clearly distinguishes between males and females. Deuteronomy 22:5 says, &#8220;The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman&#8217;s garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God.&#8221; God likes to keep a clear difference between man and woman. However, many who have been saved and are the lovers of the Lord Jesus have been influenced by the present way of living. As a result of such an atmosphere, many improper things have been picked up and wrought into their living.<p>When we go to a home, there may be people of many different ages, both male and female. We must learn how to behave properly with each family member. If we are not strict in our behavior, we may forfeit our standing with the family. The New Testament likens us who love the Lord and who are working for His interest to soldiers (1 Tim. 6:12; 2 Tim. 2:4). Soldiers fight in order to win the battle. They could never behave as non-soldiers. They should not speak loosely or act loosely. All their behavior reflects the strict training they have received so that they may fulfill their duty.<h2 class=head1>LEARNING TO REACH ALL AGES</h2><p>When we enter a home, we must be prepared so that we can open each heart in the entire household. This may require learning a simple song that can be enjoyed by a young child. If that household has a young one, such a song will attract the young one and soften the hearts of the father and mother. This is not a small matter because such a thing may be the very way to reach them. If we ignore the smallest member of the family, we will probably offend and hurt the parents&#8217; feelings, making them unable to receive our words.<p>In the Gospels, some brought their children to the Lord Jesus. The disciples tried to rebuke the people, but the Lord received the children, took them into His arms, and blessed them (Matt. 19:13-15; Mark 9:36-37; Luke 9:46-48). It seems as though the Lord Jesus forgot everything else just so He could take care of the little ones. No doubt He was using this situation to train His disciples to be human. Many Christians today aspire to be like the angels, but the Lord Jesus is not interested in our becoming like angels. He cares only for our being human.<p>Paul gives very detailed fellowship to Timothy regarding dealing with various kinds of people. First Timothy 5:1-3 says, &#8220;Do not upbraid an elderly man, but entreat him as a father; younger men as brothers; elderly women as mothers; younger women as sisters, in all purity. Honor widows who are really widows.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>ACCOMMODATING ALL KINDS OF PERSONS</h2><p>From the Bible we can realize that for others&#8217; profit, we must learn to accommodate their character, their age, their disposition, and even their ways of doing certain things. This need is especially obvious in America because it is such a melting pot of all kinds of people. We must not forget that in our going out to preach the gospel, we are going not only for individuals but for families. This requires us to learn to be human.<p>One of the most effective missionaries to China was Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission. When he first went to China as a missionary, he was located near the coast. His biography tells us that one day as he was with the Lord near the seashore, he became burdened to take the gospel to the people in the interior provinces of China. Therefore, he called his mission the China Inland Mission. The people in the interior of China were very conservative. To reach them, Hudson Taylor adopted their way of dress, even to the extent of wearing the Chinese &#8220;pigtail&#8221; hairstyle. This demonstrated how human he was, and many Chinese became convinced by this. Other missionaries kept their Western style of dress, and this offended many of the Chinese. But Hudson Taylor&#8217;s putting away of the foreign manner of dress attracted many. He specified in his will that he should be buried in China upon his death. His life demonstrates to us the importance of learning to act in such a way as to be pleasing to others.<p>Every sinner is very human. Humanity comes out of God&#8217;s creating hand, so today we must be very, very human. The most human person was the Lord Jesus. This is not so easy to learn, but if we learn to be human, we will gain many people for the Lord. If I come to your home wearing a Chinese long gown and speak only Chinese to you, you will think I am of no profit to you as an American. But if I dress as you do and speak American English in a clear way, you may be quite surprised and touched. When I was first invited to Texas, I began to hear the expression &#8220;y&#8217;all.&#8221; Later I found out that it meant &#8220;you all.&#8221; If we learn to say &#8220;y&#8217;all&#8221; when we are with Texans, they will become happy with us. The principle is that if you are going to open people&#8217;s hearts, you must be human. All the utterances, all the expressions, and all the words you use must relate to them. You may be quite learned and able to share the truths from the Bible, but if your speaking is not human, your utterance is not human, and your attitude is not human, it will not be easy for you to find someone to listen to you.<h2 class=head1>TAKING THE BIBLICAL WAY</h2><p>We must take the biblical way. Many in Christianity may not take this biblical way, but we must take it. The Lord Jesus told Zaccheus, &#8220;I must stay in your house&#8221; (Luke 19:5). I believe the Lord Jesus stayed at least one night with the household of Zaccheus. If we would be so human as to stay for one night in someone&#8217;s home, this may open that whole household to the gospel of Christ. Our staying with them may cause the whole family to be saved.<p>About forty years ago, I spent much time in people&#8217;s homes, riding from home to home on my bicycle. If I stayed to have lunch or dinner with them, this touched their heart very much, and they heartily received whatever I shared with them. After such a time, they were happy to go with me to the meetings of the church.<p>As we are carrying out this biblical way, we must realize that this is according to the pattern the Lord Jesus set up. The biblical way is very, very human. If we will learn to be human in all our actions, we will become so available to all the people whom we contact.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ELEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>HAVING BEEN CHOSEN FOR THE START OF FRUIT-BEARING AND BEING DISCIPLED FOR BEARING MUCH FRUIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 15:16, 8</h1><p>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You that You have gathered us again into Your name. It is the name that is above every name. Lord, we need You, and we want to talk to You. We are here waiting for You to give us some instruction. Lord, we are so dull in understanding Your words, so we need You. We are foolish and ignorant; we do not have the understanding. Lord, have mercy upon us for the fulfillment of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. We need Your understanding. Open up our understanding. Show us the secret of how to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. Lord, we need You, and we need Your instruction. We are here, Lord Jesus, trusting in You. Come to each one of us. We believe that many saints are happy with and are waiting to take this way; yet thus far we have not seen any kind of model, any kind of pattern. Lord, here we are. Tonight we still ask You to speak to us, even to talk to us with patience. Thank You, Lord. Amen.<p>In this message we will continue to fellowship concerning fruit-bearing. In John 15 the Lord reveals fruit-bearing in a very detailed way. This entire chapter deals with fruit-bearing, and it contains some of the more difficult verses in the Bible. In verse 8 the Lord says, &#8220;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit, and you shall become My disciples.&#8221; Why does the Lord suddenly introduce this term &#8220;disciples&#8221;? What is it to be the Lord&#8217;s disciples? In the title of this message, I have used the verb form-being discipled. We have to be discipled for bearing much fruit. The Lord Jesus also used this term in Matthew 28 when He said, &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations&#8221; (v. 19). John 15 was spoken right before His death, and Matthew 28:19 was spoken shortly after His resurrection. The disciples learned directly from the Lord to be disciples, so they were qualified to disciple others.<h2 class=head1>THE DIFFICULTY OF BEARING REMAINING FRUIT</h2><p>In John 15:16 the Lord said, &#8220;You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you.&#8221; This verse is wholly concerning fruit-bearing. If we are going to bear fruit, first we must be chosen, and second we must be appointed. Then we should go forth and should bear fruit, and our fruit should remain. We need to consider how to carry out these three things: to go forth, to bear fruit, and to assure that our fruit remains.<p>In these days, we are going out to visit people to bring them to Christ and to baptize them. Then we intend to feed them, to have home meetings with them, to have small group meetings with them, and to bring them into the church life. Merely to get people baptized is not too hard, but to feed, to nourish, and to cherish people is not so easy. To bring them to the small group meetings is difficult, and to bring them into the church life as remaining fruit is even more difficult. Those who have fruit trees know that when the fruit becomes ripe and sweet, the birds may come. The birds come not to eat the new fruit but to eat the ripe fruit. While we are working, the evil &#8220;birds&#8221; are waiting. This corresponds with the Lord&#8217;s word in Matthew 13. The first kind of soil for His sowing was the soil &#8220;beside the way,&#8221; but because the soil beside the way had become hardened by the traffic, the seeds could not penetrate it, &#8220;and the birds came and devoured them&#8221; (v. 4). We have to do something to assure that our fruit will remain. Our fruit may be all right, but if we are careless, the next day it may be damaged by the Devil. There are many things we have to do to gain and preserve our fruit. It is not as simple as we may think. To go out to visit people for the preaching of the gospel may seem easy, but actually it is not. If it were easy, it would have already been practiced by many Christians for centuries.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S PURPOSE AND HIS COMMAND</h2><p>The Lord said, &#8220;You did not choose Me, but I chose you.&#8221; This choosing transpired in eternity past. Before the foundation of the world, the Lord chose us in Himself (Eph. 1:4). Then in time we were born, and eventually we heard the gospel and believed. By this we know that we have been called, yet we must realize that we have also been appointed. In Greek the word &#8220;appointed&#8221; really means &#8220;set.&#8221; The Lord set us in a certain position and in a particular environment. The Lord said, &#8220;I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit.&#8221; The Greek for &#8220;should&#8221; in this verse has two moods. One is the mood of purpose; the other is the mood of command. The word &#8220;that&#8221; denotes purpose, and the word &#8220;should&#8221; denotes command. We see the Lord&#8217;s purpose, and we also have a command from the Lord. We should go forth, and we should bear fruit. These are commandments. The Lord set us in a certain position because He has a purpose-that we should go forth and bear fruit. Yet this is not only the Lord&#8217;s purpose; it is His command-we should go forth and should bear fruit. Furthermore, the Lord continues, &#8220;and that your fruit should remain.&#8221; How could our fruit remain? It depends upon us. We have to do a lot to carry out the Lord&#8217;s commands. We should go forth, we should bear fruit, and our fruit should remain. Otherwise, the Lord&#8217;s purpose cannot be accomplished, and His goal cannot be reached.<p>To bear remaining fruit is not easy, yet it is the Lord&#8217;s command. If you do not go forth, you are disobeying the Lord&#8217;s command. When the Lord comes, you will have to face Him and give Him an account. The Lord may ask, &#8220;How much fruit have you borne?&#8221; You may say, &#8220;Lord Jesus, it was too hard. I never went forth.&#8221; In John 15, following abiding, that is, following the enjoyment of Christ, there is the matter of fruit-bearing. The Lord may say, &#8220;In John 15, I charged you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain.&#8221; If you do not go today, one day you will be judged by the Lord. Even if you do go forth, yet you would not endeavor to bear fruit, the Lord will condemn you.<p>To go forth is one thing; to bear fruit is another. To get married is one thing; to deliver a child is another. To get married is not hard; it is an enjoyment. But to deliver a child is a kind of suffering, travailing. The mother must suffer not only on the day of its delivery; she has to suffer for nine months. After the child is born, she must spend all her time and energy so that it will grow and be healthy. Not only should her child &#8220;remain,&#8221; but it must remain in a proper way. The Lord Jesus spoke in a detailed way concerning bearing fruit because this is not a simple thing to do.<h2 class=head1>OUR PRAYER FOR REMAINING FRUIT</h2><p>Now we must consider the remaining portion of verse 16: &#8220;That whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you.&#8221; Again the Lord uses the word &#8220;that.&#8221; The Lord appointed us that we should go forth and bear fruit, that our fruit should remain, and that whatever we ask in His name, the Father may give us. The last point in this verse is to pray not merely in a general way but to &#8220;ask...in My name.&#8221; The Lord does not intend for us to ask for material things. The Lord&#8217;s intention is for us to pray purposely for remaining fruit. Even if we would go forth and bear fruit, and even if we were able to labor much to keep the fruit, our fruit still might not remain.<p>After doing so much, one thing remains-we have to ask. We may be able to preach, baptize, and bring people to the church meetings, but we cannot give life. Paul said, &#8220;I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:6). We must admit our dependence upon the Lord. We can and should do a lot, but whatever we do will not produce the result. The result comes from the Lord&#8217;s direct work. However, His direct work depends upon our work. We have to go forth, we have to bear fruit, and we have to work that the fruit will remain. However, whatever we do without His additional doing means nothing.<p>The final thing that is needed is our asking. We have to pray in a particular way. To ask in His name is to ask for remaining fruit. We must pray: &#8220;Lord, I went forth. I worked hard. I preached the gospel to this one. I baptized him and visited him regularly for more than one year. I even brought him into the church meetings, but thus far, there is nothing promising that I can see within him. Lord, what is needed is Your work. I can do a lot, but I cannot give life. I may bring a hundred into the church life, but without Your additional work, the giving of life, my labor is vain.&#8221;<p>This does not mean our labor is not needed. Without Paul&#8217;s planting and Apollos&#8217; watering, the Lord could not have given life. We must lay the base with our labor. Then the Lord can give life. We need to ask the Lord for remaining fruit.<h2 class=head1>PREACHING THE GOSPEL BY VISITING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE</h2><p>We have learned from church history, and it is confirmed by the Bible, that to preach the gospel effectively, we must go where the people are. We must visit them. The first one to visit people for the preaching of the gospel was the Lord Jesus. He came all the way from the heavens, and He even changed His form to become a man in order to visit sinners (1 Tim. 1:15). He went from city to city and from village to village to visit people (Luke 8:1). He sent the twelve to visit people (Matt. 10:5). Later He sent seventy to visit people (Luke 10:1). The Lord&#8217;s word in John 15:16 is His sending of us.<p>When He says, &#8220;I appointed you,&#8221; He is referring to all the believers. He has set us in a certain position for a purpose. We should (as a command) go forth and bear fruit, and our fruit should remain. This is the God-ordained way to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, and we all must exercise to promote it because it is not easy to carry out.<p>The old way of having a big congregation with one speaking and the rest listening does not accomplish much. It can only edify people in a general way. I was in a Brethren assembly for more than ten years. I continually went there to sit and listen so that I could be edified. That little Brethren assembly was there for over fifty years, yet no other church was raised up by them. In the mid-1970s, we had more than one thousand saints meeting in Orange County, but today the number is much less. For years we have been very busy going to the meetings yet with very little positive result. We all must realize that to stay in the old way does not work. Christianity has tested this old way throughout the centuries, and they now agree that their way does not work. They cannot go on in that way. When I came to this country in 1958, I heard that the United States had a population of two hundred million and that half of the people were Christians. Today the population might be over two hundred forty million, and only one hundred twenty million may be Christians. In over thirty years, there has only been an increase of twenty million. This is less than a one percent increase per year. Christianity has nearly come to a standstill. Due to this, the Southern Baptists have begun to pick up the practice of door-knocking. Last winter they began to do this in Texas, and this summer they practiced it in Las Vegas.<h2 class=head1>BEING DISCIPLED FOR BEARING MUCH FRUIT</h2><p>It is not that this biblical way, the God-ordained way, does not work; it is that we are not faithful to this way. In John 15 the Lord used the word &#8220;disciples.&#8221; &#8220;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit, and you shall become My disciples&#8221; (v. 8). The reason we are not fruitful is because we have not been discipled that much by Him. We need to become His disciples. To be discipled is to change our way, our position, and our character, that is, not to be natural. If we go out to visit people in a natural way, our going out will be ineffectual. We must be discipled.<p>For someone to play the piano properly, he must be willing to be tutored, &#8220;discipled.&#8221; Furthermore, he has to practice many hours to become discipled. To be discipled is to get out of the natural way and take another way. Are we willing to be discipled? It is not a matter of whether we could or should be discipled. It is altogether a matter of our being willing. Everybody should be discipled and can be discipled, but not many would be discipled. This is why nearly twenty centuries have passed, and the Lord still has not returned. Not many are living in the United States for the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. Not many are willing to be discipled.<p>We have to come back to the Bible in everything. To spread the kingdom of God on this earth, to propagate Christ in the human race, to preach His good news to save sinners, is a crucial matter. If we will dive into it without reservation, we will be discipled. All of our natural way, disposition, and character should be crossed out. We should not be natural in any way. In our going out, our way of speaking may be too natural. In the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus did not talk to people in a natural way. Every word out of His mouth was very new, fresh, and refreshing. He talked in one way to the Samaritan woman. He talked in another way to Nicodemus. He talked in still another way to Zaccheus, a sinful tax collector. This is because He did not speak from Himself; instead, He spoke His Father&#8217;s word (John 12:49). Even the Lord Jesus had to deny Himself when He spoke to people, putting aside whatever was His and taking the Father&#8217;s word, the Father&#8217;s speaking. He was the first one to be discipled. He was the Father&#8217;s disciple.<p>Then in Matthew 11:29 the Lord said, &#8220;Learn from Me.&#8221; In Greek, the base meaning of the word &#8220;disciple&#8221; is to learn. A disciple is a learner. However, this is not to learn in the worldly sense; it is to learn by our old man being crucified to take away all of our old, natural things. When we go to visit all the ones whom we have baptized, we should not speak one word out of ourselves in a natural way or express anything without being dealt with or crossed out. Then we can have a positive result.<p>To preach the gospel is the most difficult thing. You cannot be loose in preaching the gospel to unbelievers. Gospel preaching needs your impact, your ability, and even your skill. To get people saved is a top skill. When Brother Watchman Nee was about nineteen or twenty, he preached the gospel very much. One day Brother Nee talked to a very smart, young college student about the gospel. This young man answered: &#8220;I am sorry. My father is now in Hades suffering. I do not like to see that my father will be suffering there, and I will be saved into paradise, so I will go to him to suffer with him.&#8221; How would you answer such a person? Brother Nee answered in a brief and concise way using Luke 16: &#8220;The suffering, rich man begged Abraham to send someone to preach the gospel to his five brothers because he loved his brothers. Don&#8217;t you believe that your father, although he is suffering in Hades, still loves you? He doesn&#8217;t want you to go there with him. If you would go there, as you have said, you would not be honoring your father. You would be dishonoring him.&#8221; This short word convinced that young man, and he said, &#8220;I honor my father. For his sake I believe in the Lord Jesus. I will not go to his place, just for his sake.&#8221; This example shows us that there is much for us to learn in the preaching of the gospel.<p>In our full-time training, we give lessons on items such as the all-inclusive Christ, the church, and the basic truths of the Bible. This is because we need the equipment; otherwise, we are too natural. We must endeavor to get into the truths to become fully equipped (2 Tim. 3:16-17). We do not know what kind of person we will face, and we do not know what kind of knowledge we will need to convince that particular person. Without the knowledge and the skill, we may lose many people.<p>Brother D. L. Moody preached the gospel very much. One night after preaching the gospel, he was speaking to a lady concerning Christ. At a certain point, a disturbance frustrated that lady from being saved at the very time that she should have been touched by the Spirit and regenerated. Moody testified that after this small disturbance, he could not bring that lady back to the point of receiving the Lord. To preach the gospel is a fine matter. I am concerned that we may go out with a good heart, yet with a very loose manner, character, and disposition. When we go to visit people, we must be on the alert, yet we should not let them know we are so serious since that might threaten them. We cannot be loose. We must learn the ways of preaching the gospel with all the detailed points in order to deal with every situation.<p>You may consider that this is too hard, but the most precious things are always hard to accomplish. To go to visit sinners in order to preach your dear and precious Savior to them is altogether a matter in the spirit. If you do not exercise your spirit or keep yourself speaking in your spirit, you cannot be successful. You have to learn by being discipled. You can use The Mystery of Human Life, but it depends on how you use it. You may use it to kill people, or you may use it to enliven people. It all depends upon your way, your skill, your spirit, and your disposition.<h2 class=head1>HAVING A START OF FRUIT-BEARING</h2><p>We all must realize that we have been appointed to go forth and bear fruit, so we should all have a start. We were appointed with a purpose and a command that we should go forth. To go forth is to have a start. The Lord has set us in the race, so we have to run. If we never have a start, nothing will change; we will remain in barrenness. We must hate our barrenness and endeavor to bear fruit. We were chosen for the start of fruit-bearing. We all need a start. Then after being chosen and after starting, we need to be discipled. We need to go out, but not in a natural way. Being natural even a little bit can kill our purpose and annul our effectiveness. We all must have a spirit to learn. Anything that is old or natural must be crossed out. We have to be discipled. In addition, we need a lot of prayer. When we pray, we touch the Spirit. This will change us, disciple us, and cross us out. Only the Lord Spirit can change us, so we must have adequate prayer for us to be discipled. We also need to ask the Father in the Lord&#8217;s name for the giving of life to produce the remaining fruit.<p>We all need to take Paul as our pattern. In 1 Corinthians 9:16 Paul said, &#8220;For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.&#8221; There must be a necessity laid upon us to preach the gospel. If we do not preach the gospel, we will suffer woe; if we preach the gospel, a reward is waiting for us (v. 17). If we love the Lord and His recovery, we must have a new beginning in fulfilling our New Testament priesthood of the gospel to go and visit people. Then there is much possibility that we could bear fruit. After this, we must exercise further to be discipled so that our fruit will remain.<p>If you are faithful to the Lord and faithful to go out once a week for forty-eight weeks in a year, I believe you can baptize five to ten. Out of these, probably four to six will remain, yet not all of the remaining fruit will be brought to the church. It may be that only two of them will be brought into the church life. The others will simply be saved without coming into the recovery. By this we can see that if we are faithful, we will be able to gain a good number for the Lord.<p>I do not expect that all the saints meeting with us will go out to visit people, but I do expect that one-third of the saints in each locality will go out. If the Lord stirs up one-third of the saints to preach the gospel, He will gain a good percentage of increase every year. That will stir up all the saints&#8217; interest in the church life, and the church will have a way to go on. To accomplish this, we all have to endeavor to rise up to fight against our barrenness.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWELVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE PRACTICAL PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 15:8, 16</h1><p>In this message we will fellowship more concerning the gospel of Christ. This kind of fellowship should be of help to us in learning how to preach the gospel to others. In visiting with people, we should be normal, living, and lovely to them. The ones we visit should be inspired and moved by our speaking. Some preach the gospel as though they were reading a newspaper clipping to someone. The result of this kind of preaching is that there is no impact.<p>Others lose the listener by providing too much explanation in their preaching. This creates the opportunity for side issues to come in. If we are asked a question, we should restrict our answer to the point at hand, thus leaving no side issue to be raised by the person. Do not think that it is better to have a large amount of speaking. This may cause the impact to be lost. It is better to speak a few words that are directly to the point to bring the person to the proper destination. In this way we are like ushers who direct people to their seats in an auditorium. We must learn to purify our speaking and avoid speaking according to our natural custom.<h2 class=head1>USING PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATIONS</h2><p>My main concern is that many of the saints go out diligently and faithfully to talk to people, but most of the speaking is doctrinal in nature. We all need training in order to overcome our doctrinal nature. The person we are visiting may ask us to explain to him who God is. We must learn not to answer such a question with doctrines but with some kind of practical illustration. We may tell him that in the whole universe there must be a sovereign One. God is this sovereign One. We have to learn to always hit the point and avoid side issues.<p>I have practiced gospel preaching for many years. I have discovered that many sinners like to ask a lot of questions which lead into side issues, thus taking you away from the main point. It is best not to follow their questions. You must consider the best way to answer so that the side issues are kept closed. This requires learning. If you are presented with a question which you cannot answer so well right away, you should still do your best to give an answer. However, you should learn not to answer too quickly.<p>To one who asks who God is, you may say, &#8220;This is the biggest question in the universe. The philosophers and religious leaders have always considered this problem. One thing that is clear to all of them is that there must be someone in the universe who is sovereign.&#8221; This leads the person to a direct point. Then point out that this sovereign One is called God. He is not Buddha. He is not an idol. He is just God. God is unique. God is one and only one. He is the One who created the entire universe, including man. At this time you can direct him to the point which you want to reach. This will keep him from going astray. You have to be trained, but you also have to consider the questions. Ask yourself how to answer who God is. This kind of thinking and considering will cause you to learn some secrets.<p>Theology alone does not work. When you talk to people, the greatest impact will be from practical speaking. If you are not practical in your speaking, you will create more questions in the ones you contact. You must answer in a very practical way. This is why you have to learn. Do not just learn in a doctrinal way in order to go out to give lectures to people. Lectures have no impact. Just talk in a practical way. Of course, your talk must be based upon Biblical knowledge. But the way you use your knowledge of the Bible is the key. You must learn to convert your doctrinal talking into practical talking. Do not talk like a Bible teacher or theologian but in a practical way, touching people&#8217;s daily life.<h2 class=head1>CONSIDERING HOW TO USE THE MYSTERY OF HUMAN LIFE</h2><p>You have to consider the use of The Mystery of Human Life. Is it practical in your gospel situation? You must study its use. Opening with The Mystery of Human Life might be quite good for certain persons, but I do not believe it is appropriate for everyone. Thus, you have to consider how to use it for the greatest profit. Suppose you feel to use The Mystery of Human Life. Still you have to study to determine how to use it. It may be best to speak in this way: &#8220;Sir, here is a book in my hand. It talks about something marvelous which I would like to share with you. What it talks about is the mystery of our human life.&#8221; This kind of application is very understandable.<h2 class=head1>APPROACHING GOSPEL PREACHING AS A SCIENCE</h2><p>As I have told you before, you should not consider gospel preaching an easy task. Rather, it is like a difficult scientific course. The classroom training helps only to open the door of this wide field. From there, you must enter through the door and begin to consider, day and night, how to carry out your scientific research. To preach theology or biblical knowledge is not adequate. The only way that works is to make the message practical. This is the secret you all must learn.<h2 class=head1>PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF BIBLICAL POINTS</h2><p>You have to consider how to make all the biblical points practical. I have used marriage life as an example in quite a few of my messages. This makes the message more practical.<p>If you are going to reach certain persons, first of all, you must know their real situation. If you are going to help those in high school or junior high, you must learn their real life situation. Second, you have to consider what portion of the holy Word can be applied to that particular situation. You must have some verses or portions in the Bible as the base of your speaking. The basic thoughts in the Bible are the top ones. No logic can exceed the logic of the Bible. There is no comparison. When your preaching is based on the Bible, your preaching will become powerful, yet it must be practical. You have to speak on the practical situation but with some portions or some verses from the Bible. Therefore, the third point is to learn to speak in a way that is always practical. If you take care of these three points, you will be able to learn a lot.<h2 class=head1>PREACHING TO OUR RELATIVES AND FRIENDS</h2><p>It is hard to say whether it is easier to talk to a person whom you know or to a person whom you do not know. We may have relatives whom we have known from our youth. Because we know them so well, we may not know how to talk to them. Our knowledge of them may hinder our ability to talk with them. Sometimes it is rather hard for us to preach the gospel to our relatives. It may be better to ask some sisters or brothers who do not know our relatives to speak to them. There may be more impact in their speaking.<p>We have much to learn in order to preach the gospel effectively. If we are going to speak to someone whom we have known for several years, we can exercise to speak to him as though we do not know him at all. Then we can speak something new, fresh, and particular to him. When we know a person so well, sometimes it is hard to know the best subject to use. If the person is proud, it is best not to talk about being proud. It may be better to talk about the Lord Jesus or even about the danger of the lake of fire. That might have more impact. If we know the person so well, and he realizes that he is a proud person, he may not want us to bring up such a subject. A strong reason that we are not always effective in preaching the gospel to our relatives is because we know them so well.<h2 class=head1>THE OPENING WORDS BEING THE MOST CRUCIAL IN GOSPEL PREACHING</h2><p>We all have to pick up an attitude, spirit, and atmosphere of learning. Suppose you come to my home, and I welcome you and invite you to come in and be seated. Now, how would you start the conversation? To me, this is the most difficult point. The first few sentences are the most crucial. To know how to begin, you have to pray, &#8220;Lord, what would I say?&#8221; You cannot simply go to all the people that you visit and tell them that you would like to speak with them about the mystery of human life. This is too common.<p>Sometimes you have to begin in a very gentle, normal way. Your speaking should give the impression that you are a normal person. This kind of impression will always be welcomed by people and will also invite people&#8217;s openness to you. They will be happy to talk to you. You may speak in this way: &#8220;I am a Christian. May I ask you, sir, are you a Christian?&#8221; This kind of opening is very broad and allows room to pursue almost any direction with him. When you open with, &#8220;Here is a book on the mystery of human life,&#8221; you have really limited yourself. From that point forward you will have to talk about the mystery of human life. After speaking for just a short time, you may find out that this person is not suited to such a subject, but it will be hard for you to change directions at that point. You will be limited. You may open in a general way by saying, &#8220;I am a Christian. Are you a Christian brother?&#8221; Then you can deal with the person in many directions.<h2 class=head1>BUILDING UP A GOSPEL PREACHING CUSTOM</h2><p>I have definitely found out that the most difficult thing for Christians to carry out is the gospel preaching. If you are going to be successful in this matter, you must realize that this is the most difficult point. It is not so easy to be successful in gospel preaching. I do not expect that you would be a big success. I only expect that you would go out regularly, preferably once a week. Do not go too often. Do it regularly, continually, and persistently. If you do this your whole life, once a week, I am fully confident that you will gain two remaining fruit yearly.<p>To do this you have to be willing to learn. Do not regard it lightly. Do not hold to a kind of understanding that everyone can preach the gospel. None of us can preach the gospel in a prevailing way unless we are trained. We have to be discipled in order to preach the gospel. If we will be discipled, we will surely gain fruit.<p>We should feel shameful that we have been barren for so many years. We have been barren because we have not had the spirit to learn to be trained, to be discipled. My burden is to stir up your heart and your spirit so that you can see that this is a big problem. After the Lord comes back, it will be hard for us to face Him if we have not borne any fruit. I hope you would be stirred up to pick up the burden for this in a normal way.<p>When people reach their twenties, it is normal for them to get married. Later, they will have children and rear them. This is the way ordained by God for man&#8217;s multiplication. In this way of propagation, the whole earth is replenished by man. The divine life is propagated in the same principle.<p>We should not expect a big revival. History has already proven that such revivals do not work. What is needed is a practical preaching of the gospel. All of us who love the Lord&#8217;s interest need to learn how to practice such preaching. Then we can bear a year-round burden of preaching the gospel, going out once a week. If we will get ourselves prepared, we will be successful. But for us to go to do this, much learning is needed. I hope this learning can be established in the Lord&#8217;s recovery and that such a gospel custom can gradually be built up.<p>This is similar to the way a language is picked up by a race of people. Eventually, a foundation with a certain custom becomes established. Those who are born in an American family speak American English spontaneously because the speaking of American English has been laid as a foundation and as a custom in American society. When the immigrants first came to this country, it was very hard for them to learn English. But after two centuries of their living in America, American English has penetrated nearly every family. I expect that a foundation and a custom of preaching the gospel will be built up in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. When such a custom has been built up, it will be easy for all the brothers and sisters in the Lord&#8217;s recovery to bear fruit. If we are to see a gospel-preaching custom built up among us, we must rise up and take this word and practice it week by week, trying our best to learn in every aspect. This will require our building up ourselves with the knowledge of the Bible and with the practical, proper speaking.<h2 class=head1>BEING FLEXIBLE TO MEET VARIOUS NEEDS</h2><p>No one can assure you that in any gospel situation there will not be problems. You may ask a person, &#8220;Are you a Christian?&#8221; He may respond to you with, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like Christianity.&#8221; Many answer in this way. Then what should you do? You have to learn how to shift to another subject. You may tell someone that you are a Christian, and he may respond with, &#8220;That&#8217;s your problem.&#8221; Then you could say to him, &#8220;Yes, this is my problem. But, sir, we all have to realize our whole human life is a problem. Is there a human being without a problem? Having a wife is a problem. Not having a wife is also a problem. Having children is a problem. Not having children is also a problem. Having money is a problem. Not having money is also a problem. In our human life, everything is a problem.&#8221; This kind of practical talk should convince him. He may not admit it, but in his heart he will be convinced. Then from this point you can turn to the mystery of human life. &#8220;So, sir, human life is a mystery. We do not know where we came from, and we do not know where we will go. None of us knows how long we will live.&#8221; This kind of normal speaking will open a wide field for you to preach the gospel.<p>One brother related an experience of going with some other brothers to visit a man who had come from mainland China. The brothers first talked to him a little bit about the situation in China. This opened him up. Then they tried to preach the gospel to him. When they brought out the booklet The Mystery of Human Life, he became very defensive, saying that he was an atheist. He believed absolutely in communism, and he did not want them to say anything about religion and things of that nature. He said they could talk about anything else but not that subject. Later, he mentioned that he was trying to learn certain aspects about computers. What he was trying to learn happened to be the field of one of the brothers. This caused him to open more and invite them to come again. But the brothers began to wonder if it was really worthwhile to go back to see him again since he told them that he was an atheist.<p>It is definitely worthwhile to go back to see such a person. His talk has opened a very wide gate for him to be gained. But when the brothers go to him the next time, they should only talk about computer hardware and software. Later, there will be a proper time for the gospel. It may be the third or fourth time. The brothers have to wait for a chance. If there is a little crack, the living water can get in. They can then take advantage of that little crack to speak the gospel.<p>We must go to practice preaching the gospel with much patience by having a spirit to learn, to be discipled. John 15 tells us that we were chosen to bear fruit (v. 16). Then we need to be discipled in order to bear more fruit (v. 8).<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class=title>NOURISHING THE NEW ONES THAT THEY MAY REMAIN</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 15:16; 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; 1 Pet. 2:2; Acts 5:42</h1><h2 class=head1>NOURISHING AND CHERISHING THE NEW ONES THAT THEY MAY REMAIN</h2><p>In this message we will begin to cover the second step of the God-ordained way: the nourishing and cherishing of the new ones that they may remain. In John 15:16 the Lord said, &#8220;I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain.&#8221; We have been charged with three things: we should go forth, we should bear fruit, and our fruit should remain. However, to insure that our fruit will remain is not an easy task. In the past in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, although we were short in the matter of gospel preaching, we brought many to the Lord and baptized a good number. However, very few have remained. The Lord is now teaching us a very crucial step. We all must learn what to do so that our fruit will remain.<p>In John 21:15 the Lord charges us to feed His lambs. This is to do something for the fruit that we have borne that they might remain. If we love the Lord, we must feed His lambs, the little ones, the small ones, the young sheep. The fruit in chapter fifteen becomes the lambs in chapter twenty-one. To bear fruit is to multiply or produce the lambs. But after producing the lambs, we still have to bear the responsibility to feed the lambs.<p>In 1 Thessalonians 2:7 Paul says, &#8220;We were gentle in your midst, as a nurse would cherish her own children.&#8221; Whenever a mother comes to cherish or nourish her little babe, she is always very gentle. In this verse Paul did not use the word &#8220;nourish,&#8221; but he used the word &#8220;cherish.&#8221; Cherishing includes nourishing, but it indicates more tender care than mere nourishing. When a mother cherishes her babe, generally, she will also nourish it. In Greek the word for &#8220;nurse&#8221; in this verse means &#8220;a nursing mother.&#8221;<p>When a baby is crying, the mother would not rebuke or spank it; the more the baby cries, the more gentle the mother would be. To cherish is to do everything in order to meet the little one&#8217;s need. Many times the mother knows why the babe is crying, but sometimes she does not know. When she comes to the baby and holds it, she may realize that the baby is hungry or cold. She would nurse her babe or hold it in a very loving way to warm it. Everything she does would become a kind of cherishing to that little babe to make it happy.<p>After we baptize someone, we must immediately consider ourselves as gentle, nursing mothers. Even Paul, the great apostle, became a nursing mother; he was so gentle with the young believers. After we bring people to the Lord and baptize them into the Triune God, we must take care of them.<h2 class=head1>PREPARING THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE HOME MEETING</h2><p>After a new one has been saved and baptized, we should begin to meet with him in his home. The best way to carry out the home meeting is simply to cause this new one to feel happy. The first and main thing we must do is to make this one happy. Someone may ask, &#8220;After baptizing someone and after he has changed his clothes, what is the first thing I should cover with him: the first lesson of Life Lessons or the first lesson of Truth Lessons?&#8221; To use these materials at this time may be a kind of &#8220;spanking&#8221; to that newborn babe. After the baptized one has changed clothes and comes to us, we must have a kind of attitude, appearance, and gesture that is so pleasant to make this dear one also feel pleasant. If we are not gentle but are so dignified or strict in our gesture toward the new believers, they may be offended by us and may not want us to visit them again. While the newly baptized one is changing, we must learn how to exercise in such a way that our whole being would express a contagious joy. Then when he comes to join you, you might stand up and greet him: &#8220;Hallelujah! It is so good that you have been saved! Congratulations!&#8221; This will warm his heart and make him pleasant and happy.<p>We must cherish the new ones to make them happy. We have to learn how to speak to them in the best way. Whatever we say must be said so pleasantly. We may begin: &#8220;This Bible is really good. Look how it is bound and printed. It is really beautiful.&#8221; This kind of speaking will cause this one to feel quite pleasant. He would be happy for us to talk with him further.<p>How many of us have gone to a home to have a home meeting in the way of making people feel pleasant? To nourish and cherish the new ones, we have to be fine and gentle. Some brothers are very eager and intense. Their way of speaking may be too strong or rough. This may intimidate or somewhat frighten the young ones. Others are like preachers, theological school graduates, always presenting one portion from the Bible after another to instruct them. Their gesture would give people the feeling that they are proud. This kind of talk, this kind of attitude, this kind of gesture, will always cool down the new ones.<p>If you were in a home talking with a man and his young, four-year-old son comes into the room, what would you do? This is an opportunity. You might simply reach out and touch this boy&#8217;s head softly and speak to him. This is the best way to warm up the father&#8217;s heart. You could stop talking to his father and just speak to this child for a few minutes. Then the father would be so pleased that he might tell you some things concerning his son. To care for people in this kind of gentle way is not so easy to learn.<p>Suppose three saints have brought an old man to the Lord and have baptized him. How should they meet with this old man? While this one is still changing clothes, perhaps one of the three, a young sister, would begin to sing a song concerning the joy of salvation. To sing a hymn or a song is often the best way to begin, but you have to sing the right song, and you have to sing it with the right voice. You have to be pleasant and natural in your singing. It is hard for me to teach you this. This is something you must learn by practicing. You can practice by speaking and singing to yourselves at home, and you can also practice every time you are with the new ones.<p>To preach the gospel and to gain people by contacting them in a way that will make them happy require much learning. Actually, this kind of learning is endless. For me to teach you these things is not easy. You have to pick up the principles and learn through your practice. Do not take this matter lightly. It is not enough to have some knowledge of the Bible. You also must know how to take care of people in a way that their hearts would be open to you.<h2 class=head1>KNOWING THE NEW ONES</h2><p>We should not merely make the new one pleasant or happy; that is not our purpose. We must be on the alert while we are talking to him in order to know what kind of person he is. The best way to do this is to leave some time for him to say something. We should not occupy all the time. While we are making him feel pleasant, we must give him some time to say something. By his speaking we can get to know him by realizing what his feeling, thinking, and intention are. We should learn to encourage him to speak more. Then we will know what we should say. We will realize whether or not this is the right time to get our time with him &#8220;on track.&#8221; If this is the proper time, we can introduce a subject related to spiritual things. We must learn all these things. It is not so simple, but if we have a good preparation, it will be easy to talk to this person on the &#8220;right track.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>SPEAKING THE OBJECTIVE TRUTH BEFORE THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE</h2><p>When you talk to people about spiritual things, you should first touch the objective side. You should not touch the subjective side too quickly. Immediately after baptism, some may touch the subjective experience, telling the new one that he has a human spirit. However, this may be too soon. If you have the burden to talk about this, you must lay a foundation. First you must tell him, &#8220;God is Spirit, and the Savior I have preached to you is this very God. Today, He is God, He is the Savior, and He is the Spirit.&#8221; You must lay a foundation by telling him something objective. This gives him a basis for the experience. After the objective teaching, you can come to the subjective experience. You can say, &#8220;He is the Spirit, and we also have a spirit.&#8221; We should avoid talking about subjective experience without first presenting some objective truth.<p>This is true not only for the home meetings but also for any kind of meeting. In any kind of speaking, you must first present something as an object for people to seek after, to touch. Otherwise, if a person is thoughtful and you tell him that he has a human spirit and that he can receive the Lord Jesus into his spirit, he may say, &#8220;Who is the Lord Jesus? Why can I receive Him into my spirit?&#8221; Your talk concerning subjective experience can stir up many questions. You must lay a foundation with the objective truth.<h2 class=head1>SPEAKING CONCERNING GOD</h2><p>In principle, after one is baptized, the first thing we should tell them about is our God and Savior. After we have prepared the situation, the atmosphere, we must exercise to tell this new one about God, the Savior, Jesus Christ. There are many ways to present God to people. We may talk with one man about God in this way: &#8220;Many times, regardless of who we are, all human beings do have a feeling that in this universe there must be some sovereignty.&#8221; This could touch people&#8217;s inner feeling. In our talk about God, we may also tell him, &#8220;If you go to Buddha, you will find out that this Buddha cannot solve your inward problems.&#8221; By this we touch the matter of idols. We may continue: &#8220;There is only One who can satisfy us, solving our problems, dispelling our doubts, and answering the questions within us. This One is the very God whom we worship, whom we believe in, and whom we have preached to you.&#8221; This is one way.<p>Another way to speak to him concerning God which is also from the inner feeling, yet from another angle, is to talk about the conscience. We may say, &#8220;Everyone who does something that hurts others, even if he can justify himself by certain reasonings, feels deep within that he is not right and that he is offending someone. Who is this someone? Why does man have a conscience?&#8221; This is another way to lead him to the point concerning God.<p>By these examples we can realize that we must learn many things. The home meetings depend upon our talk with the new ones. After our talk has induced a new one to speak a number of sentences, we may realize that he is a person who takes care of his conscience. Therefore, we may talk about God based upon the conscience. With another, we may realize he is a very ethical person. Then we can talk about God based upon his being ethical. In principle, the first thing we have to tell the new ones about is God.<p>We should always limit ourselves to one talk per visit, and in this talk, we should thoroughly cover one matter. We should not raise up subject after subject. To cover a number of subjects will not help; it will hurt.<h2 class=head1>SPEAKING CONCERNING SIN</h2><p>After our talking to them about God, many people need to know that they are real sinners. This is according to Paul&#8217;s sequence in the book of Romans. He tells us first about God; then he tells us about sin. This is a good sequence, but we should not follow it in a legal way. We should follow it in a very living way, in a very flexible way. We should first help someone to know God and then help him to know himself. We should help him to know he is a sinner, even sin itself.<p>To talk about sin is not easy. You should not say, &#8220;God is good; God is righteous. But you are not good; you are not righteous.&#8221; This way of speaking is poor. In speaking of sin, you should begin by using the pronoun &#8220;we.&#8221; You should say, &#8220;God is very good, but we are sinners.&#8221; Then the second time you may say, &#8220;God is righteous, but I and you are not righteous,&#8221; putting yourself first. The third time you may change a bit more, saying, &#8220;You and I are not righteous.&#8221; Now you have come down to the fact gently. However, to jump down suddenly would hurt your talk and would hurt your purpose. If you say, &#8220;You are a sinner,&#8221; this may close the door. After you go, he would put the Bible away and say to his wife, &#8220;This poor preacher-he called me a sinner.&#8221;<p>We can illustrate that we are sinners. However, we should not ask people, &#8220;Have you ever stolen from people? Have you never lied to people?&#8221; When we illustrate, we should use ourselves, saying, &#8220;I can testify to you that I did a lot of stealing when I was young. I stole chalk from the school. Many times I stole some money from my mother&#8217;s pocket.&#8221; When we are talking about ourselves, this really means we are talking about the new one. Surely everyone has stolen something. When we say that we stole, that means everyone steals. Our speaking will touch everyone&#8217;s conscience. Many times when we talk in this way, we will induce the hearer to say, &#8220;I must be honest. I did a lot of stealing. I even stole from my wife.&#8221; He would confess to us. This is very good. Then we may say, &#8220;This is very good that you would tell us that you have stolen from your wife.&#8221; To bring someone to this point is like the work of a surgeon. We can do a lot of things at this juncture.<p>To learn how to talk about people&#8217;s sin is not so easy. We must learn to always use ourselves as an illustration. After this we may say, &#8220;I must also be honest with you. I am a bad person. My temper is too bad. I love my mother to the uttermost, but after only five minutes I got angry with her. How do you feel about this? Is this not sin? In the Bible God charges us to honor our parents, but quite often I did not honor my mother.&#8221; If we illustrate in this way, we will touch his conscience.<p>Whenever we talk to people about sin, the best conclusion is to have a prayer of confession. However, we should not tell people to pray and ask them to confess their sins to the Lord. We do not need to instruct them to confess their sins. We should simply begin to pray, &#8220;Lord, forgive me. I am a sinner. I did a lot of stealing, and I did a lot of lying.&#8221; We should simply take the lead to confess our sin. Spontaneously, they will learn from us, and after we pray, they will continue by praying, &#8220;O God, I am also a sinner.&#8221; They will follow us. This is the best way to talk to people concerning sin. After such a prayer, we have to tell them about God&#8217;s forgiveness. However, we cannot cover this subject in the same talk. At the conclusion of our talk, we should help this one a little bit to know that our sins have been forgiven. At another time when the situation is right, we will be able to talk with him about forgiveness in a thorough way.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class=title>DEALING WITH VARIOUS CASES IN PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h1><p>We must learn how to deal with all of the various cases or situations in preaching the gospel. Our preaching of the gospel should not be that different from our normal talk. Even if we teach the Bible, it should be done as part of our practical dialogue with the person who is listening.<p>We should not use inappropriate examples or passages from the Bible to answer a question. One saint was speaking with a person who indicated that he was mad at God. An inappropriate response to this person will raise more questions and create problems. It would be profitable to say, &#8220;You may be mad at God, but God is never mad at you. God loves you. Regardless of how long you would be mad at Him, He still loves you.&#8221; This is the gospel. It may not be Bible teaching, but such a word will touch his heart. Spontaneously he would say, &#8220;Then what should I do?&#8221; Tell him, &#8220;You do not need to do anything; God is doing everything for you. He is here right now waiting for you to receive what He has done for you, and He has sent me here to tell you the things that He has done for you.&#8221; Then he will say, &#8220;What are the things that He has done for me?&#8221; Tell him, &#8220;Well, first of all He came to be a man, and He died on the cross for your sins. Isn&#8217;t this wonderful?&#8221; Then he may say, &#8220;What should I do?&#8221; At this point you can encourage him to simply say to God, &#8220;Dear God, thank You. I was mad at You, but I have just now realized that You are never mad at me and that You came to be a man and died on the cross for my sins.&#8221;<p>If he has difficulty praying, you can escort him in his prayer by asking him to follow you. Help him to take the first few steps. This is the proper preaching of the gospel. Some do not believe that people can be saved within just a few minutes, but it all depends upon how you present the gospel. In this situation you escorted one to pray, and he prayed a sincere prayer to God. God means business with us, and the Lord told us that if we believe in Him, if we receive Him, He will surely give eternal life to us (John 3:15-16).<h2 class=head1>NOT BEING LIMITED BY THE MOLD OF RELIGION</h2><p>We have unconsciously been molded by religion into a certain form. We do not realize how much this mold restricts and limits our releasing of Christ to others. One brother testified that he was surprised by one person&#8217;s response to him. The person said, &#8220;All you people do is talk. I am a man of action. You are wasting your time with me. You should go to the poor people, the people in need. If you want to help someone, come get me, and I will go with you and work together with you.&#8221; This response was not what the brother had expected, and he did not know what to say.<p>I would have encouraged the brother to respond immediately with, &#8220;Very good! Let us go now. We will go to work. We will take some action.&#8221; This is a word of insight into the thinking of the one you are visiting. Learn to have an ear for whatever a person may say. If he goes with you to visit others, you will gain many opportunities to impart the riches of Christ into him. This gives you the time to infuse him. You should never argue with him, but take this way to care for him practically.<h2 class=head1>SPEAKING TO THOSE WHO USE THE WORLD SITUATION AS AN EXCUSE</h2><p>Some people like to use the situations existing in the world as an excuse to reject the Lord Jesus. They reason that if there is a God, why would He allow so many things to happen? They mention the wars with so many people being killed. Others reason that God should perform miracles to take care of all these problems. One of the most common questions raised by thoughtful persons is why God would allow these sorts of things to occur.<p>We can answer such a question by saying, &#8220;Yes, you are really right. Nearly every thoughtful person would ask the same question. Honestly speaking, I don&#8217;t know how to answer you. This question is too great. If I can answer you, I must be God. He is God. God is mysterious, and we do not understand everything that He does. But one thing we know is that in the Bible He tells us that He wants us to repent and that He wants us to believe in Him. Now, I don&#8217;t know that much, but I must tell you I do know that I should repent, and I did. I do know that I should believe in the Lord Jesus, and I did. I also know that God wants you to receive His salvation.&#8221;<p>This approach condenses all the potential problems into one point. In this way you save yourself from being tempted into a misleading problem. You could argue with him three days and three nights without result. The more you argue, the more he has to say. You should not follow him into these things. You must say something to restrict him, to bring him back to the point for which you came to see him. You came to him to bring him to Christ.<p>Learn never to fight or argue with people. In considering this present case, a good verse with which to bring such a one back to the point is Deuteronomy 29:29 which says, &#8220;The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.&#8221; What has God revealed in the Bible? The Bible reveals that we are sinners, that we have to repent, and that we have to believe in the Lord Jesus. Right away you can bring this one to the point toward which you are working. However, if you use your Bible too much, you will fall into Bible teaching rather than conversing.<h2 class=head1>SPEAKING TO THOSE WHO USE RELIGION AS AN EXCUSE TO REJECT THE GOSPEL</h2><p>Someone may say that he does not want to believe in the Lord Jesus because he has been damaged by religion. He may refer to all the ugly things that are happening these days in religion, such as the preachers who are misleading people and taking their money. At this juncture we should not discuss religion with such a person. Forget about that. Rather, with such a case, it is better to point out to this dear one that today, in this universe, there is God, who is absolutely good and bright. Also there is Satan, the Devil. God is working today, but His enemy, the Devil, is also working. In Matthew 13 the Lord told us that while He is working, the Devil is also working. This is why you have wheat, the good ones. You also have tares, the bad ones. Even among His twelve disciples, there was Judas. Later in the New Testament, a number of Christians were deceived and misled. But we cannot give up the positive side because of the negative side. It is not wise to reject being wheat just because of so many tares. This is the way we can respond to such a case.<h2 class=head1>ANSWERING ACCORDING TO THE KIND OF PERSON</h2><p>While you are talking with someone, you can realize what kind of person he is from his attitude or from the tone of his words. If he is highly educated or quite knowledgeable concerning the Bible, you have to consider how to proceed with him. Your answer must be according to his level of education and according to the amount of knowledge he has about the Bible. If he is not highly educated and not knowledgeable concerning the Bible, you can take a simple, clear way with him. Remember that you should never fight or argue. Do not say &#8220;no&#8221; to people&#8217;s words. Rather, use whatever is brought up by the person to instruct him.<h2 class=head1>DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>Suppose someone asks you what church you attend. Some may answer that we do not take a certain name, but we just meet according to the city. This kind of answer may be ambiguous and confusing to him. The best way to answer is to avoid all the various involvements. This kind of question is usually asked by a Christian. It is best to simply say that we are not denominational. We just meet in a simple way. After you have visited with him for some time, and it appears that he is a real seeker after the truth, you may be able to share more with him concerning the church.<h2 class=head1>DEALING WITH THOSE WHO HAVE A LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF SPIRITUAL MATTERS</h2><p>With those who have a limited knowledge of spiritual matters, it is always good to center on the fact that God is real. Such a word calms all kinds of doubts and questions. It is hard for anyone to say that God is not real or to say that there is no God. Since God is real, we all have to consider what such a God has to do with us and what we have to do with Him. This kind of talk will lead others to realize that there are so many things in this universe which are far beyond our knowledge. Even medical doctors have to admit that there are many things about our human body which they do not understand. Another item we do not understand thoroughly is electricity. We do not have the capacity to know all these things. We do know that God is here. He is concerned with us, so we must be concerned with Him.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S FAR-REACHING SALVATION</h2><p>Someone was asked whether a terrible criminal who has committed all kinds of crimes and has become demon possessed can be saved. This kind of case provides a good opportunity for us to preach the good tidings, the gospel. In the New Testament, two criminals were crucified with the Lord Jesus. While the Lord was on the cross, one of these criminals was saved by Him. This is recorded in Luke 23. This is a strong proof that a criminal can be saved.<p>Regarding demon possession, we must learn not to be so demon conscious. Such thinking is a deceit of the enemy. Christians have to ignore the demons. Wherever we go, the demons will flee.<h2 class=head1>BEING FREED FROM FORMALITY</h2><p>Learn to be freed from formality. Christians must be those who are always singing, praising, and rejoicing. When we are not rejoicing, our minds will be soaring, but the best way to consolidate our soaring minds is to sing. Then our minds will be concentrated, and the Lord will get the praise and the glory. How glorious if we come to all the meetings of the church in such a way!<p>If you drop your formality when you go to visit people, you will not go as a pastor, a missionary, or a Bible student. Rather, your going will be in a normal way as a regular human being. In this way, your going will be so nice and pleasant. You must forget about your status. Do not try to behave. Just live. To behave yourself in an outward way is hypocrisy. Just be what you are. While you are going to knock on doors, you should be singing and rejoicing. Hymns, #717 is a good song for us to sing. The chorus of this hymn says:<p class=hbody>Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore, It is better to sing than be sighing: It is better to live than be dying; So let us rejoice evermore.<p>Christians should be living creatures (Ezek. 1:5-25; Rev. 4:6-8).<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class=title>HAVING HOME MEETINGS FOR REMAINING FRUIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 15:16; 21:15; Acts 5:42; 20:20; 1 Thes. 2:7; 1 Pet. 2:2</h1><p>We have seen that the first step of God&#8217;s ordained way is to preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes. The second step of the God-ordained way is to have meetings with the new believers in their homes. In Acts 5:42 and 20:20, the words &#8220;from house to house&#8221; indicate home meetings. We must have proper home meetings in order for our fruit to remain.<h2 class=head1>THE WORD, THE SPIRIT, SINGING, AND PRAYING</h2><p>There are four elements that constitute a meeting: the Word of God, the mingled spirit-our spirit mingled with God&#8217;s Spirit, singing, and praying. These are like the four legs of a table. If one leg is missing, the table will not stand. The Word, the spirit, our singing, and our praying are the four &#8220;legs&#8221; that support a meeting. Without these four elements, a meeting will be flat like a tabletop lying on the floor with nothing to support it. However, the more we have the living Word, the more we exercise the spirit, and the more we sing and pray, the more a meeting will be strengthened and built up.<p>When we are in a meeting, many of us do things as a form, without being genuinely living. Our singing and even our shouting can often be religious forms. However, the more we exercise our spirit to speak, sing, and pray in a free and released way, the better and more living the meeting will be. But if we come and sit in our seats in silence, the meeting will be dead. Sometimes a Christian meeting can be like a cemetery, so quiet and proper yet dead. This kind of meeting is a shame to the Lord.<p>To sit in silence kills the meeting and is an insult to the God whom we serve. In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul indicates that the dumb, voiceless idols (v. 2) make their worshippers dumb and voiceless. However, the living God causes His worshippers to speak in His Spirit (v. 3). The worshippers of God should not be silent but utter some voice by speaking forth the Lord Jesus in the Spirit of God. Whenever we come into a meeting, we should speak something. Singing, praying, shouting &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221;, or speaking the Word by reading from the Bible or reciting a verse are all proper kinds of speaking for the meetings. The more we have these four elements-the Word, the spirit, singing, and praying-the richer our meetings will be.<h2 class=head1>BEING NORMAL AND SPONTANEOUS BY LIVING IN THE SPIRIT</h2><p>When we go to visit the homes of ones whom we have recently baptized, we should not go in a religious way according to our usual practice, habit, or custom. We may plan to pray for a certain amount of time before going out to visit people. However, even this can become part of our religion. It is easy for us to take any way and make it a religious practice.<p>We all must learn to forget religion and live in the spirit. Then we will be quite living in a very normal way. We may arrive home from work only half an hour before our appointment with a new one. Then we will not be able to have our planned time to pray. We may not even have time to eat, so we might take a sandwich to eat on the way. While we are going and while we are eating, we can be praying, calling on the Lord, and singing. We can go in a very spontaneous way because we are persons living in the spirit.<p>When you arrive at the new ones&#8217; home, you may knock on the door and begin singing. You should sing the hymn, the song, or the chorus that you sang with them on your last visit when they were baptized. They are already familiar with the tune, and before they open the door, they can realize who has knocked. If they have a small child, he may join in your singing. You would be singing outside, and their small boy would be singing inside. In this way the meeting has started even before the door has been opened.<p>Once you enter the home, you must be very living and spontaneous. Instead of sitting on the sofa, you may sit down on the carpet in front of the boy to talk to him. Then after a short talk, you may get up. To act in this way shows you are so normal, so human, and so spontaneous. There would be no sign of religion and no sign that you are a preacher. If you learn to practice in this way, you will already be halfway to a success. The entire household will be prepared to receive your word because they will regard you as a friend. By acting in such a normal way, you can make yourself a friend to them within a short time. They will love you, feeling that you are so easy to contact.<p>You must also be very rich in the Word and in knowing the hymns and songs. If the mother is upset for some reason, you may feel to sing the chorus:<p class=hbody>Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore,<br>It is better to sing than be sighing:<br>It is better to live than be dying;<br>So let us rejoice evermore.<br><br> (Hymns, #717)</p><p>Regardless of the situation or the atmosphere, you must be able to speak the proper word or sing the proper song so that the meeting can begin in a very living way. This kind of home meeting should be neither religious nor formal but very spontaneous.<p>At this point the small boy may interrupt you to show you that he has a small Bible. This is a good opportunity. By talking to this small boy concerning the Bible, you can present a proper verse to the whole family. You might turn to Acts 16:31-&#8220;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household&#8221;-and ask the boy to read it. After his reading you might ask him what this verse says. Based upon this verse, you may check with him: &#8220;Have you believed in the Lord? Have you been saved?&#8221; This kind of talk will turn his mother from her anxiety or hard feelings to a joy or happiness concerning her son&#8217;s salvation. Then you can also turn to the others to help them to know that once they have believed in the Lord Jesus, they are saved. In this way you can cover one definite point with these newly saved ones- the assurance of God&#8217;s salvation. This is the way to have a home meeting.<p>We all must exercise not to be religious or formal in our appearance, our bearing, or our speaking. We must avoid visiting people in the way of a preacher coming to preach to them. Recently a couple from the church went to visit another couple. Both couples had similar situations-the husbands were Japanese, and the wives were Chinese. The couple from the church had been told that this couple was not interested in the gospel, so they decided beforehand that they would not speak to them about the gospel. Although they prayed in the car while they were going, they did not take their Bibles or hymnals into the home with them. Because their marriage situations were similar, they could talk to them quite naturally, asking them when they had been married, when they had come to the United States, and if they had made any friends. The couple from the church told them that, like themselves, they had also recently come to the United States and that if they ever needed any practical help, they would be willing to help them. The couple they were visiting told them that they did not have a car, which made shopping difficult, and the husband said he did not have any friends. The brother told him that when they had the time, they would come to visit them. The husbands spoke Japanese, and the wives spoke Chinese. This kind of talk was very natural and pleasant and caused this couple to open their hearts to this brother and sister and share their needs and anxieties with them. Eventually, the wife opened to the sister and indicated that they had not absolutely rejected the Lord Jesus and that they would allow them to speak concerning the gospel.<p>They left that couple in a very happy atmosphere, having prepared the way to gain them for the Lord. This is not the way of a religious preacher forcing others to take something. The conversation was spontaneous in every way, and it led to a very positive point concerning the gospel. On her own, the wife opened to say that they had not rejected the Lord Jesus. Now that couple is willing to receive this brother and sister and listen to whatever they would say. I believe that the next time they go to visit them, something will happen because their hearts are already open and their spirits are already prepared. This is the wise way to speak to people for the gospel.<p>We are often too anxious to gain people and go too far too quickly; so eventually, we offend people and gain nothing. That closes the door, and it will be very hard to go back a second time. Many people do not like preachers, and many educated, thoughtful people do not like religion. We have to be ordinary men and women. Even the way we dress must be very normal so that it will not occupy people&#8217;s attention. We must go to visit others as ordinary people, without being special in any outward way.<p>It was sovereign of the Lord that this brother and sister would visit such a couple-both husbands being Japanese and both wives being Chinese. But we have to know how to utilize such a situation in a spontaneous and normal way. Then we will pave the way by opening people&#8217;s hearts and preparing their spirits to receive whatever we might speak the next time. In carrying out the home meetings, we should not expect to do a quick job. Instead, we should do it slowly. This is the wise and effective way.<h2 class=head1>GRASPING THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPART THE WORD</h2><p>We must learn to take the opportunity to minister the holy Word. Regardless of how much you would act in a spontaneous way, you must grasp some time to minister something of the holy Word. In talking with that lady, it seems that the sister did not minister anything of the Word to her. However, that lady responded by telling the sister that she would not reject the Lord Jesus. Furthermore, she was also ready to receive whatever the sister would speak to her. By these two points, we can realize that this lady had already received something. It was wise not to go further at that time. However, in most cases we must take the opportunity to minister something of the Word into the ones we visit. We should not go too fast, yet we should not waste our time. We must minister something of the holy Word to these ones concerning Christ, concerning God, and concerning God&#8217;s salvation. On the one hand, we must be so spontaneous, so ordinary, and so human, not giving people any impression that we are pushing something. On the other hand, we must learn to skillfully grasp the time to speak something of the Word, even if it is only for a few minutes. It is always best to use a verse from the Bible. We must impart this verse into the ones we are visiting to fulfill our main purpose.<p>If we have a burden to help these ones know that their sins have all been forgiven, we should wait for the appropriate time and then open to a verse from the Bible concerning God&#8217;s forgiveness. Then we can minister such a verse to these ones. This is not easy, so we all have to learn by practice. We must grasp the right time, minister the right verse, and minister it in a way that is brief yet impresses them very deeply.<p>To select a good verse concerning God&#8217;s forgiveness is not difficult, but to apply such a verse properly requires skill. Acts 10:43 says, &#8220;To this One all the prophets testify that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins.&#8221; To apply this verse, first you could ask the new one to read it. When he comes to the words &#8220;everyone who believes,&#8221; you should check with him, saying, &#8220;Everyone who what?&#8221; Let him say, &#8220;Who believes.&#8221; Then right away you can ask, &#8220;Have you believed?&#8221; He might answer, &#8220;Yes, I believed last night.&#8221; Have him continue to read: &#8220;Who believes in Him.&#8221; Check with him word by word: &#8220;Have you believed in Him? Him refers to Christ the Savior. Have you believed in Him?&#8221; Surely he will say, &#8220;Yes, I have believed in Him.&#8221; You may ask, &#8220;Then, what would happen?&#8221; and let him continue, &#8220;Who believes in Him receives.&#8221; You ask, &#8220;Receives what?&#8221; He reads, &#8220;Receives forgiveness.&#8221; You ask, &#8220;Forgiveness of what?&#8221; He answers, &#8220;Forgiveness of sins.&#8221; While he is reading, you can follow his reading and check word by word in this way. Then you may ask him to read the whole verse. This will impress him with some living word from the Bible. After your application of this verse, you can check with him, &#8220;How about your sins now?&#8221; He might say, &#8220;My sins have all been forgiven.&#8221; You ask, &#8220;How do you know?&#8221; He would tell you that this verse says so.<p>To merely read to the new ones does not work very well. We must develop our skill so that we can impart a verse into them. This is like nailing a piece of wood to something. You have to nail it properly or it will come off. We must develop the skill to impart a verse into someone perfectly and completely. This will capture the new ones, and they will never escape because such a verse is in them. This is why I am very repetitious in my speaking. When I speak something, I speak it repeatedly to impress the hearers so that they can never forget. Often I will speak one thing from many different angles.<p>Do not think that to go to people&#8217;s homes and have home meetings with them is an easy thing. First we must learn to be spontaneous, and second we must learn how to grasp the opportunity to minister something of the Word into the people we contact.<h2 class=head1>ACTING ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION</h2><p>Recently a gospel team went to visit a couple on a Saturday night. The next day this couple came to the Lord&#8217;s table meeting. During the meeting the husband was very touched by the Lord, and he was baptized after the meeting. Then on Tuesday night this team went to the couple&#8217;s home to see them. On their first visit, one of the brothers had given the husband a hymnal and a book used for a time of morning revival. When they arrived, they realized that the house had been prepared for them, and these two books had been laid out on the table. Then this new brother picked up these books and joined them, so they felt they should sing something from the hymnal to help him to know something more about Christ. After singing this hymn, they sensed that he needed something, that he was not so free. They told him that there was something that could make him really free. They shared that as Christians we have two very powerful treasures: inwardly we have the Spirit of God dwelling in our spirit, and outwardly we have the Bible, the Word of God, which is the truth (John 17:17). When we feel that we are bound, we need to get into the Word by using our spirit to touch the Word, and the truth will set us free. Today the Lord is the Spirit, and He dwells in our spirit. Wherever the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom (2 Cor. 3:17). By sharing these things, they encouraged him to use his spirit by calling on the Lord when he gets up in the morning to have his morning revival. He told the brothers that he had already read through almost half of the morning revival book, and at the end of their time, he stood and prayed with them in a very good way. In only thirty minutes they had used the Word, showing him the verses which say &#8220;the truth shall set you free&#8221; (John 8:32) and &#8220;the Lord is the Spirit&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:17), and they had encouraged him to exercise his spirit with them. The meeting ended in a very pleasant way, and he was willing to come to a small group meeting on the following Friday and again to the Lord&#8217;s table on the Lord&#8217;s Day.<p>They did a very good job within about thirty minutes. When they entered this new one&#8217;s home and saw that he had put out the hymnal and the other book of morning revival verses, they realized that this man was ready to receive something. They did not need to do anything to prepare him but could go directly to the point. They simply went to this new one&#8217;s home and acted not according to any preparation but according to the real situation.<p>We all must learn not to be formal, legal, or religious but to go and see what the situation is and then act accordingly. These brothers did not choose a subject beforehand. They simply saw the situation. That new one put out the hymnal and something related to the Bible, showing that he was happy with those two gifts, so one of the brothers took that opportunity to speak something. It was very wise to talk to him based upon those gifts that he was so happy about.<p>If the brothers had selected a subject beforehand, they might have presented their prepared talk without caring about the situation. That kind of talk would not have been so successful, so positive. It was good that these brothers did not do this; they went according to the likes and dislikes of the new one. This was wise and flexible, making their speaking very effective.<h2 class=head1>BEING EQUIPPED IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH AND IN THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE</h2><p>To take this way is not easy because it requires us to be properly equipped with much knowledge of the truth and experience of life. You must be so experienced and so knowledgeable that you can take care of any situation. We must also learn to be very keen and alert to know people&#8217;s feelings and desires. We must know what is within the ones to whom we are going to talk. This requires much experience. I know that when some of the young saints have an appointment to visit someone, they are very anxious. All day they may pray concerning that appointment, and they may also read some messages or some books on the way to talk to people. By all these things they get themselves very much prepared, but that is not the same as being equipped. That is a kind of temporary preparation which could kill the home meeting.<p>You all must be equipped, not by only one day&#8217;s labor but by over two years&#8217; labor. You must get yourselves equipped in the knowledge of the truth and in the experience of life. Then you will be rich, and you will also be so keen to know people&#8217;s feelings and intentions. You need to pray much that the Holy Spirit will be with you to help you to realize the real situation of the new ones. Then when you go, you can speak something rich according to the situation and according to the real need of the ones you are contacting.<h2 class=head1>NEEDING TO PRACTICE</h2><p>We all have to learn two things: to be normal and spontaneous, and to grasp the opportunity to impart something of the Word. The best way to learn is for four or five of you to come together to practice. You can demonstrate how to begin a home meeting and how to talk to people according to many different situations. This will help you. I believe that most of you have enough experience to go to the home meetings. However, you do not know how to express yourselves. Some young ones, especially the sisters, are so self-conscious when they go to a home meeting. They do not know how to stand, how to sit, or where to put their hands. It seems that they are afraid of everything. Therefore, they have to practice. In 1927, over sixty-two years ago, I realized that for my whole life I would speak for Christ. I did not study at a seminary or a Bible school, and I did not have anyone to teach me how to speak. The company I was working for at that time was very close to the ocean. After lunch we had about one hour, and I used to go to a little hill near the ocean and practice speaking there. This is how I learned to speak. In the evenings I went home and stood in front of a long mirror where I could see my whole body, and I practiced speaking and gesturing. This helped me, and I advise you all to practice the things that I have shared with you. Do not wait until you go to a home. If you never practice, you will not know what to do when you go to a home. Practice these things, and you will be able to have proper home meetings so that your fruit will remain.<p>First Peter 2:2 says that the newborn babes long for the milk of the Word. The newborn babes do not know how to drink, but we have to feed them. Without the mother&#8217;s feeding, no newborn babe can take the milk. We have to go to the new ones&#8217; homes not only to feed these ones with milk but also to teach them how to feed. Then they can grow by our feeding. We have to go to the new ones because they do not know what to do. Then we have to teach or tell them many things concerning the spiritual life. The first four things we must tell them are to read the Bible, to pray to the Lord as the Spirit, to keep the practice of morning watch, and to come to the meetings. To do this requires much learning and skill.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class=title>REACHING PEOPLE WITH THE GOSPEL</h1><p>We all have to know the Bible and some of the historical facts so that when we meet a thoughtful and educated person, we will be able to present an answer to his question that convinces, persuades, and subdues him.<p>In preaching the gospel, you may meet a very educated and thoughtful person. He may say that he is not a bad person, that he has a good marriage, and that he tries to live a good life. Everything may be going very well for him. While you are presenting the gospel to him, he may ask how anyone can really know that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead. Because this question involves a very great matter, your conversation with him must be a little longer, slower, and more thorough.<h2 class=head1>PREACHING THE GOSPEL CONCERNING THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST</h2><p>When we preach the gospel concerning the resurrection of Christ to a thoughtful person, we can use the migration of people from northern Europe to the United States three or four hundred years ago as an illustration to show how we believe that something happened long ago, even when we were not there to witness the event. The reason we believe that many northern Europeans migrated to this country is because of three things: the historical record, the actual descendants of these immigrants, and the physical evidence in the surrounding environment. When we use such an illustration, we should stress these points repeatedly in order to convince and subdue our listener. First, the historical record, the written history, tells us that such a migration took place three or four hundred years ago. Second, the descendants of those who migrated are now present among us, and they can trace their genealogies back to these immigrants. Their being in this country today is strong evidence that such a migration took place. Third, the physical surroundings, such as the different types of buildings, point to a migration because the original inhabitants did not have such dwellings.<p>The proof of the resurrection of Jesus Christ likewise has three key elements: the historical record, the Christian descendants, and the effect of Christ and His resurrection on human society.<h2 class=head2>The Historical Record</h2><p>The Bible contains the historical record concerning not only the resurrection of Christ but also the entire history of Christ. The first page of the New Testament presents His genealogy (Matt. 1:1-17). The Bible, having come through many generations, has been recognized by the entire world as a great book.<p>Some may argue that the Bible says things that are not true. The way to determine whether a book is true or not is to examine its contents. If a book has a low standard of morality and ethics, such as the book of Mormon, we are justified in not believing it. But if a book has a high standard of morality and ethics, we must believe it. The Bible has been universally recognized as a book with the highest standard of ethics and morality. Therefore, we have to admit that whatever it says is true.<p>The contents of the Bible include many different items. The prophecies concerning the nation of Israel are just one important section. Because of Israel&#8217;s degradation, God became unhappy with them, punishing them by dispersing them among the nations. This prophecy concerning the dispersion (Deut. 28:62-64; Luke 21:24) was fulfilled six hundred years before Christ when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, conquered Judah (2 Chron. 36:6-21). The loss of their country was a sign of God&#8217;s punishment of the children of Israel.<p>The Bible also predicted that one day the land would return to the Jews (Matt. 24:32; Luke 21:24) and that they would be formed into a country. The nation of Israel was formed in 1948, and in 1967 Jerusalem was returned to the Jews. This prediction is strong proof that the Bible is a trustworthy book. It was written by God Himself through the prophets in the Old Testament and through the apostles in the New Testament.<p>The Bible also contains the words spoken by the Lord Jesus. His words are deeper, of a higher standard, and more full of meaning than those of any philosopher including Plato and Confucius. For instance, the Lord Jesus said that He is the light of the world (John 8:12), the life (14:6), and the resurrection (11:25). He called us to come to Him and drink (7:37), and He offered Himself to us as the bread of life (6:35). The words spoken by the Lord Jesus are unique and profound; no other person could speak such words. The words of the Lord Jesus are so profound that one philosopher remarked that if the Christ portrayed in the Gospels is false, then whoever wrote such a portrait is qualified to be Christ.<p>No one but the Lord Jesus could say, &#8220;Come to Me...and I will give you rest&#8221; (Matt. 11:28), or &#8220;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven....he who eats Me shall also live because of Me&#8221; (John 6:51, 57), or &#8220;If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink&#8221; (7:37). Confucius and Plato could not say such things because they were not such a person as the Lord Jesus. Chapters five through seven of the Gospel of Matthew show the high standard of the Lord&#8217;s teaching. No one but the Lord Jesus ever uttered such a word about loving our enemies (Matt. 5:43-44). In human history there has been only one person who could speak and did speak such things, and His words were written down in the Bible. The Bible as a record of history is very high in its morality and ethics; therefore, it is very believable and trustworthy.<h2 class=head2>The Testimony of Christian Descendants</h2><p>The second reason we know that Jesus Christ was resurrected is by the spiritual descendants of those who witnessed it. Peter, John, and the other apostles, including Paul, were witnesses of Christ&#8217;s resurrection and were the first generation of Christians (1 Cor. 15:4-8). This first generation told the next generation, and the next generation told the succeeding generation until the report reached us today. Our spiritual forefathers can be traced back to the first generation. In China everyone believes that there was a person named Confucius, not only because of the written history but also because of his descendants who are living in China today. These descendants can trace their genealogy back to their forefather Confucius. We Christians can also trace our genealogy back to Peter and John, the first generation of Christians.<h2 class=head2>The Effect of Christ&#8217;s Resurrection on Human Society</h2><p>The third reason we know that Jesus Christ was resurrected is by the effect of His resurrection on human society. Christianity is the product of His resurrection. The whole earth being under a calendar which is based upon the birth of Jesus Christ is also a strong evidence of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. This indicates that Jesus is Lord of all.<h2 class=head1>GUIDING PEOPLE INTO THE REALITY OF CHRIST</h2><p>When a person asks a question which is too vague and too broad, we should try to solidify or compress his question into a manageable form. Otherwise, their question is like a kite without a string which soars out of control. The best thing to do in such cases is to open up to some specific verses. By opening up some specific verses, you pin him down. Then you are able to speak a definite word to him, and he is able to ask a definite question. By this definite conversation, you can guide him into the reality of Christ being life to us. You may direct a certain one to read John 6:35. After he reads, you may say, &#8220;This is the Lord Jesus&#8217; word. We all believe in Him. This word spoken by the Lord Himself tells us that He is life, even the bread of life. Now we can eat Him. To eat Him means to enjoy Him, to take Him in.&#8221; He then may ask how to eat and enjoy Christ. You can tell him that to enjoy Christ, to eat Christ, is just to pray to Him. Then help him to pray. This will surely help him.<p>Because people may have a lot of religious knowledge, it is best to avoid any discussion of doctrines. Lead them to some solid verses, and stress their content again and again. This will take away any ground for arguments because the verses are the words of the Lord Jesus Himself. This will shorten your discussion very much.<h2 class=head1>FOCUSING OUR PREACHING ON ONE PERSON AT A TIME</h2><p>The best way to conduct a gospel dialogue is with one person at a time. You should direct your speaking primarily to one person. Therefore, when you are with a group, you must learn to be keen and alert. Whenever someone speaks, you should discern what kind of person he is, and where he is coming from. By their speaking, you should be able to discern who among them is the one to whom you should address your speaking. In a group of four or five people, we should direct our speaking to one person; otherwise, our time will be wasted by trying to take care of too many in one conversation. Interruptions are sent by the Devil to waste time and annul the gospel dialogue. Eventually, due to these interruptions, there is little result.<h2 class=head1>ALWAYS TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPART THE WORD</h2><p>In visiting people, an important principle is always to take the opportunity to impart some word of the Bible into them regardless of the length of the conversation or the nature of the conversation. This imparting of the word is an injection. We may come and go, but the verses will remain with people for a long time. It may be that the person will not allow the word to work very much at first. But after twenty years, the verses will still be there working on him. Therefore, we should not allow our time with people to be in vain. We should give them an injection of the word. For this reason, we must be very familiar with the Bible, especially the New Testament, so that we can select some golden verses to use at any time without the need of a lot of consideration.<h2 class=head1>TURNING PEOPLE FROM THE MIND TO THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h2><p>When we go out to preach the gospel, we should know that Satan is opposing us. He will try to frustrate our gospel dialogue by bringing in unanswerable questions. The mind of educated ones is often like a big, bottomless ocean. Again, we must try to pin them down to a particular point. Often we will have to leave the area or field of their question and lead them into another realm. The best way is to turn the person from his or her mind to the spirit. You may say, &#8220;Our discussion, thus far, has been completely in the realm of the mind. But we have to realize that we human beings are not of one part only. We have many parts. We have our physical part, our body, and we also have our psychological part, our soul, of which the mind is the largest part. You and I have exercised two parts of our being. We have used our mouths which belong to our physical part, and our minds which belong to our psychological part. Yet we human beings also have another part, our spirit. In your mind you may say that there is no God and that you strongly believe the theory of evolution, but at night while you are quiet and calm, there is another sensation within you. This sensation is not in the mind but in another part of your being. This part of your being is your spirit. If you remain in the consideration of your mind, you sense that there is no God. But if you turn to your spirit, you sense that there is a God.&#8221; By this kind of conversation, you rescue your listener from the endless psychological realm to the realm of the human spirit.<h2 class=head1>PRESENTING THE HUMAN SPIRIT BY USING DIFFERENT ILLUSTRATIONS</h2><p>We have to learn to talk about the human spirit in many different ways using many different illustrations. Suppose you do something wrong. No one knows except you, yet there is a kind of condemnation within you. This is not psychological; rather, it is a matter of the function of the conscience within the human spirit. Publicly during the day, the atheists may say that there is no God, but alone at night, there is something within them-their spirit-which affirms that there is a God. A person may be very rich in material things and enjoy all kinds of entertainment, yet still be very unsatisfied. The body may be satisfied, the psychological part may be satisfied, but there is still a part which is not satisfied. This unsatisfied part is the human spirit.<p>The spirit is the organ for us to contact God. We have the five physical senses for realizing color, smells, sounds, tastes, and textures. The eyes are for seeing things such as color. If you lose your sight, you cannot use your ears to hear color. Similarly, if you lose your sense of smell, you cannot use your eyes to see a foul odor.<p>Our spirit is the organ for us to realize, sense, and contact God. In our mind we cannot see or realize God. Just as our ears cannot hear color, our mind cannot realize God. In order to realize color, we must use our eyes; likewise, in order to contact God, we must use our spirit. In such a discussion using the above points, it would be good to inject a Bible verse such as John 4:24.<h2 class=head1>PRESENTING THE CHURCH TO GOSPEL CONTACTS</h2><p>The matter of the church may be raised after you have visited someone for a number of weeks. When this subject is first mentioned, there may not be enough time to adequately cover it, yet it is still good to give a few injections, or verses, concerning the church. You may say, &#8220;The church is constituted with Christ as life. According to Ephesians 1:22-23, the church comes out of Christ. Christ is the substance and reality of the church.&#8221; This is probably sufficient, especially if he is a Christian and you intend to visit him next week.<p>On your next visit, you should immediately go to the subject of the church, not wasting any time. After you briefly remind him of the subject of the church which he proposed for your fellowship, you should wait for him to say something. Otherwise, you will not know where he is. By giving him the opportunity to speak, you may realize that he is a person who has never been saved, that is, he is a nominal Christian. Then you may say, &#8220;Today, in Christianity there are two kinds of Christians, genuine and nominal. Many came into Christianity without being saved.&#8221; You should then talk with him about salvation, helping him to realize that he is not yet a real Christian. This may take all of your time, so you should make an appointment to come together again next week. Perhaps over a period of four or five weeks, you may be able to cover the matter of the church, depending upon your way of handling this kind of person.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=title>FOUR CRUCIAL PRACTICES OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading:      1. Reading the Bible-2 Tim. 3:15-16      2. Praying Always-1 Thes. 5:17-18      3. Keeping Morning Watch-Psa. 119:147-148      4. Attending the Meetings-Heb. 10:25</h1><h2 class=head1>BEING RELEASED FOR THE LORD&#8217;S WORK</h2><p>In this message we will continue to fellowship concerning the way to care for the new believers in the home meetings. To have successful home meetings is not easy; it depends entirely upon our actions. Whenever we do something as a part of the Lord&#8217;s work, we must be released persons. We must also be persons who can cause others to be released. As descendants of Adam, all the people on this earth are under some kind of bondage. However, in touching the work of the Lord, we cannot be people under bondage; we must be fully released. If we go to visit a new one&#8217;s home to have a home meeting, yet we are not released, this can be very damaging. We all have to learn to get ourselves fully released from every kind of bondage.<p>There are many things that come to us to bind and oppress us. In this respect, we are very weak and fragile. A small thing can easily bind us. While a brother is driving to a new one&#8217;s home for a home meeting, one of his team members may say something about his driving. This little word about his driving will make him unhappy and bind him. In married life it is difficult to be released because small things can easily cause offenses, and to be offended is to be bound.<p>Before going to visit a home, you may receive a phone call that causes you to become bound. You may feel and realize that you are bound and even pray, &#8220;O Lord, release me,&#8221; but many times your prayer would not be answered. Then when you enter the home, outwardly you may shout and rejoice, but inwardly you are not released. The Devil knows you are bound, your spirit knows you are bound, and even the new ones will realize that something within you is not so pleasant. Your being bound can kill the home meeting. Regardless of what you would say, preach, or teach, it would not work. Therefore, to work for the Lord effectively, you must be a released person.<p>Many years ago while I was in Shanghai, Brother Watchman Nee stressed this point very much. He told us that we should never open any letters shortly before speaking for the Lord. If I would open a letter before speaking, I might be damaged and lose my effectiveness. Even to look at the sender&#8217;s name and address might bother me. Brother Nee also said that when we are about to speak, we should not accept any phone calls. Many times as I am picking up my books to come to the meeting, the phone will ring. Should I answer it or not? These things are quite bothering.<p>Another bothering factor can be our children. If we are about to go to speak for the Lord, something will happen related to our children that will bother us. It is easy to see how fragile we are. Many things in our circumstances, in our environment, and in our situation come to us with the intention of destroying our spiritual work. This is why it is hard to find anyone on this earth who is fully released, without any kind of bondage. We cannot avoid people completely. We have to contact others, and the more we contact others, the more bothering factors we will have.<p>All of us are surrounded by bothering factors. How can we learn not to be bothered? This lesson is endless; we will continue to learn it until we meet the Lord. My burden in this message is to make one basic lesson clear to all of you. Regardless of how much training you receive concerning the home meetings, you must first learn how to get yourselves released. It is possible to do nearly everything under bondage. If you are under bondage, you can still teach in a classroom or you can still learn as a student. However, in touching the spiritual work, as long as you are not released, you can do nothing.<p>The subtle enemy that damages our work is the one who bothers us. Once we become bothered, we are not released, but bound. Then our work becomes fruitless. For our work in the home meetings, we all must learn to keep ourselves always in the spirit. We should never get out of the spirit to deal with things in our environment or situation. We must preserve ourselves in the spirit. It is also good to try not to get involved in troubling situations. Once you are involved with anything, it is easy to become bothered.<p>On the negative side, we must learn not to get ourselves involved. On the positive side, we must preserve, or keep, ourselves in the spirit. Then even if someone says something to us concerning our driving, we would not care, we would not be interested in getting involved. The problem is that we are too sensitive and always want to be involved in everything. Some like to know everything and are always hunting for information. If we are like this, we are through with the Lord&#8217;s work.<p>The Bible tells us that while the Lord Jesus was on this earth, He was deaf and blind (Isa. 42:19). He was not actually deaf and blind, but He simply would not hear or see. Sometimes I go places and actually see many things, but I do not care for or pay attention to those things. Instead, I might be considering a certain chapter in the Bible. Therefore, when I return I do not remember many of the things that I have seen. I believe the Lord Jesus&#8217; eyes were very sharp, but He would not look upon so many things. In that sense, He did not see; He was blind. In this same sense, He was also deaf. He did not see and He did not hear, so He did not become involved in so many things. We must realize that we might be persons who are involved in too many things. Some can be among us for only a few days and already be involved in more things than I am. Such persons cannot carry out the Lord&#8217;s work. We all must learn not to get ourselves involved with others or in others&#8217; situations. We must be those who know only the Lord and nothing else.<h2 class=head1>SPEAKING ACCORDING TO THE NEW ONES&#8217; NEED</h2><p>Right after their baptism, we must help the new ones in the home meetings. However, we should not do this in a legal way as if we were using a textbook: first, lesson one, then lesson two, and so forth. First, we must be released. We must have a spirit that is very free and which can sense the feelings of others. Then when we come to the new ones to have a home meeting in their home, we should not have a subject that we have already decided to cover. That will kill the meeting. We can sing, pray, or praise to make ourselves so released and also to release others. By this, the new ones will open up to us and say something. By listening to them, we can sense their feelings about their situation. Then we can speak something to them that is according to their need.<p>A new one may say, &#8220;In these two days since my baptism, I have not had any peace within.&#8221; What should you say? If you were to say something concerning consecration because you had prepared this subject for the meeting, that would not fit and would not meet this new one&#8217;s need. You must follow the spirit to speak something to this one. It is best not to speak something too quickly, but first ask him why he did not have peace within for these two days. There must be some reason. In his answer you may find out the cause of his problem. He might say that after he was baptized, he began to think of his father and of what his father might feel concerning his becoming a Christian. Now you know the cause of his being troubled and can speak something to meet his need.<p>Sometimes you need to ask the new ones a question in order to find out something, but do not ask too many questions. It is better to solve one question at a time. This new one is troubled when he considers his father; he may feel that his father might rebuke him or reject him. Your answer will depend upon your learning, your knowledge. You may use Acts 16:31: &#8220;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household.&#8221; You can read this verse to him and tell him, &#8220;This is a great promise to the believers. All believers have the right to expect that their whole family will be saved. You do not need to worry about your father; you have to believe the Lord&#8217;s Word. Sooner or later your father will be saved.&#8221; In this way you can strengthen him.<h2 class=head1>FOUR CRUCIAL PRACTICES OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2><p>Four crucial practices of the Christian life are reading the Bible, praying always, keeping morning watch, and attending the meetings. It would be marvelous if we could cover these four crucial practices in two home meetings.<h2 class=head2>Reading the Bible</h2><p>Although you may have strengthened and encouraged a new one, this alone is not adequate. You still have to grasp the time to go further, to speak something more. You should not go to a home meeting with a prepared subject, but you must have a purpose. To have a purpose in going to a home meeting is different from making a decision as to what you are going to speak. If you are going to visit a man who was baptized only two days ago, you must have a burden, a purpose, to feed, or nourish, him. You may say, &#8220;This verse, Acts 16:31, is very good and comforting. The Word is straight and pure. We Christians should know the verses in the Bible, so we need to read the Bible. From the first day that we believe in the Lord Jesus, we must pick up the practice of reading the Bible. Second Timothy 3:15-16 says, &#8216;From a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation....All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.&#8217;&#8221; Then you can fellowship with him and charge him to set aside some time to read the Bible every day.<h2 class=head2>Praying Always</h2><p>You may continue your talk with him by saying, &#8220;To read the Bible is good, but it should be accompanied by another thing-our prayer to the Lord. Our reading should be matched by prayer. We can take the word &#8216;All Scripture is God-breathed&#8217; and simply turn it into prayer, saying, &#8216;Lord, thank You for all the Scriptures. Thank You that all the Scriptures are God-breathed.&#8217; You must learn to pray the words of the Bible in this way.&#8221;<p>You should demonstrate how to read the Bible and pray. You can also read him 1 Thessalonians 5:17-18-&#8220;Unceasingly pray; in everything give thanks&#8221;-and say, &#8220;Prayer should always be followed by thanksgiving. This verse says to pray without ceasing and then to give thanks to God.&#8221; You can read these two verses and then demonstrate a little bit. This will help him. In contacting him in this way, you can open up the conversation to both the reading of the Bible and prayer.<h2 class=head2>Keeping Morning Watch</h2><p>After a few days, you must visit this one again. This time when you arrive, rather than listening to him first, you should say, &#8220;Two days ago we talked to you about reading the Bible and praying. Now we would like to tell you about another practice which is crucial to our Christian life-keeping morning watch.&#8221; You can explain to him what morning watch is by saying, &#8220;Every day, rise up a little earlier to spend some time with the Lord to read the Bible and converse with Him. While you are conversing with the Lord, you can tell Him whatever you need. This is to pray. You do not need to do this too long, maybe about ten minutes every morning. This will be a great help to your Christian life.&#8221; You can talk to him about this practice and charge him to practice it. Then when you come back to visit again, you can check to see if he is practicing this or not.<h2 class=head2>Attending the Meetings</h2><p>You should also have the time to say, &#8220;Another crucial practice of the Christian life is to attend the meetings. Hebrews 10:25 says that we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together. We Christians are like the bees; none of us can live the Christian life by himself. We must meet together. There are the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the larger meetings of the church.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>BUILDING UP THESE CRUCIAL PRACTICES</h2><p>We should not merely explain or present these four practices to the new ones. We need at least one month to help them build up these practices. Every time we go back to visit them, we must check with them concerning these four practices. They may tell us that they have failed. One may say that he kept morning watch for three mornings but on the fourth morning he could not rise up. We need to check with him, &#8220;When did you get up? When did you go to bed?&#8221; No one likes to go to bed early. Even if you decide to go to bed at 10:30, you may not get to bed until 11:30. If we are going to learn to keep our morning watch, we must ask the Lord to grant us His grace and mercy so that we can go to bed earlier. If we do not go to bed earlier, it will be hard for us to get up earlier. We have to try to help the new ones build up their time of morning watch as a habit.<p>If the new ones are to live a healthy Christian life, they must practice these four things. They must read the Bible, and to some extent they must learn to study the Bible. Prayer is healthy to their spiritual life, so we must do a lot to help them to pray. We must help them build up a habit of prayer and tell them that to pray is not merely to ask God to do things for us but to breathe God into us. We must also help them to keep morning watch and attend the church meetings. We must work to build up these practices over quite a period of time.<p>While we are helping to build up these four practices in the new ones, we will also need to touch other matters. We must go to the home meetings in a very flexible way. In one visit we can cover two or three things, but with some subjects we must help them over a period of time. With the matter of consecration, we do not need a long time, but with these four practices, we need a longer time. Even one month may not be adequate for building up a new one in these practices. While we are working on him concerning these four practices, we can cover other things.<p>Now is the time to practice the home meetings by taking care of those whom you have baptized. You delivered these babes, so the responsibility is upon your shoulders to go back to them to feed, nourish, and cherish them. Do not do things without any kind of direction. You should work for quite a period of time to develop in them these healthy practices that are crucial to the Christian life.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p>Question: A problem we have been having is that when we go to a home meeting, our new one will ask so many questions about so many things that we have trouble covering any point in a solid way. How can we avoid this?<p>Answer: If a person raises a number of questions, you should try to answer only one and try to make him understand that it is hard to answer so many questions in one visit. You can tell him that this time you will cover only one question and that you will come back after a few days. If time allows you may cover a second question. You should not try to answer every question. Some questions may be concerning secular subjects like science. In this case we must be honest and humble and say that we did not study that field and cannot answer that question. Even if you know something concerning science, it is better to avoid that kind of question because that will not render much help to the spiritual life. You should save your time and try to concentrate on rendering definite spiritual help.<p>Question: We have been burdened that the new ones would enter into the preaching of the gospel. Should we promote this, or should we focus on the four practices that have been shared in this message?<p>Answer: When we go to the home meeting, we must have a purpose. Our purpose is simply to nourish the new ones that they would grow. Therefore, we must have some points within us that we want to impart to them. For instance, every new believer should have the assurance of salvation. That is very good for them. Also, every new one should know that the Lord Jesus is not only the Savior who died on the cross for our sins to redeem us, but also that after redeeming us, He became a life-giving Spirit. Today the Savior, Jesus Christ, is the life-giving Spirit, and as the Spirit, He can enter into our spirit. We have to nourish the new ones with this. Then we have to help them to learn these four basic practices so that they can start to live the Christian life. Without reading the Bible, without praying, without having morning watch, and without attending the meetings, no one can begin the Christian life. However, we cannot decide that in this home meeting we will talk to them about any particular thing. That is too legal. We must have a purpose that we want to carry out. Eventually we can establish these practices as a base, and we can go on.<p>Gradually, after about half a year, they will reach a stage where they need the help of our teaching. They have been saved, yet they do not know what salvation is. They have been regenerated, yet they do not know what regeneration is. They have been justified, yet they do not know what justification is. Their sins have been forgiven, but they do not know what it means for their sins to be forgiven by God. Therefore, in this stage we have to give them some teaching. For our own help, we should refer to the Life Lessons and Truth Lessons. But we should not teach the new ones in a legal way as if we were using a textbook. We must simply go with a purpose and act according to the need by living in the spirit.<p>Question: We are not sure whether some whom we have contacted can be gained for the church life. How should we go on with these?<p>Answer: We made a big mistake in the past. Our contact with people was aimless. We contacted this one once or twice; then we forgot about him. We labored on another one, but after three weeks we went to contact a different one. Then we went to another one. We thought that by this way we could gain more people, but eventually we had no result. Through over four years of study, I learned that our visiting, our contacting, people must be with a very definite goal. We cannot be like a mother who delivers three children and then leaves them to deliver more. This is foolish.<p>You must carry out the Lord&#8217;s work in a definite way. Go to a new city, and visit homes to get some baptized. As long as you have two or three newly baptized ones, stop visiting new homes, and take care of these two or three by feeding them. Eventually you may lose two of these, leaving you with only one new one. This is not enough, so you must try again to gain more new ones by door-knocking. As long as you are laboring on two or three, that is good enough. You must visit them again and again.<p>While you are working, you must exercise the Lord&#8217;s discernment concerning these ones. Then after about three or four weeks, you will realize which of these three are worthwhile for you to labor on further. You may find out that only one of the three is really worth the time you are giving to work on them. Then you should try to get some more new ones to labor on. This does not mean that you would give up the other two completely; you would simply not spend so much of your time on them. By doing this, you can work on certain persons in a definite way and within a year you can gain one or two solid ones as remaining fruit. You may think that this is too few, but actually, this is not too few. If you are a full-timer, you can bring in from five to ten every year by this way.<p>Question: How should we take care of the Christians whom we contact?<p>Answer: Many times you will go to visit people and find out that they are Christians. You have to discern what kind of Christians they are. If they are settled with their denominations and they are saved, it is better not to waste your time. If you realize that they are real Christians, but they are not settled in any denomination, it is worthwhile for you to work on them. In the United States, people move very often. Out of so many Christians in the United States, many are moving to new places every year, and they are looking for a new church. I heard that some brothers called people&#8217;s homes by getting numbers out of the telephone book. One who answered said, &#8220;Who told you that we were waiting for someone to call us? We have recently been considering that we would join a church, but we did not have a way. It is so good that you called.&#8221; You should work on this kind of person. There are many Christians in this country, but if you focus your labor on the Christians, you will gain very little. That would not be so profitable.<p>Question: There is a family that was baptized through some whom we had baptized in the summer of 1987. We had home meetings with this family for a long time and were training them in the four crucial practices that were shared in this message. The home meetings seemed very good, but eventually the husband said that he did not want us to come back anymore. He said that his heart was too hard and that he could not live up to what was in the Bible. We shared many things with him, and he is still open to fellowship with us, but we do not know how to go on. I feel that this is a good family. What can we do to help this one?<p>Answer: You probably have taught this man too much in the way of legality. You have pointed out to him what the Bible says and implied that he has to do it. This is legality. Some people will not listen to this kind of legal teaching. What you should do is simply open the Bible to certain verses and help them to read it. They may feel that what they read is hard to keep. Then right away you can say, &#8220;The Lord is gracious. The Lord loves us. If we want to do it, He will help us. If we are not willing to do it, He will still be patient with us.&#8221; This is the way to present something from the Bible in a loving way that would not burden them too much. If you teach in a legal way, every requirement in the Bible is a demand that no one can meet. We have to lead them by telling them, &#8220;This is what the Lord wants, yet the Lord knows that we cannot do it, so He will be our help.&#8221;<p>This man you have met is honest. After listening to your kind of teaching, he says, &#8220;I cannot come up to that.&#8221; Do not be legal in teaching anything. It is better to take the way of grace, the way of love. This will work.<p>Question: We have shared these basic practices of the Christian life with many new ones, yet most of them do not pick them up very quickly. Some of them do not seem to have any desire to practice them. What can we do to help these ones?<p>Answer: First, when we go to labor on people, we always expect to see the result. However, the result will never come quickly. Therefore, we must continue to work, and eventually we will get some results. However, here is a principle: today&#8217;s good result may not remain forever, and today&#8217;s poor result may become the best. No matter how good one may seem to be, we cannot be certain that he will still be here in twenty years. After twenty years, he may become the worst result. Another result may seem too poor. He may not react. He may not accept anything, yet he likes to listen. He always invites us to come to his home, yet there is no progress, no result. However, after five years he may become the top result. I can tell you that many who were good results in my eyes are gone. Also many whom I considered to be bad results years ago, became very good. It is hard to say who is a good result and who is not. We must simply go to work; the result is in the hands of the Lord. We should never be disappointed; to work is much better than doing nothing. If we consider that the result is too poor and just stay home, nothing will ever come out.<p>Second, if you try to help one to read the Bible, to pray, to keep morning watch, and to attend the meetings, and there is no result, you should not continue to push these matters in the same way. That would not be wise. As long as this one would receive you, you should keep working on him. You should realize that he will not take these four practices at this time, so you must approach him from another angle. If you cannot do anything by one way, you have to change your way. You may not stress the reading of the Bible, yet you can take the lead to read the Bible when you are with him to set up a pattern so that he can see something. You should never be legal, insisting that anyone follow certain practices. When we go to visit people in one way and cannot get through, we should try another way. We all have to learn to be flexible.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class=title>VISITING PEOPLE WITH THE GOSPEL AND NOURISHING THE NEW BELIEVERS IN THEIR HOMES</h1><p>In this message we will consider the second step of the organic building up of the Body of Christ which is to nourish and cherish the new believers in their home meetings.<h2 class=head1>PREACHING THE GOSPEL CONCERNING JESUS BEING THE SON OF GOD</h2><p>In preaching the gospel, a brother recently met a Moslem who did not believe that Jesus is the Son of God. Because two of the greatest items in the New Testament are Christ Himself being the Son of God and His believers being the sons of God, more than one visit to such a person would be necessary. On your first visit, you could present the matter of Christ being the Son of God. Then on your second visit, you could speak concerning Christians being the sons of God. You could also tell him that few Christians really know about the Person of Christ in detail.<p>Christ being the Son of God has at least two aspects. First, He is the only begotten Son of God (John 3:16). Second, He is the firstborn Son of God with many brothers (Rom. 8:29; John 20:17; Heb. 1:6; 2:12) who are the many believers of Christ. When you make such a presentation, you not only show that the Bible is trustworthy but also show that you are capable in preaching the gospel. Your friend may realize deep within that you are very knowledgeable about spiritual things. This builds up some credit within him. Once you gain such credit, it will be very easy for him to receive your word.<h2 class=head2>The Bible Being the Source of Three Religions</h2><p>In order to adequately prove that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, you must present what the Bible says concerning Him. Today people recognize that there are only two kinds of Bibles, the Jewish Old Testament and the Christian New Testament. When these two books are put together, they constitute the Bible, the book of books. Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism, however, do not have a bible. The Moslem religion does have a &#8220;bible&#8221; which is a partial imitation of the Bible. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam basically came from the same source. Therefore, the unique source of these three religions is the Bible. The reason such a situation exists is because there is one unique God. In Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism, there is no God. Only Judaism, Christianity, and Islam believe in the one unique God, and all three have their sacred writings. The Jews hold only the Old Testament, the Christians hold the Old and New Testaments, and the Moslems hold a partial imitation of the Bible.<p>The Bible makes known all the spiritual, divine, and mysterious things, such as the origin of the universe and the origin of man. Darwin speculated about these things, but only the Bible tells us in a trustworthy and clear manner the source of the universe and of man. As to the origin of the universe, the first sentence of the Bible states clearly, &#8220;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth&#8221; (Gen. 1:1). With such a word, there is no speculation.<p>Concerning the origin of man, the Bible clearly says that God created man in His own image according to His likeness (Gen. 1:26). None of the great philosophers could clearly tell us the origin of man, but the Bible gives some practical details concerning man&#8217;s creation. Genesis 2:7 says that God formed man&#8217;s body from the dust of the ground. Today, scientists have discovered that all the elements of the earth are in man&#8217;s body. Many of the minerals found in the earth are a supply to the human body. Only the Bible has given us such details concerning the creation of man.<h2 class=head2>Jesus Being the Only Begotten Son and the Firstborn Son</h2><p>Laying a foundation concerning the content of the Bible prepares the way for you to read a number of the top verses to your gospel contacts about Christ being the Son of God, such as John 1:1 and Romans 9:5. From eternity Jesus Christ was the only begotten Son of God (John 1:18; 3:16). In resurrection He was begotten (Acts 13:33) to be the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29; Heb. 1:6), and His believers as the many sons of God are His many brothers (Rom. 8:29; John 20:17; Heb. 2:12).<p>As people who are entering into the gospel labor, you must study not only the Bible with its truths but also a small portion of the content of other religions. Then when you meet people who are in some of these religions, you will know how to talk to them.<h2 class=head1>POINTING PEOPLE TO GOD AS THEIR REAL NEED</h2><p>In visiting people with the gospel, some saints met a Buddhist who had had a lot of problems in his past, such as a lack of food, clothing, shelter, and employment. He told the saints that since he had become a Buddhist, all of his material needs had been met through worshipping idols. Thus, he felt that he did not need God&#8217;s salvation. In presenting the gospel to him, some would say that you need to point out that God&#8217;s salvation is not only to save people from outward problems, but also to save man from his inward and daily problems of temper, lust, anxiety, and fear, and that regardless of how many things a person possesses, he still feels empty, not knowing what the meaning of human life is. This kind of presentation is good, but it is not complete. It may be better to present the mystery of human life by saying, &#8220;God is your real need. Your real problem is that you do not have God. You have problems because you do not have God. The only One who can solve all of your problems is God. God is a mystery, and human life is also a mystery. I would like to read a booklet with you which tells us about the mystery of human life.&#8221;<p>A person who has been confused in his understanding by other religions may ask vague questions. For this reason, it is best to try to bring him to a certain practical point. The kind of answers you give to his questions depends upon the atmosphere and situation of your conversation as well as your discernment of that person. As you listen to him speak, you should use one point of his talk to present something of the gospel to him.<p>A few saints preached the gospel to a very philosophical person who said that everyone has God in them. According to her view, whether someone receives the Lord or not, everyone has God in them; therefore, each person must explore within himself to find his peace and satisfaction. She also said that the things of hatred, anger, and jealousy were just baggage that needed to be dropped off in order to reveal something beautiful inside of each person. She may have known some of the deeper points of Buddhism. The saints shared the gospel with her and found that she had had several unpleasant experiences in Christianity and in her own family life. She, therefore, discredited what the saints shared from the Bible based upon these experiences.<p>This is also a case of a person who &#8220;soars in the air&#8221; with philosophical thought. We must develop the ability to restrict people to a particular point. By restricting people to a particular point, you can present something of the Word which is very practical for their daily life. Since this person knows something of Christianity and may know some of the deeper points of Buddhism, you must talk to her according to her level of knowledge and also on a level which is very practical. Actually, no other book is as practical as the Bible. In order to impress someone with the practical nature of the Bible, you must study and know the verses which show, for example, that God is the unique God (Deut. 6:4; 32:39; Psa. 86:10). You should also learn a number of verses about God being something to us, such as our breath (Acts 17:25), our life (Eph. 4:18), and our salvation (Psa. 27:1; Isa. 12:2). As you present such verses, you might ask, &#8220;In Buddhism do you have God? You know Buddhism very well, but you do not know God. You also know a great deal about Christianity, but you still do not have God. Your real need is to know God.&#8221; Based upon these verses concerning God being certain items to us, you could render some help to such a person. But learn not to rebuke people or to point out their shortages in a despising manner. Learn to help people realize their need of a practical God in their daily life and their human life.<h2 class=head1>LEADING PEOPLE TO TASTE THE LORD</h2><p>A group of saints visited a young, successful attorney in his home for about three hours. The first hour he showed them his own personal garden, and the next hour, while he commented on the news of a local disaster, he began to open up his being to the saints. He told them that he had experienced the Lord in a definite way in college and that he was filled with joy at that time. He said that his life since that time has not been so good because he goes to places such as nightclubs. On the one hand, he likes to go to such places, but on the other hand, he does not like to go. The saints began to share with him that the basic problem with man is sin. They said, &#8220;When man fell from God, he became full of sin. Man needed salvation. What you experienced in college was Christ coming into you to save you eternally and to become your salvation. But today the Lord as the eternal, divine, and indestructible life wants to save you from every frustration, lust, and problem of human life in a daily, moment-by-moment way. Yet it is not that simple, and you should not try to save yourself. Your need is just to enjoy the Lord in a simple way by reading the Bible a few minutes each day. Maybe we could start by reading the Bible five minutes a day with you.&#8221; To this fellowship, he responded, &#8220;Yes, this is what I need. I need a daily salvation.&#8221; Then he continued to share more of his problems and the other things which bothered him. The brothers listened and answered many of his questions. At the end of the meeting, he asked the brothers if they could meet with him in a regular way each week. The brothers felt very good about this, but they felt that there was still something lacking in their visit.<p>These saints were skillful in handling the situation except for one point. When they talked with him about reading the Bible for five minutes each day and he agreed, they should have grasped the chance to read the Bible at that moment in their visit. They could have said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we take a few minutes to practice reading a portion of the Bible right now?&#8221; They had a long talk after this point in their visit and their fellowship was good, but much more could have been accomplished. In place of the fellowship, it would have been better to find out whether he had a Bible or not. If he did have a Bible, they could have asked him to open it and read together with them. Then, having read a portion, they could have explained it a little in order to impress him with what that portion said. They could have then asked him to pray, not being satisfied with only a short prayer, but encouraging him to pray in longer way by saying, &#8220;Let&#8217;s try to pray something a little deeper and little longer.&#8221; By this kind of exercise, they would have brought him into the experience of Christ. They did everything very well, but they did not bring him to taste the Lord. After practicing to read and pray, they could have spoken to strengthen him and confirm his need to contact the Lord in such a way every day. He may have asked, &#8220;Would you please come back?&#8221; Then they could have responded, &#8220;Yes, and may we call you every morning?&#8221;<p>We should not forget that too much talk, even the right talk, eventually issues in nothing. In this case, the talk was not absolutely in vain because he still wanted to get back with them in a few days. The group of saints who visited him should remember him before the Lord and ask the Lord to remind him of what he has heard from them. The best practice is to bring people into contact with the Lord immediately and in a regular way each day, even if it is necessary for us to call them on the phone. With such a practice, it may be that after a few weeks such a person could be brought into the church life.<h2 class=head1>LEARNING TO BE FLEXIBLE IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE NEW BELIEVERS</h2><p>In one of the home meetings the saints have visited a brother who allowed them to come in for only thirty minutes each visit. He strictly watched his clock while they were fellowshipping and responded only in a very disinterested manner. The saints tried to share with him about the mingled spirit, but it seemed to be futile because of his lack of interest. In their fellowship with other brothers about this home meeting, the saints realized that they needed to establish a more friendly relationship with him because they hardly knew one another. The next week they visited the brother and brought some dessert, purposely leaving their Bibles and hymnals at home. This really surprised the new brother. The saints asked about his employment and shared their dessert with him. Soon the new brother forgot about his consciousness of time and began to speak for close to forty-five minutes of their meeting. Eventually, this kind of care by the saints opened this new brother to more fellowship.<p>This case illustrates that we should not expect to gain people in only a short period of time. Such an expectation is wrong. To baptize someone is easy, and it takes very little time. But to lead someone to experience Christ and to bring him into the church life is not very easy, and it takes time. Therefore, we should not expect to do a quick job. This kind of expectation will be the factor causing us to do many things in a wrong way when we meet with new believers. Few people can be brought into the church by only two or three visits. We must abandon this kind of expectation. You should be prepared to spend at least half a year, perhaps twenty visits, to gain one person. If someone promises to give you thirty minutes each week, he is certainly open. You should bring this person and the home meeting you have with him to the Lord, saying, &#8220;Lord, I do not know how to help such a person.&#8221; The Lord will give you the wisdom. You also have your other team members who can pray with you, and together you can seek the Lord&#8217;s leading concerning the care of the new believers in the home meetings.<p>In this case, it seems that to speak about the mingled spirit is inappropriate for this new brother at this time. When you talk with someone, you should discern what kind of person he is. If you discern that he is a person who likes to have friendship, you should not go back to his home and jump to the high, spiritual subject of the mingled spirit. In future meetings, you should get acquainted with and get to know this new brother better. It would be good to inquire about his business and his welfare. This will make him happy. You should also let him talk. As you have opportunity, let him know something about you. After three or four visits like this, you and the new brother will have gotten to know one another in a more intimate way, and a close friendship could begin to be built up. Then it will be easier for you to talk more freely with him and to gradually introduce something in the field of God&#8217;s salvation. At this point, you could begin to stir up his interest in this other field. Week after week, perhaps after twenty visits, something will be built up within him. If one way does not work very well, try another way the next visit. Eventually, over the long run, something will be worked out with this new believer.<h2 class=head1>CARING FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE BY STIRRING UP THEIR LOVE FOR THE LORD</h2><p>A sister in the full-time training began to visit another sister who is presently in college. While in college, the young sister has had to work full-time as well as attend class-and study, so she does not have time to come to the meetings. Often, the sister went to visit her at home and she was not there. On one occasion, she found her at home and tried to help the young sister by pray-reading Ephesians 1:17 with her. Though her response was very good and she wants the sister to come back, the sister is puzzled as to what to do in her next visit.<p>The work among the young people, especially the children of the members of the church, is very, very crucial. The wisest way to work with the children is to help them to love the Lord. If you would be a person who is qualified to work among the young people, you must be a person loving the Lord freshly every day. The junior high young people, humanly speaking, are lovers. They love many things, such as animals and clothes. The younger you are, the more you love. Junior high young people are at the best age to be led into the proper love of the Lord. Yet this kind of labor is not very easy, and many of the parents do not have a way to help their children. When you are a person who loves the Lord freshly, you can stir up a young person to love the Lord. Once a young person loves something, he will do everything for it. In this case, to help her pray-read Ephesians 1:17 is aiming a little too high. The best thing to do on the next visit is to stir up her love for the Lord.<h2 class=head1>THE PURPOSE OF THE HOME MEETINGS BEING TO NOURISH THE NEW BELIEVERS</h2><p>We have realized that when we meet a person who &#8220;soars in the air&#8221; with their thoughts, we must restrict their thought to a particular point. In the same way, we also must be restricted in our burden and purpose. When a carpenter takes a piece of wood, he has a purpose for its use. We also must have a purpose whenever we visit new believers; otherwise, we will waste our time. We should always keep in mind that if someone is a new believer, our primary purpose in the home meeting is to feed him. Every time we get together with him, we must keep in mind that our purpose is to nourish him.<h2 class=head1>LABORING CONSTANTLY AND LEAVING THE RESULT TO THE LORD</h2><p>We should labor and labor without any expectation of what the result will be. We should just labor, pray, and seek the Lord&#8217;s leading and His guidance with His wisdom. We leave the result to the Lord. All farmers know that as long as they labor, there will be some harvest. No labor is in vain. There will be a harvest, but do not expect to have a quick result. The quicker the result, the quicker the result disappears. If someone comes into the church life in three days, it is doubtful whether he will stay or not. But if it takes six months to gain one person, it is more likely that he will become settled in the church life. This may seem to be slow, and the increase may seem very small, but if only one out of every three members in the church brings one into the church life each year, the church will increase thirty-three percent a year. A full-timer may be able to bring five to ten people into the church life a year. This is not too slow. Our need is to labor. This new way is just to labor in the right way, that is, in the way of spending time every week to visit new believers in their homes.<p>To baptize people is not very difficult, but to get a person established in the experience of Christ, in the daily experience of God&#8217;s full salvation, and in the church life is more difficult. To do this will take at least half a year. Anything quicker than this is not trustworthy. We all have to labor, leaving the result to the Lord. Even if we labor for two years with little result, we should not be disappointed or lose heart. We must believe that whomever we have labored on will eventually remain.<h2 class=head1>PRACTICING THE NEW WAY WITH PATIENCE</h2><p>First, we visit people in their homes to get them saved and baptized. Then once they are baptized, we go back to have home meetings with them. We should not expect to do something fast in these home meetings. We have to be prepared to spend at least half a year to gain one person. Sometimes it may take longer. Therefore, it is better to always have three or four new believers under our care at the same time.<p>To baptize is easy, so you have to realize that you should not baptize too many at once. You should not baptize people foolishly. You should baptize only three or four and keep these under your care for half a year. Then in the next half of the year, you may baptize another three or four. You should exercise some discernment over the new ones in order to discover the one among them who is the proper person on whom you can labor in order to gain him for the Lord&#8217;s interest. You must exercise some selection. Of course, your selection may not be that accurate, but, in general, it helps in your labor. You should baptize wisely, exercise some discernment, and spend most of your time in caring for the newly baptized believers.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINETEEN</h1><h1 class=title>FEEDING THE NEWBORN BABES WITH BABY FOOD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 15:16; 21:15; 1 Pet. 2:2</h1><h2 class=head1>THE HOME MEETINGS AND THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</h2><p>In this message we will continue to fellowship concerning the home meetings. I am burdened that we would all have a proper understanding of what we mean by the term &#8220;the home meetings.&#8221; When we say &#8220;the home meetings,&#8221; we are referring to our meetings with the newly baptized ones in their own homes. When we baptize new believers, we should immediately begin to visit them in their homes to have meetings with them. This is what we call the home meetings.<p>By reading church history and biographies, we can see that a number of outstanding believers were saved in homes. For instance, when George Muller was about twenty, he was brought to the home of a Christian brother to attend a small meeting. Although he was not a religious or ethical person, through that meeting he was deeply touched by the Lord and was saved. Eventually, he became one of the outstanding believers of the past century.<p>There are many examples in history of unbelievers having good salvation experiences in the saints&#8217; homes. However, when we speak of the home meetings in the context of the new way, the God-ordained way, we are not referring to this kind of meeting in the homes of the saints. We are referring specifically to having home meetings with the newly saved and baptized ones in their own homes. Sometimes we confuse the home meetings with the small group meetings. The home meeting is a meeting with the newly baptized ones in their homes. Occasionally, some others may attend a home meeting, yet the intention is not to have a group meeting, but only to meet with that family in their home because they have recently been saved. The small group meetings are different from the home meetings. After we have helped a number of new ones in their homes for several months, we should gather them together to form a group meeting. We may consider the home meeting as a kind of spiritual kindergarten and the small group meeting as the elementary, junior high, and even high school. To understand the home meetings and the small group meetings in this way will be very helpful in the future because we will share more messages concerning these two kinds of meetings.<h2 class=head1>REALIZING THAT THE NEW ONES ARE BABES IN CHRIST</h2><p>The title of this message-feeding the newborn babes with baby food-may seem somewhat childish, but it is based upon much experience. We must realize that it is not easy to carry out the home meetings. After we have baptized some new ones, we must go back to meet with them within one or two days. The first requirement for us to have a proper home meeting with these newly baptized ones is that regardless of how old they are in the physical life, how high a position they may hold, or how high an education they may have received, we have to consider them as babes.<p>If you bring an older man to the Lord and baptize him, you must go back in a few days to meet with him. If he is over seventy years old and well-educated, yet you are only twenty-nine, you may feel uncomfortable in dealing with him. You should respect his age because this is the proper humanity, but you must realize that because he has been saved for only a few days, he is very young in the Lord. Your purpose in meeting with him should be to feed him, not to teach him. You must have the realization that he is a newborn babe and feed him with baby food.<p>You must consider whatever he might say to you as babyish talk. He may be a retired college professor and talk to you about science or computers, but you should not forget that he is a babe in Christ. This does not mean that you should despise him. You still have to respect him, but within, you must realize that he is a babe. You should not be carried away by his talking because, spiritually speaking, he is a babe and knows nearly nothing about the Lord.<p>You must try to treat these newly baptized ones as nursing mothers treat their babes. This is one of the secrets of how to practice the God-ordained way, but it is a hard lesson to learn. You must learn to always have a subjective realization concerning every new believer, considering that they are babes. If you teach kindergarten, you realize that these students are little children, and you treat them accordingly. If you teach graduate school, you realize that these students are all college graduates. To treat them like little children would be wrong. You must have a proper psychological understanding.<p>The primary point, the prerequisite, is that you consider a newly baptized one as a babe in Christ. A new one may ask, &#8220;What is the Bible?&#8221; This may not sound like a babyish question, but you must answer as you would answer a baby; you must have this kind of concept. You must say the right words, and your attitude and tone must also be right. A new one may ask many questions, yet you must always have the concept that you are dealing with a babe in Christ. If you can learn this secret, you will be welcomed by every new one. They would like to hear your talk. In this way you can open the way to feed them. Sometimes after a meeting, I went over to see how the saints were talking to the newcomers. Many times the saints&#8217; expression and tone were wrong in talking with these ones. You must speak something that will help a new one to open to you. He will open by saying something. Right away, you may realize that he has been newly saved. Then you have to talk to him by considering him as a babe. If you have learned this secret, after only two or three sentences, you will be warmly welcomed by him. He will open himself up to you, listen to you, and take your word. He will become very interested in whatever you say.<h2 class=head1>LEARNING TO FEED THE NEWBORN BABES</h2><p>When I was young, I was told that no human power can save a person and that we must fast and pray to receive the power from on high. In my hometown there was a Pentecostal denomination that met not far from our meeting hall. They continually cried out for the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and eventually they claimed that they had all received it. However, for many years we saw very few persons saved through them; yet in our hall the new ones were added nearly every day. Besides this, we studied the fruit of the new ones. The new ones who were saved in that Pentecostal denomination did not have a daily walk that glorified the Father. But among us, a good number, right after being saved, were brought into the environment of the church&#8217;s edifying. Because of this, they could have a proper living. The principle is this-in the New Testament age, God will not do anything by Himself directly, especially concerning the matter of the gospel. God must keep the principle of incarnation. God is ready to save persons, but we may not be ready; we may not have been trained.<p>When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, He had Peter, John, James, and the other disciples with Him for three and a half years. The four Gospels do not tell us in detail what the Lord did with Peter for three and a half years, but I do not believe that Peter was merely traveling with the Lord. Surely Peter received much training under the Lord&#8217;s care. In John 15:16 Peter was charged, and we all are charged by the Lord, to bear fruit: &#8220;You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain.&#8221; The Lord appointed us for three things: that we should go forth, that we should bear fruit, and that our fruit should remain. In the past we may have gone forth and borne fruit, but of the fruit that we bore, not much remained.<p>We all must go forth, bear fruit, and our fruit should remain. How do we preserve our fruit so that it will remain? The answer is in John 21:15: &#8220;Feed My lambs.&#8221; If we love the Lord, we are charged to feed His lambs. Every proper mother knows how to feed her newborn babe. Peter was charged by the Lord in John 21 to feed the lambs. Then later, in chapter two of his first Epistle, he wrote to all the new ones: &#8220;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word&#8221; (v. 2). Newborn babes cannot feed themselves; they need a nursing mother to feed them. We must be the feeding ones. We can bear fruit and have our fruit remain by learning to feed.<p>In the past we may have baptized many, but few of them remained. This is because, although we had the bearing of fruit, we did not have the feeding. It is easy to get someone saved, but to keep him, to bring him into the Body of Christ so that he can participate in God&#8217;s economy for the Lord&#8217;s recovery, is difficult because we do not know how to practice the feeding. If we are going to bear children, we must be prepared to feed them for many years. Even three years of feeding may not be adequate to assure that a new one will remain. Do not expect that the Lord will give you a particular burden to care for certain ones. That is being too spiritual. The Lord may never give you this kind of burden. Then what will you do? When a mother delivers a child, she does not receive a particular burden from the Lord to feed her child, yet she is forced to feed it for many years. Unfortunately, few among us would be willing to labor in this way, to pay this kind of price. Out of so many baptisms, nearly no one is left because few have been feeding the lambs.<p>It is much easier to knock on doors to bring people to the Lord and baptize them than to feed them in the home meetings. In our experience, we may know how to visit people for the preaching of the gospel, but when we go to hold a home meeting with the newly baptized ones, we may not know what to do. It is hard to carry out a successful home meeting. It is also hard for me to teach this kind of practice. We have to spend much time to learn how to have the home meetings.<p>You all have to learn the secret to be the proper feeders. When you go out to hold home meetings, you must treat the new ones as babes. Then you have to learn how to talk to these babes. If a new one asks a question concerning science, you must talk to him as you would talk to a babe. If you talk in a natural way, saying, &#8220;Sir, I am sorry. I do not know anything about science,&#8221; you are talking as to a man and not as to a babe. You have to realize that even if he is a professor, spiritually speaking, he is a babe. Therefore, you should not treat him as a professor, but as a babe in Christ. This is not easy to learn. In your attitude, in your tone, and in every way, you must be as one who is talking to a babe.<p>Sometimes a new one would not open himself to you; he would not say anything. He would welcome you into his home and would sit with you until you speak something, but he would not say anything. What should you do? Again, you must try to talk to him as to a babe. You may ask, &#8220;Shall we sing a song?&#8221; Surely he would be very agreeable to this. You may ask, &#8220;Do you have a song?&#8221; He might have one. This is a start, and this is to talk as to a little babe. Never forget that the new one is a spiritual babe. According to Peter, the newborn babes need milk, yet they do not know how to drink. The way to help a babe who does not know how to drink, is to feed him. When you go to hold a home meeting with the little babes, you must have the proper attitude. You must have the attitude that you are coming to &#8220;play&#8221; with these little babes. You must learn this. You may even sing a simple children&#8217;s song with them. You must learn that regardless of the new ones&#8217; age, position, or social status, they are babes.<h2 class=head1>NOT STUMBLING THE NEWBORN BABES</h2><h2 class=head2>Concerning Idols</h2><p>There are some very difficult situations that you will eventually encounter in preaching the gospel and caring for the newly saved ones. The first of these is the matter of idols. A certain man may have been saved through your preaching three days ago. When you go back to his home to hold a home meeting with him, he may immediately ask you, &#8220;What are idols?&#8221; You have to learn how to &#8220;play&#8221; with him, that is, to answer him as you would talk to a babe. You must learn to have this kind of attitude and tone. You may say, &#8220;What do you mean, idols? Are you talking about some images?&#8221; This is the way to &#8220;play&#8221; with this babe. Then he may answer you by pointing out certain things which he considers might be idols and may say, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this thing an idol?&#8221; Then you can pick up his feeling and answer, &#8220;Yes, this is an idol. What else?&#8221;<p>Do not think that the matter of idols is an easy item to handle. This is a very difficult matter. A number of the newly saved ones have been stumbled by this matter. When you feed them in many other matters they would accept it, but when you come to the matter of idols, they might not accept your word. This is especially true with the Chinese concerning the worship of their ancestors. Many would not forsake this practice, so it is hard to know how to answer them. Of course, we cannot say that it is all right, yet if we condemn this in the wrong manner, we will lose them. Therefore, you must remember that this one is only a babe. He knows many things, yet he knows nothing concerning the Lord. You must learn to &#8220;play&#8221; with him in your conversation. While you are talking to him as to a babe, you have to look to the Lord for the wisdom to handle the situation without stumbling him. Eventually, you will be able to convince him, but not like a professor convincing a student. That kind of attitude can never work out anything. You must hold the attitude that you are talking to a babe.<h2 class=head2>Concerning the Clearance of the Past</h2><p>Another difficult item is the matter of making restitution for past transgressions. We all did things that were wrong in the past. We all wronged others. Sometimes we wronged others financially in material things. After a new one has been saved, they will sooner or later encounter this problem. We must be very careful not to bring up this problem too soon. In the New Testament, there is no teaching that charges us to tell the newly saved ones to clear their past. To do this is wrong. The Lord&#8217;s dynamic salvation will work out this result. Zaccheus was saved, and immediately he told the Lord, &#8220;Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusations, I restore four times as much&#8221; (Luke 19:8). This was a dynamic reaction to the Lord&#8217;s dynamic salvation. It was not the result of any teaching.<p>In Acts 19 many of the Ephesians took their idolatrous books and burned them. They were not taught to do this; it was a spontaneous reaction to the Lord&#8217;s salvation. Therefore, when we come to such a problem, we must remember that the new ones are babes. They have come to know something, yet they do not understand it thoroughly. They might be serious about the idols, yet it is better for you to talk to them in a way that is not so serious. Then they will receive your word. You all have to learn this, not only with idols and with the clearance of the past, but with many items. Because you have helped them to read the Bible, sooner or later, they will bring up these kinds of questions from the Bible. Nearly every time you go back to visit them, they will bring up some questions. In handling these questions, you must always try to talk to them with the attitude and tone that you are talking to a babe. If you learn to do this properly, people will welcome you.<h2 class=head2>Concerning Marriage</h2><p>Another difficult question is regarding the matter of marriage. Today on this earth there are a lot of illegal marriages. Young men and young women live together as husband and wife, yet they were never married. Are they husband and wife or not? You may have a new one, a young lady, who was saved in a marvelous way, yet she lives with a young man without being married. They may even have a child. Eventually, this question concerning marriage will be brought up. Are the two of them husband and wife? What would you say? If you say &#8220;no,&#8221; you will stumble them, but you cannot tell them that this is not a problem, because this is a big problem.<p>In China there is the problem of concubines. One day I visited a home. The husband got saved and baptized. His salvation was miraculous. I did not know his situation, but I felt he was very good. Then one day I went to meet with him in his home, and there were four ladies there. Eventually, by talking to them, I learned that these ladies were his four wives. All of these four wives had been helped by this man to be saved. I can testify from my heart that all five, the man and the four wives, loved the Lord Jesus, and they seemed to love one another. I was afraid that I would not be able to get out of that home without the matter of marriage being brought up. How should one handle such a case? I tried my best to avoid the four wives. I only said, &#8220;It is wonderful to see that you all love the Lord.&#8221; They all were very happy. Then I talked to them and encouraged them to love the Lord more, and to follow the Spirit. They all said, &#8220;Amen.&#8221; After quite a long time, I said, &#8220;I have to go back home now.&#8221; They all agreed with me and sent me off; I got out of that snare. Then I went back to talk to the leading ones about this matter. What should we have done concerning this man and the four wives? This is a hard question, and even today I cannot tell you the best answer.<p>One secret you have to learn and always remember is that you are dealing with babes. I was there with one husband and four wives; all five were babes. On the one hand, I was &#8220;playing&#8221; with them, but on the other hand, I was really helping them. My visit did not stumble or damage them. If I had been careless and had been like a preacher, a pastor, or a Bible teacher, I surely would have damaged them. Just by my one visit, all five would have been stumbled. Therefore, learn to hold home meetings always with the realization that you are dealing with babes. This will safeguard you, and this will open the way for you to render the proper help to them. Do not forget that the new ones were deeply fallen sinners, so it is not so easy for us to rescue them out of their fallen situation and condition in a quick way. Some are not so complicated, but many cases are really complicated.<p>In the United States today, it is easy to meet a couple that has not been properly married. They may live together and even have children. Recently we encountered such a problem. When you go to a home meeting, you may find out strange things. This is why you need to have the home meetings. If you do not hold home meetings you cannot know the real living situation of these newly saved ones.<p>Learn to talk to people, treating them as babes all the time. If you keep this one principle and learn this one secret, you will be safeguarded from offending and stumbling people. Otherwise, many times you will unconsciously stumble the new ones. After your visit, they would say, &#8220;Forget about it. I want nothing to do with Christianity. I cannot take this religion.&#8221; They may not say this to your face, but after you leave, they will say it. Learn to talk to new ones as to babes.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWENTY</h1><h1 class=title>LEARNING TO CARE FOR THE HOME MEETINGS IN A FLEXIBLE WAY</h1><h2 class=head1>FEEDING THE NEW BELIEVERS IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2><p>Recently, before a home meeting, the saints prepared to share with a new believer concerning reading the Bible. As they were reading the lesson on reading the Bible in Life Lessons together with the new believer, they came to the portion in 2 Peter 1:21, which says, &#8220;For no prophecy was ever borne by the will of man, but men spoke from God, being borne by the Holy Spirit.&#8221; At this juncture, the new believer asked, &#8220;What is the Holy Spirit?&#8221; The saints shared a little with her about God being triune, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Then after they sang a hymn concerning the Triune God being a mystery, her question seemed to have been satisfied, so they continued to read the lesson. A little later, she raised another question, &#8220;Why is it that God will not save people, even good people, unless they come to Him?&#8221; On returning home the saints did not feel that they had adequately responded to her questions and wondered how they could have answered her questions in a better way.<p>These saints realized that the purpose of the home meeting was to feed the new believer, but they should have grasped the opportunity to help this new believer to know the Holy Spirit. Since this was a question raised by the new believer, the saints should have left the topic of reading the Bible for another time and focused wholly upon her question. It also would have been better not to have asked the new believer to sing at this point, because other points introduced by the hymn may have become a distraction in answering her question. The saints might have begun by saying, &#8220;Sister, this is our burden in coming to meet with you. We would like to help you to know that the God whom we worship and the Savior in whom we believe is a Spirit, and this Spirit is the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Then they could have spent as much time as possible to stress the matter of the Holy Spirit.<p>Immediately after someone is baptized, we should help the new believer to know the two spirits-the Holy Spirit mingled with our human spirit. In this case, the new believer asked a question concerning the Spirit; therefore, the saints did not have to introduce this matter. It would have been good for the saints to use the entire home meeting to bring the new believer into the realization that God is Spirit (John 4:24) and that Christ is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). However, saying that the Triune God is a mystery was going too far, distracting from the main matter of the Holy Spirit.<p>We must learn to go to the home meetings with a definite purpose. But at the same time, we must be quick to grasp the opportunity when a proper question or subject is manifested in the meeting. If the saints would have done an adequate job of answering the new one&#8217;s first question concerning the Holy Spirit, she would have been happy and perhaps would have forgotten about the second question. The second question, concerning why God will not save men unless they come to Him, may have been a question to distract from the main goal of the meeting. The strategy of the enemy is to spoil the work in the home meetings by distracting us from the goal. We must always bring the meeting back to the goal of our purpose.<h2 class=head1>GRASPING EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO FEED THE NEW BELIEVERS</h2><p>A brother spoke to a new believer over the telephone because the new believer had missed a meeting, and he did not want to allow too much time to pass between the time of the new one&#8217;s salvation and the next appointment or meeting. In their conversation, the new believer asked why there was a difference between the two accounts of creation in chapters one and two of Genesis. Since it was a telephone conversation and the subject required some time to adequately address, the brother asked the new believer to study the chapters some more with a view of meeting together to discuss these matters further in the next home meeting. The brother wondered how to answer the new believer&#8217;s question.<p>While it is very reasonable to discuss such a topic at a later time, we must grasp every minute to inject, to minister, something of life and truth into the new believers in taking care of them. To have taken two or three minutes to say something about Genesis 1 and 2 would have helped to improve the telephone conversation.<p>To answer his question concerning the difference between Genesis 1 and 2, you should first point out that Genesis 1 is the outline of creation and Genesis 2 is the details of that outline. Genesis 1:26 says that God created man in His own image according to His likeness. Then chapter two gives the details of God&#8217;s creation of man. God used two materials in creating man, the dust and God&#8217;s breath (v. 7). God used the dust of the ground to form man&#8217;s body, and He used His breath of life to create the human spirit within man. Thus, today we have a body and a spirit. With this short word, you would help the new brother to know something concerning these two chapters. Then you could suggest to him that the two of you come together some time soon to talk about this matter further.<p>When we share any subject with the new believers, we must keep in mind that they are newborn babes (1 Pet. 2:2a; 1 Cor. 3:1b); therefore, we should feed them with baby food. In order to make our work effective, we must learn how to feed others and what portions to give them. To feed a babe with the writings of Paul may be too deep in the beginning. Our contact with new believers as babes involves two different aspects. The first aspect deals with their human education or learning. If one is a professor, we should not talk to him in a babyish way, otherwise, he may think that we despise him. We should treat him as a learned person, a scholar. The second aspect deals with their spiritual condition and age. According to human learning, they may know science, philosophy, or psychology, but according to spiritual understanding, they are babes, not knowing the spiritual things. Therefore, we have to help them as ones who know nothing spiritually. For example, we may point out to them Genesis 1:26 and 2:7 and stress the matters of man being made in God&#8217;s image according to His likeness and being formed from the dust with God breathing into him the spirit of life. We should stress these two things again and again, treating them as babes, feeding them with these deeper things in the form of baby food. Baby food is very rich in nutrition, but its quantity and form make it easy for babes to digest.<h2 class=head1>SPENDING OUR TIME IN A WISE MANNER IN CARING FOR THE NEW BELIEVERS</h2><p>Sometimes the new believers may ask you to engage in their sports activities. In principle, you should first determine whether or not you have the time. Then you should decide whether or not your intention is to be with that new believer or to participate in the sports activity. If you simply want to engage in the sports activity, you have fallen into another realm. Your burden should be to seize the opportunity to spend time with the new believer in order to talk with him, perhaps to and from the sporting activity. If you do not have the time to do this, but want to spend some time with the new believer, you may suggest another time to get together with him. He may want to spend time with you, but you should not spend yourself or your time in a vain manner. Whenever you spend time with the new believers, you should take the opportunity to render some help to them spiritually.<h2 class=head1>PREPARING FOR THE HOME MEETINGS</h2><p>Before visiting the new ones in the home meetings, some time should be given for preparation. In that time of preparation, there should be some fellowship among the members of the visiting team concerning the goal of the home meeting. You should not go to the home meetings without a definite purpose. Of course, you should not make your purpose a legality, without any flexibility. However, regardless of how flexible you are, you must have a purpose with a goal.<h2 class=head1>CARING FOR THE HOME MEETING ACCORDING TO ITS ATMOSPHERE</h2><p>The way we care for a home meeting-the hymns we sing and the verses we read-should be according to the particular atmosphere of that home meeting. To begin a home meeting by singing a hymn without raising up a proper atmosphere is to practice a religious way. To just sing a hymn is something of religion. To our general understanding, to open a meeting with a song is not wrong. But according to our recent learning and practice over the last few years, this kind of practice is wrong. This religious practice may only confirm the new one&#8217;s past understanding of Christianity.<h2 class=head1>CARING FOR THE HOME MEETINGS IN A LIVING, INSPIRING, AND UNVEILING WAY</h2><p>The way we open a meeting must be living and spontaneous, free from any kind of religion. Whether we pray, call a hymn, open the Scriptures, or ask the new one to speak something, we must do it in a living way, having prepared the atmosphere. It may be that before a certain hymn is sung, one of the brothers or sisters may first read something from the Word. The other attendants may feel to reread this portion of the Word. Then someone may expound this portion of the Word with one or two sentences. Following this, there may be some pray-reading of this portion. To finish this kind of reading may take ten minutes. Such reading will impress the new one with something living and prepare him for getting into the hymn. In this way, his participation is something more than merely singing a hymn.<p>Whatever we do in all kinds of meetings must be living, stirring, and something the Spirit can use to inspire and unveil something to people concerning the mystery of God. We should do nothing merely as a religious activity. To help people to be revived or to love the Bible can also be a religious activity which is common in Christianity. This kind of work is very general. But to read and sing a hymn such as #537 in Hymns concerning Christ being so subjective would impress a new believer in a particular way. To stress that Christ is subjective is something really new to Christians in Christianity. Christ is not only a historical person who is merely objective; rather, the Christ who is our Savior is so subjective. To help a new one with such a particular subject is to care for the home meetings in a living, stirring, and unveiling way, free from any religion.<p>The new way is something living and altogether outside of religion. The new way is unveiling, revealing, and inspiring. The new way is not a work in the style or form of any type of religion. It is something altogether in the reality of life. When you minister Christ, stressing His being subjective, not only will the new one receive some help, but also those who are taking care of the home meeting with you will receive some help.<h2 class=head1>LEARNING TO USE THE WORDS OF THE NEW BELIEVERS IN A POSITIVE WAY</h2><p>In a recent campus meeting, though a new brother had received some help from the practice of calling on the name of the Lord, he asked how calling on the name of the Lord is different from the feeling one receives when repeating a motto such as, &#8220;Don&#8217;t quit&#8221; or &#8220;Never give up.&#8221;<p>Perhaps the best way to help this new brother is simply to encourage him never to quit calling on the name of the Lord, to encourage him to contact the Lord all day long. The best way to help the new believers is just to take their words and speak something definite and particular to them according to their need. In this case, you may say, &#8220;Brother, don&#8217;t quit contacting the Lord. Don&#8217;t quit remaining in the spirit. Don&#8217;t quit calling on the Lord. Don&#8217;t refrain from all of these positive things.&#8221; When we use their words and leave them with something positive, this can inspire them, impress them, and keep them in the atmosphere, the spirit, of the fellowship in that meeting.<h2 class=head1>DEALING WITH PROBLEMS IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2><p>Some saints were meeting with a new believer who had recently quit his job. In caring for this new one, one of the brothers offered to help him write a resume in order to find a new job. The brother also felt that the new one needed some help concerning the matter of authority, but was unsure how to share this matter and remain in the realm of feeding a babe in Christ.<p>In this case, it would be better not to touch the problem of his employment. To help him do something about his employment would simply immerse him further in that problem. The brother caring for this new believer should stress the matter of contacting the Lord and turning to the spirit. Our work among people is in the spiritual realm. This brother should try to bring the new believer into the spiritual realm, into the experience of the Lord&#8217;s presence, and into His rich anointing.<h2 class=head1>LEARNING TO CARE FOR THE HOME MEETINGS ACCORDING TO A DEFINITE GOAL</h2><p>A group of saints have been visiting a new couple for several weeks. The couple is very open to these saints, but they still remain unbaptized. They have asked very basic questions about such items as the human spirit, so the saints have just answered their questions. Upon their last visit, the couple asked the saints what the Lord required them to do as Christians. Knowing that they were still unbaptized, the saints brought them to John 3:5 concerning baptism. The couple responded that they were not ready and that they needed to learn more about the Bible first. At that time, the saints felt not to press them any further concerning baptism. But now they wonder what the next step should be in helping this family to go on with the Lord.<p>These saints have been a little too general in their care of these new believers, not having taken any definite steps to help them. When the couple asked what the Lord requires His believers to do, this was the golden time to baptize them. At this point, the saints could have presented Mark 16:16 which says, &#8220;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&#8221; Then they could have pointed out to them that this is a word out of the Lord&#8217;s mouth. They could have said, &#8220;This word in Mark 16:16 urges us to believe and be baptized. You have surely believed already and, therefore, you are saved. But you are still not baptized. Today you raised the question, &#8216;What does the Lord require Christians to do?&#8217; After reading this verse, you should tell us what you should do.&#8221; At this juncture, they might say, &#8220;We have to be baptized.&#8221; In this way, the saints would have helped this couple to be baptized. We should not force people to do things, but to a certain extent, we should compel people to take the word of the Lord.<p>When we go to work in the home meetings, we should always have a definite purpose. The main purpose of the home meetings is to nourish the new believers, but each mother who nourishes her new baby does so with a definite goal. The kind of nourishment a mother uses depends upon the situation of the baby. To nourish the new believers without any purpose is to run the risk of damaging their spiritual health in the long run.<h2 class=head1>USING LIFE LESSONS IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2><p>In six months of taking care of the home meetings in a weekly way, you should mainly try to help the new believers according to the lessons in Life Lessons. Of course, you cannot finish all forty-eight lessons in only twenty or so weeks. But as those caring for the home meetings, we should become acquainted with all forty-eight lessons. The book Life Lessons was written according to the sequence of Christian experience, not according to doctrine. Yet these lessons should not be taught as a textbook. You should put these forty-eight lessons within your heart, becoming very familiar with their content. Then as you prepare to go to the home meetings, you will have a deep sensation concerning which point you need to work into the new ones by feeding them. Your purpose and goal may be to help the new brothers to know and experience their regenerated spirit. But when you arrive at the home meeting, the atmosphere and the real need may be altogether different. The urgent need may be to share with them something about dealing with idols. To postpone this matter another week would be too late. Therefore, you must put aside the matter of the human spirit and immediately pick up the matter of dealing with idols. By sharing this matter, you cover another one of the forty-eight lessons on that visit.<p>On your next visit, you may still have the human spirit as your goal in feeding the new ones. The atmosphere, however, may still not be for the human spirit. It may be on knowing the Bible. With such an atmosphere, to insist on discharging your burden concerning the human spirit would be something of legality. It would also be wrong. You must fit into the situation, sensing the atmosphere and giving a word concerning the Bible, the divine revelation. By doing this, you spontaneously cover another lesson among the forty-eight. You may not have used a copy of the book Life Lessons, but you covered one of its lessons. By doing this again and again, you will eventually cover each lesson in the book in a living and flexible way according to the situation.<p>To work in the home meetings is to nourish the new believers with the baby food contained in the Life Lessons. Each lesson is like a jar of baby food. You should keep each lesson in the &#8220;pocket&#8221; of your heart. Then whenever there is a need, like a medical doctor after the diagnosis, you are able to meet any patient&#8217;s need. You not only know what medicine to prescribe, but also will have the medicine on hand to give to them. We have to nourish the babes with baby food.<p>We should not conduct the home meetings in an aimless way. We should always conduct the home meetings with the aim of injecting one of the Life Lessons into the new believers. We may not be able to finish all forty-eight lessons with one new believer in six months, but we may be able to complete at least twenty within that period of time. The material contained in one lesson may be too much for one injection, but we must realize that each lesson is like a &#8220;basket of peaches.&#8221; Perhaps only a portion of the basket is needed for the new believer we are caring for. We must feed the new believers according to their need.<h2 class=head1>LEARNING TO CARE FOR PEOPLE BEING A LIFELONG MATTER</h2><p>For many years in the churches, we have suffered loss for two reasons. We did not feed people in home meetings, and we did not know how to feed people. In the past someone may have been baptized, and we may have had the burden to visit him; but after several visits, we lost interest because we did not know what to do, and there was little result. Likewise, the new believer we visited had little interest in continuing to receive our visits. We all must learn to do the work of home meetings to nourish the new believers with baby food.<p>From 1940 to 1943 in the church in Chefoo, I began to learn how to visit the homes and how to take care of new believers. Now I am just opening some doors for you to learn as much as you can. In this training, I am simply opening the doors and giving directions for you to go and learn more. Gradually, day after day, as we take care of two or three new believers year-round, we will bear two or three remaining fruit yearly into the church life. In the course of our lifetime, we may bring one hundred to one hundred fifty into the church life. Be assured that when we enter into the eternal tabernacles (Luke 16:9), these one hundred to one hundred fifty will welcome us. What a wonderful life this is! Doing the work of nourishing the believers in the home meetings builds the church and helps us to know what it means to be built up with others.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=title>RAISING UP THE NEW ONES AS GOD&#8217;S GROWING CHILDREN WITH THE PURE MILK OF THE WORD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 2:2</h1><h2 class=head1>RAISING UP THE NEW BELIEVERS</h2><p>In this message we will continue to fellowship concerning the second step of the God-ordained way, that is, having home meetings with the newly saved and baptized ones. If you spend some time to consider 1 Peter 2:2, you will realize that it implies more than feeding. It implies the raising up of children, which is to provide whatever they need, including feeding, that they may grow and mature. Human history has proven that the society of a nation is built up through the raising up of children in individual homes by families.<p>Since I came to the Lord&#8217;s recovery in 1932, I have been bothered by the small attendance in the meetings, yet I never understood the reason for this lack. For the past five years I have set myself to study this problem thoroughly. By the Lord&#8217;s mercy, I found out that the biggest reason we do not have a large number in our meetings is that we are lacking in the proper raising up of the new believers. We have had the meetings, we have had the work, and all the co-workers have been diligent and faithful in their labor; yet we have not seen much fruit. Many people have come, but very few have remained.<p>I have studied and even expounded John 15 for many years, yet there is one point in verse 16 that I had never seen. I had seen that the Lord has chosen and appointed us that we should first go forth and then bear fruit, but I had not seen the third point-&#8220;that your fruit should remain.&#8221; The Lord has not only appointed us to go forth and to bear fruit; He has also appointed us to insure that our fruit remains. Unless the fruit remains, it is somewhat vain for us to go forth and bear fruit. In the past we went out and labored to bear fruit, yet those who remain are very few. We all have to understand that our problem, our shortage, in the past was that we did not see that to keep our fruit, to insure that it remains, we need to carry out the work of raising up the new believers in the proper way.<p>On the day of Pentecost, three thousand were saved (Acts 2:41). I believe that on the same day they began to have home meetings (Acts 2:46). This was not something that was practiced in the Old Testament. This was something totally new, something of the New Testament. On the day the church came into existence, the one hundred twenty plus these three thousand believers began to meet in the homes so that the fruit would remain. It would be very difficult for three thousand newborn believers to remain healthy without being cared for in home meetings. Immediately after the delivery of a baby, the nursing mother must take care of feeding her child. However, only to feed this child is not sufficient; she must also raise this child. To raise a child is not simple or easy. There are many, many items to take care of in order to raise a child properly.<p>Surely Peter saw the situation on the day of Pentecost and helped in the work of caring for these newborn believers. Then in his first Epistle, he says that the newborn babes need the milk of the word, not for knowledge, but for the growth in life (2:2). He exhorts the newborn babes to long for the guileless milk of the word that they may grow in life unto salvation. Here salvation does not refer to regeneration, the initial stage of salvation, but to the fact that following regeneration, we must grow in life, that is, we must be saved continuously every day. After a baby is born, it must be cared for continuously. If it is not cared for, after a few hours, it may die. Therefore, its being cared for continuously is its salvation. Such a babe must be saved in every way; this is to raise up a child. Merely to feed a babe with milk is not adequate; it must also be kept clean, warm, and comfortable. All of its environment must be arranged so that it will be safe and able to grow properly. We must take this way in raising up the newborn believers.<p>I am very burdened concerning the new way. Nearly every day I have considered the items of God&#8217;s ordained way, and the more I considered, the more I realized that we should be trained to take care of the new ones in the same way that mothers and fathers raise their own children. The work of taking care of the new ones must be a work of raising up children. We should not bring forth children and send them to others to be raised. The little ones should be directly under their mother&#8217;s care. This makes a big difference.<h2 class=head1>NOT BEARING TOO MANY CHILDREN</h2><p>The first item regarding raising up children is that you cannot care properly for too many. When you baptize someone, you are very happy, but you have to realize that this person is now your babe. You must take care of him and raise him up as your child. You are now a mother, and you have to assume the responsibilities of motherhood. This is very troublesome. Every young lady wants to get married and have children, but after she has had three children, she may weep and say, &#8220;I do not want any more children.&#8221; This is because raising up children is so difficult. Therefore, if you have too many new ones to take care of, you will not be able to do it properly.<p>It is good to have spiritual children, but do not have too many. In Taipei when we were experimenting with the new way, we broke this principle. We considered that the more we could baptize, the better. We baptized so many that we could not care for all of them adequately. It seems that we had only begetting ones, without anyone to feed these newborn babes. Through this we learned that every believer who preaches the gospel must also care for the new ones as a mother raising up her own children. To have home meetings is the way to fulfill this responsibility.<h2 class=head1>TAKING THE WAY OF INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES</h2><p>The home meeting is for raising up the newborn believers, not only as your children but also as God&#8217;s growing children. This is the unique shortage among us and also among all of Christianity. Wherever there is a group of Christians, and among them there is the proper care for the new ones, that church will become quite large. However, this work cannot be carried out on a large scale by the church as a whole; it must be done through the individual families.<p>In society it is difficult to raise up children on a large scale. If every family raises three or four children in their home, eventually, many proper persons will be produced to benefit society. Every team is a family. If you are a team of three members, you must become a family raising up the new ones as your children, yet considering them as God&#8217;s children. You are simply nursing mothers doing the work of raising up these children for God.<p>To carry out this kind of work, you must keep certain principles. You should not leave the raising up of your children to others. Do not go out to do other things, leaving your children under others&#8217; care. You must &#8220;stay home&#8221; and take care of your children directly by yourself. To leave your children in the care of others for even a short time may cause some damage; they may suffer and not grow so well. The work of raising up the new ones must be under your direct care.<p>Then you should not try to care for too many at one time. As a team of three, you should be able to take care of six to ten new ones. Once you have this many to care for, you should stop going out to baptize more and concentrate your energy, time, and attention on these six to ten. It is best to care for these new ones for about two years. For the first half year, you should render intensive care, visiting them twice each week for two months and then once each week for four months. During this period of time, to leave your children as orphans to be raised by others would cause much damage. Instead, you should fall in love with your children and be willing to sacrifice yourselves for them. Without the sacrifices of its mother, no child could be raised properly.<p>Based upon my study and our history of nearly sixty-five years, I have found that the only way to raise up a proper church life is by begetting babes and raising them up as children. This is the way to fulfill the Lord&#8217;s commandment to go and disciple all the nations (Matt. 28:19). To disciple the nations, we must start by discipling individuals, yet we cannot go alone; we must go as a team. The best number to have in a team is three. On the one hand, to have too many on a team may allow too many opinions to come in, but on the other hand, to have only two on a team would be too few because these two may quarrel. Therefore, a third member is needed to balance them. Also, if the members are not the same age, this will help to balance the team. We all must learn how to work together as a team without any opinion. Then our team can become a family, working together year-round to raise up the Lord&#8217;s children.<h2 class=head1>FULFILLING OUR RESPONSIBILITY</h2><p>In your going out to preach the gospel, it may be that you will baptize some nearly every time you go out. It is possible to become addicted to this. Every kind of addiction is harmful. If you are addicted to baptizing people, even that can be harmful. We all must learn not to baptize too many. If as a team you have already baptized eight, that is good enough; do not endeavor to baptize more. You should stop baptizing and go to &#8220;change diapers.&#8221; You must be balanced. Do not bring forth babies and then hand them over to others. That is wrong. After your team has baptized a small number, stop and form a family to do the work of raising up these new ones as God&#8217;s children. You must do everything for them continuously, day after day, week after week, and month after month. Then you will see the proper result. This is the way to build up the church life through raising up the new believers.<p>We all must bear our responsibility in taking care of the home meetings. However, we should not try to do this on a big scale. Each team member should have only about three new ones to take care of. It is their duty to meet continuously with these new believers in home meetings. If a nursing mother does not have a sense of duty, but only does things according to her desires and likes, her babe will not grow properly and may even die. In the Lord&#8217;s work, there are no vacations. You have to go out continuously, not to many homes, but to those three or four homes of the ones you are caring for. You must attend to your duty like a nursing mother raising up her children. Today you are raising up not only your children but also God&#8217;s children.<h2 class=head1>RAISING UP THE NEW ONES WITH THE WORD OF GOD</h2><p>The second point regarding the raising up of God&#8217;s children is that you have to raise them up with the word of God, not with your own word. You must always keep this principle. Do not speak your own word too much. You must learn to seize, or grasp, the opportunity to inject these new ones with the word of God. Feed them with the milk of the Word of God. This is why I published Truth Lessons and Life Lessons. In these volumes I have collected the most suitable verses for helping the new ones. I encourage all of you who are working in the Lord&#8217;s new way to become very well acquainted with all forty-eight lessons in Life Lessons. All the subjects of these lessons were carefully selected according to my knowledge and experience to meet the needs of the new ones. Study these lessons, and learn how to use all these golden verses. It is best if you can recite all these verses, but at least you must know where they are in the Bible. Then if you cannot recite a verse, you can find it quickly. Sometimes, even if you can recite the verse, it is better to open to that verse and let the new one read it. Whatever you do, you must do it in a living way, and you should try to cover at least one definite point using the best verses.<p>The first thing we should inject into the new ones is that our Savior is the Spirit and that we as saved ones have a regenerated spirit. We need to spend at least three or four home meetings to impart this matter into them.<p>The second category of things we should impart to them must be the basic practices of the Christian life. As Christians we should read the Bible, the Word of God. We should pray to God, which is to breathe in God. Also, we should have morning watch. Every morning we should rise up early to have a time of morning watch with the Lord. We must also teach them how to practice morning watch by reading some verses and then pray-reading these verses. You have to charge them to attend the Christian meetings. Then you also have to help them to do the same thing that you did for them, that is, to preach the gospel to others. These are the basic practices of the Christian life.<p>The next matters we should cover with them are all the different items of God&#8217;s salvation. God&#8217;s salvation is all-inclusive, and within God&#8217;s salvation there are many different items. There are the washing away of our sins, the forgiving of our sins, redemption, reconciliation, justification, regeneration, and so forth. All of these matters are covered in the forty-eight lessons in Life Lessons. You have to take care of all these matters, and to do so will require many weeks.<p>If you cover these three categories properly, the ones who are under your care will be raised up very well. Spontaneously, they will grow and become steadfast. The home meeting is like kindergarten, and the group meeting is like elementary school. In later messages we will have much fellowship on the group meeting.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p>Question: Recently, before we went to a home meeting, we had some fellowship and felt that we should cover the matter of calling upon the name of the Lord in a solid and thorough way. So we got into the footnote on this matter in Acts 2:21 (note 1), and we also got into the Life-study of Romans where this matter is covered in detail (Message Twenty-three). When we went to the home meeting, six members of the family attended. We began by singing some songs about calling upon the name of the Lord, but we could tell by the singing that they were not entering into this matter. We went on to share with them the importance of calling upon the name of the Lord, not only for our salvation, but also for us to participate in all of the Lord&#8217;s riches after we are saved. We got into verse after verse, and after each verse we tried to encourage them to practice, saying something like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s practice calling on the Lord right now. Lord Jesus!&#8221; But we could tell that, for some reason, they simply did not want to call on the Lord. This grieved us because we really wanted them to touch the Lord. So we continued to share, going through the Old Testament and then the New Testament, showing them all the verses related to calling on the Lord. In the end, we felt like we had given a message to some people who did not want to know about calling on the Lord. We spoke the Word of God and not our own word, but we also felt that the meeting was a failure. Our aim was to bring them into the matter of contacting their spirit, but we did not accomplish this. Would you make some comments concerning this case?<p>Answer: First, what you taught was not suitable for the home meeting. The home meeting is the kindergarten, but you were teaching something in graduate school. Do not have home meetings on such a high level. Do not forget that in the home meetings, you are taking care of babes; you are feeding the newborn babes with baby food. You used the Word of God, but you used too many verses. In most cases, three or four verses is enough. When you feed these little babes, you cannot feed them too much. You should always keep them a little hungry. If you overfeed them, they will lose their appetite.<p>Second, you must feed babes something with a good flavor, something sweet to make them happy. If the food you offer them is sweet to the taste, they will eat. The first thing you have to learn is how to make people feel pleasant. Do not forget that nourishing must go along with cherishing. You have to cherish them first.<p>The best way to bring the new ones into calling on the name of the Lord is by singing. You can simply take the lead to sing. Everyone, both young and old, likes singing. Do not explain that much to them; explaining is often sour, not sweet. Singing is very sweet. You must be like a nursing mother, making your little ones feel pleasant by giving them something sweet. It is better if you do not need to use the hymnal. You must learn some short, simple songs and choruses that are easy to sing. You may need to sing a chorus quite a few times. The first time you sing it, the new ones may be surprised. The second time, they may listen and begin to enjoy it. Then the third time you sing it, they may begin to join you.<p>The principle is this: if you are going to help the newborn babes, you must always try to make them happy, to make them feel good. Then they will take what you give them.<p>Question: We have been visiting a ninety-two-year-old woman and her daughter. We told them that we would like to come and read the Bible with them. We have gone back to do this several times. On one of these occasions, we sang a song for them and taught them how to sing it. Then we read a chapter from the Gospel of John, exercising a little as we read, and fellowshipped a few things related to that portion of the Word, Every time we visit them, they seem to enjoy our time together, especially the singing, and sometimes we are able to impart something of the Word through our reading of the Bible and fellowship. One time we were able to meet some of her grandchildren, so we thought that their home might be the key to the whole family. What are your feelings concerning this case?<p>Answer: We all must consider what our purpose is in going out to visit people. We are laboring for the increase of the church. For people to be saved and baptized is easy, but for them to become practical, living members in the church life is difficult. Our burden is not only to get people saved and baptized; our purpose is to gain the proper increase for the church life. Therefore, when you go to visit a new one, you must exercise the Lord&#8217;s discernment to know whether or not this one could be brought into the church life easily. If it would be hard for this one to be brought into the church life, we should help him to be saved and baptized, but then go out to labor on others. In this way we will find the best sons of peace for the church life.<p>Our preaching of the gospel is not merely to get people saved and baptized. Our preaching of the gospel is for the building up of the Body of Christ. Therefore, we must seek out the proper persons who would not be so difficult for us to gain for the church life. In visiting people, we must have the discernment to realize which ones would be very hard to bring into the church life. To spend so much time to labor on such an old sister, even if she could be brought into the church life, is not wise. We have to save our time. To spend this much time in hope of gaining her family is also unwise. There are too many other homes and families on which we can spend our time.<p>Learn to be wise and not waste your time. You have a fishing pond with thousands of fish. There are thousands of homes to which you can go. In going out to save and baptize people, you must labor with discernment. After two weeks your team may have baptized fifteen. Then you have to consider which of these fifteen are proper persons whom you could bring into the church life easily. You must spend most of your time on these promising ones. Out of these fifteen, you may select six. You should not abandon the other nine, but go to visit them perhaps once every two weeks to keep in contact. However, you must spend most of your time on the promising ones.<p>We all have to be trained to labor with discernment. We are like farmers with too many pieces of land to farm. Therefore, we must select the most productive piece of land on which to work. If we have only five pieces of land, we have no choice; we must labor on them all. If there are only three families in our city, we have to knock on these doors. But there are hundreds of families in our city, so we must go with discernment. We should also discern which communities are the best to work in and which kind of people are the best to labor on. This does not mean that we despise a certain kind of people or that we do not believe that all sinners need God&#8217;s salvation. We are going out to gain proper people for the church life that the Body of Christ could be built up. Our commission from the Lord is not only to save sinners but also to build up the church life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery as a testimony. Therefore, we must save our time to work on the most promising ones that we could gain the proper increase for the church.<p>Question: We are taking care of a family, and the wife is very sad because her husband has an alcohol problem. Recently, she spoke to me about this problem, and I shared with her that she is now a new person because she has Christ in her and that our problems can be overcome. Then I tried to help her to know how to receive more of the Lord so that her problems would not bother her so much, but she did not understand very well. I tried to explain in a different way and read her some verses. At the end we prayed together, and in our prayer we prayed for her husband and for her further receiving of the Lord. How should we go on with this one?<p>Answer: When we go out to visit people we always have to exercise our God-given discernment. Even if this one is very good, her environment is hard, full of problems. It is hard for our work to overcome all of these problems. There are too many people with too many problems. If we try to solve everyone&#8217;s problems, our time will be wasted and our work will be finished. You can work on this kind of person for your whole life, and nearly nothing may come out for the practical building up of the Body of Christ. It is better to go out to visit new homes to gain more new ones. Eventually, we will find some who are very good for the church life.<p>It is worthwhile to sacrifice everything to work in His recovery for the building up of the Body of Christ as God&#8217;s testimony today, but we must labor wisely; we must discern the different people. America is a melting pot with all kinds of people. Some are people of problems. If we go to them, we are jumping into a pit full of problems. Therefore, we have to have some discernment concerning what community we should work in and which neighborhoods we should visit. We should make our choices wisely.<p>When people raise up problems, you have to consider what particular point you should strike in order to feed them. In this case, the one point you may want to strike is that she has a spirit and that she can exercise this spirit to contact the Lord, to breathe the Lord in for her enjoyment. You must leave all the problems aside. However, do not ignore or reject her problems completely. You could say, &#8220;Only the Lord can take care of all our problems. You can pray concerning this.&#8221; This is the best way to put aside the unnecessary matters. Then you may say, &#8220;I would like to help you to do something. Every day you can exercise your spirit to pray to the Lord. In your prayer you can remind Him of all these problems, but please do not be bothered by these problems. If you are bothered by them, this will kill your prayer life. Learn how to exercise your spirit to call on the name of the Lord.&#8221; Simply stress this one point, and ask her to practice this matter by praying with you. In this one point you can help her, but you should leave all the problems untouched. The enemy is always crouching, waiting for a chance to spoil our work. He does this by bringing up all kinds of problems to make the whole situation muddy or cloudy. We have to choose one point in order to render some help, forgetting all the problems.<p>Question: If a team of three has nine to twelve new ones to care for, should each member go out alone to care for three or four, or should all three go together to visit each of these?<p>Answer: Every week your team should come together to fellowship concerning all these new ones. By this you can know their situations and consider which of them may not be that promising and which of them may need some urgent care. Based upon your fellowship, you can decide which member or members should visit which new ones that week. You all must work together in this way.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=title>LEADING THE NEW ONES INTO THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h1><p>In this message we will continue to fellowship concerning the home meetings.<h2 class=head1>LEADING THE NEW BELIEVERS TO MEET WITH THE CHURCH</h2><p>As you labor in the home meetings, you will realize that the new believers under your care need to be led into the practice of the church life. You should not forget that the goal of gaining people is to bring them into the proper church life for the increase of Christ to build up the Body of Christ. Do not wait too long before bringing the new believers into the practice of the church life. Actually, from the day you baptize the new believers, you should begin to direct them into other meetings of the church. If possible, it is best to direct the new believers into the church meeting on the Lord&#8217;s Day because that meeting best represents the character of the church life.<p>Immediately after baptizing a new one, we should bring him into the church meetings and give him some impression concerning the church life. After this initial visit, we should charge him again and again in subsequent home meetings to meet with the saints and with the church. We should help him to realize that Christians are like sheep of a flock. As sheep cannot live apart from the flock, Christians cannot live apart from one another and should come together often.<p>To have meetings in the new ones&#8217; homes is only the initial stage. While we are having home meetings in their homes, we still should endeavor to bring them out of their own homes into other meetings of the believers, such as the small group meetings or the larger meetings of the church. We should help them to build up a practice of meeting with the saints and with the church.<h2 class=head1>LEADING THE NEW BELIEVERS TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2><p>We have to take the lead to bring the new believers into the practice of preaching the gospel. First, we baptize them, and then we feed them in the home meetings. While we are feeding them, we should help them to have a burden for their relatives. We may say to them, &#8220;We brought Christ to you, and now we encourage you to bring Christ to your relatives.&#8221; As we accompany the new believers to visit their relatives, these &#8220;warm doors&#8221; will be open to us. We must lead the new believers to visit their relatives, helping them to realize that this is another part of the practice of the church life.<h2 class=head1>LEADING THE NEW BELIEVERS TO TAKE CARE OF OTHER SAINTS</h2><p>From the very beginning, we should also lead the new ones to take care of other saints. In raising children the best parents always lead their children to do the same thing that they do. While we are caring for the home meetings, we should gradually lead our new ones into the practice of the church life. The practice of the church life is first, to preach the gospel to gain new believers; second, to meet with the saints and with the whole church; and third, to take care of other saints. From the beginning of their Christian life, the new believers should be brought into the habit of caring for other believers.<p>We should concentrate on these three things in helping the new believers. Yet we should know that each of these three things is not very easy to practice. They may seem to be easy, but they are somewhat difficult. We all must learn to practice these things to bring the new ones into the proper church life.<h2 class=head1>NOT CARING FOR THE NEW BELIEVERS ACCORDING TO OUR DISPOSITION</h2><p>In caring for the new believers in the home meetings, we must realize that every person has a different disposition. Some are of a loud disposition, while others are quiet. Even among us, there are many saints who have rarely shouted aloud in the meetings. When we are leading the new believers to call on the Lord, we should not care whether they call loudly or softly. Our main objective in the home meetings is to feed the new believers. We all would like to see the new ones pray loudly and shout their hallelujahs in a loud way. But we must realize that often those who shout loudly and crazily are not that trustworthy. Usually, the more trustworthy and steady ones are the more silent ones.<p>We should not require the new ones to call or pray in the same way as we do. They have their disposition, and we have ours. Our main job is to give them an injection, that is, to minister and impart Christ into them. Whenever we meet with them, we must have the assurance that we have nourished them.<p>We should not be overly concerned with their response. When a mother nourishes her child, she is comforted as long as she realizes that her child is nourished. This is primary to a nursing mother. How the child responds is secondary. As we care for new believers, we should trust in the nourishment we have ministered into them more than in anything else we do.<p>Since I have had many diseases and sicknesses throughout my life, I have been under the care of many doctors and have learned a great deal from them. They strictly pay attention to their treatment and not to the pleasant or unpleasant reaction of their patients. We should take care of the new ones in the home meetings in the same way, giving them the proper injection without being affected by their reaction. However, we should do this in a pleasant way without offending or stumbling them, leaving them with a good impression of us.<h2 class=head1>FEEDING THE NEW BELIEVERS WITH BABY FOOD</h2><p>In one of the home meetings, a family of new believers proposed that their family and the saints exchange Christmas gifts. When this suggestion was made, the saints simply smiled and tried to avoid the issue by turning the conversation to a hymn and a portion of the Word. The meeting ended without any further mention of Christmas. But a few days later, another reference was made to something of Christmas by one of the family members as the family was traveling to one of the meetings with the team. The family has been brought into the enjoyment and experience of the Lord on many occasions, yet the saints are somewhat concerned as to how to share with them concerning the celebration of Christmas without offending them.<p>In speaking with the new believers, you should never forget that they are babes and that they must be fed with baby food. When they raise a question concerning Christmas, you should use the subject of Christmas to feed them. You should not try to adjust them harshly, since this would not be treating them as babes. The nursing mothers not only feed their little ones, but they also cherish them by playing with them. To play with them is to cherish them. This cherishing makes them happy. Once they are cherished and feel happy, the mothers feed them. You must learn how to &#8220;play&#8221; with the new believers. Your aim in playing with them is to feed them; therefore, you should not become too occupied with the subject of Christmas. You may say in a tender and loving manner, &#8220;Christmas is here because of Christ. Without Christ, there would be no Christmas holiday. The story of Christmas began because Christ came to be our Savior. Although you may have a Christmas tree, you must make sure that you get Christ.&#8221; You should gradually turn them from the false things of Christmas to the reality of Christ. As you turn them to Christ, saying something about Christ, spontaneously you are injecting them with Christ. Eventually, through this kind of tender fellowship, they will feel happy that they know something about the real meaning of Christmas, and soon they will forget about exchanging Christmas gifts. You should exercise your patience and wisdom, but you should not forget your goal of ministering Christ into the new believers as their nourishment.<p>The year I got saved, I learned that Christmas was a falsehood. I began to fight with anyone who held on to something of Christmas. That was wrong. Gradually, I have learned to &#8220;play&#8221; with the spiritual babes. We all have to learn this secret. In the Western world, there is the problem of the Christmas celebration, but in the Far East, especially in China, there is the problem of the traditional feasts which occur three times a year. It is difficult for the young believers to overcome these feasts and celebrations, but with the Lord&#8217;s help, we can help them by applying the principle which I have presented here.<h2 class=head1>LEARNING TO BE FLEXIBLE IN CARING FOR THE NEW BELIEVERS ON DIFFERENT LEVELS</h2><p>The saints visited a new believer who comes from a strong Christian background and began to teach her a very simple song in order to help her call on the name of the Lord. They told her that they like to sing such a song in the morning, especially when they do not feel so good or when they have a lot of problems. She responded by saying, &#8220;Yes, it seems that we always go through a lot of problems.&#8221; Based upon this response, the saints read Romans 8:28-29 with her and began to share with her concerning the contents of these two verses. In reading verse 29, she noticed the word &#8220;predestinated,&#8221; which reminded her of a verse in Ephesians 1 where she had been reading concerning the matter of sealing and pledging. The saints then turned to Ephesians 1 and began to share with her about sealing and pledging. The new believer was excited by the saints&#8217; fellowship on this subject and remarked that she had never heard such things before. The saints shared a little further concerning this matter, and at the end of the meeting, they sang the song again and encouraged her to remember it during the coming week.<p>In principle, when introducing something such as a new song to the new believers, it is best to avoid using the word teach in your fellowship. You should try not to say, &#8220;We would like to teach you a new song.&#8221; It is better to say, &#8220;We would like to sing a song with you,&#8221; or &#8220;Would you please sing a song with us?&#8221; To use the words teach or teaching brings in an element which damages the situation with the new ones.<p>The new believers, in principle, are like babes; therefore, we must feed them with baby food. But we also have to learn to be flexible when we realize that the one for whom we are caring is more than a babe. In this case, the person the saints were taking care of was not a babyish person. Thus, the saints should have been very flexible and adjusted themselves to the level of the new believer. The saints also tried to deal with too many different things in this one visit. It would have been better to discern which one of the things was the subject for that visit and to feed the new one the proper food based upon that subject. In this matter there is the need for a lot of training because we often do more than we should in one visit. A trained and experienced person, however, would be able to handle this situation in a proper way.<p>In this home meeting, the saints should not have left their subject of singing a song to help the new one to call on the name of the Lord. She introduced the subject of sufferings, but in order to keep the subject of calling on the name of the Lord and avoid changing subjects, they might have said, &#8220;Not only do we Christians suffer, but everybody on this earth suffers. This is the reason that we need to call on the name of the Lord. To be rescued from suffering, we must call on the name of the Lord.&#8221; By such a short word, the new one is brought back to the subject. Instead of being led by the new one from subject to subject, the saints should have brought her back to the subject of calling, using any word spoken by her to strengthen their subject. According to the Lord&#8217;s leading, the saints may have felt to explain a little concerning the name of the Lord being powerful and being above all names. Then they could have led her to call a few times, and as they were calling, one of them could have begun to sing. Spontaneously, the new one would have followed them to sing also. It then may have been appropriate to share a short testimony of their experience of calling on the name of the Lord. This kind of testimony should not be given in the way of teaching, but in a spontaneous way as the opportunity presents itself. We all must learn to lay aside the way of teaching in a formal way and to take the way of caring for the new ones in a very living, flexible, and pleasant way.<h2 class=head1>EXERCISING DISCERNMENT IN PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2><p>The principle in visiting people with the gospel is to first help them to get saved and baptized. As we are preaching the gospel we should learn to exercise our discernment concerning whether a person will be difficult to gain or not. If we discern that the environment, the family, and so forth would make it difficult to gain someone, we should not invest our time in that person. A carpenter selects a certain kind of wood based upon what he intends to make with it. He must discern what kind of material will be fitting for his use. We should also discern in the same way when we preach the gospel, because there are many different kinds of people on the earth. We must be wise and learn to discern people while we are talking to them.<h2 class=head1>AVOIDING VAIN LABOR BY LEARNING TO LABOR IN A PROPER WAY</h2><p>I have noticed that when some saints go out, they quickly gain people, while others may go out faithfully, having little result. The problem with the second group of saints is the lack of training. Though we labor a great deal, our labor may be in vain if we do not labor in the proper way. The labor in the gospel and home meetings must be regular, consistent, and continuous. If one member of a team of three is sick, it would be better for the other two to go visit the new one than to have some change of hands in the visiting. To change the persons who labor in a particular home meeting will almost certainly cause a lot of loss. The best way is not to change the persons who visit the home meetings. To change the persons damages the coordination among the saints who have been laboring together to take care of the home meeting. The issue of such constant changes will be confusion among the saints who are laboring, and the time with the new believer will be wasted. Therefore, it is better to maintain the same members in the visiting groups.<p>We all have to learn how to take the Lord&#8217;s new way through training. In the past years, we studied history and the biographies and autobiographies of the saints, and we discovered that, among the Lord&#8217;s people, only the seminary graduates labored according to some kind of training. These graduates were hired by the denominations to become their clergy. These clergymen were trained, but the so-called laity was not trained. The laity simply acted according to their likes and dislikes. However, today we realize that if we would practice the new way according to the New Testament, we must be trained.<p>Though the word training is not used in the books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, the thought is surely conveyed in these books. In order to serve the Lord, we must be trained. In 2 Timothy 2:2 Paul charged Timothy to commit the things which he had heard to faithful men who would be competent to teach others. To commit to faithful men implies some amount of training. A job cannot be handed over to someone who knows nothing about the job. There is the need of training. Neither does a mother commit the job of cooking to her daughter without first training her.<p>Paul set up a pattern by staying in Ephesus for three years (Acts 20:31) to train the saints. In Acts 20:20 Paul told the elders of the church in Ephesus that he did not shrink from declaring to them anything that was profitable and that he taught publicly and from house to house, admonishing each one with tears (v. 31). Paul&#8217;s teaching publicly in the meetings and visiting from house to house was his training of the saints. Paul later charged Timothy to stay in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently (1 Tim. 1:3). This too was a kind of training carried out by Timothy.<p>There has been little result in Christianity because the so-called laymen have not been trained. Many have been stirred up for the Lord, but their enthusiasm has had very little result because they have exercised to serve the Lord in their own way. We in the Lord&#8217;s recovery also need training. The Lord&#8217;s recovery itself is very particular, and the matter of training is also something particular within the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Under the training we should not do anything according to our likes or dislikes or according to our environment. Rather, we must do everything according to the points of the training.<h2 class=head1>AVOIDING THE TRANSFER OF CARE OF THE NEW ONES FROM GROUP TO GROUP</h2><p>One group of saints baptized a new believer in an area which has been cared for by another group of saints. The first group wants to introduce the second group to the new believer so that they can begin to care for the new one in the home meetings. The saints are concerned whether or not this is the best way to care for the new believer.<p>The best way to care for the new believers is to try to avoid any kind of transfer of care from one group to another group. Unless the new ones who were baptized move from one section of the city to another section, it is best not to transfer the new ones from group to group. When there is the need of a transfer, it should be done in a very careful and considerate manner and not in a light way. If a couple wants to adopt a child, they must go through a number of procedures. Likewise, whenever a new believer is passed on from one group of saints to another, it must be done in a very proper way. To conduct a transfer in a proper way, however, is difficult. We must realize that gaining anything worthwhile on this earth is not easy. To get an education to the level of a doctorate is not very easy. One must go through six years of elementary education, two years of junior high school, four years of high school, four years of undergraduate school, and five years of graduate school. If such things as education are not easy, how much more difficult it is to advance in the things of the Lord, who is our King. Nothing with the King is a light matter. To save souls and to feed people in home meetings are not small matters. For a nursing mother to sweep her front porch is not very significant, but to nourish her child is one of the most important things to her. The nourishment of the new believers in the home meetings is a most important thing; therefore, we should exercise great caution in transferring the care of a home meeting from one group to another group.<p>If a new one moves from one city to another, we have to do something in a definite way to affect a transfer. We should call some of the brothers in the new city to recommend the new one to the brothers. Then we should infuse the new one in order to encourage him to contact the saints in the new locality. We then need to make sure that the new one is contacted by the saints. Otherwise, we will lose the one on whom we have labored.<h2 class=head1>CARING FOR THE NEW BELIEVERS AS OUR OWN CHILDREN</h2><p>In raising up the new believers as children, it is best if you have your own children. However, if you do not have your own children by birth, you can adopt other children. Adoption of spiritual children takes place when you do not have children of your own. When you adopt these children, the best attitude is to consider them as your very own children.<h2 class=head1>FOUR STEPS NEEDED TO PRACTICE THE LORD&#8217;S NEW WAY</h2><p>One brother related his past experience of being successful in preaching the gospel and baptizing a good number of people, but not having remaining fruit due to his own immaturity. Recently, he has gained one of his schoolmates at college, but he is reluctant to stir up his friend to preach the gospel because of his friend&#8217;s lack of growth. This brother is also reluctant to have too many spiritual children for fear of not having one who remains.<p>To bring people to the Lord is relatively easy, but to raise them up is not very easy. In our study over the past few years, we have discovered that we need at least four steps to raise up the new believers. The first step is to visit people by knocking on their doors in order to gain them. Second, after gaining them by saving and baptizing them, there is the need to nourish and cherish the new ones in home meetings. Third, there is the need of group meetings to perfect the saints. Fourth, we must learn to practice having our meetings in mutuality with the universal prophesying. Walking according to these steps is to practice the Lord&#8217;s new way. We must learn how to visit people as the New Testament priests of the gospel to get them saved (Rom. 15:16). Then we should take care of them as our little children to cherish them and nourish them that we may raise them up. This step requires a great deal of time, but we should not expect to have remaining fruit without exercising the proper care in the home meetings. After bearing fruit, we must take good care of the fruit; otherwise, the fruit will not remain. Once we have fruit, we should try our best to take care of it even though we may still be young and lack the growth in life. Often, the children in a family are raised not only by the parents, but also by the elder brothers and sisters. It is the same today in the church life. We must realize that the older brothers and sisters in the Lord&#8217;s recovery can help us to raise our spiritual children.<h2 class=head1>DEALING WITH THE EXPECTATIONS OF PEOPLE REGARDING CHURCH MEETINGS</h2><p>Christianity has built up something in a wrong way and has given people the wrong impression concerning the meeting life among the Lord&#8217;s people. Because of this wrong impression, most people today have a certain expectation whenever they attend a so-called church meeting. When they attend a Christian meeting, they often say that they are &#8220;going to church.&#8221; This is the reason that we must have the home meetings. In the home meetings, the new ones are not distracted by the form of the church, and they can receive the nourishment. While we are feeding them in their homes, we should gradually let them know what the biblical way of gaining people for the Lord is. Then, as they are helped to realize the biblical way to meet and to serve, they will not pay that much attention to the form of the church meetings. In their homes we nourish and cherish them to raise them up and to educate them so that they can realize what the real things are. In many cases, when the saints have done a good job of educating the new ones in the home meetings, the new ones are very happy to attend the small group meetings because their taste has been changed. With this change of taste, these new ones no longer have a taste for the formality of Christianity.<h2 class=head1>THE RICHES OF CHRIST AS THE ATTRACTING ELEMENT IN ALL KINDS OF MEETINGS</h2><p>In order to practice the New Testament way, we must have the riches of Christ as our content. Our meetings must have the riches of Christ as their content; otherwise, the new ones will be disappointed. When they compare the attractive facade of Christianity to our way of meeting and practice, they will not be impressed with our way. Therefore, we must have the rich content in the home meetings, small group meetings, and larger church meetings. All of these meetings must be full of the riches of Christ. As people taste these riches, they will lose their taste for the facade of Christianity.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=title>THE PERFECTING IN THE GROUP MEETINGS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:24-25; 2 Tim. 2:2; Eph. 4:11-12</h1><p>In this full-time training we intend to cover the four main steps of the God-ordained way. In the previous messages we have covered the first two steps: visiting people as the New Testament priests of the gospel and raising up the new believers in the home meetings. In this message we will begin to fellowship concerning the third step-the group meeting. The fourth step of prophesying for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ will be covered in future messages.<h2 class=head1>PAUL&#8217;S PRACTICE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTHOOD</h2><p>Paul said that he was a New Testament priest of the gospel (Rom. 15:16). In the book of Acts and in all of Paul&#8217;s Epistles, we can see that Paul exercised to practice this New Testament priesthood to the uttermost. He practiced the gospel preaching as a New Testament priest mainly in two ways. First, wherever he went he visited the synagogues. At that time, especially in Asia Minor, there were Jewish synagogues in all the major cities. There was always a group of people gathered together in these synagogues who had the Scriptures and knew something of God. Paul took advantage of this situation. As a Jew who had been converted to be a Christian and who had also become an apostle and an evangelist, it was very profitable for him to go to visit the Jewish synagogues. In doing this he was following in the Lord&#8217;s steps. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He traveled through the cities and also entered into the synagogues (Matt. 4:23; 9:35). Paul followed the Lord&#8217;s example and was successful in this way of preaching the gospel.<p>Paul also practiced preaching the gospel by going out to visit people. In his second journey, Paul was first forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia, and then when they tried to go into Bithynia, the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them. Therefore, they were forced to take a direct course toward Macedonia through Mysia and Troas (Acts 16:6-8). In his second journey, Paul did not know which way to go. He tried one way and then another way; he was &#8220;experimenting.&#8221; He tried to go to the left (Asia) and was stopped. Then he tried to go to the right (Bithynia) and was also stopped. He did not want to turn back, so he went straight forward until he came to the city of Troas on the Aegean Sea. At this point he did not know where to go.<p>It seems that when they came to Troas, Paul did not have the thought to cross over to another continent, so God gave him a vision. &#8220;A vision was seen by Paul during the night: a certain man, a Macedonian, was standing and entreating him and saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us! And when he had seen the vision, we immediately endeavored to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to bring the good news to them&#8221; (Acts 16:9-10). The word &#8220;concluding&#8221; in this verse indicates that after seeing the vision from God, there was the need to conclude, that is, to understand by considering what it meant, by exercising the mind, a mind saturated and directed by the spirit (Eph. 4:23), according to the actual situation and environment. After studying the situation and considering the vision, Paul reached a conclusion. Today some people are too spiritual. They think that if you have the leading of the Holy Spirit, you should always know what to do. But Paul was not that spiritual; he was still human.<p>In the Old Testament, God&#8217;s oracle, God&#8217;s speaking, always came through the Urim and Thummim which were on the breastplate of the high priest (Exo. 28:30). That was a miracle. Suddenly light would shine, not on the whole breastplate, but on the Hebrew letters on the breastplate, again and again until the divine speaking was completed. In this way God&#8217;s will was made known to His people. God&#8217;s administration in the Old Testament was carried out by His speaking in His divine oracle through the Urim and Thummim. This administration, God&#8217;s divine government over his people, is called theocracy. At certain times this theocracy was carried out by the wording from the Urim and Thummim; but not all of God&#8217;s oracle in the Old Testament was through the priesthood by the Urim and Thummim. This is why, in addition to the priesthood, there were the prophets. The prophets went along with the priesthood to strengthen it. They prophesied and also received visions from God.<p>In the New Testament theocracy, the Urim and Thummim are replaced by the mingled spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with our regenerated human spirit (Rom. 1:9; 8:16; John 3:6; 4:24; 1 Cor. 6:17). The oracle of God is in our spirit, but sometimes this is not adequate because of our weakness. In the book of Acts, there is also something in addition to the New Testament Urim and Thummim. As the prophets were added to the priesthood in the Old Testament, the New Testament priesthood also needs the function of the New Testament prophets. All of the New Testament believers are priests. Paul indicates that he was a priest of the New Testament (Rom. 15:16), yet in Acts 16 his priesthood needed the function of the prophets.<p>In the Old Testament, it was common for a vision to come to a prophet. Here in Acts 16, Paul was the priest, but the inner feeling of the mingled spirit was not so clear to him. If it had been clear, he would not have needed to experiment, to try to go to the left and then to the right. It may be that he was worried about this situation and could not sleep well. Then a vision came to him. Even after the vision came, Paul and those with him considered their situation and the vision very much, and concluding that God had called them to bring the gospel to Macedonia, they went to Philippi.<p>In Philippi Paul did not preach the gospel by going into the synagogue. He went out to visit people. He went to a place of prayer outside the gate beside a river and spoke to the women who had come together. In going to this place, he was going to a &#8220;cold door.&#8221; He did not know them, and they did not know him; but one of these women, Lydia, received the gospel and opened her home to the apostles (Acts 16:13-15). This was the first penetration of the gospel preaching into the continent of Europe. Before this time the gospel had not yet spread beyond Asia Minor.<h2 class=head1>RAISING UP THE BELIEVERS AS GOD&#8217;S FAMILY</h2><p>After studying the entire New Testament, we have found that raising up a church is like raising a family. In raising a family, the main thing is that the family has to grow. The church is the house of God, that is, the household of God, God&#8217;s family (Eph. 2:19). A local church is God&#8217;s &#8220;local family.&#8221; We have to raise up this family in the same way that we raise up our physical families. First, we must beget children. Second, we must feed these newborn babes in their homes. However, simply to have a family that is feeding babies is not the goal. That is the way, the procedure, to reach the goal. The goal is to raise up these little ones. Raising up children does not merely mean to feed them, but also to perfect them. This perfecting is clearly revealed in Ephesians 4. This chapter says that the ascended Head, Christ, has given gifts to men for the perfecting of the saints (vv. 8, 12). These gifts fall into four main categories. He gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, and some as shepherds and teachers (v. 11). The Head gave these four kinds of gifts directly to the Body.<p>According to Ephesians 4, these four kinds of gifts should do the perfecting work on the saints. Parents, after feeding their babes for a few years, have to perfect them. This is mainly by teaching them, by educating them. If a person would only eat but never receive an education, that person would be useless in society. At least a person should learn a trade. In raising up families to form the society of a nation, there is the need of births, then feeding, and then perfecting, educating.<p>After the perfecting, every saint needs to exercise to prophesy. According to the New Testament, prophesying builds up the Body of Christ directly. This is fully revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. This chapter unveils the direct building up of the church in a complete way. However, we cannot practice 1 Corinthians 14 so easily. We first have to grow and be perfected. To graduate with a bachelor&#8217;s degree, one must first pass through kindergarten, elementary school, junior high, high school, and then four years of college. To receive a master&#8217;s degree, one has to go to graduate school. To receive a doctorate requires even more study. All these steps-kindergarten, elementary school, junior high, high school, college, and graduate school-are for our perfecting.<h2 class=head1>PERFECTING ONE ANOTHER IN THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2><p>In studying the New Testament, I found that there are these same steps of maturity in the spiritual life. First, we must bring sinners to be regenerated to become babes in Christ. Then these babes need to be fed. The Lord Jesus tells us in John 15:16 to bear fruit and that our fruit should remain. In John 21 the Lord charges us to feed His lambs (v. 15). To feed the Lord&#8217;s lambs is the way to insure that our fruit remains. Peter learned this from the Lord; so in writing his first Epistle, he charges the newborn babes to long for the pure milk of the word (2:2). However, newborn babes cannot eat or drink by themselves; they need a nursing mother to feed them (1 Thes. 2:7). We suffered in the past because we did not follow our preaching of the gospel with the proper feeding. Without the proper feeding, a newborn babe can die prematurely. This has happened among us many times over the years.<p>Then after feeding, a young believer needs some teaching, some education. Hebrews 10:24 says, &#8220;Let us consider one another for inciting to love and good works.&#8221; Verse 24 uses two very positive words-consider and incite. We are to consider one another, we are to incite one another to love, and we are to incite one another to good works. This means that we have to consider others, remember others, and take care of others. We must also incite them, stir them up. They might become cold. If so, we have to fan the fire for them. We need this among us, but how can this be carried out? Verse 24 ends with a comma, and verse 25 continues, &#8220;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is.&#8221; To not forsake our assembling is to have our own meeting. This is not to have a general meeting, but a group meeting.<p>The group meeting is your meeting. In a general meeting it is hard for you to consider one another or to incite one another. This can only be done with a small group. If there are too many in a meeting, it is hard to incite one another or consider one another in this way. I have been meeting with most of you in meetings of about two hundred for quite a long time, but I still do not know many of your names. However, if you would come to my home and meet with me in my living room in a group meeting, I would get to know each of you intimately. Many of us have been meeting together for fifteen years, yet we do not even know one another. This is a shame. We all need to have our own group meeting. It is not enough to attend others&#8217; group meetings; each of us needs our own.<p>The group meeting is not the coming together of the church as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14. When the whole church comes together, that is not a group meeting. Hebrews 10:24-25 describes a group meeting. In these verses there are three items that characterize the group meeting: considering, inciting, and exhorting. Without a group meeting, how could we exhort one another? When we come together in the group meeting, you can incite me, and I can incite you. We can stir up one another to consider others, to love others, and to take care of others. To consider, incite, and exhort one another, we need the group meeting.<h2 class=head1>THE PERFECTING WORK OF THE GIFTED PERSONS</h2><p>In 2 Timothy 1:14 Paul charged Timothy to &#8220;guard the good deposit.&#8221; Timothy had a deposit; something had been deposited into him. This deposit was the healthy words repeatedly given to Timothy by Paul. Timothy had received all these healthy words into him as a kind of deposit. In 1 Timothy 6:20 Paul charged Timothy to &#8220;guard the deposit,&#8221; and in his second Epistle he repeats this charge. Then in 2 Timothy 2:2, Paul refers to &#8220;the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses.&#8221; These &#8220;things&#8221; were the healthy teachings and healthy words that Timothy had heard from Paul (1 Tim. 1:10; 6:3; 2 Tim. 1:13). Paul charges that these things, the good deposit in Timothy, be committed to faithful men, who would be competent to teach others also (2 Tim. 2:2). The word &#8220;also&#8221; indicates that Timothy should teach and that there was the need for some others to teach also.<p>First, Paul was an apostle, a perfecter. He perfected a young man, Timothy. This equipped Timothy with the good deposit and qualified him to perfect others. In 2 Timothy 2:2 the first generation perfecter charges the second generation perfecter to perfect the third generation.<p>Ephesians 4 says that the Head has given some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, and some as shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints (vv. 11-12). In a family all the young members under the age of eighteen have to be perfected. This perfecting has a goal. In Ephesians 4:12 this goal is indicated by the word &#8220;unto.&#8221; This word in Greek means with a purpose or with a view to. Therefore, the perfecting of the saints is with a purpose or with a view to the work of ministry. The same word translated &#8220;unto&#8221; is used twice in this verse: &#8220;unto&#8221; the work of ministry and &#8220;unto&#8221; the building up of the Body of Christ. These two phrases are in apposition to each other. The two refer to the same thing. The work of ministry is the building up of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class=head2>Not Directly by the Head</h2><p>Ephesians 4 is a crucial chapter because it is the only chapter in the Bible which reveals that the Head of the Body does not build the Body directly. Some have used the Lord&#8217;s word in Matthew 16:18-&#8220;I will build My church&#8221;-to teach that we do not need any persons to build us, but that we need only the Lord Jesus to build us. However, the New Testament is not only Matthew 16. There are the four Gospels, Acts, twenty-one Epistles, and Revelation. Among the Epistles, the fourteen which were written by Paul, Romans through Hebrews, are placed first. Among Paul&#8217;s Epistles, Ephesians is a book specifically on the church, and chapter four is on the building up of the church. Although the Lord says, &#8220;I will build My church&#8221; in Matthew 16, the entire Bible does not show us that Christ builds up His church directly. Rather, chapter four of Ephesians unveils this matter in detail. It is true that Christ is building up His church, but He is doing it as the Head by producing the gifted persons and giving them as gifts to the church. The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are all gifts from the Head to His Body.<h2 class=head2>The Gifts Produced by the Head</h2><p>Ephesians 4 tells us that the Lord came down, not only to the earth, but He also descended into the lower parts of the earth, Hades. Then He came out of Hades to the earth in His resurrection, and from the earth He ascended to the height, the third heaven. Therefore, He is the all-inclusive Christ who fills all in all (vv. 8-10). As such a Head, He has received gifts from the Father. According to John 17:2 and 6, the Father has given His chosen ones to the Son that the Son may give them eternal life. At the time Christ ascended to the heavens to show His freshness in resurrection to the Father (John 20:17), the Father gave all of the millions of people which He had chosen in eternity past as gifts to the Son (Psa. 68:18). Immediately, some of these gifts became apostles.<p>Although Peter, James, John, and the others were appointed apostles before the Lord&#8217;s death and resurrection, they were not constituted apostles yet. The Lord needed to die, be resurrected, and then ascend into heaven to see the Father. Then the Father could give all the chosen ones, including Peter, James, and John, to the Son, and the Son could impart His resurrection life into them. By this they were constituted apostles. Peter was a fisherman with a very impulsive disposition. In his natural condition, he could have never been an apostle. Peter was appointed as an apostle, but he was only qualified for fighting (John 18:10). James and John, the sons of thunder, were qualified to fight to be the first among the Lord&#8217;s disciples (Matt. 20:21, 24, 27), but they were not qualified to be apostles. Only through Christ&#8217;s death, resurrection, and ascension can anyone be qualified to be an apostle. In resurrection Christ breathed Himself into His disciples as the Spirit of life, and in His ascension He was poured upon them as the Spirit of power. First, He breathed Himself into them; then He was poured out upon them. As a result, on the day of Pentecost, Peter, James, John and the others all stood up as qualified apostles. They were not appointed only; they were qualified. They were qualified by being constituted with the resurrected Christ as the breath of life and with the ascended Christ as the power of authority. The ascended Head constituted the gifts in this way and gave them to His Body. The first ten verses of Ephesians 4 describe the procedure through which the ascended Head constituted the gifts and gave them to His Body. These gifts are for the perfecting of the saints.<h2 class=head2>The Apostles&#8217; Care for the Churches</h2><p>There is a different teaching regarding &#8220;autonomy&#8221; which originated with some of the Brethren teachers. The teaching of autonomy says that once the apostles establish a church and appoint the elders, the apostles should keep their hands off the church and not touch the saints. If this were the case, how could the apostles perfect the saints? This is altogether a strange teaching, a wind of teaching. How can saints be perfected if the perfecting ones stay away from them? By reading the New Testament you can see that the truth is that the apostles were always with the saints and contacting the churches. Paul established the church in Ephesus and appointed the elders there, but he never abandoned Ephesus. He visited Ephesus again and again; even once he stayed there for three years (Acts 20:31). Surely he did not keep his hands off the church. This teaching of autonomy was published in a book by one Brethren teacher, and we rejected it years ago.<p>Paul did not stay away from the churches. He not only visited the churches, but also wrote many epistles to the churches. After establishing a church with the appointment of the elders, the apostles repeatedly went back to the churches they had established. When they could not go to visit for a period of time, they cared for the churches by writing letters. They never gave up their care for the churches.<p>In Acts 20 while Paul was going back to Jerusalem the last time, he could not forget about the church in Ephesus, having labored so much on them. He was very concerned about them. Therefore, when he came to Miletus, he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church (v. 17). He reminded them, saying, &#8220;I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house&#8221; (v. 20). He also said, &#8220;I did not shrink from declaring to you all the counsel of God&#8221; (v. 27) and &#8220;for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears&#8221; (v. 31). Surely the apostle did not take his hands off the church; rather, he continued to perfect them by teaching them, admonishing them, etc., all the time. The teaching of autonomy is a wrong teaching, and we must reject it.<p>The result of the perfecting work of the apostles and the other gifts is that the perfected ones are able to do the same things that the gifted persons do. We must all be perfected to do the same work as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. After a college student learns for four years, he is able to do what his professor can do. The Apostle Paul was the first generation &#8220;professor.&#8221; Then Timothy became the second generation &#8220;professor.&#8221; Now we must also become &#8220;professors.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>NEEDING TO PRACTICE THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h2><p>We all need to enter into the practice of the God-ordained way to organically build up the church as the Body of Christ. We are short in our practice of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel with the proper preaching of the gospel by going forth to visit people in their homes. We are short in caring for the newborn believers with the proper feeding. Also, through the years we have mostly had general teaching; we have not had much teaching in the way that perfects people. We do not have the real practice that is revealed in Hebrews 10, 2 Timothy 2, and Ephesians 4. We do not have the proper group meetings. Finally, we are short of the proper prophesying in the church meetings as revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. We fall far short in all of these four steps.<p>The New Testament priesthood of the gospel, the home meetings for feeding the new believers, the perfecting of the saints for the work of the New Testament ministry, and prophesying for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ are the four steps of God&#8217;s ordained way as revealed in the Bible. We all have to humble ourselves and ask the Lord to forgive us of our negligence in the past. Through the years we have been influenced by the old traditional Christianity, and we are still under its influence. We have not properly carried out our New Testament priesthood of the gospel. A priest has to offer sacrifices. In the Old Testament, the priests offered animal sacrifices. In the New Testament, Paul offered the Gentiles as acceptable sacrifices (Rom. 15:16). Then he charged the young believers to grow that they themselves could be priests to offer themselves as living sacrifices directly to God (Rom. 12:1). In Colossians 1:28-29 Paul still had the intention to offer every man to God in maturity. As New Testament priests, it is not enough to offer our prayers and our giving of the material things; these are not the mail offerings. In the Old Testament, there were the main offerings-the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. These were the main offerings, and all of them were types of Christ. Today we are not offering bulls and goats as types of Christ; we are offering sinners who have become the members of Christ. In the Old Testament, Christ was offered in type, but today in the New Testament, the members of Christ are offered. Our prayers and material giving in themselves are not adequate. We must offer some saved living persons as Christ&#8217;s members.<p>God&#8217;s priests both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament were to offer Christ. The Old Testament priests offered Christ typified by the animal sacrifices, but today the New Testament priests offer Christ in a corporate way, an enlarged Christ. Therefore, you must go out to get sinners saved to be Christ&#8217;s members for your offering (Rom. 15:16). Otherwise, you will not have anything to offer to God as a part of the enlarged Christ.<p>If we are genuine believers, we must go visit people in their homes to help them believe and be baptized. This is to make sinners into sons of God and members of Christ. Then we must go to these new believers&#8217; homes to feed them for about two to three months. Then we must perfect them; but if we want to perfect others, we first need a deposit. If we do not have any deposit in the bank, how can we write checks? To help others, we need a good deposit. If some are willing, I would like to give them such a deposit. We all need a deposit that we can spend to help others.<h2 class=head1>A WORD OF EXHORTATION</h2><p>In this message I have been quite frank, but please understand that my frankness is my faithfulness. I have told you the truth, not only for your sakes but for the Lord&#8217;s sake. I am responsible to Him. What I have shared as the new way is the God-ordained way. I have no doubt about this. We have suffered much and are still suffering from our old way. Look at the number of saints attending the prayer meeting. It is very small. Some say, &#8220;We do not care for numbers.&#8221; Do not say this; the Lord cares for numbers. The Bible says that on the day of Pentecost three thousand were baptized (Acts 2:41), and at another time there were five thousand (4:4). Later it says that multitudes both of men and women believed (5:14), the number of disciples in Jerusalem multiplied exceedingly, and a large number of the priests obeyed the faith (6:7). This is the biblical record. If we only raised up our children and gained our close relatives, we could have at least a five percent increase yearly. This is a shame to us because we have not even gained this small percentage of increase. Barrenness is a shame. Fruitlessness is a shame. But it is better for us to be ashamed today than in that day when we stand before the judgment seat of Christ to give an account of our service. If we will receive this warning, we can avoid standing there without any fruit to show Him. We have to go out to get persons saved for the Lord. Otherwise, we have no way to meet Him.<p>If you cannot go out, you can pray for those who do. But it is altogether wrong for anyone to oppose those going out. If you oppose this, you will surely be condemned by the Lord. Who are you to oppose the Lord&#8217;s servants? Not everyone can go out, but everyone can pray. Even when you are sick in bed, you can pray for those who love the Lord and would be willing to sacrifice their faces by knocking on doors to gain people for Him. You should pray for them.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>GROUP MEETINGS FOR PERFECTING THE SAINTS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:24-25; 2 Tim. 2:2; Eph. 4:11-12</h1><p>In this message we want to have more fellowship concerning the group meetings.<h2 class=head1>THREE PORTIONS OF THE WORD SHOWING THE PURPOSE OF THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2><p>Hebrews 10:24-25, 2 Timothy 2:2, and Ephesians 4:11-12 tell us a lot. Through these three portions of the Word, we can pick up some realization of the purpose of the group meetings.<h2 class=head2>Considering One Another for Inciting to Love and Good Works</h2><p>Hebrews 10:24-25 says, &#8220;And let us consider one another for inciting to love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.&#8221; If we are going to be serious students of the Scriptures, we must analyze the language according to the grammatical construction. Many Christians are too light in considering the holy Word. Lawyers are very serious in reading the law. The nine members of the United States Supreme Court study the law by analyzing it thoroughly. We must be just as thorough in studying God&#8217;s Word.<p>In verse 24 &#8220;inciting&#8221; is a gerund, &#8220;to&#8221; is a preposition, and &#8220;love&#8221; is a noun. We consider one another for inciting to love and to good works. Verse 25 does not say, &#8220;Do not forsake.&#8221; It says, &#8220;Not forsaking.&#8221; This indicates that this verse is not a new sentence. If we are going to understand verse 25, we must go back to what it modifies. &#8220;Not forsaking&#8221; is an adverbial phrase modifying &#8220;let us consider&#8221; in verse 24. The way to consider one another is to assemble ourselves together. We must not forsake the meetings of the church.<h2 class=head2>Committing Healthy Words to Faithful Men</h2><p>Second Timothy 2:2 says, &#8220;And the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.&#8221; The things Timothy heard from Paul were healthy words (2 Tim. 1:13). Timothy was to commit these healthy words to faithful men. The word &#8220;commit&#8221; does not only mean to give something to someone but also implies much training. At Mount Sinai, God not only gave the law but also committed the law to the children of Israel. This was His training them.<h2 class=head2>The Perfecting of the Saints</h2><p>Ephesians 4:11-12 says, &#8220;And He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&#8221; The ascended Head, Christ, who is now in the heavens, gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints. This perfecting is unto something, which means that it results in something. It is unto the work of ministry, that is, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED TO RAISE UP THE NEW BELIEVERS</h2><p>We go to the sinners to bring the gospel to them and infuse them with Christ. Then these sinners become children of God and members of Christ (1 Cor. 12:12, 27; Eph. 5:30). We offer them to God, and they become the sacrifices in our priesthood (Rom. 15:16). Through our preaching, through our priesthood of the gospel, they are regenerated, converted from sinners to sons of God, and these sons of God are the many brothers of Christ. His many brothers are His many members which compose His organic Body. This is the first step of the God-ordained way.<p>We have to consider the new believers as our babes. We have to feed them. As newborn babes they desire the milk of the Word that they may grow unto salvation (1 Pet. 2:2). For their initial salvation they needed to believe. But now for their continuous salvation, they need growth. They grow by being fed. We, the New Testament priests, have to take the responsibility to go back to their homes to have home meetings with them just for feeding them, like a nursing mother feeding her little babe for a certain period of time.<p>In today&#8217;s society, mothers take care of their babies at home for a few years. Then when they are about three or four years of age, they are considered as preschool children. Right after this they will be in kindergarten. From kindergarten they progress through elementary, junior high, high school, and college. These are the stages for their perfecting. For anyone to become a proper person, there is the need of perfecting. In the United States, one cannot do much with only a high school education. He must at least have a trade. If possible, it is better for a person to get a four-year college education. Better still, he could go to graduate school for two years to get a master&#8217;s degree. Even this is not as good as studying a few more years in order to earn a Ph.D. This is considered the peak of a proper education in the United States.<p>It is necessary to be properly educated. Using the biblical terminology, this means the growing saints have to be perfected. Previously they were sinners, but through our visiting them with the gospel, they opened up their hearts and were infused with Christ through the holy Word. He got into them, and they were regenerated. Regeneration transfers sinners out of Adam and into Christ. In Adam they were fallen sinners. Now they have been transferred through regeneration into Christ. In Christ they are no longer sinners, but they are the sons of God, the children of God, the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God, Christ (Rom. 8:16, 29; Heb. 2:12).<p>These new brothers of Christ are also the members of His mystical, organic Body. Still, they are infants. They do not yet know how to eat, so we have to feed them. After we baptize them into the Triune God, we have to go back to their homes as soon as possible. If we invite them to come to a meeting, they may be unable because they are infants. We have to go to their homes to have home meetings with them. This practice is seen in the book of Acts. After the three thousand were saved on the day of Pentecost, they began to meet in their homes immediately (Acts 2:41-42, 46). The purpose of their meeting in the homes was so that they could be fed. This continued among them for a period of time (Acts 2:46-47; 5:42).<h2 class=head1>INCITING ONE ANOTHER BY SPEAKING</h2><p>In each of the local churches, there should be some advanced ones who have been perfected by the gifted persons. Now they should continue the perfecting through their fellowship with the newly saved ones. Actually, all the saints in a local church should speak a heavenly language that newborn babes can learn to speak. We all know that every child in any home picks up the language of that home.<p>When I came to this country, I noticed that different regions had different expressions. They all spoke English, but they had different ways of expressing the English language. The first time I was invited to Tyler, Texas, I heard the expression &#8220;y&#8217;all.&#8221; I did not realize what &#8220;y&#8217;all&#8221; meant. Later, I found out that it was the Texan way to say &#8220;you all.&#8221; Language is very contagious. What our babes will speak depends on what we speak.<p>How can we incite one another without speaking? If we come to the meeting and sit silently, will this be an inciting? Inciting surely requires our speaking. One may say, &#8220;Did you read the Bible this morning?&#8221; Even this much speaking will incite the hearers. They may go back home with a burden to rise up early in the morning to read the Bible. When we all speak in a meeting, we consider that a good meeting. If we do not participate in speaking in a particular meeting, we may feel that the meeting was not so good.<h2 class=head1>THE PRACTICE OF THE GROUP MEETING</h2><h2 class=head2>Speaking and Singing Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs</h2><p>Now we need to consider the way to have a group meeting. Ephesians 5:18 tells us to be filled in spirit. We believers who love the Lord Jesus, who are seeking His purpose, and who are burdened for His recovery should be persons filled in our spirit all day long. We should be filled with the Triune God, who is today the all-inclusive Spirit to us. When we are filled within, surely we will utter something out from our spirit. Ephesians 5 tells us to be filled, speaking and singing. Our speaking and singing are not in common language. We may speak or sing a psalm, which is a long piece of poetry. It may be like Psalm 119, which has one hundred seventy-six verses. There are twenty-two sections with eight verses in each section. Twenty-two is the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet. Each section of Psalm 119 is according to a letter of the Hebrew alphabet. We may speak or sing a hymn, which is somewhat shorter than a psalm, or we may speak or sing a spiritual song, which is shorter still.<p>We need to speak and sing these psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs long before coming to the meeting. Even in our home, it is very good to be speaking and singing. The husband may say, &#8220;This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior....&#8221; Then the wife may respond with, &#8220;All the day long&#8221; (see Hymns, #308). Or she may say, &#8220;I have passed the riven veil. Here the glories never fail.&#8221; Then the husband responds with, &#8220;Hallelujah! Hallelujah! I am living in the presence of the King&#8221; (see Hymns, #551). If we are filled in spirit, we will have something to utter. The small group meeting may begin at 7:30 p.m., but if a couple begins to sing at dinnertime, around 6:00 p.m., the small group meeting will have already begun. Such a meeting can continue as they drive together to the meeting with the other saints.<p>If I go to the meeting place and no one else has arrived, I should not sit quietly and wait for others to arrive. I should begin to speak, pray, or sing. At least I have an angel with me, so I am not alone. The Bible says clearly that when Peter was released from prison and went to Mary&#8217;s home, some there thought it was his angel (Acts 12:15). The Lord Jesus said that even the little ones in the kingdom have angels (Matt. 18:10). The group meeting can be started very spontaneously by speaking, praising, or singing.<h2 class=head2>Fellowship, Interceding, Mutual Care, and Shepherding</h2><p>The New Testament does not give us the details of the group meetings, but in the verses we have mentioned, there are some small &#8220;windows&#8221; into the practice of the group meetings. These will help us to see what happened in the ancient days in the group meetings. By considering the Word, we can see that there was much fellowship, interceding for one another, mutual care, and shepherding. The fellowship brings the awareness of one another&#8217;s condition and situation. This will lead into prayer for one another. This will then cause us to go to one another to render a mutual care. Through the fellowship we may find out that a brother has been in an automobile accident. This leads us to pray for him and his family. Then we may consider his financial needs and be burdened to care for his health needs. All of this should not be in a formal way. It should be a spontaneous issue of the Spirit. I hope that from now on we can have all our group meetings in such an organic way.<h2 class=head2>Teaching in Mutuality</h2><p>For the perfecting of the saints, there is the need of teaching in the group meetings, and in the group meetings all are teachers. There should not be a particular teacher. Even one who was saved two weeks ago can be a little teacher. After there has been some fellowship, interceding, mutual care, and shepherding with the exercise of the spirit in the small group meeting, a brother may suddenly ask a question. He may ask what God&#8217;s dispensing is. All the eyes may turn to the oldest one in the meeting, but it may be better for one who has been recently saved to answer the brother. This gives him the opportunity to speak. This newly saved one may say, &#8220;God&#8217;s dispensing is for Him to distribute Himself into our spirit.&#8221; Suppose such a one has been saved for only one or two months. Everyone would be encouraged by his speaking. It is much better if six or seven speak for a few minutes than if one person speaks for a longer time. This kind of teaching is rich and all-inclusive. Its many aspects are much better than a meeting where only one is speaking. If everyone speaks, all the saints will be happy, and all will learn. This is the way for all to be perfected. If there is someone there who is really high in spiritual knowledge and in the experience of life, he may give a conclusion of perhaps ten minutes.<p>If the saints will come to this kind of meeting forty-five times a year, much teaching will be gained by all. The new ones will be perfected in this way. Furthermore, because this is a group meeting, many things will be worked out. This kind of practice is the proper way to fellowship, to intercede, to give mutual care, to shepherd, and also to perfect one another by the mutual teaching.<h2 class=head2>Carrying Out the Church Service</h2><p>If we are experiencing the riches of such a meeting, we may pick up a burden to take the first step of the God-ordained way to go out to visit others. Then we must take care of the new ones whom we gain. This means the group meeting will carry on the church service. Eventually, this will make the small group meeting just a miniature of the church life.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE PRACTICE OF THE GROUP MEETING</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:24-25; 2 Tim. 2:2; Eph. 4:11-12</h1><h2 class=head1>BEGINNING THE GROUP MEETING</h2><p>In this message we will continue to fellowship concerning the practice of the group meeting. First we must consider how we should come to a group meeting and how we should enter into a group meeting. We should not come to the group meeting in a religious way. We should come in a normal and spontaneous way. We may sing if we come alone, or we may fellowship if we come with another. It is always good to come speaking, either to the Lord or to one another. If we wait until we come to the meeting to sing or speak, that is religious. We all have to learn to do this naturally and spontaneously.<p>Then when we enter the meeting, we can sing, pray, or simply praise the Lord. It is better not to ask about others, but if we are burdened, we should pray for them. We should not have anything foreign or religious in the group meeting; we must be in spirit and in life. Then when another comes in, he can simply join us in whatever we are doing. Whether we are singing or praying, he can easily join our singing or say &#8220;Amen&#8221; to our prayer. In this way the group meeting has begun. Then as others come, they may also come speaking or singing.<h2 class=head1>FELLOWSHIPPING, INTERCEDING, MUTUAL CARE, AND SHEPHERDING</h2><p>Everything must be done in a natural, or normal, way. There are many ways to practice the group meeting. You may have heard that a certain brother has just had an automobile accident. When you come to the meeting, you may say, &#8220;Brothers and sisters, Brother John has been in an automobile accident.&#8221; This is fellowship. Then some will spontaneously intercede for this brother. In the group meeting, singing, fellowship, and interceding should all come forth in a normal and spontaneous way.<p>First, the group meeting must take care of the proper fellowship. Many things should have happened since the group meeting the previous week. Therefore, when we come together, we should fellowship with each other. This kind of fellowship can spontaneously turn to intercession for one another. Then following intercession, we may have some mutual care. After praying for the brother who has had the automobile accident, someone may know if he is at home or in the hospital. Then immediately some may go to visit him. This is shepherding. Along with the shepherding, we may need to render some help. We should consider this brother&#8217;s family and the financial situation. Some sisters may want to go to visit his wife and children. All these things can be done in a very spontaneous way. In the group meeting, we have to take care of fellowship, intercession, mutual care, and shepherding.<p>By the mutual fellowship, we can know one another&#8217;s situation and consider one another. In Hebrews 10:24-25 there are three important words concerning the group meeting. Verse 24 says that we should &#8220;consider one another for inciting to love and good works.&#8221; To &#8220;consider&#8221; implies fellowship. If we do not fellowship, how can we consider one another? The next word is &#8220;inciting.&#8221; This considering should issue in our inciting one another to love and good works. Then in verse 25, we are to be those &#8220;exhorting&#8221; one another. We should not take these three words-consider, inciting, and exhorting-as a doctrine, but we should immediately practice these things in our group meetings. If we consider one another, we will surely have something to fellowship when we come together. This kind of fellowship will spontaneously usher the meeting into intercession. This prayer for one another will bring us into a mutual care for one another. Then, the mutual care leads to shepherding, and the shepherding leads to the rendering of help, whether it be spiritual, practical, or material. Through these practices, our group meeting will thoroughly cover the needs of the saints.<h2 class=head1>TEACHING IN MUTUALITY FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</h2><p>After fellowship, intercession, mutual care, and shepherding which includes the rendering of some help, we come to the main purpose of the group meeting-the perfecting of the saints. To perfect the saints is to edify, educate, and raise them up. This perfecting depends upon our teaching, but we should not teach in the way that Christianity does with one man teaching and the rest listening. That way does not develop the gifts of the saints. In the group meeting, the teaching is carried out by every member in mutuality. If we have an assigned teacher, everyone will come merely to hear this teacher&#8217;s teaching. That might be considered as a kind of group meeting, but that is the old way; that is not what the Bible reveals as a group meeting, especially Hebrews 10:24-25: &#8220;Let us consider one another for inciting to love and good works,...exhorting one another.&#8221; These verses show that a group meeting is full of mutuality. Every time we come together in the group meeting, everyone is exercised to practice. By this practice everyone is developed in their spiritual function, gift, and ability. In the group meeting, everyone is both a teacher and a learner. Everyone is both an asker and an answerer. Every answer becomes a part of the teaching in the group meeting.<p>Because the group meeting should have some very young believers, we must learn to begin our teaching with something very simple. One of the new ones may say, &#8220;I was saved one week ago and was also baptized, but I do not understand what baptism is. What is baptism?&#8221; If after such a question, everyone would turn to a certain brother for a reply, this is the way of religion. Even if the question was directed toward a particular brother, it would be altogether right for a sister to say, &#8220;I would like to tell you something concerning baptism.&#8221; This shows the livingness of the meeting.<p>In our speaking we should not be formal or religious, but come directly to the point. A sister may say, &#8220;Baptism is when we put you into the water, and the water is very significant.&#8221; This is simple and direct; this is a good beginning, but this sister or someone else should continue by sharing some of the significances of the water, using some verses from the Bible. We all must learn to function together as one teacher-a sister shares something, I may add something more, and several others would add other points. However, we should not do this in a foolish way. We must care for a proper continuation in our teaching and cover the points of the truth step by step. Eventually, after about five minutes, seven different saints may have spoken a point concerning baptism. These seven points added together should be a very good short message concerning baptism.<p>There may be a brother among us who is more experienced and knowledgeable in the truth, but he must learn not to be the only teacher in the group meeting. He should exercise to sit and listen while all the attendants function. Then at a certain point, he may feel that this subject has been covered but that there is the need of a conclusion. Then this brother may give a word as a conclusion to the seven persons&#8217; speakings in order to complete this short &#8220;message.&#8221; In this way everyone learns something in a short period of time.<p>In practicing the group meeting, although we are teaching others, we must realize that we are also learning how to teach. We should not think that our teaching is that good or complete. A new believer may say, &#8220;I was baptized last week, and I noticed that you were all calling on the Lord. And you also asked me to call on the Lord. But when I called on the Lord this week, I did not have any feeling. It seems that you have some feeling. Why don&#8217;t I have any feeling?&#8221; We may be able to respond to this question in many ways, but we must learn to answer such a question in a simple and direct way. Someone might answer saying, &#8220;Calling on the name of the Lord is just like breathing. Quite often when we breathe we don&#8217;t have any feeling, but when we breathe deeply, we do have some feeling. In the same way, the louder you call, the more feeling you will have.&#8221; With a short word of only a few sentences, we can answer such a question.<p>Many times when we try to answer a question, we give a lot of good teachings, but we do not answer it according to the asker&#8217;s thought. Therefore, while one is teaching, all the others must be learning. In this way everyone is exercised. We are all being taught, sometimes by seeing a negative example. We might realize that although someone&#8217;s answer is good, it does not fit the question. We have to learn how to answer in a very fitting way. After going home, we may consider certain questions, so that the next time such a question is raised, we can answer in a better way. Each saint may be able to attend forty-five group meetings in a year. In this time we will all learn very much and our gifts can be developed.<p>Also, in our practice of the group meetings, our teaching should not be too long. If we say a short word to hit the point, this is good enough. We should not try to answer everything in every aspect. We should try to leave more time for others to say something. Then we will learn more.<p>When someone asks a practical question, you should first give them a practical answer, and you should also try to make your answer short. Someone may ask, &#8220;You talk about worshipping God. How do you worship God?&#8221; You may say, &#8220;To worship God is not to bow down or prostrate yourself, which is what many people think. That is not the worship the Bible teaches. To worship God is simply to contact God. When you pray to God, that is your worship to Him. When you sing to God or praise God, that is worship. Even when you are sitting and considering God, that is another kind of worship.&#8221; This answer is good enough. You have spoken, and now you can leave some time for others. Then a sister may conclude the answer to this question by saying, &#8220;In order to pray to God, to praise God, to sing to God, and to call on Him, you have to exercise your spirit. Do not merely call or pray from your throat; you have to exercise your spirit. The Bible tells us in John 4:24 that God is Spirit, so those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit.&#8221; This is not too doctrinal, yet it gives him some practical instruction. If you give someone a good answer, this answer can imply very much teaching.<p>Someone may ask how to read the Bible. There are many ways to answer this question. You may teach him to pray-read the Word. This is not bad, but this is not the best answer. You must give him some direct, brief instruction. You must always consider someone&#8217;s question and not answer anyone according to your thought. You must answer a question according to the asker&#8217;s thought. He has asked how to read the Bible. You might say, &#8220;The best way to read the Bible is simply to read it. Just read it again and again.&#8221; Then you may go further to tell him that the Bible is the Word of God, so you should pray before reading it. Also, you should advise him to read through the Bible consecutively, not skipping from book to book, and that it is better to begin with the New Testament. If he takes these points and practices them, he will receive very much help. If you still have time in the group meeting, you may go a little further, but do not go too far at one time. Do not forget that he is a new learner. If you go too far, he will not be able to pick up that much.<p>Some questions raised by new ones are quite trivial. They are not related to a crucial point, or doctrine, so we should not spend much time on these matters. Some questions are related to basic problems like baptism or calling on the Lord. For these we need to spend more time to answer them properly.<p>A new one may raise a question about what it is to eat and drink God. He may be offended when we speak about this, feeling that this is disrespectful. How should you answer this one? You may immediately turn to John 6 and teach this one; however, before you refer people to the Bible, it is good to give them a very simple and practical answer. You may say, &#8220;God is our supply, but He is a Spirit. This is too mysterious. It is hard to realize how we can receive His supply. The Bible tells us that God is our food and that God is our living water. Since God is our food, we have to eat Him; since God is our living water, we have to drink Him. How can we eat and drink Him? To eat Him is to read His Word, the Bible. When we read the Bible with consideration, we take God in. In this way God becomes our food, a kind of life supply. Then when we pray to Him and call on His name, we take Him in. To take Him in is to drink Him in.&#8221; You all have to learn to give simple answers, yet this simple answer implies a lot of points. This is a good teaching.<p>This matter of eating and drinking God is a big point, so you should spend more time to cover it. However, do not bring in other related points that are not within the thought of the question. It is better to stress one point repeatedly than to bring in a distraction. The problem with this new one is that he feels that to say we eat and drink God is disrespectful. You may say, &#8220;This may sound crude, but we have to consider what God is to us. He is not merely our Lord and the object of our worship; He is life to us. The Bible even tells us that He is our food and our living water. Even the Lord Jesus says that He has come to be the heavenly bread. He Himself tells us that he who eats Him shall live because of Him. We receive food by eating it, not by worshipping the food. If we are going to worship the food, this would be foolish. The more we eat the food, the more we respect it. The Lord is our living water. The more we drink of Him, the more we respect Him. To eat Him fits His purpose regarding us. We do not despise or disregard God because He is our food and our drink. Therefore, we have to eat Him, and we have to drink Him.&#8221; This is to answer the question within the limit of the thought of the question.<p>In the entire recovery, the practice of having group meetings according to the scriptural way has just begun. In the past we did not have the organic practice of the group meetings. You all have to learn very much, therefore you should go forward gradually in the group meetings. After faithfully practicing for about one year, this will be built up as a very positive habit among us. Some in the full-time training who are learning to practice this way will bring this way to every place.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p>Question: Sometimes in a meeting a new one will ask a question that is peculiar or bring up a subject that is not so proper. How do you respond to them in a sensitive way so as not to insult or offend them?<p>Answer: This is one thing that you all have to learn. If someone brings up a subject that is not so proper, you must turn that improper matter to something good. You can turn the whole situation simply by talking about something good. You do not need to argue with them, but should try to calm down any turmoil in the meeting.<p>Question: In one group meeting, there are some who have the tendency to &#8220;keep the ball.&#8221; The meeting is like a game, and we all should be passing the &#8220;ball&#8221; to one another. But some would hoard the &#8220;ball&#8221; and ramble on and on, speaking something natural. As a result, the meeting suffers. However, they are young in the Lord and somewhat sensitive, so we are afraid we may offend them if we cut them off. How can such a situation be handled properly?<p>Answer: First of all, not many homes have this kind of problem. Some homes may be very difficult, but in general we have to believe that most of the homes will be very good. If there is such a problem in one of your group meetings, the first thing you can do is to ignore it. If you rebuke them, they will fight back. Then the meeting becomes a fighting meeting. Most in the meeting are quite good, so let the good ones &#8220;play with the ball.&#8221; Try not to let the &#8220;ball&#8221; get into the hands of these troubling ones. In this time of turmoil, there are some troubling ones in the church life, but not that many. We encourage those that want to go on to &#8220;play ball&#8221; in the proper way. Eventually, the atmosphere will change in your place.<p>No turmoil lasts forever. I have never seen a typhoon that lasted for one month. The typhoon comes; the typhoon goes. You do not need to worry. Just be at peace and be joyful. Sometimes we all have to say, &#8220;Hallelujah, no storm remains forever.&#8221; I am glad that I am not in the storm. When the storm goes away, I will stay. Do not join the storm. If you join the storm, when it is gone, you will also be gone. Whoever is in the storm will not stay.<p>My ministry has lasted through fifty-seven years, since 1932. I can testify that within these fifty-seven years I have seen many storms. Eventually, I learned that no storm ever lasts very long. Storms do not alarm me; I know them very well. It seems that each new storm makes a lot of noise, however, to me that is not noise but music. I do not need to be bothered because every storm that comes will also go away. Wherever you are, do not be bothered; the storm will pass.<p>Question: When the new ones come into the group meeting, they become so rigid and stiff. We have tried to do different things to break up this kind of atmosphere. Can you give us some fellowship concerning this situation?<p>Answer: You do not need to do anything different. If you will practice according to this way, the new ones will be released. I am not concerned for the new ones, but I am a little concerned for the old ones. When all the older saints come into the meeting, their appearance and gesture may cause the new ones to be bound. If you are bound, surely they will also be bound. In a home, all the little brothers and sisters follow the older ones. If you &#8220;play ball,&#8221; the new ones will never stay bound, but will join in with you to play. When you come to the group meeting, if you all function livingly and actively, the new ones may be subdued for half an hour, but after that they will say, &#8220;Praise the Lord!&#8221; and &#8220;Amen!&#8221; If you never say, &#8220;Amen,&#8221; they will never know to say, &#8220;Amen.&#8221; If you want them to &#8220;play ball,&#8221; you have to &#8220;play ball.&#8221; Then they will join you. A child learns to speak English simply by hearing, but the immigrants that come to this country have to learn by being taught. We are somewhat like the immigrants learning a new language. After one or two years, we will be able to speak this new language properly. This is why I have to spend so much time to turn us from the old way to the new way. For this we need much practice.<p>Question: We are caring for a meeting that has three new ones who are all at different stages of growth. Many times it seems that they all want to talk at once. Sometimes it seems that the meeting will actually divide because the young ones are talking so much. I feel that we should take the lead somewhat, but I do not know what to do. What should we do in this situation?<p>Answer: You should never try to keep a meeting that much in order or that quiet. We always expect to have an orderly meeting, but we should not have this kind of expectation. That is religious. Let the new ones feel free. If three of them would speak at the same time, you should say something to them, but you must say it in a happy and encouraging way. When these three all start to speak at the same time, you may smile and say, &#8220;I am so happy that you all will say something. What if we let this dear one speak first?&#8221; Surely the new ones will listen to one another, and the two whom you stopped will not be offended. It all depends upon how you handle the situation and how you speak to them about this kind of matter. When the first one finishes, do not ask the second one to speak right away. Instead, take the opportunity to answer some of the first one&#8217;s problems. In this way you can turn the whole meeting, and the other two will not be offended. This is another thing you must learn in handling the group meetings.<p>Question: I was in a group meeting that was very enjoyable with a lot of speaking, but then one brother began to speak for over ten minutes. He went on and on, and all the new ones became uncomfortable. One of the new ones even left the room. Eventually I said, &#8220;Brother, let&#8217;s all sing a hymn.&#8221; Is this the way to handle this kind of situation?<p>Answer: You have to be wise. At the opening of the meeting you may say, &#8220;What if each one speaks for not more than two minutes.&#8221; We can do this at the beginning of the meeting, making it a kind of regulation. Even if you do not say such a thing, if one is speaking quite long, for eight to ten minutes, you can still handle it in a loving way. You can say, &#8220;Brother, let&#8217;s give some time to the others.&#8221; Most people would listen to this. The young ones would usually take your word, but the older ones would say, &#8220;Give me another minute.&#8221; This means another ten minutes. Do not argue, and let him continue. Then after one minute, say, &#8220;Brother, one minute is over. Let&#8217;s turn the meeting to others.&#8221; Most people, even the older ones, would take this word. But sometimes the storm comes, and when it comes you have to endure it. Do not be bothered; it will pass. This is not a problem, so do not make an issue out of it. If you do, you will turn this matter into a problem, and you will suffer.<p>Question: One thing we have been practicing in our group meeting is to ask the new ones a question to draw out something from them. Is this profitable?<p>Answer: This is altogether right. If the new ones do not have any questions to ask in the group meeting, you must learn how to initiate a subject by asking a question. However, you have to ask your question just as a new one. Do not ask it as if you were the Apostle Paul. That will cause trouble. You must ask a beginning type of question just like a new one in order to stir up some answering. Then those answers will all become teachings.<p>Question: In the past you said that we should go to a meeting with a definite goal. If in a group meeting the questions being asked do not match the goal of the meeting, should we answer the questions and disregard our goal?<p>Answer: What is the goal of the group meeting? The goal of the group meeting is to perfect the saints; it is not any particular subject. You may have a burden to teach people about justification, and now they are asking you about the eating and drinking of God, but this is not your goal for the meeting. This shows that you are religious; you are too legal. The goal of the group meeting is to perfect people. As long as you can carry out this goal, that is marvelous. Whether you teach justification or you teach people why we should eat and drink God, both help to fulfill our purpose. The purpose is to perfect. Surely you have to prepare something, but you still must leave this matter wholly in the hands of the Holy Spirit. Then you can be flexible and simply follow. You must learn how to be flexible all the time. You may feel that to learn all these things is too difficult, but this is not my invention. This is what the Bible reveals.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=title>EXERCISING TO PRACTICE WHAT WE HAVE HEARD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:24-25; 2 Tim. 2:2; Eph. 4:11-12; 1 Pet. 2:9, 5</h1><p>In this series of messages on the exercise and practice of the God-ordained way, we have seen that we should carry out our Christian work according to four basic principles or in four main steps. First, we have to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel by going out to visit people in their homes for the preaching of the gospel. Then when we have gained some, we must raise them up properly through the nourishing and cherishing in the home meetings. Third, we should bring these new ones to the group meetings that they might be perfected through the mutual teaching of all the saints. Then, these perfected ones can prophesy in the church meetings for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ. We have given many messages on the first three steps, but I am concerned that many of us may not be practicing persistently according to what has been spoken.<h2 class=head1>THE GOAL OF OUR GOSPEL PREACHING</h2><p>We all have to remember that the goal of our going out to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel is not merely to &#8220;win souls.&#8221; Nearly all of the gospel preaching in Christianity today is for &#8220;soul-winning,&#8221; but in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, our goal is not merely to get sinners saved through regeneration. We desire that those who are saved through our preaching would also be sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ.<p>According to Ephesians 4:11 and 12, the ascended Head &#8220;gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&#8221; In these verses the word &#8220;unto&#8221; is used twice-&#8220;unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&#8221; Because these two phrases are in apposition, they refer to the same thing. The work of the ministry is the building up of the Body of Christ, and the building up of Christ&#8217;s Body is the goal of the Head&#8217;s giving of the gifted persons. The gospel work done by the evangelist is not merely for &#8220;soul-winning.&#8221; It is to get sinners regenerated to become sons of God and members of Christ. Then God can have many sons to build up His house, the church, and Christ can have many members to build up His Body, which is also the church. To be built up as the house of God and to be built up as the Body of Christ are the same thing. Both the house of God and the Body of Christ are organic, and the building up of something organic requires building in life. This building in life is the organic increase of the church through the increase of God in the growth of life within the members of the organic Body of Christ (Col. 2:19). Our goal in preaching the gospel is to go out to get sinners saved to make them the sons of God and the building members of Christ&#8217;s Body.<p>First Peter 2 also shows us the goal of the New Testament priesthood. Verse 5 says that we &#8220;are being built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood.&#8221; Then verse 9 says that we are a royal priesthood so that we might tell out the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. To &#8220;tell out&#8221; is to preach the gospel. This &#8220;telling out&#8221; is the preaching of the virtues of our saving God. According to these verses, the goal of the preaching of the gospel, the telling out of the virtues of our saving God, is for the building up of a holy priesthood as the house of God. This is not what we see in our present situation.<p>Our concept concerning the preaching of the gospel is very low due to our Christian tradition. We must humble ourselves, admitting to the Lord that we do not have the proper understanding. Although we have the whole Bible in our hands, much of our understanding of the Bible is traditional. When we go out to knock on people&#8217;s doors, we should not keep the old, traditional understanding concerning the goal of our gospel preaching. Our goal in preaching the gospel is to get sinners saved to be the material for the building up of the church as the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15; cf. Hag. 1) and the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23).<h2 class=head1>NEEDING TO EXERCISE DISCERNMENT IN ORDER TO REACH OUR GOAL</h2><p>The central thought of the book of Romans is that God&#8217;s salvation makes sinners His sons. Romans begins with sinners (1:18-3:20), but when we come to chapter eight, these sinners have become sons of God (8:14). Furthermore, these sons of God, the brothers of Christ, have been justified, are being sanctified, and will eventually be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God (8:29-30). The goal, the aim, of our gospel preaching is that sinners would be fully conformed to the image of Christ.<p>Based upon this goal, when we go out to visit people, we should exercise to consider people according to the discernment the Spirit gives us. It may be quite easy to get some people saved to become children of God, but for them to grow and become sons of God may not be so easy. In the Bible there is a significant difference between &#8220;children of God&#8221; and &#8220;sons of God.&#8221; John 1:12 says that those who believe in the Lord&#8217;s name have the authority to become children of God, but in Romans 8 the term &#8220;sons&#8221; indicates a more advanced stage of growth in the divine life. &#8220;Children&#8221; are those in the initial stage of regeneration in their human spirit, but &#8220;sons&#8221; are the children of God who are in the stage of the transformation of their soul. They not only have been regenerated in their spirit and are growing in life, but they also are living and walking by being led by the Spirit (8:14). To help a new one become such a son of God requires much care and labor, and some may not be able to reach this stage of development in this age. Therefore, we must be wise and not waste our time on those who are not that promising.<p>Although we all must exercise to have the Spirit&#8217;s discernment, we should not go out to consciously &#8220;measure&#8221; or categorize every new one, saying, &#8220;This one is good for the building up of the Body, but that one is not.&#8221; To practice in this way is too extreme. Actually, no one knows for certain who is good and who is bad. Still, some discernment is needed. Over twenty years ago, I went to downtown Los Angeles to a district where there were many drunkards on the streets. Some Christian missions had been located particularly in that district in order to preach the gospel to those unfortunate people and to feed them with some physical food. Surely the merciful God cares for these people and would save them, but in general, it is difficult for such persons to be that useful for the building up of the Body of Christ. They have serious problems, and with many of them, their human faculties have been damaged. We cannot reach our goal by spending much of our time to gain such persons; we will only waste our time. The Lord will give us the proper discernment, yet we should be careful not to try to &#8220;measure&#8221; the new ones too quickly.<p>Your results in going out for the gospel will depend upon your discernment. If no one lets you in, your door-knocking should go quickly. Then if a door opens, and a lady or a gentleman comes out, you should discern whether this one is worthwhile for you to spend your time. If you sense that this one may be quite good, you may spend half an hour or more with him. You should not work according to any set time limits; instead, you must always exercise your discernment and follow your inward leading. To exercise your discernment means that you are praying and seeking the Lord: &#8220;Lord, lead me to the right door and even to the right person. Lord, You are with me, and I am with You. I am going into this home with You. Is anyone here for Your purpose?&#8221; If you go out in this way, you will not be going out by yourself. You will be going out as a person who is one with the living Christ, who has the proper discernment. In this way you will always be on the alert.<p>If we are persistent in going out to preach the gospel and endeavor with long-suffering, we will never be disappointed. We should never lose heart or be subdued. Eventually, we will baptize three to make up for the week in which we gained no one. If we mean business with the Lord and have the endurance to go out faithfully and regularly, we can have three or four new ones within a month. Then we must stop knocking on new doors and go back to the ones we have already baptized to have home meetings with them to feed them. We must practice according to these principles, but in our discerning, we should not be too rigid or legal. If we are too preoccupied with evaluating the new ones, we will be distracted. The main thing is for us to mean business with the Lord and be desperate to gain sinners for His purpose.<h2 class=head1>PRACTICING THE FOUR STEPS OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h2><p>I have been speaking concerning the new way, the God-ordained way, for over five years. The brothers in Taipei have collected all my messages on the four steps of the new way and have separated them into four groups, one for each step. After seeing so many messages on each of these steps, they told me that their greatest need was not for me to give more messages, but for me to stir up some saints to practice all these things. They felt that if only a small number of saints, sixty or seventy, went out to practice, it would be enough to bring the church there into the new way. I told them that they were right. This is what we are doing in the full-time training; sixty to seventy are going out to practice all these things. This is also why, for this series of messages in the training, I have chosen the title The Exercise and Practice of the God-ordained Way. We have heard so much concerning the new way, but we may not be exercising to practice what we have heard.<p>In these training meetings I have repeatedly charged you, especially the full-time trainees, to practice in a very particular way. First you should go out to gain people, but at the same time, you have to exercise your discernment not to baptize more than you can care for. Then once you have baptized three or four, you should stop going out to gain more new ones. Instead, you should exercise to practice the second step; you must go back to have home meetings with those whom you have baptized in their homes. In these home meetings, you must feed them continuously for ten weeks, twice each week if possible. Then you can reduce your feeding from twice a week to once a week. I also told you that while you may be working on three or four that you have baptized, you may lose two or three. Then because you would not have enough under your care, you have to knock on doors to gain another two or three. In this way you will always have three or four under your care year-round.<p>After the proper feeding, you must take these new ones on further by bringing them out of their homes to meet with others. You should gather together all of the ones whom you have been feeding with other saints who live nearby to practice the group meeting. The group meeting is not only for feeding, but also for perfecting their spiritual function that they might learn to prophesy for the organic building up of the church.<p>You beget them, feed them, and perfect them with the goal that they all may grow up to prophesy. This prophesying is not to predict but to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord Himself into others for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ. These are the four steps that we have repeatedly covered for nearly three months. I have been observing the situation among us, and I realize that you are not practicing as I had expected. Very few are practicing these four steps in a definite way.<h2 class=head1>BEING DESPERATE FOR THE LORD&#8217;S INCREASE</h2><p>Through our testing and experimenting, we have found that for every twenty homes we visit, we will get one baptized. However, to have this kind of success, you have to mean business with the Lord. You must exercise your faith and even exercise your God-given authority to pray, &#8220;Lord, this is the time for our team to go out to gain people for You. All men were created by You and for You, and we have the right to gain some tonight.&#8221; To pray in this way means that you mean business with the Lord and are endeavoring to make some profit for Him. Even more, you must be desperate to gain people. In the past some teams went out for a full two hours and did not gain one. Then as they were about to quit for the day, one member said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s try one more door. If we do not find one there, we can go home.&#8221; Then in that last home they baptized two. If they had not been desperate, they would not have gone to that last home and would have missed those two. If you all mean business and are desperate with the Lord, out of every twenty homes you visit, you may baptize one.<h2 class=head1>EXERCISING TO PRACTICE WHAT WE HAVE HEARD</h2><p>Our daily business, our trade, is to tell people about Christ, baptize them, and bring them to maturity. On this earth there is such a marvelous trade, but to work in this trade successfully, we have to mean business with the Lord. When I pray, the cry in my heart is, &#8220;Lord, You must build up the practice of the new way among us. This should have been built up centuries ago, but it was not. It should have been built up fifty years ago when Brother Nee saw this matter, but it was not. Now, Lord, I have been speaking concerning Your ordained way for over five years, yet it is still not being practiced so fully and adequately.&#8221; However, this does not mean that the new way does not work. This way works, but not everyone in this kind of business will succeed. Those who are desperate will succeed. If some fail, it is because they are not desperate.<p>We must be clear that we are going out to get persons saved and regenerated to be sons of God and members of the Body of Christ. After baptizing some, we have to feed them. All year long we should have two or three newly baptized ones under our care. If we do this faithfully, in one year we will surely gain one or two as remaining fruit. If each of us can gain one or two as remaining fruit in one year, that would be wonderful. Regardless of how much fruit we bear, we must keep going out to labor. If we go out continuously and faithfully for the next thirty years, eventually each one of us could gain fifty as remaining fruit. Then we can go with these fifty fruit to see the Lord and say, &#8220;Lord, here are my fruit.&#8221; It would be very good if out of one hundred meeting together, fifty would go out to practice the priesthood of the gospel. If not half, at least we would expect one-third to go out. If thirty saints out of one hundred would do this, it is possible for the church to increase fifty percent in one year.<p>I recently had a long talk with one of the leading brothers from Taipei. He meets together regularly with a group of saints. Last February there were only twenty in this group, but by August it had grown to over fifty; it had more than doubled. By November this group had increased to over eighty. In only nine months, that group has increased more than fourfold. Then he told me the secret. He said, &#8220;The secret is to simply go out to practice the four steps of the God-ordained way.&#8221; He told me that practicing the new way really works, especially for the new ones. This brother said that many of those brought in were brought in through the work of the new ones themselves. In Taiwan it is possible to find many who have never been in Christianity and who have never learned anything about Christianity. He said that working with this kind of new one for only one hour can accomplish much, much more than working for many hours with one who has already been a Christian for a few years. Someone who has been a Christian for some years can become an &#8220;old Christian.&#8221; They can become the hardest ones for the Lord to work on.<p>I want to impress us and encourage us to practice the definite steps of the new way. We should not work in a general way. We may not be so desperate in practicing these definite steps. We may not have a definite work. This leading brother from Taipei was desperate to have morning watch with the new ones every day. Through this, every new one, within one or two days after being baptized, had a good morning revival and became fully revived.<p>We may do many good works, but we may not have a goal. This leading brother from Taipei does not care for other things; he only cares for these few things-to beget new ones, to feed them, to stir them up, and to revive them. If a school teacher receives a message that his friend is seriously sick, does he stop teaching and go to visit his friend? If he leaves for two weeks, he will lose his job. Even a mother cannot forsake her responsibilities in the household to go to care for someone else. She has a duty to stay home to prepare food and care for her family&#8217;s needs. In the same way, we must be occupied with our priestly duty in the gospel. We need to realize our grave responsibility to gain sinners for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.<p>After you baptize two or three, you should stop baptizing and endeavor to feed them. You have begotten some children, and now these babes are under your care. You have to feed them. If you do not feed them, you are neglecting your duty. There is no excuse for leaving your babes without any care. Your primary responsibility is to take care of your babes. At least you should be able to complete these first three steps with the new ones-begetting, feeding, and perfecting. Then they will all learn to meet, to pray, to function, and to prophesy.<p>I am very burdened to strongly encourage you to exercise and practice what you have already heard. This is the present need, yet this is very difficult for us. All of us, including me, are &#8220;old-timers.&#8221; We have a strong Christian background with many old things. To get rid of this is not easy. Therefore, there is the need for some of the local saints to pick up the burden and be desperate to exercise to practice these steps of the God-ordained way. They must go out regularly and persistently, once every week, with a definite goal each time. They must practice the steps of the new way-begetting, feeding, perfecting, and prophesying-in a definite way. They should always have two or three under their constant care.<p>In this way some of the local saints will be able to raise up some new churches. Some saints can go to a nearby city to labor, and I hope that the elders will take the lead to send them out in this way. After half a year there can be little churches of about fifteen saints in some surrounding cities. They will produce elders from among themselves.<p>In the city of Monterey Park, California, about forty began to meet together in April of 1988. Today, after only one and a half years, they have grown to over one hundred. This small church was raised up, nourished, built, and established particularly according to the God-ordained way. In San Gabriel, California, about fourteen began to meet together at about the same time that those in Monterey Park began. Now, after one and a half years, they have close to sixty in their meetings. There is also another church in that area-Hacienda Heights. They have been meeting there for about two years. They began with a few saints, and now they have one hundred fifty. These churches were born through much travail. They have grown and become healthy by practicing the new way.<p>Luke 19 and Matthew 25 show that the Lord has given us some capital and that we have been charged to do business. He demands a profit from His investment. In Matthew 24 each of us is the servant whom the Lord has set over His household. When He returns, we will receive either a reward or a punishment. In Matthew 25 we are His slaves, and He wants us to do business for Him. When He comes back, He will demand that we give Him an account of our business, and we will either receive a reward or a punishment. This is very serious. If I did not speak this to you, I would not be faithful to the Lord or to you. I only care for the burden I have received from the Lord. I believe that some faithful saints will carry out God&#8217;s ordained way on the earth.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE PRACTICE OF THE GROUP MEETINGS</h1><h2 class=head1>MEETING IN THE PREACHING, PRAISING, REJOICING, CHRIST-SPEAKING SPIRIT</h2><p>When we come together in any kind of meeting, we must exercise to keep ourselves away from anything of religion. Something of the influence of religion can be seen in the way we come to the meetings. Some saints are very talkative everywhere else and at any other time except at the time of the meeting and in the meeting hall. This is the result of the influence of religion. Outside of the meeting hall, they may be very active and talkative, but as soon as they get inside, they become very quiet and &#8220;reverent,&#8221; walking quietly and maintaining an attitude and posture of attending a religious activity. This kind of conduct is altogether religious and must be completely abandoned. We must learn to come to the meetings in a very general and natural way. We should only consider the meeting hall as a convenient place to come together, not as a &#8220;sanctuary.&#8221;<p>In our daily life, we must be people who are full of Christ and filled with the fullness of God in our spirit, praising, rejoicing, and speaking of Christ all day long. Then, we should come to the meetings as we are in our daily life-full of Christ, full of joy, and full of the Spirit. If we are not such persons, we are failures. But if we are a praising, singing, rejoicing, and Christ-speaking people, we will come to the meetings in this way.<p>The reason that it is hard for us to practice the praising, singing, rejoicing, and speaking of Christ is because religion has been constituted into our being. As Christians, whenever we come to a meeting, we act in a religious way, because we have been influenced by the religious things of our background. This religious influence kills our preaching and singing spirit. The Christ-speaking spirit is also killed. The concept of religion has wrapped up our entire being and has become a part of our being. It seems that even before we became Christians, the concept of religion was there. We must exercise to reject anything of religion in our meetings.<h2 class=head1>MEETING IN THE TRIUNE GOD OUTSIDE OF RELIGION</h2><p>The intrinsic things of the church, such as the intrinsic essence, the intrinsic growth, the intrinsic building up, and the intrinsic fellowship, are all just the processed and dispensing Triune God Himself in Christ, His embodiment, being realized by us. These intrinsic things stand in opposition to our disposition and character. We usually come to the meetings in our disposition and character and behave a certain way according to our disposition and character. Usually, we do not come to the meetings in our spirit, in Christ, in our singing spirit, or in a praising attitude. But when we go to the group meetings in the preaching, shouting, singing, and Christ-speaking spirit, we are completely outside of our disposition and character. Thus, when we attend the group meetings in this way, we are far away from religion.<h2 class=head1>LEARNING TO MEET BY DENYING OURSELVES</h2><p>Our disposition and character hinder us from practicing the proper Christian meeting; therefore, we must learn to deny our disposition and character. According to the teaching of the New Testament, we must deny ourselves (Matt. 16:24), our soul-life (16:26; Luke 9:24). To deny ourselves is to deny our disposition, since the self is in our disposition. The soul-life is the person, and the being of the person is the disposition. The expression of the person, the self, is the character. We sometimes say that someone is &#8220;a real character.&#8221; This means that a certain person expresses himself in a particular way which distinguishes him from everyone else.<p>As Christians we should be people who are always against our disposition and against our character. To be against our disposition and our character is to deny ourselves. We must learn to always live, behave, and have our being against our disposition. To be against our disposition is to deny ourselves. Without being against our disposition, we cannot have proper group meetings. If we are not against our disposition and character, we will go to the meetings religiously, enter the meetings religiously, sit down religiously, and conduct ourselves in the meetings religiously. The entire activity of the meetings will altogether be a matter of religion, because religion always matches our disposition and character. If we meet according to religion, disposition, and character, there will be no Spirit, no Christ, no life, and no speaking of Christ. This is the situation of Christianity today. Although many dear saints love the Lord very much, they do not meet with the Spirit or with Christ, but with religion and their disposition.<p>We must learn to be against our disposition and character. Whether or not we use our time in a proper way exposes our disposition and character. As full-timers it is very easy not to budget our time wisely. When we were employed in a business, there was always a certain schedule which served to budget our time. As employees, you could not go in to work whenever you felt like it. If you did this for even a short time, you might receive a termination slip and you would be fired. As full-timers, it may seem that you do not have a boss since you have dropped your job. You may say that the Lord is your boss, but actually, you are your boss. Today, you may go to work on time, but tomorrow, if you feel somewhat tired, you may go to work a little later. Who is your boss? Jesus Christ or yourself? Actually, you are the boss. I know that it is easy to spoil you as full-time trainees, because I have been in this line for many years, and I have seen many full-timers. We may say that we live, walk, and have our being in the name of the Lord. But actually we often live, walk, and have our being completely according to our disposition.<p>One time I asked one of the sisters whether or not she functioned in the meetings she attended. She responded by saying, &#8220;Oh, Brother Lee, you know that by birth I am not a person who can speak anything in a meeting. I was born quiet, and I am not an outspoken person.&#8221; When I received such a response, I said, &#8220;This is just your disposition.&#8221; To use the word disposition is pleasant, but to use the word self is not so pleasant. Actually, the disposition and the self are very close. To say that we are a certain way by birth seems to be a good excuse, but the Bible tells us that whenever we come together, we should have something, such as a psalm or song for speaking as well as for singing. The Lord is not happy for us to sit in a meeting according to the way we were born. Sometimes the older sisters have said to me, &#8220;Brother Lee, we are over seventy years of age. For the young ones to shout is okay, but we older ones find it difficult to do the same thing.&#8221; Their disposition became their argument against functioning as well as a vindication of themselves. We must be against our disposition. A good practice to help overcome our silent disposition in the meetings is to praise the Lord by ourselves many times throughout the day but not in a way that would disturb or threaten others. If we live a life of praising the Lord, when we come to the meetings, we will be beside ourselves with the enjoyment of the Lord. This enjoyment of Christ will encourage us to praise the Lord and shout, &#8220;Amen,&#8221; when we come together with the saints in the meetings.<p>We are familiar with the traditional way of meeting in Christianity. The attendants come in and sit down quietly, waiting for the pastor to lead the singing, to give a message himself, or to introduce a guest speaker. Only one speaks, and the others simply listen. This kind of meeting annuls the function of the attendants. But another way to meet is by each one coming into the meeting praising the Lord, singing, or saying, &#8220;Amen&#8221; as they enter. This meeting begins on the way to the meeting place. It bears the testimony of Christ and makes the Lord very happy.<h2 class=head1>THE SECTIONS OF THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2><h2 class=head2>Prayer and Fellowship</h2><p>The first part of the group meeting is primarily a time of singing, praising, and praying. This spontaneously brings us into fellowship. For example, one brother may pray for another brother who is sick and who has lost his job. Such prayer opens a window for the group to fellowship concerning the sick brother. Perhaps, immediately after the prayer, another brother would ask, &#8220;Brother, could you please tell us what kind of occupation this brother has?&#8221; The brother may respond by saying, &#8220;He came from China to this country two years ago and has been working in a certain firm as a bookkeeper.&#8221; This little conversation is an example of fellowship.<h2 class=head2>Intercession and Practical Care</h2><p>Following such fellowship comes intercession. Some of the brothers in the group may begin to pray for the brother to get a job. Then the following week, one of the brothers may find out that there is an opening for bookkeepers in his company. He may then go to the group meeting and ask for a resum&#233; that he could present to his company. This is an example of practical care.<h2 class=head2>Shepherding</h2><p>After fellowship, intercession, and practical care, shepherding follows. Some in the group may find out that one of the saints is sick at home or in the hospital. After some fellowship, two of the group may decide to go to visit the sick brother or sister. This is shepherding visitation. Spontaneously, all the things which are so necessary for taking care of the saints-fellowship, intercession, proper care, and shepherding-could be and should be done in every group meeting.<h2 class=head1>PRACTICAL GROUP MEETINGS VERSUS RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY</h2><p>The matters of fellowship, intercession, practical care, and shepherding can easily be carried out in the group meetings. But because we are short of the group meetings, we are also very short of these things in the church life. We come together, but our coming together is not very practical. We perform as actors in a religious service, but do not care for the practical matters. We call hymns, but they have little to do with anything of fellowship or intercession. We may speak things which have little to do with practical care, or we may propose things which have little to do with shepherding. We talk a great deal, but there is very little fellowship, intercession, practical care, or shepherding. The result is that we waste our time and do very little to take care of the saints, to perfect them, or to build them up. Often we do a lot of religious things which have nothing to do with the actual, practical situation of the saints. For this reason, I feel burdened to fight against the oldness, the religious concepts, and the dispositions of the saints, including my own.<h2 class=head1>THE FUNCTION OF THE GROUP MEETINGS IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>The church life is on a high level whenever the group meetings are on a high level. Therefore, the group meetings are very crucial and we must pay very close attention to the group meetings. If the group meetings are loose, the church is also loose. The church life is rescued from looseness in the group meetings. Through the group meetings, the saints, not the elders or co-workers, take care of the fellowship, the intercession, the practical care, and the shepherding. In the group meetings, all of these things can be done thoroughly. But without the group meetings, the fellowship, the intercession, the practical care, and the shepherding could not be done so thoroughly. Even five brothers functioning as elders would not be able to thoroughly take care of a church of two hundred saints without the group meetings. But a group of eight to twelve saints can take care of one another in a very thorough way. Because we have not practiced the group meetings over the past years, it is possible to be in a locality with a number of saints for years and not know the names of some of the saints. But if a small number of saints come together week after week in the group meetings, eventually, these saints will not only know each others&#8217; names, but they will also know the inmost being and disposition of each other.<p>Because of the intimate nature of the group meetings, you may discover that a brother who seemed to be very spiritual and heavenly in the larger meetings is really not very spiritual at all. This discovery should cause you to pray and intercede for the brother, not to criticize him. After exercising to intercede on behalf of the brother, you may be led of the Lord to shepherd and care for the brother in a practical way.<p>The practice of the church life will become very thorough and sufficient in meeting all the needs of the saints through the group meetings. Today there is a lack among us because the group meetings have been neglected. A church may have one hundred saints, but due to the absence of the group meetings, there is very little shepherding, practical care, or particular intercession for the saints. Intercession is regularly needed in the church life. To intercede is more particular than prayer. When we pray for the saints in a common way, this is prayer in a general sense. But when we pray in a specific way by mentioning certain cases and persons by name, this is intercession.<p>When the church practices the group meetings in a thorough way, all of the saints will be in a specific group, and the whole church will go on primarily by and in the group meetings. The elders of the church should oversee the group meetings in order to correct, improve, uplift, enrich, and enliven them when needed. When any of the group meetings are dead or short of life, the elders should exercise to enliven these group meetings.<h2 class=head1>PERFECTING ONE ANOTHER IN THE GROUP MEETINGS BY MUTUAL TEACHING</h2><p>Perfecting by teaching comes after shepherding. We may hold the religious concept that the teaching in the group meetings must be done by a brother who is able to teach and who has been appointed by the church to teach. That kind of meeting may be called a Bible study. But if you carefully study the New Testament, you cannot find such a practice in the meetings of the church. According to Hebrews 10:24-25, the teaching was carried out in a mutual way. These verses contain three very crucial words, &#8220;consider,&#8221; &#8220;incite,&#8221; and &#8220;exhort.&#8221; To consider one another may not involve much teaching, but to incite surely does. To incite someone, you have to instruct and teach. Exhortation involves a lot of teaching. Without teaching, how could you exhort others? Both to incite and to exhort imply teaching. This teaching is done by many persons mutually, not by only one person. There should not be one person who only teaches and a group of saints who only are taught. The teaching should be done by all the saints. We incite one another, and we exhort one another. You exhort me and I exhort you; you learn and I also learn. When one of the group members teaches or exhorts another one in the group meeting, the other members of the group are also taught because they hear the teaching or exhortation. This is mutual teaching.<p>Most of us only know how to practice teaching in the way of religion with a learned and appointed one teaching all the others in the group. Because we may think that we have no responsibility to teach and that our only responsibility is to be taught, we may simply delegate all the teaching in the group meeting to the learned ones. This thought may be very common even among us, but it is altogether wrong. This concept is not the concept revealed in Hebrews 10:24-25. According to this portion of the Word, we must incite and exhort one another mutually. Therefore, we must drop the old concept and the old way of practice.<p>Forty years ago in Taiwan we practiced meeting in smaller groups. So, we cannot say that to meet in smaller groups is really new among us. But the way to practice these group meetings as I am now presenting it is completely new. On one hand, the group meetings are new, and on the other hand, they are ancient. Two thousand years ago, the things concerning how to meet were recorded in the Bible in Hebrews 10:24-25. To consider one another, to incite one another, and to exhort one another are three things which show that the church life is very mutual. It is a life of mutual considering, mutual inciting, and mutual exhorting.<h2 class=head1>AN EXAMPLE OF MUTUAL TEACHING</h2><p>Our practice of the church life through the past years has not included the saints coming together to exhort and teach one another in a mutual way. To testify to one another is one thing, but to teach and exhort one another is a completely different thing. In a group meeting, one brother may ask what it means to be watchful. In such a group meeting, everybody can teach the brother who asked the question with some points. All the saints in this group meeting should try to answer the question concerning watchfulness. As these saints learn more, their teaching will be uplifted more and more.<p>In the group meeting, everyone speaks and everyone teaches. The group meeting affords the opportunity for everyone to learn to speak and to teach. In the old way of meeting, many saints diligently attended the meetings, yet the level of their spiritual education remained at the elementary level. The reason for this is twofold: first, the teaching was not consecutive, proper, or adequate, and second, most of the saints were given very little opportunity to say anything. According to the New Testament, we all have certain gifts, capacities, abilities, and functions (Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 12:4). But the old way of meeting annulled these gifts, capacities, abilities, and functions. A newborn baby has the gift of speech by birth. After a certain number of months, the mother will begin to hear intelligible words from the mouth of her child. Given the opportunity to develop, the speaking ability will be manifested in the young child. No mother would say to her child, &#8220;Don&#8217;t speak. Don&#8217;t walk. Don&#8217;t do any of these things because you don&#8217;t know how to do them. I know how to do them, so I will do them for you.&#8221; If the mother were to do this, her child would not be able to speak or walk after a period of time, because she never gave the child an opportunity to practice speaking or walking. A mother repeatedly encourages her child to say words such as &#8220;ma&#8221; or &#8220;pa.&#8221; Eventually, after a period of time, the child will begin to speak these words, and the parents of the child will be very excited.<p>We all should speak for the Lord in the meetings. Today, you may still not be able to speak very much in the meetings, but this does not mean that you do not have the capacity to speak. It simply means that your growth has not yet come up to this level. You still need to grow more. My burden is to feed you so that you will grow. While I am feeding you, I am also encouraging you to take every opportunity to practice speaking. After a certain time of meeting in the group meetings, you will be able to speak for the Lord in the way of prophesying. According to the New Testament, the highest function in the church meetings is to prophesy (1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12). To prophesy is not just to teach, to exhort, or to give a testimony. To prophesy is to speak forth the Lord, to minister the living Christ with all His riches into people.<h2 class=head1>EVERYONE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEACH IN THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2><p>In the group meetings, everyone has equal opportunity and equal time to teach. Even those who are very young in the Lord can speak something as a teaching. This kind of exercise will improve our ability to teach, and it will also bring out the riches of Christ within each brother or sister. One person teaching is not as rich as everyone teaching. In a group meeting, a sister who was saved three months ago may ask a question concerning abiding in the vine. She may ask, &#8220;I do not know what it is to abide in the vine. What is the vine, and how do you abide in the vine?&#8221; Her question opens the door for everyone in the group to say something. Another young sister in the group may say that, although she does not know very much about this subject, she does know that the vine is the Lord Jesus according to John 15:1. This little word is very good, because this sister has given a little teaching. Another sister who knows a little more may add to the first sister&#8217;s answer by saying that to abide in the vine is to abide in the Lord Jesus. These two answers put together form a very good teaching concerning abiding in the vine. Another brother who is quite learned and experienced may say that the word &#8220;abide&#8221; means to remain. He may also say that to abide in the vine means to remain in the Lord Jesus. Another brother sitting next to the first brother may then say that our need is to always stay with the Lord Jesus. Four brothers and sisters have spoken a few short sentences, but when these sentences are added together, they constitute a good message. This kind of teaching is often much better than what you can receive in many Christian books. The teaching of these four brothers and sisters is good, but it may still need to be strengthened, so another brother may add something. He may say that Christ today is in our spirit, so to abide in Christ is to stay in our spirit.<p>After listening to the speaking of the saints, some of the young ones may still not be satisfied with the saints&#8217; answers. These young ones may then seek out some of our publications in order to find out what others in the recovery have said concerning abiding in the vine. This is very good. In the past sixty-seven years, a number of books have been published on many different items of the truth. There is a long history among us of understanding the truths, and these truths have been printed. So, today we have printed many books dealing with various subjects for the young believers to get into and to uplift their realization concerning many different truths.<p>The group meeting will not only open the way for all to teach and all to learn, it will also help the seeking ones to seek the truth in a deeper way. Whenever we come together as a group, we must practice not to do anything according to religion. Rather, we should practice to come together in a living way, rejoicing, singing, and praying. Then as we fellowship with one another, intercession will issue forth spontaneously. The proper care for one another, as well as shepherding, should then be exercised. Ultimately, questions will be raised for all the members of the group to answer. This gives the way for everyone to teach.<h2 class=head1>LEADING THE NEW ONES TO ENTER INTO EACH ITEM OF THE NEW WAY</h2><p>All those in the group meetings, including the new ones, should be helped to practice all of the items of the new way in the church life. The first item of the new way is the priesthood of the gospel, the preaching of the gospel by visiting others. In the group meeting, we must teach the younger ones to preach the gospel. One of the sisters in one of the group meetings may ask if each of the saints in the group is participating in going out to visit people by knocking on their doors. Out of a group of fifteen members, seven new ones may not have entered into this kind of exercise. Thus, there is the need to say something to teach them and to stir them up to participate in the gospel preaching. Following this, there is the need to give them some instructions in preaching the gospel and to help them to form visiting teams to go out.<p>In another group meeting, another brother or sister may say, &#8220;It is very good that everyone in our group meeting is going out to get people saved and baptized. But I would like to know if all of us are practicing to feed these new believers in the home meetings.&#8221; This question deals with the second item of the new way, that is, nourishing new believers in the home meetings. It may be that ten out of fifteen do not have the practice of caring for the new ones in home meetings. This indicates that there is a need to promote and stir up the saints for the home meetings. Then in subsequent group meetings, the third step of helping the young believers to group together with others needs to be touched. Though some of the saints in the group are already meeting with new ones in their homes, there is still the need to bring these new ones into the group meeting with the other saints. Once these new ones are brought into the group meeting, this may increase the size of the group from fifteen to twenty-five. With such a large number, there is the need to subdivide into two groups.<h2 class=head1>THE GROUP MEETINGS BEING A MINIATURE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>Through this kind of exercise-from preaching the gospel by knocking on doors to home meetings with the new ones to group meetings, we all learn how to build up a group meeting. This is for the perfecting of the saints. In a sense, the group meeting is a miniature of the church life. The real and practical church life is in the group meetings. Whether the church life is strong or weak depends upon the strength of the group meetings. Therefore, the group meetings are very important. If the church is still in the stage of one man speaking and all the rest listening, the church is not very healthy. Without the group meetings, the church will be weak. The attendance in the Lord&#8217;s Day morning meeting and the messages may be good, but without the group meetings, the church is really not very healthy. The church is the healthiest and strongest when all the saints in the church are in group meetings. When all are in the group meetings as I have described, everyone will be practicing the church life adequately and thoroughly.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>THE GROUP MEETING IN THE NEW WAY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:24-25; 2 Tim. 2:2; Eph. 4:11-12</h1><p>In this message we will continue to fellowship concerning the third main step of the God-ordained way-the group meeting. In previous messages we have covered the basic elements of such a meeting. When we come together in a group meeting, we must have the mutual fellowship, intercession, care, and shepherding. After this, there must be the mutual teaching by all the saints. This mutual teaching is the crucial part of the group meeting because, through it, the saints will gradually be perfected week after week. As they are being perfected, they will spontaneously learn to speak the word of the Lord, that is, they will learn to prophesy.<h2 class=head1>THE GROUP MEETING IN THE NEW WAY</h2><p>Although some among us have been meeting in smaller groups for the past three or four years, for the most part, those meetings were still in the old way. We may pick up all the items of the new way and yet practice them in the old way. Our group meeting may have fellowship, intercession, mutual care, shepherding, and teaching, yet still be according to the old way. In the new way, when we come to the group meeting, we must be those who are living a life of morning revival and daily victory. If we are not revived by the Lord in the morning and are defeated by the enemy in our daily life, how can we be victorious and living when we come to the group meeting? If everyone comes to the group meeting in a defeated condition, that meeting will surely be empty.<p>If we mean business with the Lord to practice the group meeting in the new way, we must be revived, victorious, and overcoming people. Then our spirit will be living and uplifted, and our person will be altogether in the spirit. Then when we come to the group meeting, we will come in the spirit, praying, praising, and shouting, &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221; Even before we enter the meeting place, the meeting will have already started in our home or on our way to the meeting.<p>The group meeting should be something real in the spirit. It should not be anything as a performance. Therefore, we must be revived, victorious, and living in our spirit. A proper Christian is a very peculiar person, even a &#8220;crazy&#8221; person. When others laugh, they would not laugh; when others weep, they would not weep. The New Testament, based upon the Old Testament (Deut. 7:6; 14:2; 26:18), calls us the peculiar possession of God (Titus 2:14; 1 Pet. 2:9). To be a Christian is to be something peculiar. We should not be this kind of person through mere performance. We are peculiar, even crazy, because we are saturated with the Triune God. This causes us to be crazy with joy. We are so happy, joyful, and rejoicing because the Triune God is saturating us with Himself. If we are such persons in reality, nothing will bother us. Regardless of what our outward environment or situation may be, we will be at peace and will always be eager to attend the meetings.<p>The old way is cold, dumb, dead, and deadening. In the old way, we may have come to the meetings deadened within ourselves and deadening to others. But the new way is living, revived, overcoming, shouting, and rejoicing. We cannot learn to be crazy in this way; it must be the issue of our living. Then when we come together in the group meetings, we are living, fresh, and refreshing. We come singing, praying, shouting, and praising; we are crazy in the most positive sense. Then, spontaneously, there will be the proper fellowship with intercession, mutual care, and shepherding. Then the mutual teaching will come forth from all the saints through the mutual answering of one another&#8217;s questions.<p>Because we are so living, we will have many good questions. Then, all can and must answer. Do not think that some brothers are so mature and knowledgeable that no one can teach them. This kind of thought is wrong. Quite often, I have received much teaching from the younger ones. If we mean business with the Lord to follow the Bible, we must practice this way. Hebrews 10:24-25 says that we should not forsake our own assembling together. We should have our own meetings, and they should be full of mutuality. We must consider one another, incite one another, exhort one another, and teach one another.<p>The perfecting work in the group meeting is carried out mainly through the mutual answering of one another&#8217;s questions. Every member can answer according to his capacity, and every member can be taught. Within God&#8217;s people there are many riches. However, many times when we go to a group meeting, we do not speak. Although we are rich, it seems that when we come together, many of us leave our riches at home and appear to have nothing. This is due to the marriage between our disposition and religious tradition. To have a proper group meeting, we must dissolve this marriage. The Lord wants us to meet in the group meetings so that we can release what is within us. Some young ones may answer in a way that is not so right, yet that is still a kind of teaching that can help others. No matter who we are or how young we are in the Lord, we all can and must speak something in the group meeting.<p>Sometimes an interesting question can open the way for the saints to pour out the riches that are within them. Therefore, you all must learn how to ask a proper question in order to help the meeting. If no one else asks a question, this puts the responsibility upon your own shoulders. You must initiate the mutual teaching by asking a question. You might ask, &#8220;Why does the Bible tell us that Christ became the life-giving Spirit?&#8221; There are many answers to such a question, and every believer, old or young, can give an answer.<p>Every one of us should feel obligated to speak in the group meeting. Such a meeting always affords us the time and the opportunity to pour out the riches we have within us. By this we both teach one another and are taught by one another. Sometimes we are taught unconsciously. By simply listening in the group meetings week after week, we receive the riches from the saints. Whenever we open our mouth and exercise our spirit to say something, the Holy Spirit within us will be one with our spirit. Sometimes it seems that we are speaking something out of ourselves, but actually it is something out of the Holy Spirit. We must learn to do this; then we can have a proper group meeting.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED FOR LEADERSHIP NOT LEADERS</h2><p>The most difficult aspect of the group meeting is the matter of leadership. We do not need any leader in the group meeting, but there is the need for leadership. We all must learn to take care of the meeting yet not have the thought that we are leaders. In the home the mother does not consider herself as a leader, yet she realizes that she needs to take care of the family. When the mother is gone, the older children spontaneously pick up the responsibility to take care of the family. When one of us goes to a group meeting, he should not consider himself as a leader; he should not consider himself as being better than others. However, he must feel that he has the responsibility to take care of that meeting.<p>Someone may ask, &#8220;Suppose fifteen come together, and each one has the feeling that he has to take care of that meeting. Wouldn&#8217;t there be too many leaders?&#8221; Not at all. I would like to see fifteen come together and there be fifteen leaders. This would be marvelous! This means that every saint is bearing the responsibility for that meeting. They are not only functioning in the meeting but also bearing the meeting. How much someone can do in bearing a meeting depends upon the capacity that the Lord has measured to him, but as long as he has such a burden, he will surely do his best to serve the meeting. Whatever he has and whatever he can do according to his capacity will be poured out. Then the meeting will be rich.<p>Do not say to yourself, &#8220;I am not the one responsible for this meeting. It is not up to me to make this a good meeting, and if it is a bad meeting, it is not my fault.&#8221; This kind of attitude is wrong. When you come to any Christian meeting, you must have the feeling, the realization, that you must take care of the meeting. This is the best aspect of the new way. The new way stirs up the believers to care for God&#8217;s interest. In the new way, every saint has the feeling, the realization, that he is responsible for the meeting.<p>Many things can be done when there is a &#8220;gap,&#8221; or silence, in the meeting. What you can do depends upon your capacity. Whether your capacity is large or small does not matter. A new one may ask, &#8220;I have heard you talk about God&#8217;s economy. What do you mean by this?&#8221; This is actually a very deep question, yet a young one can also give a very good answer. He may say, &#8220;God&#8217;s economy is just to make sinners His children.&#8221; This is a good teaching out of the mouth of one that has been saved about four weeks. He was a sinner, and He became one of God&#8217;s children. According to his knowledge, God&#8217;s economy is simply to make sinners His children. This is such a simple answer, yet many may learn from it.<p>Regardless of my spiritual maturity, as long as I do not hold back what God has given me to speak, I have fulfilled my responsibility, and the meeting will be enriched. If every saint has this realization, all the riches within them will be ministered to the other members of the Lord&#8217;s Body according to each saint&#8217;s capacity.<h2 class=head1>SETTING UP A GROUP MEETING</h2><p>We all must endeavor to start a group meeting. However, to form a group meeting is not easy. You probably will not succeed on your first attempt. You have to try again and again. You have to collect all the new ones who are under your care, and if you do not have that many, you can work together with other teams. Three teams may need to gather all their new ones together in one group meeting.<p>Once you all come together, you have to help the new ones by bringing them into the proper practice of the group meeting. You must be their &#8220;coach&#8221; because they are all new learners. You can help them by proposing things to them or by asking them questions. You may ask, &#8220;Brothers, what troubles have you had in these past few days?&#8221; This will help them learn how to fellowship, how to open up to one another. You may say, &#8220;In today&#8217;s society no one wants others to know his problems, but as Christians we are &#8216;no longer strangers and sojourners, but...members of the household of God&#8217; (Eph. 2:19). We are brothers and sisters in Christ; therefore, we like to open ourselves to the other members of our family. It is good for us to open up to let others know about our situation.&#8221; If one of the brothers opens and lets you know about a problem, what should you do? It may be better if you do not take the lead to pray for him. Instead, you may ask the others, &#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; Then, someone may say, &#8220;Well, we have to help him.&#8221; You may say, &#8220;That is very good.&#8221; Then another may say, &#8220;Sisters, what do you feel that we should do?&#8221; A sister may answer, &#8220;We should pray for this brother.&#8221; Another will agree, &#8220;That&#8217;s right. We should pray for him, and we should pray for each other.&#8221; This brings them spontaneously into the matter of intercession.<p>After praying, we may be able to say something in order to usher them into the matter of the mutual care. If the brother has some sickness, you may say, &#8220;Brother, can we do anything to help you? Can we help you go see a doctor or help in some other way? Maybe you have some things you need to do but you need some help. We would like to help you.&#8221; This is to have the mutual care. This kind of care shows our genuine love to one another. Regardless of their situation, love always touches people; love always builds people up. If we only stress something so high like &#8220;the two great mysteries in God&#8217;s economy,&#8221; many people may not be able to identify with something so high. They may think, &#8220;These people must be angels. I cannot be like that.&#8221; However, if you simply come to them with tender, loving, mutual care, everyone will be deeply touched.<p>However, we must be balanced. If we only practice the mutual care, we will not have a high experience of Christ. We must stress the great mysteries in the Bible, yet we must practice the mutual care with tenderness and love toward one another. This will keep people, and this will build people up. In the past we have been short of this, because to exercise this kind of mutual care without meeting in small groups is very hard.<p>The mutual care can bring you into the practical shepherding. You may say, &#8220;Maybe tomorrow, Brother So-and-so, you can go with me to help this brother?&#8221; This is shepherding. In this way you can take the lead in the group meeting. However, you should not have any feeling, any consciousness, that you are taking the lead. Once you have this consciousness, you will become the leader, and this will kill the meeting. No one should feel that you are a leader. They should feel that you are the same as they are. Then they will follow you to do the same things.<p>If you show the new ones the way, they will learn to follow your example. If they do not know how to ask a question, you can show them. You may ask, &#8220;Do you all know that you have a human spirit? Do you all know what your human spirit is?&#8221; Give them this question, and let them answer. Their answers are a kind of teaching to one another. Then you may need to add something, but do not answer too quickly. If you speak too soon, it may prevent the new ones from speaking. You must encourage them to speak and give them the opportunity to say something. After their answering, you can add something, then another one may add something, and so forth. Eventually, you will have a complete answer to this question, and that becomes a very good teaching. By this all the new ones will know, see, and understand that they have a human spirit. Also, by asking in this way and answering in this way, you set up an example for them to follow.<p>At the end of the meeting, one of you may say, &#8220;Brothers and sisters, this is the way we have our Christian meetings. We hope to have this kind of meeting once a week. In this meeting we will have fellowship as we did tonight. We will get to know the situations of all the dear ones who meet with us. Then we will be able to pray for them, that is, to intercede for them. Then we can take care of one another and also shepherd one another. I may have some need that I cannot take care of by myself. Then I would need someone to help me. Some others may have needs that I can help them with. Because we are a big family, we like to help each other and to shepherd each other.&#8221;<p>&#8220;Tonight, a question was raised for all of us to answer. Do you know that all of our answers were a kind of teaching? All the answers together made up a complete teaching. According to Ephesians 4:12, it is in this way that we are perfected. Although we are not apostles, prophets, evangelists, and so forth, we believe that there are some gifted persons among us tonight who are able to do what we cannot do. However, after about four months, because we are being taught and perfected, we should be able to do many of the same things that they can do. We call this kind of meeting the group meeting, and we consider this meeting as a great part of the practical church life.&#8221; Then in the next meeting, you can introduce the basic practices of the Christian life and the church life, such as having morning watch and going out to visit people for the preaching of the gospel.<p>To change our way from the old practice to the new is not easy. We may want to begin a group meeting with a small number, even four or five can be enough. The best way is to begin mainly with the new ones. Then after we have set up that group meeting, we can bring in more saints. We all must try our best to have group meetings according to these few steps. First, we have to let the attendants open up that we may have fellowship. Following fellowship we will know the situation and condition of the saints so we can pray for one another. This is intercession. Then, based upon our fellowship and prayer we can render some practical care to one another and we can practice the mutual shepherding. In every group meeting, we must have some points to talk about or a question to answer. This is the mutual teaching, not by one person, but by all the attendants. Everyone can say a little bit, and even this little bit should be considered as a part of the teaching. We must try our best to practice the group meeting in this way.<h2 class=head1>A LIFE OF MORNING REVIVAL AND DAILY VICTORY</h2><p>A vital matter that is crucial to the practice of the church life in the new way is our living a life of morning revival and daily victory. We should not consider that to have a personal morning revival is difficult. To be revived is simply to be touched by the Lord anew. Whenever the Lord touches us, we are revived. In only two minutes the Lord can touch us and revive us. You may not have been revived for a long time, and you may feel that you are very far from the Lord. However, the Lord promises that, regardless of what we are, where we are, or how we are, He is always near to us. We may not have a pure conscience, but the Lord&#8217;s blood is ready to cleanse us. If we simply confess our failures, defects, wrongdoings, and shortcomings, the Lord will forgive us and cleanse us. Then immediately we touch Him, and He touches us. This is to be revived, and this kind of revival must be fresh every day.<p>We stress that this should be a morning revival based upon God&#8217;s natural law. Every twenty-four hours there is a morning to begin the new day. The sun rises anew every morning, and we also must rise up every morning. Therefore, it is good for us to go to bed earlier at night so that we can rise up earlier in the morning. Every morning we should get up, make our bed, and then spend some time with the Lord. If we can give the Lord ten minutes in the morning before doing anything else, surely we will be revived. If we normally get up at six o&#8217;clock, we should get up at five fifty. Then we could have ten minutes to contact the Lord and be revived.<p>In our time with the Lord, the main thing is to clear up our conscience, to get rid of our inner condemnation. This is done by making a thorough confession of all of our failures, defects, defeats, wrongdoings, mistakes, even sinfulness to the Lord. Then we can take one or two verses from the Holy Word to use in our prayer. This is pray-reading. Do not be concerned about too many things, and do not care that much for your understanding. Take care of calling on the Lord, contacting the Lord, and touching the Lord with a proper inner sense. This keeps you in a direct, fresh, intimate, loving contact with the Lord. Sometimes as you are enjoying the Lord in this way, you may have the sensation that the Lord is speaking to you. Then you can be silent, listening to His speaking. This is to fellowship with Him. In ten minutes you can do a number of things, yet you should not try to do too much. Use this ten minutes mainly to contact the Lord directly; then you will be revived. Because you have been revived, when you go to work, you will go with the Lord. In this way you will be victorious the whole day.<p>Because we have such a daily practice, we should help all of our new ones to do the same. Do not think that because they were just baptized, they cannot have morning watch or a morning revival. Everyone can have a morning revival. You only need to give them some simple instructions. We found out that a good way to help the new ones build up this practice is by using the telephone. You can encourage a new one to have a time of morning revival and explain what this means as I have done in this message. Then you can help him set a time for this. Many people do not get up early, so you may have to encourage him. If he usually gets up at seven o&#8217;clock, then you can say, &#8220;If you get up fifteen minutes earlier, you can make your bed, and then I will call you at six fifty. Then we can pray together over the phone.&#8221; If you practice in this way, you may be able to take care of two or three new ones every morning. You should also fellowship with them and select a book from the New Testament to go through in your morning revival times. When you begin to help them in this way, it may seem somewhat lifeless. However, after one or two days, this new one will be revived and become living. Whether he becomes living this morning, tomorrow morning, or the next morning, you should not care for that. If you are faithful to call him every morning, eventually, he will be fully revived. Through your example, he will learn to pray and to pray-read. If you will practice with him, he will learn. If you have a morning revival with an overcoming daily life, then you can take the lead to bring the new ones into the same practice.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=title>THE FORMATION OF GROUP MEETINGS</h1><h2 class=head1>THE ADVANCEMENT IN THE STUDY OF THE LORD&#8217;S NEW WAY</h2><p>In the fall of 1984 as we began to study the Lord&#8217;s new way, I began to speak about the group meetings. At that time I did not differentiate between the home meetings and the group meetings, because we considered these two terms as synonyms. Gradually, through our study and practice over the past few years, we have learned that we should differentiate between these two types of meetings. The home meetings are for nourishing and cherishing the newly baptized ones in their homes. This nourishing and cherishing is like that of a nursing mother after the delivery of a child.<p>The group meetings, on the other hand, are more advanced because they are for the perfecting of the new ones. We were not so clear about the distinctions in these two types of meetings at the beginning of our study in 1984. Now, we are clear. We also anticipate that there will be some improvement in the coming days.<h2 class=head1>GROUP MEETINGS AS THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>The group meetings are crucial to the church life. Without the group meetings, the church cannot be very strong or increase very quickly. If a local church is to be strong, it must be built upon the group meetings. Without the group meetings, it is difficult to have remaining fruit. The home meetings are for nourishing and cherishing the new believers in their homes. But these home meetings are only good for a short period of time in the initial stage of caring for the new believers. If you were to baptize a few new ones today, the interest of the new ones for the nourishing and cherishing in their homes would only last for about six months. If you continue to have the home meetings without the group meetings, the new ones will begin to lose their interest in meeting with you.<h2 class=head1>GROUP MEETINGS VERSUS GOOD SPEAKERS</h2><p>The church should be built upon the group meetings. According to the history in Christianity and also among us, the strength of a congregation is apparently determined by the speaker. If a congregation has a strong speaker, as long as the speaker is alive, the congregation seems to be strong. But when the speaker goes away or dies, the congregation begins to weaken. This is very common in Christianity, and we also have had similar experiences. When a church has a brother who is a good speaker and he remains in the church for awhile, speaking in a regular way, the church seems to ascend to the moon. But when that brother leaves to go to another place, the church quickly descends to the earth again. It seemed that the church was strong. But through many experiences, we have realized that it was not the church itself that was strong; it was the speaking or preaching that was strong. The speaking was not that much related to the actual strength of the church itself.<p>The actual strength of the church itself depends upon the group meetings, not on the strong speaker. If the group meetings are built up, whether or not you have a strong speaker makes little difference as far as the actual strength of the church is concerned. A good speaker with good speaking only adds another &#8220;crown&#8221; to the church. If the church is strong, the church will be strong with or without the good speaker as a crown.<p>When I was in Taipei from 1949 to 1955, I spoke in nearly every meeting. Apparently, the church in Taipei was strong, but eventually, I discovered that my constant speaking weakened the church there. In Shanghai, Brother Nee had a similar experience. Brother Nee was a strong speaker, and the more he spoke in the church in Shanghai, the weaker the church became. The factor for this weakness was the lack of the group meetings being built up. We may think that the more a good speaker speaks, the more a church will be strengthened. This may be the case when a church is first established. But over time this kind of speaking weakens the church. The good speaking of a speaker is like good food prepared in a restaurant. If you eat such rich food three times a day every day for a long period of time, you will not be very healthy. The emphasis must be placed, not on the good speakers, but on the group meetings. This is because the strength of the church rests actually in the group meetings, and the strength of the group meetings depends upon our labor.<h2 class=head1>BRINGING THE NEW ONES TO THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2><p>At the beginning of this term of training, we encouraged you to go back to the homes of the newly baptized ones in order to meet with them in their homes to nourish and cherish them. We also encouraged you to bring the new ones into the group meetings after a while, which we did not specify. At the beginning of this term, however, we did not encourage you to form group meetings with the new ones. But now, through the practice of the last few months, we have realized that it is best to try to bring the newly baptized ones into a group meeting as soon as possible. If a group meeting has not been established, you should form one with the newly baptized believer and the other members of your team. If the newly baptized one is a brother, it would be best to go back with at least one brother in your team. In a sense, your going back to visit the new one is the principle of a home meeting, but after a while that home meeting could become a group meeting.<p>First, you should begin to nourish and cherish the new one. Then, you should begin to practice the things of the group meeting, such as fellowship, intercession, care, and shepherding. If you baptize some others in other homes, you should try to gather them together into this group as soon as possible. If you do not bring them to the group meetings, after a few months, they will lose their taste and interest for the home meetings in their homes. The group meeting will stir up their interest again. Our returning to feed them in the home meetings can be likened to the regular feeding of a nursing mother. After a few months of feeding the new child regularly, when the mother tries to nurse her child, the child will be naughty, refusing to eat. The child would rather play than eat. But, if some other babies are brought in, the interest of the young child is renewed again. It is the same for the new ones in the home meetings. If you go back to visit them repeatedly, after a few months, they will lose their taste for that kind of meeting. The best way to take care of the new ones at this point is to bring other new ones together with them in a group meeting. They will begin to converse with each other, and their interest will be recovered. By grouping them together, they will also begin to be built up together with others. They will become like burning coals placed together to build and keep a strong fire. Thus, this kind of grouping will be a great benefit to them. Therefore, if we are serious about taking the new way, we must try our best to bring the newly baptized ones together to form group meetings as soon as possible.<h2 class=head1>THE PROBLEM OF OLDNESS IN THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2><p>The problem among us today is that some of the groups which have been meeting for several months are full of oldness. I would advise you as visiting ones not to bring the new ones into these older group meetings. These older group meetings are like a Chinese household which has emigrated to the United States. The older ones in the family can only speak Chinese, but the children of the family have learned to speak English. It is difficult for the older ones to change their language from Chinese to English. But the younger ones find it very easy to do so. Though the younger ones may try to teach the older ones to speak English, eventually, the older ones would still prefer to speak Chinese. It is the same in the group meetings. The older ones by habit practice in an old way. The younger ones, however, only know to practice in the new way. Yet, they can be influenced by the older ones. The older ones may not be influenced very much by the newness of the new ones, but the new ones could be very influenced by the oldness of the older ones. This kind of influence is a problem in the group meetings; therefore, it is better to have two different types of group meetings.<h2 class=head1>CHANGING FROM THE OLD WAY TO THE NEW WAY</h2><p>The conclusion of the new way in our understanding is that we must build up the group meetings. The need to build up the group meetings is very urgent. But in building up the group meetings, I encourage you to have two groups, an old group and a new group. Because we are in a transitory period of time, changing from the old way to the new way, it is better and necessary to keep these two different types of group meetings. The first type of group meeting would be composed of saints who have been meeting in groups for a long time. The other type of group meeting is the one formed with the newly baptized ones. The first type of meeting is composed of saints who are in full agreement with the new way, but due to their habit in the old way, they take the new way according to the steps of the old way. They take the form of the new way, but with the habit of the old way. Eventually, this kind of practice is just a repeat of the old way. In many of the existing group meetings, the old way of meeting was unconsciously repeated. We should not annul these existing groups; we should try to help them. Gradually, they will pick up some of the aspects of the new way.<p>The second type of group meetings is the result of our going out as lambs in the midst of wolves (Luke 10:3) to find the sons of peace (v. 6). If we go out regularly, we will find the chosen ones. Since we have realized the need to visit our relatives, friends, neighbors, and other acquaintances, there is not that much need for us to knock on &#8220;cold doors.&#8221; We can simply make appointments to visit our relatives, friends, neighbors, and acquaintances, and from among these, we will surely find some who have been chosen of God. When we find these chosen ones, we should form them into groups as soon as possible.<h2 class=head1>FORMING THE NEW BELIEVERS INTO GROUPS</h2><p>In forming the new believers into groups, you do not need to wait until you have eight or nine. You could form a group meeting with just one newly baptized believer and one or two other visiting ones. Then, gradually, the group meeting will grow until it reaches a size large enough to subdivide. No group meeting should remain for over a year without subdividing, so each year the group meetings should double. By this way, the church will grow and expand. As we labor in this way, we will discover a lot of details that will help us to grow and improve our practice. Within three to five years a good foundation for growth and expansion will be laid in all the churches.<h2 class=head1>HOME MEETINGS DEVELOPING INTO GROUP MEETINGS</h2><p>As we take care of the new ones, we must learn to do two things at the same time. While we are in the homes of the new ones to feed them, we are also there endeavoring to bring them into the realization and practice of a group meeting. The home meeting is mainly to cherish, nourish, and to feed the new ones a little bit. But the group meeting has other elements, such as fellowship, intercession, care, shepherding, and mutual teaching. As we are with them, we should try to add these elements of the group meeting into the home meeting. When these elements are brought into the meeting, the home meeting changes into a group meeting. But this does not mean that the home meeting with cherishing, nourishing, and feeding should be abandoned. We still should care for the new ones in the principle of the home meetings. But as we are laboring in the home meetings, we should also labor to build up the group meetings. Actually, a group meeting will also meet the need of feeding the new ones. The group meeting is really a miniature of the church life because it comprises the elements of fellowship, intercession, mutual care, shepherding, and mutual teaching, as well as gospel preaching.<h2 class=head1>LABORING IN A NEW PLACE VERSUS LABORING IN AN OLD PLACE</h2><p>If my wife and I with four other brothers and their families went to an absolutely new place like Mongolia, I believe that in a single year, we could gain at least thirty new believers through the practice of the new way. This could be done mainly because the Mongolians would not have any idea about the practice of Christianity, and we would not bring anything of it to them. We would simply preach the gospel to them, baptize them, and meet with them in the home meetings and small group meetings. We would be absolutely new and keep anything of the oldness of Christianity away from them. Without the frustration of opinions and oldness, perhaps as many as five hundred could be gained in five years.<p>Due to the frustrations of differing opinions, the result of the practice of the new way has been greatly reduced. Because of the different opinions and attacks, as we labor according to the God-ordained way, we must build with one hand and fight the enemy with the other as Nehemiah did in rebuilding the walls of the city of Jerusalem (Neh. 4:17). Sometimes, only a small part of our strength can be applied to the positive work of carrying out the Lord&#8217;s move, and a greater part of our strength must be used to fight. This is the nature of the work in an old place.<h2 class=head1>A HOLY LIFE AND LIVING FOR THE PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL</h2><h2 class=head2>The Morning Revival</h2><p>As New Testament priests of the gospel, we must have a holy life and living. This holy life and living is maintained by being revived every morning. Each morning we should have a new start. To have some time with the Lord each morning does not mean that we have to spend a great deal of time with the Lord. I have practiced a lot and have found out that having about ten minutes with the Lord each morning is enough time. In this time with the Lord, we must reject all distracting thoughts about our activities. Try your best not to go along with your emotion, mind, or will. It is also good not to consider many different portions of the Bible at this time. Just concentrate your entire being on the Lord, and try to exercise your spirit to call on His name. We must learn to call on His name in the morning. It is also helpful to pray-read two or three verses, using them for your prayer. There is no need to compose a prayer; simply pray the verses as they are. In these ten minutes, it is best to avoid praying for other things. In this time, we should simply talk to the Lord directly. This is real prayer. As you contact the Lord in this way, something in your being will be revived, your spirit will be stirred up, and you will be strengthened to live a holy life. This is the morning revival.<p>If you have more than ten minutes, you can spend the first ten minutes contacting the Lord to be revived, and the extra time can be used to read and study the Bible. In this time of study, it is helpful to use other publications in order to understand the Bible in a more thorough way. This second part of your time in the morning is what we call morning watch. Usually, in our speaking, we combine the morning revival with morning watch. But it is good to separate them, because if you only have a small amount of time each morning, you should try to have a revival every morning.<h2 class=head2>An Overcoming Daily Life</h2><p>After the morning revival, we must exercise to keep ourselves in the spirit throughout the day. We must do and say things in our spirit. This is to be overcoming and victorious. Throughout the day, there will be a lot of failures because we are so fragile, unstable, untrustworthy, and not very steadfast. We may ascend very strongly early in the morning, but by ten o&#8217;clock in the morning we may already be down. We do not have to remain down. We can always exercise our spirit to come back to the Lord. Then we should continue to practice remaining in our spirit the rest of the day. This is to have the morning revival and the overcoming daily living.<p>We should not only exercise to have such a life and living ourselves, but we should also help each of our new ones to have the same kind of life and living. We have discovered that a very convenient way to help the new ones get revived every morning is to have some time with them over the telephone each morning. It is best to make an appointment with them before calling them. Because of the convenience of calling the new ones by telephone, if we rise up a little earlier each morning, there is the way to take care of as many as three persons very easily.<h2 class=head1>CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY</h2><p>We must practice the biblical way to preach the gospel as priests of the gospel (Rom. 15:16). This priesthood of the gospel is carried out by training. The co-workers and leaders in the churches must understand this and labor to train the saints to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. We must preach the gospel in such a particular way. If we would practice this priesthood in a thorough way, we may be able to have a one hundred percent increase each year. But, at the very least, we should be able to realize a thirty percent increase a year.<p>The crucial point of the God-ordained way is the group meetings. How much success we will realize depends upon how much attention and labor we are able to put on the group meetings. Therefore, we must endeavor to build up the group meetings. When the group meetings are built up strongly, the church will also be very strong.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THIRTY</h1><h1 class=title>THE GROWTH AND MULTIPLICATION OF THE GROUP MEETINGS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:24-25; 2 Tim. 2:2; Eph. 4:11-12</h1><p>In this message we will continue to fellowship concerning the group meeting. We all must see that the group meeting is all-inclusive. It is more than eighty percent of the church life. If a church does not have strong group meetings, it could never be that strong. A church&#8217;s condition is closely related to the group meetings. Without the group meetings, a church will stagnate and become stale. To give messages to a big congregation may help the saints somewhat, but for the church to be living, fresh, high, and rich, we must have group meetings according to the God-ordained way.<h2 class=head1>BEING FLEXIBLE IN PRACTICING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h2><p>In the full-time training, I have given you many practical points concerning the first three steps of the God-ordained way. These points are the result of much experimenting in our full-time trainings and have also been confirmed by the experiences of some of the churches. However, you should not take these points in a legal way. You must be very flexible in your practice of these steps.<p>Our being flexible gives the Lord a way to reach all His seekers. Recently I heard a number of testimonies from new ones who had been contacted by saints practicing the new way. At least two were contacted through the telephone by saints who simply began to call numbers in the phone book. Another two had been hoping that some Christians would contact them to bring them to a church. While they were considering in this way, some saints knocked on their door. There are a number of cases like this. By all these testimonies you can see how the Holy Spirit is working today in so many wandering people.<p>In the United States today, there are many wandering people. Even though they may be settled outwardly, they do not have a goal, a destination, for their lives. These people are always longing for a friend that can help them. We can help them. They do not have a destination, but we do. They do not have a goal in their lives, but we can give them a goal. If we do not go out, how can we find these people? Mankind has become a pack of wolves; yet today, at the end of the age, there are many sons of peace among these wolves (Luke 10:3, 6), waiting for us to contact them. If we do not go to contact them, how can we find them? When the Lord visited Zaccheus, He said that &#8220;the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost&#8221; (Luke 19:10). The Lord went out with a purpose to find His lost sheep. If we intend to find the Lord&#8217;s sheep, we also must go out.<p>However, when we go out to visit people, we should not be too legal. Do not say, &#8220;Brother Lee told us that we must first visit our close relatives, then our neighbors, then our classmates, and so forth. Therefore, we should not contact this person because he is not a relative or a neighbor.&#8221; This is too legal. The Spirit is like the wind. We do not know which way the wind will blow, but when He blows, we must be flexible to follow Him. As long as we keep the principle that we who love the Lord should go out to visit people to bring them the gospel, we can be flexible in every way.<h2 class=head1>THE GROUP MEETING BEING ONE WITH THE CHURCH</h2><p>You should begin to bring the newborn believers together in group meetings as soon as possible. If you do not have that many new ones, you can have a smaller group meeting, even two or three would be enough. If you baptized one last night, yet his wife has not yet been baptized, two of you may go back to his home tonight to meet with him. If his wife would join you, you could have a good group meeting with only four people. As you gain more new ones, your group meeting can be enlarged.<p>In principle, there are certain elements that we should have in the group meeting. We should first have fellowship, intercession, mutual care, and shepherding. Then, we should go on to be taught and perfected through the mutual teaching. To encourage or initiate the mutual teaching we may need to ask a proper question. Each one has the responsibility, and each one must be given the liberty to teach in the group meeting through the mutual asking and answering of such questions. This teaching in mutuality issues in the perfecting of the saints. Each one teaches and is also taught. Each one perfects and is also perfected.<p>In addition, you have to promote what the church is practicing. If the church is endeavoring to encourage all the saints to have a time of morning revival and to live a daily life in Christ&#8217;s victory, you must also promote these things in the group meeting. You must help all those in your group meeting to practice having a time of morning revival in order to live a daily life in Christ&#8217;s victory.<p>The benefits of a small spiritual practice like morning revival cannot be measured according to your feelings. On one hand, your time of morning revival may be better than what the Apostle Paul experienced, but on the other hand, it may be worse than one of the new believer&#8217;s. But regardless of whether it is better or worse than others&#8217;, as long as you have a time of morning revival with the Lord, that is wonderful. The real value of food cannot be measured by taste. You may appreciate a certain type of food, but I may not. However, regardless of whether you appreciate a certain type of food or not, as long as you eat it three times a day, you will be sustained.<p>Your experiences of morning revival may be on different levels, but regardless of the level, it is much better than not having such a time at all. On some mornings you may be in a hurry and not have ten minutes. You may only have time to pray, &#8220;Lord, I want to be revived by You. O Lord Jesus, revive me. Lord, I have to go. I am sorry that I don&#8217;t have time to stay here with You.&#8221; Sometimes I have had to do this, yet this is surely much better than nothing.<p>We must do our best to have a time of morning revival every day. If we do not have ten minutes, we can at least have a little time to contact the Lord. Surely every one of us, regardless of how busy we are, can find half a minute in the morning to speak to the Lord. We will surely get something. Because I have such little time, I have had a number of morning revivals like this. No matter what, we must never stop having a time of morning revival. This is the life line to all the saints.<p>In the group meetings, you should do whatever the church is doing. Because all the churches are in different conditions and different situations, they may be promoting different things at different times. The group meetings should always follow the leading of the church. If the church is encouraging the saints to go out to visit people for the preaching of the gospel, then you should also promote this practice in the group meeting. You may ask the saints to read John 15:16 in the meeting, and then fellowship with them concerning going out to bear fruit. If you promote this, four out of ten will go out for the gospel. Later, there will be the need to promote the home meetings in order to care for the new believers, and then the group meetings to perfect them.<h2 class=head1>DIVIDING THE GROUP MEETINGS FOR THE INCREASE</h2><p>In the group meeting, we should never be contented with the same number week after week. We may feel that fifteen is a good number for the group meeting, but we should not be content with this. We must fellowship with the brothers and sisters in the group meeting that we all have to be burdened for our group to grow. We may speak to a certain brother, &#8220;Near your home there are a number of saints in the recovery. Maybe you could go and visit one of these and bring him to our group meeting next week.&#8221;<p>If a group of fifteen has been meeting together for a few months without any increase, they may need to divide into two groups. Then these smaller groups will endeavor to gain others and will grow. Some may be afraid that to divide a group in this way may cause some to be lost. However, I assure you that what is lost will be small compared to what will be gained. Still, before you divide the fifteen, you must spend two or three weeks to fellowship with them to prepare them. Then when you divide them into two groups, in only two weeks, each group may have ten to twelve.<p>After a group meeting has been together for some time, the saints may not want to leave one another. The grandparents want to keep their children and grandchildren with them forever. However, I do not care for that; I care for the spreading. Let the children be scattered. Then they will grow, establish their homes, and raise up families. Do not keep your children with you for too long. The Bible tells us that when someone is married, he has to leave his parents and be joined to his wife (Gen. 2:24; Eph. 5:31). You should let the saints go to form their own families, that is, to form their own groups. In principle, a group meeting should divide within six months or, at the most, one year. If you practice this, you will immediately see the growth, the increase.<h2 class=head1>A WORD TO THE FULL-TIME TRAINEES</h2><p>A number of the full-time trainees will not come back for the second term of training. This is glorious because they have graduated and can go back to their places. Wherever they go, they can be a blessing. The Lord promised Abraham that his seed would be a blessing to all the nations (Gen. 12:3). I hope that those who are going back after this term will be a blessing to their churches. Whether they are a blessing or not depends upon the way they conduct themselves.<p>I would like to share a few points for you who are going back to your churches after receiving some training in the practice of the God-ordained way. When you go back, do not preach the new way, and do not promote it among the saints. When people ask you about the full-time training, you must restrain yourselves in answering. Do not say, &#8220;The training was glorious! Let me tell you everything I have learned.&#8221; If you are so excited in your speaking concerning the training, you may cause trouble. If I were you, I would only say, &#8220;The training was very nice.&#8221; However, some saints like to be the &#8220;information desk&#8221; of the church. They would not be satisfied with such an answer. However, others may have a genuine concern for the Lord&#8217;s interest. You must be wise and answer according to your discernment. You have to discern whether this person is the one to whom you should tell more.<p>The first time you attend a meeting, the elders may ask you to give a report concerning the training. You must be careful. If you do not do it, you will offend them. If you do it improperly, you will cause trouble. Therefore, you have to learn to speak the right word at the right time. While you are speaking you must discern the atmosphere, whether the atmosphere is good for you to speak more or not. If it is not, you can close your speaking in a nice way. Be patient; if you cannot speak something today, there will be a tomorrow.<p>Do not preach or promote anything; simply live the new way. You have received help from the training. Now, go back and pray to the Lord, and I believe the Lord will give you one or two companions. You can fellowship with these companions, and the two or three of you can go out to get your relatives and neighbors saved. If you practice in this way, you will never stir up any kind of opposition. Simply go out to visit people to get them saved and baptized. Then, go back to their homes to cherish, nourish, and feed them so that they will grow. When you bring them to the church meetings, the elders and all the saints will be happy to see some new ones. You also must stir up the new ones to give testimonies in the meetings. New faces and new voices in the meeting really refresh people. They will all find out that these are your fruit, yet you still must be careful in your speaking. Do not boast and do not vindicate the new way; even more, do not criticize anything the church is doing or has done in the past. That would kill the church. Do not advertise what you are doing. Simply labor quietly and even somewhat hiddenly as a New Testament priest of the gospel according to what you have learned.<p>Some of the saints may be interested in what you are doing. If others ask what you are doing, do not reject them. To reject them is to oppose them. Simply tell them that you sometimes go out with one or two others to visit people and preach the gospel to them. Again, there is the need for discernment to know how much you should speak to them.<p>Many times you will be frustrated in your work, but you have to believe all things are sovereign of the Lord. Every frustration helps you. Do not say or do anything quickly. Always work in a gradual way, bit by bit, believing that whatever you do, if it is of the Lord, the Lord will perform it. If you do this, the Lord will lead you, and you will not cause any trouble. If you have any problems, we would be willing to help you. You can write to us. This kind of fellowship will be a profit to all the churches.<p>In principle, whatever you do must be peaceful and altogether constructive to the saints and to the church. You should never try to destroy anything. Learn to be wise, to help people, and to avoid causing trouble. By your proper behavior, after two months, even a dissenting one toward the new way may be convinced. Do not think that men cannot be turned; many will be turned.<p>In this term of the training, we were not able to cover the fourth step of the God-ordained way, that is, the prophesying for the direct building up of the organic Body of Christ. However, we intend to cover this matter in the second term of the training, and all those messages should be made available to the saints as these have been. I would also encourage you to get a copy of the book Prophesying in the Church Meetings for the Organic Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ. This is a book of detailed outlines compiled from all the messages that I have given in the past three years concerning prophesying. If you will read these outlines, point after point, slowly and carefully with much consideration, you will receive much help. Another book that I would recommend is The Advance of the Lord&#8217;s Recovery Today. This book covers the four main steps of the God-ordained way in detail. You can receive much help concerning prophesying from these publications.<p>One thing which I have spoken about very much in the past, but have not covered in this term of the training, is the matter of speaking hymns, psalms, and songs in the meetings. I covered this subject thoroughly in February of 1988 at the beginning of the first term of the full-time training in Irving, Texas. In order to make up this lack, I recommend that you study another book of outlines: Speaking Poems in the Church Meetings for the Organic Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ. The word poems used in this title refers to the psalms, hymns, and songs used in the church meetings. I hope that you will read these outlines carefully and then begin to practice speaking hymns, psalms, and songs in the church meetings for the organic building up of the Body of Christ.<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=title>A CONCLUDING WORD</h1><p>The purpose of the messages in this series is to train us to be proper Christians and even proper human beings. We must grasp and treasure our current opportunity and redeem the time to be trained and built up. Many students may attend the same school, and even the same class, and may even have the same professor. However, the outcome of their schooling depends on the students&#8217; labor.<p>In order to be proper Christians we must firstly be built up with the divine truths, the scriptural knowledge in the divine way. We must also be built up with the divine life, the life of God, which is God Himself in His divine Trinity and in His processes. We have to know Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him. If we know Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him, we will possess Him and be able to minister Him to the lost world. Lastly, we must know the church and be brought into the proper practice of the church life. We have passed through many turmoils in the church, but we are still here. On the one hand, this is because of the Lord&#8217;s mercy and grace. On the other hand, it is because of the proper knowledge of the truth concerning the church as the Body of Christ and the truth concerning the proper practice of the church life. This proper knowledge has preserved many of us.<h2 class=head1>BEING BUILT UP IN OUR CHARACTER</h2><p>We must be built up as proper human beings. This is a matter of our character, that is, our behavior and habit. A person who has been properly built up is a right person with a right character. Today, many young people have been damaged with respect to their character. It is because of this that we have a children&#8217;s work for the children. We need to build up our children&#8217;s character. From their youth they must learn to honor their parents, love their brothers and sisters, and respect others. We do not need to give the young ones too much knowledge of the Bible. We should rather build them up with the proper ethics and morality that will constitute a proper character. Many people today are short of such a proper training.<p>In our sleeping, in our rising up, in our dressing, and in every detail of our life we should be very strict to be built up in a good character. We must be punctual and learn to take care of even the small matters in a proper way. We must be strict in our speaking. We have to learn what to say when we talk to others; we should not be free and loose to express ourselves. Every matter related to our life should be in order.<h2 class=head2>Learning to Submit Ourselves to Authority</h2><p>It is a blessing for young people to be under authority. It is a shame that ambition, the desire to be over others, still exists in the church life. Nearly all the turmoils in the Lord&#8217;s recovery are due to ambition. If the &#8220;gopher&#8221; of ambition could be killed, there would be no further turmoils. It is ugly for one to consider that since he is older than others, he cannot be under them. Regardless of who we are or how old we are, we must learn to be under others. When we are under someone, we should learn to check with them before we do certain things. In turn, those who are over us will be instructed by those who are over them. In this way we will all learn something. We should not consider that we are so free to do as we please. If we do not keep the order among us, we will be in chaos.<p>Since my youth I have always been under someone. In this way I have learned much and received help. I was in the Lord&#8217;s ministry with Brother Nee for eighteen years. During this time I never did anything by myself. I always put myself under him. I will never regret this. Rather, I worship the Lord that I was under him. Brother Nee was only two years older than I. However, I always treated him as a father, and I received much help from him. It is difficult for those who are rebellious to learn anything. Rebellion robs people of the opportunities to learn. No child can learn anything if he is rebellious against his parents. Likewise, a student who rebels against his teacher in school will have difficulty learning his lessons. Every student must please his teacher that his teacher may be happy to teach him. Nothing is so blessed as submission. We must learn to submit ourselves to someone else according to God&#8217;s arrangement.<h2 class=head2>Learning the Lessons of the Inner Life</h2><p>When I was young, I learned the lesson not to touch anything that was not mine without first asking. One of the elders in Shanghai always instructed the young people in this way. When he knocked on someone&#8217;s door, he would wait for them to open it. When the door would open, he would not enter into the house until the host invited him in. Then, once in the house, he would stand until the host offered him a seat. This brother learned the lessons of the inner life to a great degree. Eventually, his standing in the inner life was manifested. In a single day the communists imprisoned one thousand of the leading brothers throughout the country, including this brother. Many of the brothers eventually lost their faithfulness to the Lord. The communists spoke in a subtle way, saying that they were not persecuting the church. They only asked that the brothers would say that they believed in Jesus Christ but did not follow Watchman Nee. They tempted them, asking whether or not they believed that Watchman Nee was always right and never made mistakes. At first, the brothers did not reply to this manner of questioning. However, they eventually told the questioner that they felt Brother Nee had been wrong in certain things. After speaking in this way, they were allowed to return home. The brother from Shanghai, however, had learned the strict lessons of life and had taught others to always follow their inner feeling. He told his questioners that as a Christian his inner feeling did not allow him to say anything negative about Brother Nee. He said that whether or not Brother Nee was wrong was not his business. This brother was kept in prison until he died a half year later. The other brothers were good saints, but eventually, when the test came, most of them could not stand because they had not been built up with a strong character. We also may feel that we are right, but we may not have built up a strict character. It is not a small matter to build up our character.<h2 class=head1>VISITING PEOPLE FOR THE GOSPEL IN THE TRAINED WAY</h2><p>We need to build up a habit of visiting people in their homes for the gospel, and we must learn the proper way to visit them. This should be a part of our church life and a life-long habit in our Christian life. We should first visit people for gospel preaching to get them baptized, and after this we should continue to visit them to have home meetings with them. The way in which we visit people makes a big difference. We need to go out in a proper way, the trained way. Many saints have a sincere heart to visit people, but they go out in a natural way. I helped to compile our hymnal with over a thousand hymns, but I cannot play the piano because I was never trained by a proper tutor. In the same way, we may diligently practice to visit people for preaching the gospel, but we may not be doing it in the trained way.<p>When we visit people for the gospel, we should observe our rate of success, how many doors we knock on in order to baptize one person. We should also consider the way we care for the newly baptized ones. After they are baptized, we need to give them a good lesson on salvation. To fail to do this will create a great lack in our care for them. In visiting people we also need to properly proportion our time. After baptizing new ones, we need to care for them, but at the same time we may need to continue to knock on more doors in order to baptize others. If our practice is proper, our visiting of people will not be in vain. We will always gain people.<p>In order to preach the gospel in the best way, we have to be those who are very much interested in people. We have to like to talk to people, but not in the way of gossip, and we must be very concerned for them. Then, for the sake of our gospel preaching, we must learn to be attractive persons. Christians who preach and minister Christ must be attractive. When we enter into people&#8217;s homes, they should be attracted by us. Some of us may be good saints, but we may not be attractive. When we enter into a home, the people there may be afraid of us and will not want to have anything to do with us. If we are this way, we are finished with the gospel preaching. A precious stone is valuable, but it may not be attractive. To Christ we should be the precious stones, but for the ones we visit, we should be a &#8220;magnet&#8221; to attract them. We should be attractive not only in our speaking but even in the way we look at people. We should be soft and warm to them.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED FOR A TRAINING IN THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY</h2><p>In the past centuries the Lord has not fully obtained what He has desired. In our youth we realized this and became burdened. We had received a revelation from the entire Bible, and we could not deny that the Lord had shown us something. However, at that time we were not able to carry out what the Lord had shown us. In the early 1960s I came to the United States and was burdened by the Lord to stay here to minister and release the truth. For several years I visited many places to contact the seeking ones. The Lord honored this, and the churches began to be raised up. I then realized that we should have conferences and trainings to release the truth from the Holy Word consecutively, and from 1974 until the present time we have had two trainings annually.<p>After we finished the life-study of the New Testament in 1984, I felt that we needed to see the Lord&#8217;s new way to meet and serve in the church. By this time our situation and practice in the church had become stale, and we were at a standstill. We studied our situation and felt that we needed a training so that a group of saints could rise up to take the God-ordained way for the church. In February of 1986 we had an urgent meeting with the co-workers and elders in which I presented my feeling concerning our need. We were burdened to &#8220;sound the trumpet&#8221; to call some volunteers to fight for the people of God. We did not expect that all the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery would take the new way, and we did not feel that those who would not take this way were no longer a part of the church. Whether one takes this way or not, he is still in the church. We only asked that those who did not take this way would not criticize or oppose it.<p>From the very beginning of the Lord&#8217;s recovery among us, Brother Nee realized that there was the need for a training, but whenever he would begin a training, the enemy would come in to attack. In 1936 Brother Nee built a house in a suburb of Shanghai in order to have a training there. However, immediately after the completion of this house, Japan invaded China and the house was destroyed. When Brother Nee tried again to have a training in the early 1940s, the enemy attacked again and a turmoil arose in the church in Shanghai. This caused Brother Nee to suspend his ministry for six years. In 1948 Brother Nee resumed his ministry and held a training in his home town for two terms. At this time, however, the communists came in, terminated the training, and confiscated the buildings used for it. In Taipei we started to have a training for the new way in August of 1986. Only after a little over one and a half months, the criticizing of the training by a visitor began. Later, the criticizing spread to other countries, even to the U. S. A., and went up to opposing, and the opposing went up to attacking. Eventually the attacking went up to destroying. The training became a target for the enemy&#8217;s attack because this kind of training is a crucial factor for the defeat of the enemy. I am grateful to the Lord that He has burdened me to carry out the training in the Lord&#8217;s recovery.<p>A training in the Lord&#8217;s recovery is very crucial, and we must bear the burden to pray for it. Without a training the church cannot be prevailing. Because of the training, a number of saints who have been in the church life for only a short time have been growing quickly. Without a training, however, we may all be common Christians, simply attending the meetings year after year. To be trained makes a great difference in our Christian life. After a few months of training we will never be the same. The regular church meetings help us only in a general way. The training, however, helps us in particular ways. To be trained is to become more useful in the Lord&#8217;s hands.<h2 class=head2>The Church as the Army Being Trained to Fight for the Kingdom</h2><p>The Bible likens the church to an army (Eph. 6:11-20; Rev. 19:14), and an army is formed with soldiers. Without training the soldiers could not be formed into an army. The enemies of a country always hate to see that country build up an army. Satan hates the church as the army. Because of this, it has been a struggle to have a training in the Lord&#8217;s recovery.<p>The Lord&#8217;s move on the earth is for the purpose of establishing His kingdom. In order to establish a kingdom there is the need of fighting. After being trained, we become the fighting ones, the &#8220;soldiers&#8221; to fight for God&#8217;s kingdom. According to the book of Numbers, Israel was formed into an army in order for God to establish the kingdom in the good land (Num. 1:2-3, 45). Without the formation of the army, the kingdom could not be established. The fighting of the Israelites brought in God&#8217;s kingdom.<p>If possible, all the college graduates among us, both brothers and sisters, should not take a job immediately after their graduation. They should rather spend one or two years to be trained and then find a job. Whoever will be trained in this way will be a soldier. Some countries practice to train their young people in the military service after their graduation. After their training, the young people can find a job, but when the country has the need, all the trained ones can be recalled and formed into an army.<h2 class=head2>The Need for Wisdom and Discernment after We Are Trained</h2><p>In fighting there is the need of wisdom. Once we have been trained, we should do everything with much discernment; we should not fight foolishly. To knock on people&#8217;s doors for the gospel we have to exercise our discernment, and to talk to people in their homes also requires discernment. In order to discern we need to exercise our wisdom. Wisdom is related to God and is mostly a matter of our spirit. In order to have wisdom we must have God, and the more God we have, the more wisdom we have. We must contact God and stay with God to have wisdom for our discernment.<p>All the local churches are very good; they are in the Lord&#8217;s recovery and for the Lord&#8217;s recovery. However, the condition of the churches are not all the same, and the condition of the saints are not all the same. We must be wise to discern the condition of the church and the saints in our locality. The way we contact the church and the saints should not be according to our preference but according to their situation. Sometimes to contact the saints is like walking on thin ice, requiring us to exercise much care and to walk with discernment. The saints in the churches are not our &#8220;trainees.&#8221; Rather, they may be our spiritual fathers and mothers. We should be as gentle as lambs with them. In this way we will be useful to everyone. We will not damage anyone, and we will not cause a problem. However, we should not say that in order not to cause problems we will do nothing. This is not the way of training. We are being trained to be useful, to do something for the Lord, yet without causing any trouble. We must be as useful as we can, as useful as the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty allows and His grace affords, taking every opportunity to be used by the Lord, yet without damaging anyone.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p>Question: It is needful to dress properly when we visit people, but should the members of a gospel team dress uniformly?<p>Answer: We simply need to dress properly. Many institutions, such as banks, insist that their employees dress properly. However, it is not needful to dress uniformly. We may have some variety.<p>Question: Should we practice the trained way to visit people step by step only when we first begin to go out, or should we practice it step by step every time?<p>Answer: Large corporations train their salesmen not to speak according to themselves. The salesmen are told in writing what they should say. Then they learn to recite it until it becomes their own word. We should read the booklet The Mystery of Human Life and take its contents into our being. Then when we go out, we will not speak the gospel in a general way. We will spontaneously speak from our own being according to the instructed way. This principle has been proven by many business corporations and by other preachers of the gospel. We should not believe that our own way is better than the trained way. Our own way is natural, and the natural way of doing anything will not be successful. The most successful way is a trained way. Even in playing ball, we must be coached. We must do everything according to the coach&#8217;s instruction, and we have to practice until that instruction gets into our being. Then it will not merely be instruction; it will be &#8220;in our blood.&#8221; We should be trained until we get into the trained way and the trained way gets into us. Then whenever we open our mouth, the trained speaking will come out. If we practice this way, our visiting people will not be in vain.<p>We must make up our mind not to visit people in our own natural way. We should reject the natural way and always try to go out according to the instruction given in our messages. At first we may not be successful, but if we practice the trained way for about two weeks, we will see the results.<p>We must be the first ones saved by our preaching. If we doubt that people will be saved by the trained way, we have not first been saved by it. We must pray that we be saved by the message we are going to give others. Then we can go out with the assurance that they will be saved. This principle is the same with our teaching. If we doubt that our message will help people, we have not first been helped by it, and we should not speak it. The way to believe that what we preach will save others is to pray and get ourselves into our message. In this way we will be saved and have the assurance others will be saved. Then we will be zealous to knock on people&#8217;s doors and find people to talk to.</body></html>
