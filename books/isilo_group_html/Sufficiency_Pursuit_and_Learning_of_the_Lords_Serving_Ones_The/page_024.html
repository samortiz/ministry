<p>Many people have asked me whether the many Christian groups who zealously preach the gospel are the church. We do not deny the importance of preaching the gospel. The Catholic Church also preaches the gospel; this is undeniable. However, it is not a matter of whether or not a Christian group preaches the gospel. The real issue is whether, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we have seen the vision that God desires to be our life. His purpose is that all those who have His life would be built up to be the church. This church is one universally and also one locally. Concerning the church, we can either be one hundred percent correct or one hundred percent wrong. There is no ambiguity in this matter because there is only one Body of Christ, and there is only one church of God. If we are clear concerning this vision, we will understand that there cannot be more than one church in the universe and that there cannot be more than one church in any given locality. There can be only one universal church because there is only one Body of Christ, and this one universal church can have only one expression locally. Hence, we should not participate in any group that is not the one Body. We cannot participate in the Catholic Church even though it has many believers, because it is not of the one Body, and its system is not scriptural.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Turning to the Spirit<br />
to Be Faithful to the Vision<br />
and Being Restricted<br />
in the Coordination of the Body</h2>
<p>In this age God desires to be our life and to build us up to be His church. We may not be able to bring every believer into this vision, but we must be faithful and loyal to this vision. When we see the Body, we will no longer serve God individualistically; instead, we will serve in coordination in the one Body. We cannot require every Christian to be in this coordination, but since we have seen this vision, we are willing to be restricted by it and to serve in coordination with the other saints. No matter how good or how effective other groups may be, my concern is to serve according to this vision.</p>
<p>A friend once told me that he felt it was the Lord who told him to do what he was doing. I told him that those in the Catholic Church would also say, with absolute assurance, that they were doing what the Lord wants them to do. I said that only the Lord knows who is right.</p>
<p>I hope that all the co-workers will learn to fellowship with the Lord more in order to see a vision and to know the Lord&rsquo;s feeling. They should also learn to fellowship and follow the Lord. At a certain point in time you will see His Body&mdash;the universal church and its local expression. You will also see that the church is a coordinated Body, that there is an order in the Body, and that there is also restriction in the Body.</p>
<p>All the talk by other groups concerning the church can be compared to the talks between Job and his three friends; these talks are words without knowledge, which darkens counsel (Job 38:2). They are the expression of human opinions. The more we listen to them, the more confused we will be. There is only one way to be clear, and that way is to turn to our spirit. When we touch the Lord, we should deal with whatever He wants us to deal with. In whatever way He would restrict us, we should be restricted, and if He wants us to pay a price, we should be willing to pay a price. If we are willing to follow the Lord in this way, we will see the glorious vision of the universal church and its local expression. We will also realize that we have received mercy to be members in the Body. Hence, we will be in coordination, knowing our place and the order in the Body. The Head is in this coordination, and the order and deputy authority come out from the Head. We will also realize that this living testimony is what God desires to gain in this age and that Satan hates this testimony. Only this vision can destroy Satan&rsquo;s scheme and bring in God&rsquo;s kingdom. This is the way we serve in the church.</p>
<p>Every saint must be established in two aspects: learning the lessons of life and having a proper knowledge of the church. Concerning the aspect of life, we must learn to turn to the Lord and fall before His face. Without a clear vision of the church, we will have problems in our service. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we will learn the lessons of life and the way to serve in the church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Sufficiency, Pursuit, and Learning of the Lord's Serving Ones &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
