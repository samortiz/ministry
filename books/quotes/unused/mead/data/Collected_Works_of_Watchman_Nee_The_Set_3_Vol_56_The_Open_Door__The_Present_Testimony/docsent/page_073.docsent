   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Treasure Manifested in Earthen Vessels</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many people have a concept of an ideal Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Please remember that this ideal was created by us, not by God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That kind of ideal Christian does not exist, nor does God want us to be such.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we meet an earthen vessel, but the special characteristic of this earthen vessel is that a treasure has been put into it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The treasure transcends and overshadows the earthen vessel and manifests itself from within the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the meaning of Christianity and of being a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Paul, we see a man who was afraid yet strong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was troubled in his heart yet had hope.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was surrounded by enemies yet was not captured.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although he met with persecution, he did not feel rejected or cast aside.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He seemingly was knocked down, but he did not die 2 Cor 4:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We see his weaknesses, but when he was weak, he was powerful 12:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We see him bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, but the life of Jesus was manifested in his body 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We see him being slandered, but he had a good name.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He seemingly led others astray, but he was honest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He seemingly was not famous, but everyone knew him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He seemingly was about to die, but he lived.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He seemingly was punished, but not unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He seemingly was sad, but he always rejoiced.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He seemingly was poor, but he made many rich.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He seemingly had nothing, but he had everything 6:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a real Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is true Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A Christian is a person in whom there is a basic, but harmonious, paradox.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christianity means having a life in which there is an incomprehensible, spiritual paradox.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God gives us this paradox.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some people think there is only a treasure but not an earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Others think that the earthen vessel prevents them from going on.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Human thought is always so extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We think it would be ideal just having the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We think that the earthen vessel prevents us from going on.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before God, however, we see a treasure placed in earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The earthen vessel is not destroyed, and it does not frustrate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The treasure is in the earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's Power Being Manifested in Man's Weakness</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The apostle said that he had a thorn in his flesh 2 Cor 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not know what this thorn was, but I know this thorn made Paul weak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He prayed to the Lord about the matter three times, hoping the Lord would remove the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the Lord said to him, "My grace is sufficient for you" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord said even though the thorn in his flesh made Paul weak, His power was perfected in this weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How is the Lord's power perfected in human weakness?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He said, "My power will tabernacle over your weakness," which means "My power will overshadow or cover your weakness."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christianity does not eliminate weaknesses, nor does it only look to the Lord's power.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christianity means that the Lord's power is manifested in man's weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christianity does not mean that a new race of strange angels is created on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christianity means that man's weaknesses can manifest God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Let me give an example.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once I had a very serious illness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I was x-rayed three times in two months, and each time the report was very grave.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I prayed, I believed, and I hoped that God would cure my illness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At times my strength was greater than normal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before God, I confessed that I had been empowered, but I was angry because I did not know the reason God was treating me this way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At certain times I would be well and full of strength, but I would relapse without warning.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What was the use of God giving me this temporary strength?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I was very sick at heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One day as I was reading the Bible, I came across 2 Corinthians 12.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul prayed to God three times about that thorn, but the Lord was not willing to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Instead, He said, "My grace is sufficient for you."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord increased His grace because of the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord increased his power because of the weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I saw what Christianity was.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As I lay in bed, I asked the Lord to show me more clearly what this was all about.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Inwardly, I had the impression of a boat in a river.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The boat required ten feet of water for navigation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the river, however, a submerged rock rose five feet from the bottom of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If the Lord so desired, He could remove the boulder to let the boat pass, but within there was a question: "Would it be better for Me to remove the rock or to increase the water level by five feet?"</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God asked me if it would be better to remove the boulder or to increase the water level by five feet.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I told the Lord that it would be better to increase the water level by five feet.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>From that day onward many of my difficulties were gone.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I dare not say that I was never tempted again, but praise God, from that matter I discovered God has other ways to meet our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I repeat, Christianity does not remove the boulder; it increases the water level by five feet.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Are there difficulties?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Yes, we all have difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Are there trials?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Yes, we all are tried.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Are there weaknesses?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Yes, we all have weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Please remember one thing, however, that the Lord does not eliminate our weaknesses on the negative side nor give us unwarranted power on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God's power is manifested in weakness, just as our treasure is in earthen vessels.</S>
