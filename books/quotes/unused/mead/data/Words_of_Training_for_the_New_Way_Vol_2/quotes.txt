[2]  Chapter 13: The Steps to Lead People in the New Way 1
[3]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE STEPS TO LEAD PEOPLE IN THE NEW WAY 1 Scripture Reading: Acts 4:8; 13:9; 2 Cor 4:13; Rom 10:12-13; 2 Tim 2:22; 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 14:26; Heb 10:25; Rom 10:9; Eph 5:18-19; Col 3:16 PREACHING THE GOSPEL BY HOME VISITATION
[4]  In the last three years, I have been speaking on the new way.
[5]  The purpose of that speaking was to have a complete rearrangement according to the Bible in the ways of meeting and service which we have had for the past sixty years.
[6]  I have said before that the big meetings and the small meetings are like the two wings of an airplane; you cannot afford to lose either one.
[7]  Today in the Lord s recovery, if we want the Lord to have a way in the matter of gospel preaching, we must follow this example of the Lord who was incarnated and humbled to visit people, and go to visit people s homes to bring the gospel to them.
[8]  In this way, after they have become stable and have attained to a certain level of practice in speaking the Lord s word, you can further bring them to the big meetings so they will know that there are big meetings as well as small meetings in the church.
[9]  The most crucial step to lead people in the new way is the step of meeting.
[10]  In the last two thousand years, this has been a matter every seeker of the Lord has been concerned about, and this has also been a big problem that all the denominations of Christianity faced when they were first established.
[11]  THE TRUE WORSHIP OF GOD IN THE NEW TESTAMENT
[12]  When the Lord Jesus was thirty years old, He came out to fulfill His ministry for God.
[13]  I hope that your concept can be thoroughly changed so that you no longer would appreciate the traditional things of Christianity such as the magnificent chapels and the sermons given by famous preachers.
[14]  THE STEPS TO LEAD PEOPLE IN THE NEW WAY Leading People to Know the Lord Jesus
[15]  as the Spirit and to Call upon His Name
[16]  When you go out to visit people to preach the gospel, right after getting them saved or in the next visit, you need to lead them to know this Jesus in whom we have believed.
[17]  Now, we may not be speaking on justification or sanctification, but if we are calling on the Lord s name every day, walking according to the Spirit, burning in spirit, and speaking the Lord s word to people, this is the justified behavior and the sanctified living.
[18]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE INCLUSIVENESS OF THE NEW WAY 1
[19]  This morning I want to fellowship with you concerning the inclusiveness of the new way.
[20]  From the first day I mentioned the need to change the system and take the new way, I heard that a very small number of saints among us had different opinions, especially after we had the gospel preaching by visiting people.
[21]  When we began to take this way, we were not quite sure of the way of doing things; however, we have seen quite clearly the principle and the emphasis.
[22]  In the Subjective Aspect of Practice Preaching the Gospel
[23]  We have already covered the new way in the objective aspect of the truth.
[24]  Within the past three years, we conducted much research.
[25]  Visiting people s homes by door-knocking for preaching the gospel is our first step.
[26]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE INCLUSIVENESS OF THE NEW WAY 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 20:9-14; Luke 14:23 THE KEY TO THE MEETINGS IN THE NEW WAY
[27]  As a continuation of the preceding message, I would like to add a few final words.
[28]  The problem with the meetings is not whether they are big or small, but whether they have one person speaking with the rest listening or everyone speaking and listening to one another.
[29]  It is not an easy thing to have everyone speaking in the meeting.
[30]  It is easy to have a meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening as long as you can find a speaker and have the seats ready.
[31]  However, it is difficult to have every attendant speak because in the Christian meetings one should not speak ordinary words, but the words of God.
[32]  To speak the word of God we have to first speak of the Triune God.
[33]  This morning we will consider the focal point of the change of the system, which is the speaking of the Lord s word.
[34]  The degradation and failure of Christianity and its greatest lack lies in the fact that the believers do not speak the Lord s word.
[35]  Luke 1 records three examples of speaking for the Lord.
[36]  If today the Holy Spirit is poured out upon you as He was upon Mary, I am afraid that you will not be able to speak the same words as Mary did because you lack God s word in your daily life.
[37]  When Zachariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, he prophesied, saying, Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because He has visited and accomplished redemption for His people, and raised a horn of salvation for us in the house of David His servant, even as He spoke through the mouth of His holy prophets from of old salvation from our enemies, and out of the hand of all those who hate us; to show mercy to our fathers, and to remember His holy covenant, the oath which He swore to Abraham our father, to grant us that, having been delivered out of the hand of our enemies, we might serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.
[38]  We have already mentioned that Christians are those who speak for the Lord.
[39]  Whenever Christians are gathered together, their meeting should be for speaking the Lord s word.
[40]  When we go to the new believers, we also teach them in the same way little by little, just as a mother teaches her child to speak.
[41]  AT ALL TIMES Scripture Reading: Eph 5:18-19; Col 3:16
[42]  The church in Taipei has made the decision to practice the new system in the one hundred gospel tents formed during the gospel festival.
[43]  According to our experience, although the meetings with one speaking and the rest listening can meet certain people s needs and maintain a certain kind of situation, in reality, they do not edify the saints, much less do they perfect the saints as described in Ephesians 4:12.
[44]  But when we speak, we seldom speak the Scriptures that we have read, and seldom do we speak the Lord s word; we have not yet built up this habit.
[45]  This morning we want to spend some time to study further the things we should do in the present stage.
[46]  At present, we have over eighty meetings in different districts in Taipei.
[47]  I feel that the brothers and sisters should seize this opportunity, not just to shout and yell as we did formerly, but rather, to practice speaking the Lord s word.
[48]  First, I would ask you how you bring people from the home meetings to the group meetings and how you make them interested in the group meeting.
[49]  I am happy for you, because there is a rare opportunity for you to learn to serve the Lord in this environment.
[50]  You can practice speaking for the Lord in the district meetings on the one hand, and learn to take care of home meetings and group meetings on the other hand.
[51]  But how to take the whole church on so that the whole church will be on the right track, how to help the saints to have a life in the Word, in prayer, and in the enjoyment of the Lord s table, as well as how to have gospel activities, these are your responsibility.
[52]  CHAPTER TWENTY CONCERNING THE MEETINGS IN THE NEW WAY
[53]  According to the present situation, among all the meetings of the new way, the group meeting is a very complicated one.
[54]  In the group meeting there are those who have been saved for a longer time as well as the newly baptized ones; those who attend the district meetings as well as those who do not attend them; those who break bread in the homes, and those who break bread in the group meetings.
[55]  Hence, in practice, we need much of the Lord s grace that we may meet all the needs when we serve, and may be able to coordinate the serving ones from all the different areas together.
[56]  Now what kind of life these in the local churches should live in order to express the Body of Christ is what we want to take care of in this training.
[57]  Our training is to regenerate, sanctify, and transform those who are chosen and called by God, so that they would become the Body of Christ to be expressed in the different localities.
[58]  Hence, you must seek for a revival; you must pray, confess, and consecrate yourself to God, and you must adjust your spiritual life so that you would have a new beginning before the Lord.
[59]  I hope these words will give you a deep impression that you will have a new beginning and be revived from within: those who did not taste the Lord before will now be able to taste the Lord, those who did not enter into the Lord s words before can now enter in. In this way, your spirit will be strong, and you will be rich in the enjoyment of the Lord s word.
[60]  Then when you come to the meetings, you will speak the Lord s word.
[61]  By the time you go to work and meet your colleagues, or when you go to school and meet your classmates, you should speak the word of the Lord at any time.
[62]  Since October of 1984 when we first mentioned the change of the system, we have been practicing small group meetings here in Taipei.
[63]  THE CONTENT OF GROUP MEETINGS With Humanity and Avoiding Leaven
[64]  Now let us consider the content of group meetings.
[65]  Although in 1986 the number in the small groups increased from three thousand to over five thousand with an increase rate of seventy-five percent, the content of our group meetings has never been uplifted.
[66]  Concerning the content of group meetings, I would say that in principle we should have freedom for development.
[67]  When you take care of a group meeting, you need to consider the practical environment and the need.
[68]  Besides this, you may share in the meeting in a spontaneous way what you have enjoyed in fellowshipping with the Lord and reading the Lord s word recently.
[69]  BY THE FULL-TIME SERVING ONES Learning Not to React
[70]  I would like to present all the situations to you, so that you will know where you are, what you are doing, and what your goal is.
[71]  CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO TAKING IN THE LORD S WORD
[72]  AND BEING EXERCISED IN IT Scripture Reading: Col 3:16; Heb 5:13-14
[73]  This morning, we come to the matter of speaking in the meetings.
[74]  I mentioned at the beginning that the key to meeting is speaking.
[75]  When the Brethren were raised up by the Lord, their influence was mainly due to their speaking.
[76]  On the one hand, we like to go in; on the other hand, the ones behind the door have to let us in. Many times we have locked our doors tight and would not let the Lord come in. But as soon as we would give a crack for the Lord s word, the Lord would come in.
[77]  Hence, not only do you have to practice speaking in the meetings, you must also in your daily life let the Lord s word, which is a living Person, gain the ground in you, operate in you, and act freely in you.
[78]  We have seen that the way for Christians to meet as revealed in the Bible is a way of revival and overcoming.
[79]  If we are not revived and overcoming, and if we do not live in the spirit, then we will be through.
[80]  If we want to walk properly in this way, we must be ones who are overcoming, spiritual, living in the spirit, and fellowshipping with the Lord.
[81]  Since we in the Lord s recovery want to return to the Bible to take the way of life, we can no longer expect to have this kind of preaching meeting with one speaking and the rest listening.
[82]  If you would allow the Lord s word to be digested in you, the digested word will become the living and instant word spoken out from within you when you go to the meeting.
[83]  In the past messages I have already pointed out that the proper way to meet and to serve as required in the Bible is an overcoming way by living in the spirit.
[84]  This indicates that when anyone hears the word of the Lord s gospel but does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart so that he cannot be saved.
[85]  This shows a person who hears the Lord s word, receives it, and is regenerated by it, but because of hidden sin and unexposed self within him, the Lord s word is not able to take root and grow in him.
[86]  For the above reason, in the New Testament, beginning from the Gospels, the Lord Jesus told His disciples again and again to be watchful, to watch and pray Matt 24:42; 25:13; 26:38, 41; Luke 21:36 .
[87]  But if you spend twenty or thirty minutes to deal with sins, to pray, and to be filled with the Holy Spirit before going out to knock on doors, your preaching of the gospel will be victorious, and you will experience in a genuine way that the Lord is one with you and that His power and authority are with you.
[88]  Our door-knocking to save people is just the first step.
[89]  In the next step we need to care for the new ones we have gained.
[90]  I believe you have experienced this one thing, that is, if you are not an overcomer, if you would not live absolutely in the spirit, put aside the world, and deny the self, it will be difficult to take care of a home meeting or a group meeting.
[91]  We who serve the Lord can exhort others to love the Lord, to be spiritual, to study the Bible, to pray, to deny the self, and to reject the flesh, but what is important is whether we ourselves have these experiences, and whether we are such persons.
[92]  Especially you full-time trainees, you who have given up everything to be for the Lord, should be ones who fellowship with the Lord every day, dealing with Him, living according to the spirit, and having genuine experiences in your daily lives.
[93]  When you come to the meetings, whether large or small, spontaneously you will be able to release something from within.
[94]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR BEING A MAN WITH A VISION Scripture Reading: Acts 26:18-19; Phil 3:13-14; 2 Tim 4:7-8 THE VISION OF THE LORD BEING AMONG US
[95]  Since 1984 when I returned to Taipei, I have been very clear that the Lord s changing of the system must start from Taiwan.
[96]  If the Lord s recovery is without such a change, and if there are no full-timers raised up, there will gradually be no way to go on.
[97]  The way of Christianity eventually leads to a dead end. For this reason, the Lord raised up His recovery among us.
[98]  We know that Paul was originally a stout defender of Judaism.
[99]  He inherited the tradition from his fathers and was excessively zealous for religion, trying his best to persecute and ravage the church of God.
[100]  One day, while he was on his way to Damascus to bind all those who called on the name of the Lord, the Lord met him and spoke to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?
[101]  Moreover, this vision included the way that he walked the rest of his life, as recorded in Acts 26:17b-18: To whom the people of Israel and the Gentiles I the Lord send you, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me. From that day on, what Paul preached and worked was fully controlled by the vision he saw; he never deviated from it.
[102]  This is why in Romans 10 it says that Christ is the word and He is near you, in your mouth and in your heart v. 8 . Now all you need to do is believe in your heart and confess with your mouth and call O Lord Jesus, and He, the Spirit, will enter into your spirit to be mingled with your spirit to become one spirit with you.
