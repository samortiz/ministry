<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Spirit's Mingling with the Body of Christ<br>in the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity</H2><P>In this oneness there is the mingling of the Spirit with the Body of Christ. In this mingling there is a divine dispensing. Whether we realize it or not, this dispensing is going on all the time. It is like the digestion and assimilation of food in our human body. Every day digestion goes on without us realizing it. It is only when our stomach is sick that we have any feeling. When our digestive system is working properly, we do not feel anything.</P><P>The Spirit is dispensing, moving, anointing, and operating within us all the time in a smooth way. When He is dispensing, we may not feel anything. But if we do not go along with Him, He will be grieved. This is why Ephesians 4:30 says that we should not grieve the Holy Spirit. When the Spirit is grieved, it means that He is frustrated from working within us. The Pentecostal Christians consider the experience of the Spirit as something extraordinary; but actually, the dispensing of the Spirit works in a very normal way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Spirit Being<br>the Essence of the Body of Christ</H2><P>This Spirit is the intrinsic essence of the Body of Christ. As such an essence, He is sealing us day by day (Eph. 1:13; 4:30). We are not only sealed by the Spirit, but are, even more, sealed with the Spirit. The Spirit is the sealing ink. He is not only the One who seals but also the ink with which we are sealed. This sealing ink never dries. It remains wet within us all the time. As it is sealing, it is also saturating and permeating. We are like a piece of paper. Day by day the Spirit as the essence is saturating us. His saturating is His dispensing. This dispensing continues quietly within us until we are fully permeated by the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Spirit Bringing In the Hope of Glory<br>Which is Christ in the Believers<br>as the Hope of God's Calling</H2><P>This kind of dispensing of the Spirit brings in a hope (Col. 1:27; Eph. 1:18). This hope is the redemption of our body, in which our entire body will be soaked and permeated with the glory of God. Today Christ is hidden within us as our life. But in that day, the hidden Christ will become manifested as our glory (Col. 3:4). He will permeate from our spirit through our soul and to our body. That will be the aggregate and the totality of God's divine dispensing in us.</P>
