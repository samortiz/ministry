   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Getting Settled in the World Where Satan's Throne Is</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Revelation 2:13 the Lord Jesus said to the church in Pergamos, "I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Satan's dwelling place is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because the church entered into union with the world and became worldly herself, she began to dwell where Satan dwells in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church in Pergamos also dwelt where Satan's throne is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This again refers to the world, which is not only Satan's dwelling place but also the sphere wherein he rules.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Holding the Teaching of the Gentile Prophet to Eat Idol Sacrifices and to Commit Fornication</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 2:14 the Lord said, "I have a few things against you, because you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to commit fornication."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Balaam was a Gentile prophet who caused God's people to stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For the sake of reward 2 Pet 2:15; Jude 11 , he brought fornication and idolatry to God's people Num 25:1-3; 31:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the worldly church some began to teach the same things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the worldly church disregarded the name, the person, of the Lord, she turned to idolatry, which issued in fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The teachings of Balaam always cause people to enter into union with the worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is to eat idol sacrifices and to commit spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fornication actually denotes confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to God's holy ordination, a woman should have only one husband.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To have more than one husband is to commit fornication, and this brings in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Spiritual fornication is fully related to idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should love God, our unique Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if we worship idols, we make these idols husbands to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, in principle, worshipping idols is the same as fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Holding the Teaching of Clergy to Build Up Hierarchy</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Revelation 2:15 the Lord went on to say, "You also have those who hold in like manner the teaching of the Nicolaitans."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Nicolaitans" is an equivalent of the Greek word nikolaitai, the root of which is nikolaos, composed of two words: niko, meaning "conquer" or "above others" and laos, meaning "common people," "secular people," or "laity."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, nikolaos means "conquering the common people," "climbing above the laity."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Nicolaitans, then, must refer to a group of people who esteemed themselves higher than the common believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the church in Pergamos their works Rev 2:6 progressed into a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They not only practiced the hierarchy but also taught it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This hierarchy destroys the function of the believers as members of the Body of Christ, thus annulling the Lord's Body in expressing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord's Promise to the Overcomers of This Stage</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 2:17 we have the Lord's promise to the overcomers of this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To overcome here means specifically to overcome the church's union with the world, the teaching of idolatry and fornication, and the teaching of the hierarchy.</S>
