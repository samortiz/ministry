<h2 class="head1">CONSTANTLY MAKING PROGRESS IN THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Some people have said that in the life-study messages there are many new, deep terms that are hard for ordinary saints to understand. In recent years American educators have discovered that as our era progresses, the knowledge of our children progresses along with it. The things that we thought children would not understand are now easy for them to understand. The things which children are able to understand according to their intelligence far surpass the contents of their textbooks. For example, computer classes are now beginning to be taught in elementary school, so many households are buying computers for children under the age of ten to practice on and use. This is worth our consideration.</p>
<p>The principle is the same in considering the development of Christianity in China. The first step was taken when the Western missionaries spoke messages about joy and peace in order to get people to accept their preaching. They told people that as soon as they believed in God they would be blessed, obtain profit, and enjoy peace. This kind of speaking at the very beginning matched people&rsquo;s psychology, because in this world the human life is mainly a life of suffering and troubles, and everyone wants blessings, prosperity, and peace. Actually, people can understand this kind of preaching without any explanation. It is preached for the purpose of lifting people&rsquo;s hearts and producing a desire and willingness to believe in the Lord Jesus for the forgiveness of sins, the obtaining of peace, and the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s blessing. However, if we stop there, after a long time man&rsquo;s heart will become cold. This is why those missionaries gradually improved their speaking and spoke about some basic truths in the Bible, telling people that there is one God who is the holy and righteous One and that this One sent His only begotten Son to shed His blood and die for us to redeem us from our sins and to save us from eternal perdition into eternal life. Today this is where many Christians have stopped.</p>
<p>There are, however, many deep truths in the Bible. The fourteen Epistles of Paul alone have many deep and high truths. For example, Ephesians 1:10 says, &ldquo;Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; It is very hard to understand this kind of word, but over the past twenty to thirty years the Lord has revealed to us these deep, high truths in the Bible. Our knowledge of the truth has not only been constantly progressing, but the younger we are, the more room there is for progress.</p>
<p>When computers first entered the homes, many among the older generation did not understand anything and could only listen to their grandchildren talk about computers. In the end they were still confused about things like software and hardware. Then one day the grandchildren turned on the computer in front of the older ones and demonstrated as they played, explaining what software is and what hardware is. Thus, the older ones were able to understand through the practical teaching of the grandchildren. In the same way we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery should have a change in our concepts about the truth. We must not remain stuck in our old ways.</p>
<p>Items such as God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s dispensing, the essential Spirit, and the economical Spirit are certainly very deep terms, but to the new believers, especially the young ones, they will not seem deep for very long. These new ones will gradually become familiar with the terms, and then they will clearly understand them. We must be willing to change our concepts and must encourage the young ones to learn the highest and deepest truths. I believe that if we do so, in the future when the saints speak to each other and even when they preach the gospel, their speaking will be of the very highest quality. We will not need to charge them to preach the high gospel instead of the gospel of prosperity and peace. As soon as they open their mouths, the high truths will spontaneously come out. Today we may feel that this is not so easy, but very soon they will be using the terms <em>the essential Spirit</em> and <em>the economical Spirit</em> when they preach the gospel to others. The saints just need to be able to simply say, &ldquo;Friend, we all are sinners; we all need the essential Spirit to get into us and regenerate us, giving us an inward change in our element. Moreover, God will also give us the economical Spirit so that we may be full of power in our living and actions.&rdquo; Do not think that people will not understand this word. Actually, we are the ones who do not understand it, so we think others will be just like us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SPEAK THE PROFOUND TRUTHS</h2>
<p>We all know that in a child&rsquo;s learning process the child needs his parents to constantly give him input. For example, when he learns about love or smiling, the parents must keep telling him on the one hand and demonstrating to him on the other until he gradually understands the concept. Sometimes the parents must speak about things many times before the child can understand what they mean. Thus, learning comes from hearing. From now on, regardless of whether we are preaching the gospel or speaking God&rsquo;s word, we should not be afraid that people will not understand when we speak the profound truths. We must realize that these truths are actually what touch people the most.</p>
<p>Moreover, in a way it does not matter whether we speak something deep or shallow. The most important point is that we must learn the secret, the practical technique, of speaking. If we do not have the technique or secret, people will not understand us even when we speak the shallowest truths. If we learn the secret, we will be able to use very simple words to speak the deepest matters, and we will be able to bring people into spiritual reality. For example, when learning to use the computer, we cannot just have empty knowledge but must also pick up the right techniques. Then, when a computer is placed before us, we will know how to set it up, operate it, use it, and even teach others.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has the highest truths. Thus, if we learn the techniques, when we preach the gospel to people, we will be able to appropriately use the highest truths in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and say, &ldquo;Friend, we are all sinners without God inside of us. We do not have the nature of God, but as soon as we repent of our sins and turn to Him, God&rsquo;s essential Spirit enters into us, causing us to be regenerated and have God&rsquo;s life and nature. This is God&rsquo;s entering into us as our essence. Even more than this, after we are regenerated, if we are willing to deal with our sins and apply the Lord&rsquo;s blood for a thorough washing, then God&rsquo;s economical Spirit will be poured out upon us, making us full of power.&rdquo; I believe that anyone who hears such a word will be able to understand it. When new believers enter into the church life, if they are taught in this way, they will be able to quickly understand the proper meaning of each spiritual term, and they will be able to apply each one practically in their daily lives.</p>
<p>I hope that the standard of truth will be constantly raised higher among the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We cannot remain in the shallow gospel truths such as peace and prosperity, Christ&rsquo;s incarnation to save sinners, His crucifixion to accomplish redemption, and God&rsquo;s love for the world. Although these things are right, they are still elementary, basic, and beginning truths. We must go up to the high peak. It is just like in the elementary schools today, where what they are teaching is much higher than what was taught ten or twenty years ago. Yet the children are still able to learn these things because the entire standard has been uplifted. Even in the daily conversation in the homes we can find that the standard among the children has been raised; many of them use terms in a familiar way that we never understood when we were young. In the same way, when many people were young, they did not understand such truths as the essential Spirit, the economical Spirit, or the dispensing of the Triune God, but now the young people all speak about these things, and their speaking is true and logical. This is what it means when people say that the students can go farther than the teachers.</p>
<p>May we all be able to really perfect the young people in the truth and encourage them to enter into the depths of the Lord&rsquo;s word. This is why we have a burden to recommend and promote the life-study messages. I hope that we would all be able to study and apply them and that we would teach the young people well so that they would receive the real help. If we do this, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will have a wonderful future.</p>
