[1]  This message is a foreword to the life-study of the Gospel of John.
[2]  We need to have an overview of the Bible as a whole.
[3]  Many times in the past we have stressed that the Bible covers two main matters Christ and the church.
[4]  When we speak of Christ and the church, we must realize that Christ is life and that the church is a building.
[5]  If you read the life-study messages on Genesis 1, you will see that God s creation was focused on life.
[6]  After creating man God placed him in front of the tree of life, indicating that He wanted man to take Him in as life.
[7]  While Abraham lived in the tent, his nephew fell into the city of Sodom which was another counterfeit building of Satan Gen 13:12-13; 18:20; 19:1 .
[8]  According to history, Babel was a city of idols, and Sodom was a city of sin.
[9]  With Babel and Sodom as the background, God, according to His selection, visited Jacob, a supplanter.
[10]  Jacob knew nothing of God s selection; he only knew how to be crafty.
[11]  Seventy years after the destruction of the temple some of the Jewish people returned from their captivity and rebuilt the temple Ezra 1:2-5 .
[12]  The rebuilding of the temple was the recovery of God s building.
[13]  Following the rebuilding of the temple came the rebuilding of Jerusalem Neh 2:17-18 .
[14]  In Matthew 16:18 the Lord prophesied that He would build the church, which is the fulfillment of both the tabernacle and the temple as God s habitation on earth.
[15]  OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN A. An Extract of the Whole Bible
[16]  We have seen that the Bible is a book of life and building and that the Gospel of John is also focused on life and building.
[17]  The Gospel of John reveals that in Christ, the Word of God, is life 1:4 ; that He came that man may have life 10:10b ; and that He Himself is life 11:25; 14:6 .
[18]  Furthermore, this gospel shows us that Christ is the bread of life 6:35 ; that He has the water of life 4:14 ; that He gives life to man 5:21 ; and that He even lives in man as life 14:19 .
[19]  LIFE AND BUILDING 1 I. THE WORD, WHO WAS GOD,
[20]  TO BRING FORTH THE CHILDREN OF GOD A. In the Beginning the Word
[21]  The Word is the definition, explanation, and expression of God; hence, it is God defined, explained, and expressed.
[22]  I like the way the Recovery Version of John renders verse 3.
[23]  All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being.
[24]  John 1:4 says, In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
[25]  It is absolutely true that the life is the light of men.
[26]  When we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, receiving Him into us, the divine life came into our being.
[27]  Immediately we had the sense of something shining within, but perhaps, at that time, we did not have the language or the utterance to describe it.
[28]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE THREE AN INTRODUCTION TO LIFE AND BUILDING 2
[29]  In the previous message we saw that Christ, as the Word, came as life and light for the purpose of bringing forth many children to be God s enlargement and corporate expression.
[30]  In this message we come to the second section of John 1, which is composed of verses 14 through 18.
[31]  John 1:1-13 tells us that Christ came to produce the children of God; verses 14-18 indicate that all the children of God need the enjoyment of Christ.
[32]  When He was in the flesh, He was the tabernacle of God among men.
[33]  According to the history in the Old Testament, there was among the people on earth a tabernacle, and in that tabernacle God was present.
[34]  Whenever we enjoy God, we not only have grace, but also reality.
[35]  When God is enjoyed by us, we have enjoyment, that is, grace, and when we have this enjoyment, we realize the reality of God.
[36]  It means the realization of God and the reality of God.
[37]  JESUS AS THE LAMB OF GOD WITH THE SPIRIT
[38]  In this message we come to the last part of the first chapter of the Gospel of John vv.
[39]  The main subject of this passage is Jesus as the Lamb of God, with the Holy Spirit as the dove, making the believers stones for the building of the house of God with the Son of Man.
[40]  If I had written this portion of the Word, I would have used only seven or eight verses, telling how the Pharisees inquired of John whether or not he was the Messiah, Elijah, or the prophet, how John baptized people in water, how he introduced Jesus as the Lamb of God with the dove descending and abiding on Him, how five disciples were attracted to the Lord and began to follow Him, and how the name of one of them was changed.
[41]  When John saw Jesus coming, what did he say?
[42]  C. To Produce Stones for God s Building 1.
[43]  The Lamb with the dove attracted people to follow Him.
[44]  When John the Baptist said, Behold, the Lamb of God, two of his disciples were drawn to Him, and John was very happy about it.
[45]  And He said to him, Truly, truly I say to you, you shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man v. 51 . The ancient Jews knew that this was a reference to Jacob s dream Gen 28:10-22 . When Jacob was fleeing from his brother, he slept one night in the open air, using a stone for a pillow.
[46]  He dreamed that he saw heaven opened and a ladder set up on the earth which reached to heaven and on which angels were ascending and descending.
[47]  When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven Gen 28:17 .
[48]  Christ, as the Son of Man with His humanity, is the ladder which is set up on the earth and leads to heaven, keeping heaven open to earth and joining earth to heaven for the house of God.
[49]  Jacob poured oil the symbol of the Holy Spirit, the last Person of the Triune God to reach man upon the stone symbol of the transformed man that it might be the house of God.
[50]  In this one chapter, we can see the beginning, the Word, God, creation, life, light, the many children of God brought forth in life, the flesh, the tabernacle, grace, reality, the full declaration of God, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world, and the dove which regenerates, anoints, transforms, unites, and builds; we can see a stone, a ladder, an open heaven, and the house of God.
[51]  In this message we shall cover John 1 as a whole, reviewing some points that we have already covered and touching upon other points that we have not yet considered.
[52]  Verse 51 refers to eternity in the future, for when the Lord told Nathanael that he would see the heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man, He was not speaking about the present, but about eternity in the future.
[53]  How can God, who had no humanity in eternity past, have humanity in eternity future as His dwelling place?
[54]  In eternity past God planned and purposed, but He did not do anything.
[55]  Without creation there would have been no way for God to be incarnated.
[56]  Creation brought things into being, and incarnation brought God into His creation.
[57]  The anointing comes by way of the dove, the Spirit, which is the continuation of the Lamb.
[58]  The Lamb has removed sin and terminated the old creation, and the dove, the Spirit, has come to regenerate, impart life, transform, unite, and build.
[59]  The Gospel of John is not as simple as many people think.
[60]  When John wrote his gospel, he was one hundred percent under the anointing of the dove, the Spirit.
[61]  Although some expositors of the Gospel of John say that the introduction includes only the first eighteen verses of chapter one, the Lord has shown us that the entire first chapter is an introduction.
[62]  Some may ask, How could Jesus come in resurrection when He had not been crucified yet?
[63]  Before doing the miracle, the Lord told the people to fill the waterpots with water 2:6-7 .
[64]  These water containers, made of stone, were six in number.
[65]  In this book, all the miracles done by the Lord are called signs 2:23; 3:2; 4:54; 6:2, 14, 26, 30; 7:31; 9:16; 10:41; 11:47; 12:18, 37; 20:30 .
[66]  They are miracles, but they are used as signs to signify the matter of life.
[67]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE SEVEN LIFE S PURPOSE II.
[68]  LIFE S PURPOSE TO BUILD THE HOUSE OF GOD
[69]  It is quite interesting to see that in John chapter two we firstly have the case of changing water into wine 2:1-11 and then, following that, the case of dealing with the temple 2:12-22 .
[70]  We must believe that both of these cases were recorded for the purpose of signifying something beyond the mere account of historical events.
[71]  Why does the dealing with the temple follow the changing of death into life?
[72]  In the incident of the Lord s changing water into wine, we saw the principle of life, that is, to change death into life.
[73]  Verse 17 says, His disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of Your house shall devour Me. Within the Lord Jesus there was a zeal for the house of God.
[74]  This zeal devoured Him, ate Him up, consumed Him.
[75]  The physical body of Jesus was destroyed on the cross by the Jews.
[76]  When Christ became flesh, He took on a physical body.
[77]  Since the day of His physical resurrection, the Lord Jesus has been enlarging His Body in resurrection life.
[78]  What an immense Body Christ has today in His resurrection!
[79]  After the principle of life and the purpose of life have been set forth in John chapter two, from chapter three through chapter eleven the writer then relates nine cases to prove the principle of life set forth in the first sign in chapter two.
[80]  He uses these cases to signify some spiritual and meaningful points.
[81]  These cases first expose the condition and need of man, and then they reveal how the Lord can deal with all the conditions and meet all the needs of man.
[82]  We must realize that life here means the Lord Himself, the Word which was God and which became flesh.
[83]  Although the Lord might have dealt with thousands of human cases, John selected only nine of them to illustrate how the Lord as life could and still can meet the need of every human case.
[84]  THE LORD S SUFFICIENCY IN MEETING MAN S NEED
[85]  We have seen the condition and need of man in these nine cases.
[86]  Now we must see how the Lord is able to come into man s fallen condition and meet his every need.
[87]  In every case, the Lord presents Himself as the One who could fulfill the deficiencies of man.
[88]  The first case shows that the Lord can afford us regeneration, which even a superior person such as Nicodemus needed that he might have the life of God for the entrance into the kingdom of God.
[89]  All aspects of the Lord s work as shown and signified in these nine cases are the different aspects of the Lord s full salvation, which are 1 regeneration, 2 the satisfaction with the living water, 3 the healing power of life, 4 the enlivening with the power of life, 5 the feeding with the bread of life, 6 the quenching of thirst with the rivers of living water, 7 the deliverance from sin, 8 the opening of the blind eyes, and 9 resurrection.
[90]  The first case, that of Nicodemus, is the case of regeneration.
[91]  Nicodemus was a person of the highest class, and we need to consider his virtues and attributes.
[92]  Due to human culture and Jewish religion, Nicodemus thought that man needed to behave.
[93]  Since man must have good conduct and worship God in a proper way, man needs much teaching.
[94]  Nicodemus considered Christ to be a teacher come from God.
[95]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE NINE THE NEED OF THE MORAL PEOPLE
[96]  Nicodemus thought that to be born anew was to go back to his mother s womb and come out of it again.
[97]  He did not realize that even if that could be done he would still be flesh.
[98]  To be born anew is not to be born again of our parents, but to be born of God the Spirit that we may have His divine life with His divine nature, a life with a nature absolutely different from our natural life with its nature.
[99]  John 3:8 says, The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.
[100]  In verse 3 the Lord said, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God, and in verse 5 He said, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[101]  Nicodemus was still puzzled and asked, How can these things be?
[102]  The Lord Jesus said in return, You are the teacher of Israel, and you don t know these things?
[103]  When Christ was lifted up on the cross, Satan, the devil, the old serpent, was dealt with John 12:31-33; Heb 2:14 .
[104]  This means that the serpentine nature within fallen man has been dealt with by the death of Christ.
[105]  a. The Son of God Coming to Save Man
[106]  Verse 17 says, For God did not send the Son into the world that He might judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.
[107]  Christ, the Son of God, was sent to save us from God s condemnation, which was caused by the sin of Adam.
[108]  In verses 15, 16, 18, and 36, the Lord said, That everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life ; that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life ; he who believes in Him is not judged ; he who believes in the Son has eternal life.
[109]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE TEN THE INCREASE OF CHRIST
[110]  When I was young, many things in the Bible bothered me, one of which is in John chapter three.
[111]  Although this chapter is so elevated, speaking about the rebirth, it seemed to me that suddenly, beginning at verse 22, it became rather low.
[112]  Verse 22 says, After these things, Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea; and there He stayed with them and baptized.
[113]  John wrote his gospel under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.
[114]  By his words we can see that all the regenerated followers of Christ are His increase.
[115]  This means that in this chapter on regeneration, regeneration is not only to bring the divine life into the believers and annul the satanic nature in their flesh, but also to make them the corporate bride for Christ s increase.
[116]  If all of today s Christian preachers and leaders would say, Lord, let my following be Yours that You may increase and that I may decrease, there would be no problem.
[117]  Verse 34 says, For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for He gives the Spirit not by measure.
[118]  Some versions render this verse incorrectly, saying that God the Father gives the Spirit to the Son without measure.
[119]  However, if you study the best manuscripts, you will see that it means that the Son gives the Spirit without measure to God s people.
[120]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE ELEVEN THE NEED OF THE IMMORAL
[121]  In this message we come to the case of the Samaritan woman in John 4.
[122]  This case is the second of the nine cases.
[123]  The case of the Samaritan woman reveals that Christ is real satisfaction.
[124]  While Nicodemus was a pure-blooded Jew, the Samaritan woman was of mixed blood.
[125]  Undoubtedly, this Samaritan woman had been foreknown and predestinated by God the Father in eternity past Rom 8:29 .
[126]  In verses 9 through 14 we see the contrast between the emptiness of religion s tradition and the fullness of life s living water.
[127]  The Samaritan woman asked the Lord Jesus, Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?
[128]  In John 4:15-26 we see the way to take the living water.
[129]  The living water is good, but if we do not have a way to take it, it means nothing to us.
[130]  Listen to the Lord s words about the matter of worship.
[131]  Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father.
[132]  You worship that which you do not know; we worship that which we know; for salvation is of the Jews.
[133]  But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality; for the Father seeks such to worship Him.
[134]  To contact God the Spirit with her spirit is to drink the living water, and to drink the living water is to render real worship to God.
[135]  The place chosen by God for His habitation typifies the human spirit, where God s habitation is today Ephesians 2:22, an habitation of God through the spirit KJV , should read a dwelling place of God in spirit.
[136]  Hence, when the Lord instructed her to worship God the Spirit in spirit and reality, it meant she should contact God the Spirit in her spirit instead of in a specific place, and through Christ, instead of with the offerings, for now, since Christ the reality has come vv.
[137]  The Lord Jesus told the Samaritan woman that God is Spirit, that worshipping God means to contact Him, and that contacting Him is not a matter of place, but a matter of the human spirit.
[138]  Now we come to the last aspect of the way to take the living water believing that Jesus is the Christ.
[139]  When the Samaritan woman heard the Lord s answer to her question about worship, she still tried to turn away to another subject saying, I know that Messiah is coming, He who is called Christ; when He comes, He will declare all things to us 4:25 .
[140]  In the case of the Samaritan woman we see the picture of a thirsty sinner and a thirsty and hungry Christ.
[141]  Both of them were tired because both had walked a long distance to that well.
[142]  Consequently, the Lord Jesus and the woman were very sympathetic with one another.
[143]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE NEED OF THE DYING LIFE S HEALING I. JESUS COMING BACK TO THE PLACE
[144]  Jesus returned to Cana of Galilee, the place of the weak and fragile people John 4:43-46 .
[145]  Cana is in Galilee, a despised place 7:41, 52 , which signifies the world of a low and mean condition where the weak and fragile people are.
[146]  The Lord was here once during the first sign to change the death water into life wine.
[147]  Now He comes back to the same place to do the second sign, which in the principle of life corresponds with the first sign to change death into life.
[148]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE NEED OF THE IMPOTENT
[149]  In this message we come to the fourth case the need of the impotent John 5:1-47 .
[150]  The central point of this case, on the negative side, is to show the inadequacy of law-keeping in the typical religion.
[151]  The Jews realize that, apart from keeping the law, they have no way to please God, to behave themselves, and to perfect themselves.
[152]  This signifies that under the law-keeping shelter, in religion s fold, there are many people who are blind, unable to see; lame, unable to walk; and withered, being short of life.
[153]  RELIGION S OPPOSITION TO LIFE A. Life s Enlivening
[154]  The Jews then said to the one who was healed, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to pick up your bed 5:10 .
[155]  C. The Son of God Giving Life to the Dead
[156]  Verse 21 says, For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wills.
[157]  In verse 24 we see that whoever hears the word of the Son and believes in Him who sent Him has eternal life and has passed out of death into life.
[158]  Verse 25 says, Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear shall live.
[159]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE NEED OF THE HUNGRY
[160]  It speaks of the divine life and of the functions of this divine life.
[161]  Since it is very difficult to describe them in human language, the Apostle John received the wisdom from the Lord to write his gospel, not only with plain words, but also with figures.
[162]  The Passover in verse 4 signifies Christ as the redeeming Lamb of God who shed His blood for our redemption and gave His flesh for our feeding 1 Cor 5:7 .
[163]  This typifies Christ as the redeeming Lamb of God who was slain that we might eat His flesh and drink His blood, thus taking Him in as the life supply for us to live by.
[164]  The number five signifies responsibility, the responsibility of Christ in feeding us.
[165]  The number five is composed of four plus one.
[166]  It is interesting to note that the five barley loaves and two fishes came from a small boy, not a big man.
[167]  This is very meaningful, because the Lord wants to indicate to us that He is our life, not as someone big, but as someone small.
[168]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE NEED OF THE HUNGRY
[169]  In verses 32 through 71 we find the food that abides to eternal life.
[170]  If we read this portion carefully, we find that the Lord was incarnated, crucified, resurrected to indwell us, and ascended, and we see that He has become the life-giving Spirit who eventually is embodied in His living Word.
[171]  We have seen that incarnation is the first step and that crucifixion is the second.
[172]  Resurrection is the third step by which the Lord has made Himself available as our life.
[173]  Several times in John 6 the Lord mentions something about life and living.
[174]  On the one hand, He said that He was the bread of life; on the other hand, He said that He was the living bread 6:35, 51 .
[175]  Christ, as the bread of life, is embodied in the Word of life.
[176]  Although the Spirit is wonderful, it is too mysterious.
[177]  In verse 63 the Lord says that the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.
[178]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE SEVENTEEN THE NEED OF THE THIRSTY
[179]  We have covered five of the nine cases in this gospel.
[180]  In the first case, the Lord talked with a superior, moral man about the regeneration of life.
[181]  In the second case, the Lord spoke to an inferior, immoral woman about the satisfaction of life.
[182]  I. THE SCENE OF THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES A. In Contrast with the Scene
[183]  of the Feast of the Passover in Chapter Six
[184]  The sixth case is a continuation of the fifth case, because the matter of food is related to water.
[185]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE NEED OF THE THIRSTY
[186]  In chapter five we saw the contrast between life and religion, but the actual persecution had not started yet.
[187]  E. Life s Source and Origin God the Father
[188]  For quite a while I was not happy with the Lord concerning what I felt was His lack of frankness in John 7.
[189]  The Lord Jesus said, He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water 7:38 .
[190]  In 4:14 the Lord said that whoever drinks of the water that He gives us will have in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.
[191]  In chapter seven the Lord goes somewhat further, saying that anyone who drinks of Him will have the flow of the rivers of water of life.
[192]  The Lord did not speak of just one flow but of rivers.
[193]  Rom 15:30; 1 Thes 1:6; 2 Thes 2:13; Gal 5:22-23 of the one unique river of water of life Rev 22:1 , which is God s Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .
[194]  The Spirit of God was there from the very beginning Gen 1:1-2 , but the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , was not yet at the time the Lord Jesus spoke this word, because He was not yet glorified.
[195]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE NINETEEN THE NEED OF THOSE UNDER
[196]  In the record of this gospel, nine cases have been selected to prove that the Lord Jesus is the life and the life supply to people.
[197]  The first six cases, in chapters three through seven, form one group of signs, signifying, on the positive side, the aspects of the Lord as our life and life supply: the regenerating, the satisfying, the healing, the enlivening, the feeding, and the quenching.
[198]  The last three cases, in chapters eight through eleven, form another group of signs, signifying, on the negative side, that the Lord is life to us to deliver us from the three main negative things: sin, blindness, and death.
[199]  This great I Am, God Himself in relation to man, became the Son of Man.
[200]  For Jehovah to become the Son of Man means that He had to humble Himself, to lower Himself.
[201]  Sin is the nature of the devil, and sin, the nature of the devil, is a lie.
[202]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE TWENTY THE NEED OF THOSE UNDER
[203]  LIFE S SETTING FREE 2 F. The Way of Setting Free 1.
[204]  How does the Lord Jesus set us free from sin?
[205]  There is still more in this chapter, for it reveals the person of the Lord.
[206]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE THE NEED OF THE BLIND IN RELIGION
[207]  As we have mentioned before, the nine cases in the Gospel of John are divided into two groups.
[208]  The first six cases signify how the Lord as our life can deal with positive things, while the last three cases signify how the Lord as our life can deal with negative things.
[209]  The first six cases reveal that the Lord as life is for regenerating, satisfying, healing, enlivening, feeding, and quenching.
[210]  In the first six cases the Lord brings us to something positive, but in the last three cases the Lord delivers us from something negative because He delivers us from sin, blindness, and death.
[211]  When the Lord Jesus saw this blind man, He said, While I am in the world, I am the light of the world 9:5 .
[212]  After the blind man s eyes had been anointed with the clay, he was more blind than before.
[213]  However, be prepared to suffer persecution at the hands of blind religion.
[214]  The blind man who received his sight was cast out 9:34 , meaning that he was excommunicated, ostracized, from the Jewish synagogue.
[215]  This means that he was put out of the sheepfold, as spoken by the Lord in 10:3-4.
[216]  This is a very interesting chapter, but it is also a misunderstood chapter.
[217]  In eternity past, God with His foresight had chosen His people.
[218]  In time, before Christ came, God put His chosen people into the custody of the law.
[219]  After Christ came, He wanted all of His people to come out of the law s custody.
[220]  The blind man who was cast out of the Jewish synagogue and who came to the Lord Jesus is one of God s chosen people.
[221]  Christ is the door, not only for God s elect to enter into the custody of the law, as did Moses, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc., in the Old Testament time before Christ came; but also for God s chosen people, such as Peter, James, John, and Paul, to come out of the fold of the law after Christ came.
[222]  As a man the Lord has the psuche life, the human life, and as God He has the zoe life, the divine life.
[223]  He laid down His soul, His psuche life, His human life, to accomplish redemption for His sheep 10:15, 17-18 that they might share His zoe life, His divine life 10:10 , the eternal life 10:28 , by which they may be formed into one flock under Himself as the one shepherd.
[224]  In 10:28-29 the Lord says, And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.
[225]  My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father s hand.
[226]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THE NEED OF THE DEAD LIFE S RESURRECTING 1
[227]  The case of raising Lazarus from the dead is certainly a wonderful case.
[228]  Here we see the case of a man who had died, who had been buried for four days, and who had begun to stink.
[229]  This case is not in the Judaistic fold; it is outside of it.
[230]  After the Lord went out of Jerusalem, He went to a home in Bethany of one brother and two sisters who loved Him very much.
[231]  When the news came about Lazarus sickness, the Lord s heart was not moved.
[232]  She reiterated what Martha first told the Lord: Lord, if You were here, my brother would not have died 11:32 .
[233]  This also is an opinion, a complaint against the Lord.
[234]  The Lord never argued; neither did He accept their opinion.
[235]  They simply did not understand that as long as the Lord was present everything would be all right.
[236]  By considering the signs in the Gospel of John, we can realize that the Lord firstly comes to us as life.
[237]  The first category of hindrances that He met was the Judaistic religion, and the second category was that of the human opinions held by those who loved Him.
[238]  The hindrance of human opinions is exactly the same today in His church.
[239]  Outside the church, it is religion that prevents the Lord from being life.
[240]  The Lord raised up the dead only among those who loved Him dearly.
[241]  This is typical of His church today, for He is the resurrection life only to the group of believers who dearly love Him.
[242]  The religious groups will simply become angry with the Lord and even make the decision to arrest Him and put Him to death.
[243]  In this message we come to another major subsection in the Gospel of John.
[244]  We have seen that this Gospel is composed of two sections: the eternal Word incarnated coming to bring God into man chs.
[245]  We have already covered the first three subsections of the first main section: an introduction to life and building 1:1-51 ; life s principle and life s purpose 2:1-22 ; and life meeting the need of man s every case 2:23 11:57 .
[246]  Beginning with chapter three, we see nine cases which illustrate how Christ as life can meet mankind s every need for the fulfillment of God s purpose.
[247]  The rejection of the Lord by Judaism was a negative issue.
[248]  But there was also a positive issue brought forth by the Lord s being life to people a home for Him in His rejection, a place where He could rest, feast, dwell, and be satisfied.
[249]  In chapter twelve we see that the Lord has come out and has hidden Himself from the religion that rejected Him and has come into a home of His Jewish believers in Bethany.
[250]  Bethany means house of the poor or house of affliction.
[251]  The church on earth may not be rich in material things; it should be rich with the enjoyment of the Lord in His presence.
[252]  They do not have a spirit to realize how rich we are in the enjoyment of all that the Lord is to us.
[253]  There are three kinds of functions in the service of the church represented by the three persons in the house.
[254]  However, in the picture of the church life portrayed here, there is something negative the black spot of Judas 12:4 .
[255]  Even among the twelve apostles chosen by the Lord Jesus, there was Judas, who was a black spot.
[256]  Nevertheless, it is quite comforting that even in the little church established directly by the Lord Jesus Himself, there was such a black spot.
[257]  In this message we come to the second part of John chapter twelve.
[258]  In the first part of this chapter we see, in a shadow, that the church has come into existence through the Lord as resurrection life.
[259]  The Lord Jesus fell into the ground and died that His divine element, His divine life, might be released from within the shell of His humanity to produce many believers in resurrection 1 Pet 1:3 , just as a grain of wheat has its life element released by falling into the ground and growing up out of the ground to bear much fruit, that is, to bring forth many grains.
[260]  Instead of receiving a warm welcome, the Lord preferred to fall into the ground and die as a grain of wheat that He might produce many grains for the church.
[261]  The Lord, as a grain of wheat falling into the ground, lost His soul-life through death that He might release His eternal life in resurrection to the many grains.
[262]  In one aspect, the Lord s death was a falling into the ground as revealed in verse 24; in another aspect, it was a lifting up on the tree v. 32; 1 Pet 2:24 . To fall into the ground as a grain of wheat was to produce the many grains; to be lifted up on the tree as the Son of Man was to draw all men to Himself.
[263]  In verse 31 the Lord declared, Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.
[264]  By His death on the cross the Lord judged the world and cast out its ruler, Satan.
[265]  Satan has systematized all the things on earth, especially those related to mankind, and the things in the air into his kingdom of darkness to occupy and frustrate people from the purpose of God and to distract them from the enjoyment of God.
[266]  On the cross the Lord as the Son of Man v. 23 was lifted up in the form of the serpent 3:14 , that is, in the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 . Satan, the ruler of this world, as the old serpent Rev 12:9; 20:2 , had injected himself into man s flesh.
[267]  If we do not know this Gospel, we may know the Lord as life, but we simply will not know the Lord as life in all its detailed aspects.
[268]  RELIGION S UNBELIEF AND BLINDNESS A. Prophesied by Isaiah
[269]  Verses 36b through 43 speak of the unbelief of religion and God s judgment upon that unbelief.
[270]  Regardless of how much the Lord as life worked in wonders, miracles, and signs, the religious people would not go along with Him.
[271]  No matter how much the Lord did, the religious people would not respond.
[272]  Finally, the last point indicates how the Lord was forced to make a declaration to the religious crowd that He is the manifestation of God coming to them as light; that if they receive Him, they will become the sons of light, and that if they do not receive Him, they will be overtaken by darkness; that He comes to them with the commandment of God to speak living words to them; and that if they receive His words, those words will become eternal life to them, but if they reject them, those very words will judge them in the last day.
[273]  In this message we come to John 13, a very interesting and meaningful chapter.
[274]  Probably all Christians know that such a chapter about the Lord s washing of the disciples feet exists in the Gospels.
[275]  It seems easy for anyone to understand this chapter, but actually it is not at all easy to realize its true meaning.
[276]  The second section, composed of chapters fourteen through twenty-one, unveils how the Lord as the Son of Man went through His death and resurrection to bring man into God, that man and God, God and man, may be built together as a mutual abode.
[277]  I. WASHING BY THE LORD HIMSELF A. Loving to the Uttermost
[278]  Verse 1 says that the Lord loved His own who were in the world and that He loved them to the uttermost.
[279]  Because of this love the Lord washed the disciples feet.
[280]  Hence, the foot-washing is a matter of love, a love to the uttermost.
[281]  Without this, the Lord s love toward us would not have been to the uttermost but would have fallen short of our need.
[282]  It was because He knew that the Father had given all into His hands, and that He had come forth from God and was going to God.
[283]  The Lord came through incarnation to bring God into us and He went through death and resurrection to bring us into God.
[284]  As we have already pointed out, to be dirty does not mean that we are sinful.
[285]  Many times you are not sinful, but you are dirty.
[286]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT LIFE S WASHING IN LOVE
[287]  Each of us must learn how to love the brothers and sisters by ministering the spiritual foot-washing to them.
[288]  Sometimes when I come to visit you, you can minister some sort of foot-washing to me by showing your love toward me, and I have to show the same love toward you so that some foot-washing will be ministered to you to cleanse you from the earthly touch.
[289]  We must do this, otherwise the fellowship between us could not be maintained.
[290]  In this message we come to the very heart, the center, of the Gospel of John.
[291]  Chapter fourteen is the first part of the message that the Lord gave to His disciples before His death.
[292]  In order to understand this message, we must remember that this Gospel reveals two main points: one, that the Lord comes to be our life; two, that the Lord will build us together in oneness with Himself and with God.
[293]  The word building is clearly referred to in chapter two, for there we are told that the Lord will build up the temple, the house of God, in three days v. 19 . Then in chapter seventeen the Lord prayed that those who take the Lord as life may be one in the Triune God vv.
[294]  By the Lord s coming we take Him as life, and by His going He builds us into God.
[295]  In the first thirteen chapters we see that the Lord, as the Word of God and the Son of God, came to be life to His disciples that they all might have eternal life and become parts of the church.
[296]  In 14:1-6 we see Jesus going through death and Christ coming in resurrection to bring us, the believers, into the Father.
[297]  Please notice that it is not Christ going and Jesus coming, but Jesus going and Christ coming.
[298]  In verse 1 the Lord said to His disciples, Let not your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me. This verse reveals two very important points.
[299]  Even up to that time, the disciples did not adequately realize that the Lord was God Himself.
[300]  B. My Father s House Being the Body of Christ,
[301]  According to the natural concept, most Christians think that the Father s house mentioned in verse 2 must refer to the third heaven where God the Father dwells.
[302]  But we must not interpret the Bible according to our natural concepts.
[303]  OF HIS ABODE 2 C. Many Abodes Being Many Members
[304]  In verse 3 the Lord said, If I go...I am coming.
[305]  This word proves that the Lord s going through His death and resurrection is His coming to His disciples vv.
[306]  The Lord s going was not His departure but actually another step of His coming.
[307]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE THE DISPENSING OF THE TRIUNE GOD
[308]  In the first six verses of John 14 the Lord revealed that He was going in death and coming back in resurrection in order to bring the disciples into the Father, that He will be the way and the Father the destination, and that where He is the disciples also will be.
[309]  In the following fourteen verses the Lord goes further to reveal the details regarding how He can get into the disciples and bring them to the Father.
[310]  When the Lord said that He was the way and that He was going to bring the believers into the Father, Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us v. 8 . The Lord replied, Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father.
[311]  This Spirit, this Comforter, is the Spirit of reality v. 17 . Why is He the Spirit of reality? Because whatever the Father in the Son is and whatever the Son is are realized in the Spirit.
[312]  If you do not have the Spirit, you cannot have God the Son as your life.
[313]  The reality of all the divine attributes of both God the Father and God the Son is the Spirit.
[314]  Verse 17 of John 14 also reveals that the Spirit abides with and in the believers.
[315]  Not only does He abide with the believers but also in them.
[316]  As we have seen, when the Lord was in the flesh, He was able only to be among the disciples, to be with them.
[317]  But after becoming in His resurrection the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of reality, He is now able to abide not only with us but also in us.
[318]  It is by being the Spirit that the Lord enters into us and abides in us.
[319]  John 14 reveals mainly how the Triune God is dispensing Himself into us in order that He and we, we and He, might be built together in the mingling of divinity with humanity.
[320]  This chapter unfolds that the Triune God, the Father, Son, and Spirit, is dispensing Himself into the believers in Jesus Christ; that this very God and the believers are being built together, a building of divinity with humanity; that eventually this building becomes a mutual abode; and that God dwells in man and man in God.
[321]  If we love the Lord, we will keep His commandments 14:15, 21, 23 .
[322]  In 14:21 the Lord said, He who has My commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves Me; and he who loves Me shall be loved by My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him.
[323]  If we keep the Lord s commandments, we shall be loved by the Father and the Son, and the Son will manifest Himself to us.
[324]  Tell me, according to your experience, when the Lord spoke the word no to you and you obeyed Him, what was the result?
[325]  The Triune God makes a mutual abode with the believer.
[326]  In verse 23 the Lord Jesus does not say, The Father and I will abide with him, but He says, We will come to him and make an abode with him.
[327]  AND LIFE S PEACE A. The Comforter, the Holy Spirit,
[328]  In verse 26 the Lord said, But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and remind you of all things which I said to you.
[329]  We should not consider this chapter separate from chapters fourteen and sixteen because all three chapters are one message given by the Lord Jesus before He was betrayed and arrested.
[330]  There is no doubt that chapter fifteen is the continuation of chapter fourteen, where we see the mutual abode, the mingling of divinity with humanity.
[331]  I. THE VINE AND THE BRANCHES BEING AN ORGANISM TO GLORIFY THE FATHER BY EXPRESSING
[332]  In 15:1-11 we see that the vine and the branches are an organism to glorify the Father by expressing the riches of the divine life.
[333]  Some readers of this message might be bothered by the word organism; it may sound quite strange to their understanding to hear of the organism of the Triune God in the divine dispensation.
[334]  But we are used to saying that the church, the Body of Christ, is not an organization but an organism.
[335]  In Ephesians 3:10-11 we read of the eternal purpose of God.
[336]  The vine is very good for propagating life and for multiplying life.
[337]  To propagate life means to spread life widely, and to multiply life means to reproduce life.
[338]  With every kind of vegetable life we see the matters of propagation and multiplication.
[339]  If we consider deeply the matter of the Lord s likening Himself to a vine, we shall realize that of all the plants, flowers, grasses, and trees, the vine is the best plant to show the propagation and multiplication of life.
[340]  No plant other than the vine tree can illustrate adequately the living relationship between us and the Lord.
[341]  What kind of relationship does this suggest to you?
[342]  In verse 2 the Lord said of the Father that every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it, that it may bear more fruit.
[343]  IN THE DIVINE DISPENSATION 2 H. The Abiding 1.
[344]  As we pointed out in the last message, if we are to abide in the vine, we must see the fact that we are the branches in the vine v. 5 . Our abiding in Christ depends upon a clear vision that we are branches in the vine.
[345]  If we see that we are already in Him, then we shall be able to abide in Him.
[346]  Apart from the Son we can do nothing v. 5 . A branch of a vine cannot live by itself, for it will wither and die apart from the vine.
[347]  The relationship between the branches and the vine pictures the relationship between us and the Lord.
[348]  We are nothing, we have nothing, and we can do nothing apart from Him.
[349]  While the Lord is moving, acting, motivating, and energizing within us, what shall we do?
[350]  We need to keep the Son s commandments by obeying His instant words that we may abide in His love vv.
[351]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE THE ORGANISM OF THE TRIUNE GOD
[352]  We have covered the first part of John 15, verses 1 through 11, which shows the relationship between us and the Lord.
[353]  The branches have been chosen to bear remaining fruit through praying in the Son s name.
[354]  When we pray for fruit-bearing, we must pray in the Son s name.
[355]  To ask in the Lord s name requires us to abide in the Lord and to let Him and His words abide in us that we may actually be one with Him.
[356]  B. Religion, as a Part of Satan s Worldly System,
[357]  Religion, as a part of Satan s world system, hates the branches of the divine organism for the expression of the Triune God 15:18 .
[358]  Many religious people would not consider religion as a part of Satan s worldly system.
[359]  When we come to chapter sixteen, we shall see that the Lord told His disciples that the religious people would consider killing the Lord s followers as a kind of service offered to God.
[360]  Verse 26 says, But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me. Religion persecutes, but the Spirit of reality testifies.
[361]  The Holy Spirit is the reality of all things, and we are to be witnesses of the Spirit of reality.
[362]  But in 14:26 the Lord said that the Father would send the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, in the Son s name.
[363]  If we are clear about John 14 and 15, it will be easy to understand John 16.
[364]  In verse 7 the Lord said, I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.
[365]  The Son s going was for the Spirit s coming.
[366]  He said that if He did not go, the Spirit would not come.
[367]  Let us now look in more detail at each of these three main items, beginning with the matter of convicting the world concerning sin.
[368]  We see this in 8:44 where the Lord says to the Pharisees, You are of your father the devil, and it is your will to do the desires of your father.
[369]  Concerning Righteousness a. The Son Having Come and Died
[370]  The Son has come and died to fulfill God s righteous requirements 3:14 .
[371]  Concerning Judgment a. The Judgment Being for the Devil,
[372]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT
[373]  OF DIVINITY WITH HUMANITY 2 B. To Glorify the Son by Revealing Him
[374]  The first category of the Spirit s work is to convict the world in the preaching of the gospel and to translate people out of Adam into Christ.
[375]  In verses 14 and 15 the Lord said that the Spirit of reality shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you.
[376]  All that the Son is and has is revealed as reality to the believers through the Spirit.
[377]  In verses 16 through 24 we see a point which is rather difficult to understand: the Son was to be born in resurrection as a newborn child.
[378]  The Lord had told His disciples that He would be killed and that this would make the world happy but the disciples sorrowful v. 20 . Then the Lord told them that a woman who is about to bring forth a child has sorrow at the time of birth, but when she brings forth the child, she no longer remembers the affliction because of the joy that a man has been born into the world v. 21 . After the child has been delivered, the woman will be happy because a man is born.
[379]  In verses 23 and 24 the Lord said, And in that day you shall ask Me nothing.
[380]  Truly, truly, I say to you, if you shall ask anything of the Father, He will give it to you in My name.
[381]  Until now you have asked nothing in My name; ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be made full.
[382]  At that time the Lord promised to declare the Father to His disciples v. 25 . This was fulfilled by His coming back to His disciples after His resurrection, at which time He declared the Father s name to His brothers Heb 2:12 , making them know the Father s life and nature.
[383]  In resurrection as the firstborn Son of God, the Lord makes us, the many sons of God, His brothers, know the Father in the way of life, in the way of partaking of His divine nature 2 Pet 1:3-4 .
[384]  During the Son s suffering, His disciples were scattered, leaving Him alone v. 32 . But He was not alone, because the Father was with Him.
[385]  Even at the time of the Son s suffering, the Father was with Him.
[386]  His disciples left Him, but the Father did not.
[387]  We have peace in the Lord v. 33 . Although the Lord died and has been resurrected, we remain in the world where there is no peace.
[388]  In this message we come to the profound prayer uttered by the Lord in John 17.
[389]  This prayer is the completing prayer of the Lord s message given in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen.
[390]  If we read John 14 through 17 carefully, we shall realize that these four chapters have a very specific flavor in utterance and composition.
[391]  Although the whole Bible undoubtedly is God-breathed, these four chapters have a special taste, a special flavor, that no one can imitate.
[392]  In verse 1 the Lord said, Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.
[393]  If we see the main points of the three previous chapters, we shall be able to understand what it means to have the Son glorified that the Father may be glorified.
[394]  The Son is to be glorified along with the Father vv.
[395]  In verse 5 the Lord said, And now, glorify Me with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.
[396]  This word strengthens the indication in verse 1, concerning the deity of the Lord s person, that He had the divine glory along with the Father before the world was, that is, in eternity past, so that He should be glorified along with the Father with that glory now.
[397]  Because the Lord is one with the Father and the Father is in the Lord, the release of the glory and beauty of the Lord manifests the glory and beauty of God the Father.
[398]  In the last message we covered the subject, the central thought, of the Lord s prayer in John 17.
[399]  In this message we come to the second part of this prayer.
[400]  The first part, verses 1 through 5, gives us the subject of the prayer, and the second part, verses 6 through 24, deals with oneness.
[401]  The people in this oneness include all the disciples, all those whom God has chosen and given to the Lord Jesus, all those to whom the Lord has given eternal life.
[402]  This is indicated by the Lord s word in 5:26, which says, The Father has life in Himself.
[403]  In the entire Scripture, especially in the Gospel of John, the Father denotes the source of life.
[404]  As the father of a family is the very source and origin of life, so the name Father reveals the Father as the source of life.
[405]  While the names God and Jehovah are fully revealed in the Old Testament, the name Father is not fully revealed.
[406]  When I say, my Father, I mean that I have His life and that I was born of Him.
[407]  The Father s Word and the Father s Words
[408]  Verse 6 says, They have kept Your word, and verse 8 says, For the words which You gave Me I have given to them, and they received them.
[409]  In these verses we see in the Greek that the Father has two kinds of words: logos, the constant word, in verse 6 and rhema, the instant words, in verse 8.
[410]  Both the logos and the rhema are used by the Lord to impart eternal life to the believers.
[411]  One in the Father s Name a. As the Three of the Triune God Are
[412]  That is the real oneness and that must be the pattern of our oneness.
[413]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE FORTY LIFE S PRAYER 3 B. In the Triune God through Sanctification
[414]  In this message we come to the second factor of genuine oneness.
[415]  The first factor is being in the Father s name by the eternal life, and the second is being in the Triune God through sanctification by the holy word vv.
[416]  In verse 17 the Lord prayed, Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.
[417]  God s living word works in the believers to separate them from anything worldly, separating them from the world and its occupation unto God and His purpose, not only positionally Matt 23:17, 19 but also dispositionally Rom 6:19, 22 .
[418]  Now we come to the third factor of genuine oneness: in the divine glory for the expression of the Triune God vv.
[419]  As we have seen, the first ground of oneness is regeneration, receiving the life of the Father, and the second ground is sanctification, being separated from everything other than God.
[420]  When we have been separated from everything outside of God to God Himself, then we are on the ground of sanctification, being separated from all worldly places and worldly things unto one center.
[421]  The Son has given to His believers the very glory which the Father has given to Him, that they also might have the sonship with the Father s life and divine nature John 17:2; 2 Pet 1:4 to express the Father in the Son in His fullness John 1:16 .
[422]  In order that the believers might participate in this oneness, the Son has given them three things: the eternal life for the first aspect of oneness v. 2 , the holy word for the second aspect of oneness vv.
[423]  8, 14 , and the divine glory for the third aspect of oneness v. 22 . We may have the divine life and be separated from the world through the holy word and still not be shining with God s glory.
[424]  When we realize that we have the divine life and the divine nature with the sonship to express God the Father in His fullness, we shall shine with glory.
[425]  At such a time, our oneness will not only be in the eternal life and by the holy word but also with the divine glory for the expression of God.
[426]  Now we see that our oneness has a goal to express God the Father in His fullness, even during this dark age on this corrupted earth.
[427]  As we read the Lord s prayer in John 17, we need to see that genuine oneness is by His life, by His word, and in the divine glory for the expression of God.
[428]  In verse 23 the Lord says, I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me. How can we be perfected into one? Only in the glory of the divine life.
[429]  The latter part of verse 23 says, That the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me. Here we see the Father s love shown toward the Son as well as toward the Son s believers.
[430]  The Father has loved the Son in that He has given the Son His life, His nature, His fullness, and His glory to express Him.
[431]  Not many of us appreciate this love, the love in giving us the Father s life, nature, fullness, and glory to express Him.
[432]  The fulfillment of this began with the Son s resurrection, when He brought His believers into participation in His resurrected life, and it will consummate in the New Jerusalem, when His believers will be fully brought into the divine glory for the ultimate corporate expression of the Triune God for eternity.
[433]  Although much has been said about John 17, still more is necessary.
[434]  We must never forget this chapter, for in it the Lord prayed that God would glorify Him so that God might be glorified in and through Him.
[435]  After His death, the Lord was resurrected, meaning that He was manifested and glorified.
[436]  The third factor of oneness is found in verse 22.
[437]  And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.
[438]  Since the glory which the Father has given to the Son has been given to us by the Son, genuine oneness is in the divine glory.
[439]  Do not think that this is my concept or that it is not supported by the revelation in the Bible.
[440]  Through the type of the tabernacle in the Old Testament we can see that oneness is the building.
[441]  Every careful reader of the Bible knows that the tabernacle was not only God s dwelling place but also the dwelling place of those who served God.
[442]  For example, Psalm 27:4 says, One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple.
[443]  John 18 and 19 tell us about the Lord s betrayal, judgment, crucifixion, and burial.
[444]  By reading the account of the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels, we discover that the first three Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are records along the same line.
[445]  But the record of the Gospel of John is absolutely different.
[446]  For example, in the first three Gospels the record of the Lord s crucifixion and death on the cross is accompanied by many signs.
[447]  Also, the Lord s cry from the cross, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? is another sign in these Gospels that cannot be found in the Gospel of John.
[448]  However, John s record contains that which cannot be found in the first three Gospels, such as the soldiers mocking of the Lord 19:2-3 and the blood and water pouring out from the Lord s side 19:34 .
[449]  John s purpose was to show that the Lord Jesus is the expression of God as our life and that He died on the cross for the purpose of releasing Himself to us as life.
[450]  In John 17 the Lord prayed that all the disciples, being born of God, knowing the name and life of the Father, and belonging to the Father s family, would be one in the Father s name, separated from the world and sanctified to live in God, and be absolutely one in the Triune God, realizing the glory of being the sons of God.
[451]  The Lord delivered Himself in voluntary boldness to be processed 18:1-11 .
[452]  In John 10 He told us that He would purposely give up His life for us.
[453]  D. Taking Care of the Disciples in an Easy Manner
[454]  While the Lord was handing Himself over to the people, He took good care of His disciples in a very easy manner.
[455]  In 18:8 Jesus said, I told you that I am; if therefore you are seeking Me, let these go away.
[456]  This was the fulfillment of the Lord s word in 17:12, where He said, Of those whom You have given Me, I have not lost one.
[457]  We see here that under the suffering of the betrayal of His false disciple and the arrest of the soldiers, the Lord still took good care of His disciples.
[458]  The Lord was examined by the Jews according to the law of God in their religion 18:12-27 .
[459]  After the Lord Jesus was examined, He, the perfect One, was sentenced in man s injustice 18:38b-19:16 .
[460]  This unjust sentence exposed the blindness of religion and the darkness of politics 18:38b-39; 19:1, 4-5, 8-14, 16 .
[461]  Probably most Christians know that when the Lord was on the cross He spoke seven words.
[462]  These seven words from the cross are quite famous.
[463]  The first word the Lord spoke was, Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing Luke 23:34 ; the second was, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise Luke 23:43 ; and the third was Woman, behold your son....Behold, your mother John 19:26-27 .
[464]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE FORTY-THREE LIFE PROCESSED FOR MULTIPLICATION 2
[465]  We have seen that the Gospel of John reveals the Lord as the very expression of God coming to us as life.
[466]  By imparting Himself into us, He becomes everything to us and meets all our needs that He may bring God into us and bring us into God, mingling God with us until God is one with us and we are one with Him.
[467]  After such a revelation in these seventeen chapters, in chapters eighteen and nineteen the Holy Spirit reveals the Lord s willingness to go into death and to deliver Himself to death that He might be sown as a grain of wheat into the earth to die in order that He might rise up to release and impart Himself into us, thus bringing forth much fruit by His death and resurrection.
[468]  We have seen that the Lord delivered Himself in voluntary boldness to be processed 18:1-11 , that He was examined in His dignity by mankind 18:12-38a , that He was sentenced in man s injustice 18:38b 19:16 , and that He was tested in God s sovereignty by death 19:17-30 .
[469]  Furthermore, the words spoken by the Lord on the cross in Luke 23:34, Father, forgive them, and in Matthew 27:46, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me? because He bore our sin at that time , also depict the Lord s redemptive death.
[470]  Every aspect of the Lord s death was according to God s sovereignty.
[471]  The Jews, not wanting the bodies to remain on the cross on the Sabbath, asked Pilate that their legs might be broken.
[472]  The soldiers then broke the legs of the two thieves who had been crucified with the Lord.
[473]  This indicates that, in a sense, the Lord Jesus was not put to death by human hands but that He died Himself.
[474]  The piercing of the Lord s side was typified by Adam s opened side Gen 2:21 .
[475]  Adam s side was opened and a rib was taken out.
[476]  After the Lord had completed His work in His death, He rested 19:38-42 .
[477]  In John 18 and 19 we see the many evil things and sufferings which came to the Lord.
[478]  Some treated Him evilly, others mocked Him, and even His most intimate disciple denied Him.
[479]  In this message we come to John 20, a chapter about the Lord s resurrection.
[480]  In 12:24 He said that He was the grain of wheat which would fall into the ground and die that it might be released to impart its life into many other grains.
[481]  In other words, He had to die that He might rise up and become many grains.
[482]  Christ resurrected as the firstfruit of resurrection 1 Cor 15:20-23 .
[483]  As the unique, only begotten Son of God, He did not need to be begotten, but in order for the only begotten Son to become the firstborn Son He had to be born in resurrection Acts 13:33; Heb 1:5 .
[484]  On the day of His resurrection, Christ was born to be the firstborn Son of God and the Firstborn from among the dead in order to be the Head of the Body, the church Col 1:18 .
[485]  This message is the continuation of the last one.
[486]  Although the Lord s resurrection had been accomplished, the discovery of it required the seeking of His disciples.
[487]  The discovery of His resurrection was made by the loving seekers of the Lord Jesus.
[488]  John chapter twenty shows the kind of person who will realize the Lord s resurrection, the kind of person to whom the vision of His resurrection can be disclosed.
[489]  E. Testified to by the Angels Sent by God
[490]  When Mary looked into the tomb, she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain 20:12 .
[491]  These two angels were like the cherubim on the propitiation cover, watching and observing how the glorious Lord, who is the resurrection, carried out the wonderful task of walking away from the threatening of death.
[492]  These two observing angels became the strongest witness that the Lord Jesus had resurrected.
[493]  As the linen cloths and the napkin were the testimony from man s side, the angels were the testimony from God s side.
[494]  In 20:17 the Lord Jesus said to Mary, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.
[495]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE FORTY-SIX LIFE IN RESURRECTION 1
[496]  We have seen that the Gospel of John is composed of two major sections.
[497]  The first section, comprising chapters one through thirteen, unveils the eternal Word incarnated coming to bring God into man.
[498]  The second section, comprising chapters fourteen through twenty-one, reveals Jesus crucified and Christ resurrected going to prepare the way to bring man into God, and as the Spirit coming to abide and live in the believers for the building of God s habitation.
[499]  In this second major section there are four subsections: life s indwelling for the building of God s habitation 14:1 16:33 ; life s prayer 17:1-26 ; life processed for multiplication 18:1 20:13, 17 ; and life in resurrection 20:14 21:25 .
[500]  In John 14, 15, and 16, the Lord expounded how He would come into us to be our life and to be mingled and built together with us that there might be a mutual abode for God and man.
[501]  TO BE BREATHED INTO THE BELIEVERS A. With the Resurrected Body
[502]  With a resurrected body, the Lord came into the room where the disciples were with the doors shut 20:19 .
[503]  After saying, Peace be to you, the Lord said to His disciples, As the Father has sent Me, I also send you 20:21 .
[504]  The Lord said that just as the Father sent Him, so He would send us in the same way.
[505]  The sending of the Lord is the same as the sending of the Father.
[506]  The Father sent Him, and He will send us.
[507]  The Holy Spirit in verse 22 is the Spirit expected in 7:39 and promised in 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; and 16:7-8, 13.
[508]  Thus, the Lord s breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter.
[509]  In chapter fourteen the Lord promised that He would ask the Father to send another Comforter.
[510]  This message is the continuation of the foregoing one.
[511]  If we put 1 John 2:1 together with John 14:16, we see that today the Lord Jesus is our Advocate at the right hand of God in the heavens and, at the same time, He is also the Comforter in our spirit.
[512]  This Spirit is also the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[513]  The Spirit of Jesus mainly refers to the Spirit of the Lord as a man living on earth and passing through all the human sufferings for the accomplishment of our redemption Acts 16:7 .
[514]  The Spirit of Christ mainly refers to the Spirit of the Lord resurrected as the divine Person with the uplifted humanity who dwells in our spirit as our life Rom 8:9 .
[515]  The Spirit of Jesus Christ indicates that the Spirit today is the all-inclusive Spirit of the Lord as God and as man, including His divinity, His humanity, His human living, His crucifixion, His resurrection, and His ascension with all His divine attributes, human virtues, and attainments in His achievements.
[516]  The gathering of the disciples in 20:19 in the evening of the day of the Lord s resurrection may be considered as the first meeting of the church before Pentecost.
[517]  This meeting was to fulfill Psalm 22:22 according to Hebrews 2:10-12 for the Son to declare the Father s name and to praise the Father in the church.
[518]  To declare the Father s name is to make the Father known to the disciples as the source of life that they might partake of His divine nature.
[519]  To praise the Father in the church is to praise the Father in the praising of His believers in the church meetings.
[520]  According to Psalm 22:22 and Hebrews 2:10-12, the resurrected Lord did both of these things in the first meeting of the church on the day of His resurrection.
[521]  John 20:26 says, And after eight days, His disciples were again within, and Thomas with them.
[522]  Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace be to you.
[523]  As the phrase after eight days indicates, this gathering was on the second first day of the week, the second Lord s Day after the Lord s resurrection.
[524]  The intention of the Holy Spirit in writing the Gospel of John was to show us that we have been made the sons of God by the resurrection of Christ.
[525]  We human beings were worthless, sinful, low, mean, and dirty.
[526]  But by the Lord s death and resurrection, we have been made the sons of God.
[527]  Thus, we are the sons of God, just like the only begotten Son of God.
[528]  In resurrection, the Lord was not only meeting with the brothers but also moving and living with them.
[529]  He is not only with us when we meet; He is even with us in our daily walk.
[530]  In verse 3 we are told that the disciples went forth and got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing.
[531]  Peter and the sons of Zebedee John and James were professional fishers, the sea of Tiberias was large and full of fish, and night was the right time for fishing, but through the entire night they caught nothing.
[532]  Here He also recovered him to His call by a miracle in fishing.
[533]  By this, the Lord trained them to realize that without His leading, though they went to the sea where the fish were, and in the night, the right time for fishing, they could catch nothing; but with the Lord s leading, even on the land where the fish were not, and in the morning which is not the right time for fishing, the Lord could provide fish for them.
[534]  In 21:1-14 we saw that, in resurrection, the Lord moved and lived with the believers.
[535]  Now, in 21:15-25, we see that He is also working and walking with the believers.
[536]  After restoring Peter s love toward Him, the Lord Jesus charged him, saying, Feed My lambs, Shepherd My sheep, and Feed My sheep.
[537]  The first twenty chapters of the Gospel of John stress the matter of believing in the Son that we may have life 3:15 .
[538]  Verse 23, referring to what the Lord had said to Peter about John, says, This word therefore went forth among the brothers that that disciple would not die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?
[539]  In this word the Lord indicates that some of His followers will live until He comes.
[540]  Between these two events are all the things related to the Christian life during the church age: seeking the Lord with love toward Him, especially in the personal morning watch; seeing the Lord in resurrection; receiving the revelation of the issue of the Lord s resurrection concerning the brothers and the Father by experiencing His manifestation; meeting with the believers to enjoy the Lord s presence; being breathed on by the Lord with the Holy Spirit and being sent by the Lord with His commission and authority to represent Him; learning how to live by faith in the Lord and to trust in Him for our daily living; loving the Lord with our natural strength having been dealt with and having learned the lesson of being broken, of losing our self-confidence, and of putting our trust in the Lord; shepherding the flock for the building of the church; practicing the Lord s invisible presence in which some follow Him even to death to glorify God, not by self-will but according to His leading, and some live until He comes back.
[541]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE FIFTY THE ULTIMATE CONCLUSION
[542]  Although we have completed our life-study of the Gospel of John, we still need to see something more as a conclusion to all these chapters.
[543]  The apostle John not only wrote the Gospel of John but also his Epistles and the book of Revelation.
[544]  The Gospel of John is for the imparting of life, his Epistles are for the fellowship of life which is for God s building, and the Revelation is for the consummation of God s building.
[545]  The first stage is that of life imparting, the second stage is that of spiritual growth and building, and the last stage is that of maturity and the completion of God s building.
[546]  If we would divide this Gospel into three parts, the second part would consist of chapters eighteen and nineteen.
[547]  In these two chapters we see a picture of how the Lord was arrested, brought to trial, sentenced to death, and crucified on the cross.
[548]  But we must realize that this picture is a revelation of life manifested through death.
[549]  In the first part of this Gospel, God is manifested in man; in the second part, life is manifested in death.
[550]  Everything that happened to the Lord Jesus in chapters eighteen and nineteen was an aspect of death.
[551]  Judas betrayal of the Lord, his bringing the soldiers to arrest the Lord, the judgment before the high priest and Pilate, the cruel treatment of the Lord, the false sentence against Him, and His being nailed to the cross all were aspects of death.
[552]  The fact of abiding is mentioned in the New Testament Epistles.
[553]  In his first Epistle, John covers this matter of the mutual abiding.
[554]  How do we know that God abides in us and that we abide in Him?
[555]  If we would experience God in resurrection, if we would experience God as the Spirit, if we would experience God in the way that God and we are mingled together, if we would experience being a pillar for the Lord s presence, if we would experience the writing of God s new name, the name of the New Jerusalem, and the name of the Lord upon us, then we, like Mary the Magdalene, must seek the Lord.
[556]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE BEARING FRUIT BY THE OVERFLOW
[557]  Since the time I was saved and began to love the Lord and the Bible, I have been attracted to John 15, where we have the illustration of the grapevine.
[558]  For more than fifty years, this illustration has never been far away from my consideration.
[559]  God has taken a number of steps to produce this organic body.
[560]  Through creation, He formed a spirit within man Zech 12:1 .
[561]  God has also accomplished the work of redemption, and eventually, He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .
[562]  Now He is not only the Creator and Redeemer He is the very pneuma, the life-giving Spirit, for us to contact Him.
[563]  You may be wondering how you can experience this organism.
[564]  This living organism is like a building with an entrance.
[565]  In this Gospel we have both the gate through which we can enter the organism and the way to experience this organism.
[566]  The Lord Jesus said to a sinner named Nicodemus, Unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God, and, Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[567]  In verse 48 the Lord said, I am the bread of life, and in verse 57 He said, He who eats Me shall also live because of Me. The way is not only to drink God as the living water, but also to eat Christ, the embodiment of God, as the living bread.
[568]  The Lord s word about eating Him was offensive to the religious people, and they could not bear it v. 60 . In verse 63 the Lord said to His disciples, It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.
