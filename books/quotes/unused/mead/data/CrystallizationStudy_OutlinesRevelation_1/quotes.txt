[1]  The church as the Body of Christ, consummating in the New Jerusalem, is the testimony, the expression, of Christ; as such, the church is the reproduction of the testimony, the expression, of God in Christ Eph 1:22-23; Rev 21:2-3; cf.
[2]  Christ as the Word of God is in three forms the person of Christ Himself, the spoken word, and the written word John 1:1; 5:39-40; 6:63: Christ as the testimony of God and the living word of God infuses His substance into His loving seekers, working Himself into them to make them His enlarged and expanded testimony: Through the Word we can enjoy God s countenance and the shining of His face so that we can glow with Him for His glory Exo 34:28-29; 2 Cor 3:16, 18; Psa 27:4, 8; Psa 119:58, 135.

[8]  The golden girdle signifies Christ s divinity as His divine energy, and the breasts signify that this golden energy is exercised and motivated by and with His love to nourish the churches.

[14]  Mark 4:26-29; Dan 2:34-35, 44; Rev 1:9 One of the main aspects of the book of Revelation is that God is recovering His right over the earth to make the whole earth His kingdom Gen 1:26; Rev 5:10; 11:15; 12:10; 20:6; 22:5; Matt 6:10.
