[1]  Life-Study of 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther 1 & 2 Chronicles
[2]  In the eternal economy of God, the Father has allotted the Son, the all-inclusive Christ typified by the good land, to the believers as their eternal portion and has transferred them into Him that they may partake of Him Col 1:12; 1 Cor 1:30, 9 .
[3]  The omnipresent and omnipotent Triune God became the hiding God in taking care of His chosen people in the dispersion of their captivity, in the most wise secrecy of His highest sovereignty Esth.
[4]  The first book covers about 41 years, from 1056 to 1015 B.C., not including the forefathers genealogy.
[5]  The books of 1 and 2 Chronicles cover the genealogy of mankind from Adam to Abraham and the genealogy of God s elect from Abraham to the family of Saul, and the history of Israel from Saul the king to Israel s return from their captivity.
[6]  The central thought is, first, to give us a full chronology of God s move in man s history by including the genealogy from Adam to Samuel, indicating that God s move in man s history to prepare the way for God to carry out His eternal economy in humanity by becoming a man that man may become God is not a matter that concerns only the history of God s elect but a matter that concerns the history of the entire race of mankind.
[7]  This is a strong evidence that the coming Christ as the embodiment of God is not only for the one race chosen by God but for the entire human race created by God.
[8]  AND SECOND CHRONICLES MESSAGE TWO THE REPRODUCTION OF GOD Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26; 3:15; 22:18; 2 Sam 7:12-14; John 12:24
[9]  In this message I have the burden to speak a word on a very striking matter the reproduction of God.
[10]  After God created the heavens and the earth, one of the angels rebelled and became God s enemy, Satan.
[11]  Some do live by God s life, but they do not live by His life continually.
[12]  Perhaps in the morning they live by God s life, but later in the day they may lose their temper and live like a scorpion.
[13]  I am glad that during the last ten months the Lord has released the matter of the high peak of the divine revelation in the Holy Scriptures.
[14]  Recently, I wrote in Chinese a hymn on God becoming a man that man may become God in life and in nature.
[15]  AND SECOND CHRONICLES MESSAGE THREE THE GENEALOGY FROM ADAM
[16]  TO THE TWELVE TRIBES OF ISRAEL Scripture Reading: 1 Chron 1 9
[17]  over the Service of Song in the House of Jehovah
[18]  After the ark of testimony was given rest by David, David set the descendants of Kohath over the service of song in the house of Jehovah, and they ministered before the tabernacle with singing until Solomon built the temple in Jerusalem.
[19]  They attended to their office, and their brothers the Levites were given to all the service of the tabernacle of the house of God 1 Chron 6:31-48 .
[20]  AND SECOND CHRONICLES MESSAGE FOUR THE HIGHEST POINT OF GOD S GOSPEL Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:4; Gen 1:26; John 12:24; 1 Cor 10:17; Col 3:11
[21]  The eternal God in His eternity had a dream according to His heart s desire, and He made a plan, which in the New Testament is called God s economy 1 Tim 1:4; Eph 1:10; 3:9 .
[22]  Then God created the universe, making His heart s desire Adam the center.
[23]  From fallen mankind God chose Abraham to be the father of another people, and then two thousand years later God became a man and lived on earth as a God-man.
[24]  I believe that our God, who is sitting in the heavens, is happy whenever He looks upon a gathering of God-men, especially a gathering of God-men from fifty nations.
[25]  In the second to the fifth centuries, the church fathers found three high mysteries in the Bible: 1 the Triune God, the Divine Trinity, the highest mystery; 2 the person of Christ; and 3 the deification of man that man could become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.
[26]  However, after the fifth century the truth concerning this last mystery was gradually lost.
[27]  When we realize that we are God-men, we will say, Lord, You are the first God-man, and we are the many God-men following You.
[28]  Christians today admit that all the believers in Christ are the sons of God or the children of God, but they do not dare admit that the believers in Christ are God.
[29]  AND SECOND CHRONICLES MESSAGE FIVE THE SUPPLEMENT TO THE HISTORY OF DAVID Scripture Reading: 1 Chron 22:2 29:30
[30]  David s preparation of the materials for the building of the temple of God in abundance typifies Christ s provision for the building of the church of God with His unsearchable riches 22:2-5, 14-16a; 29:2-5a .
[31]  C. The Divisions of the Services of the Levites
[32]  First Chronicles 27 speaks of the officers in the administration of David s government.
[33]  In verses 9 through 21 David charged Solomon his son to serve God and to build the temple of God.
[34]  He charged Solomon to serve God with his whole heart and with a willing soul, for Jehovah searches all the hearts and understands every imagination of the thoughts v. 9 . Then David charged Solomon to build the temple of God according to the pattern that he had by the Spirit, having God s presence, with the priests, the Levites, the willing men with wisdom for any service, the leaders, and all the people wholly at his command vv.
[35]  David s preparation of the materials and his gifts for the building of the temple of God stirred up the leaders of Israel to offer willingly their gifts to God for the building of His temple, so that both the people of Israel and David the king rejoiced with great joy 29:1-9 .
[36]  David continued by asking God to keep and establish the heart of His people Israel in this sound condition and give Solomon his son a wholeness of heart to keep God s commandments, testimonies, and statutes and to do all and build the palace the temple of God vv.
[37]  Although Rehoboam was capable and wise, he did not labor for God s interest on the earth to build up the kingdom of God.
[38]  Second Chronicles 13:1-21 gives us an account of the reign of Abijah.
[39]  AND SECOND CHRONICLES MESSAGE SEVEN BEING FUNDAMENTAL IN FULL AND WALKING ACCORDING TO THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 2 Chron 11:5, 13-14; Rom 8:4; Gal 5:16, 25
[40]  In this message I would like to say a word about our need to be fundamental in a full and complete way and also about our need in our daily living to walk according to the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.
[41]  God s dealing with His people in the details of their living is for His people to enjoy the good land, Christ, in a very proper way.
[42]  IN LIFE AND IN NATURE BUT NOT IN THE GODHEAD
[43]  If we would be fundamental in full, we must be fundamental with respect to all the truths.
[44]  Among the many truths there are three great mysteries which were discovered by the church fathers in the second century: the mystery of the Divine Trinity, the mystery of Christ s person, and the mystery of man s deification that God became a man that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.
[45]  Although Christians hold the truth concerning the Triune God and the truth concerning the person of Christ, after the first five centuries the truth concerning deification was gradually lost.
[46]  460 The Word became flesh to make us partakers of the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 : For this is why the Word became man, and the Son of God became the Son of man: so that man, by entering into communion with the Word and thus receiving divine sonship, might become a son of God St. Irenaeus, Adv. haeres . 3, 19, 1 . For the Son of God became man so that we might become God St. Athanasius, De inc., 54, 3 . The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods St. Thomas Aquinas, Opusc . 57:1-4 . Catechism of the Catholic Church, pp.
[47]  In order to be perfectly fundamental, we need to be clear concerning this great truth the truth that God became a man that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.
[48]  AND SECOND CHRONICLES MESSAGE EIGHT LEARNING FROM THE EXAMPLES
[49]  EXAMPLES REFERRING TO THE WAY WE CONDUCT OURSELVES IN THE DETAILS OF OUR DAILY LIVING
[50]  In the Old Testament history books we can see many different pictures, but we may not have an accurate interpretation of these pictures.
[51]  The correct interpretation of the pictures in the history of the kings of Judah recorded in the books of Chronicles is that these kings are examples showing us that it is not sufficient for us who love God and seek Christ only to stand on the right ground and keep the fundamental truth.
[52]  OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Chron 21:12-18; 24:14b-24; 25:5-16; 26:6-21a; 28:8-15
[53]  Furthermore, in this supplement in 1 and 2 Chronicles none of the kings of Israel are included, because they all forsook both the proper ground, the ground of Jerusalem, and the fundamental faith given by God through Moses.
[54]  In 25:5-16 we have the example of Amaziah.
[55]  OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH 3 Scripture Reading: 2 Chron 29:3 32:8; 33:11-17; 34:3-7; 36:20b-23
[56]  In previous messages we covered nine kings of Judah who are examples regarding the enjoyment of God s good land, which is a type of the all-inclusive Christ.
[57]  In 30:1 31:1 we see that Hezekiah recovered the Passover.
[58]  The Passover had been lost, and the people no longer kept it, but Hezekiah recovered it.
[59]  Hezekiah asked all the people of Israel and Judah to come to Jerusalem where the house of God was to hold the Passover in order to remind them to keep the one unique ground of the worship of God among all Israel v. 1b; cf.
[60]  Moreover, the hand of God was on the people of Judah, giving them one heart to perform the commandment of Hezekiah and the officers according to the word of Jehovah v. 12 . They listened to Hezekiah and the leaders, and then they took action according to God s word, according to God s revelation.
[61]  In 2 Chronicles 33:11-17 we have a word concerning Manasseh.
[62]  B. Entreating Jehovah His God and Humbling Himself Greatly before the God of His Fathers
[63]  AND SECOND CHRONICLES MESSAGE ELEVEN LIVING CHRIST FOR THE EXPRESSION OF GOD Scripture Reading: Exo 20:1-17; 25:16; Col 1:15; Rom 8:4; Phil 1:19-21a
[64]  The examples of the kings of Judah show that God needed a people on the earth so that He could be incarnated in humanity.
[65]  God also needed a land for His people that He might form a nation to set up His testimony.
[66]  Based upon the fact that the law is the testimony of God, a picture of God, we may say that the law is also a type of Christ.
[67]  How can the law be a type of Christ?
[68]  Now we need to see how the law is linked to God s economy.
[69]  AND SECOND CHRONICLES MESSAGE TWELVE A CONCLUDING WORD TO THE SUPPLEMENT
[70]  TO THE HISTORY OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH Scripture Reading: Heb 4:12; 5:12-14
[71]  The law of God, which was decreed through Moses in the second part of Exodus, beginning from chapter twenty, and the entire book of Leviticus, had two sections the moral section and the ceremonial section.
[72]  The entire law of God was decreed to His people by Him with the intention to expose and convict His people by the moral section of His law, that they would be conducted to the ceremonial section of His law, that is, conducted to the all-inclusive Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God for their redemption, salvation, and bountiful enjoyment in every aspect Gal 3:23-24 through all the ages unto eternity.
[73]  AND SECOND CHRONICLES MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE RESEMBLANCE OF GOD AND MAN
[74]  In this message I would like to give a very brief word on the resemblance of God and man in their images and likenesses.
[75]  As we consider these we may wonder whether man resembles God or God resembles man.
[76]  If God had made ten thousand pieces of clay in His image and after His likeness, those ten thousand pieces of clay would all have been figures of God, the mass reproduction of God.
[77]  The piece of red clay in Genesis 1:26 was a type of Christ, and Christ is the image of the invisible God Col 1:15 .
[78]  In this message we come to the last three books of history in the Old Testament Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther
[79]  I believe that in eternity past God determined that, after the confusion of Babel, He would choose a man by the name of Abraham.
[80]  After calling Abraham God spent many years to train him.
[81]  Isaac had two sons Esau, whom God hated, and Jacob, whom God loved Mal 1:2-3; Rom 9:13 .
[82]  Following 1 and 2 Chronicles, we have the books of Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther The book of Ezra is concerned with the return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple, and the book of Nehemiah is concerned with the repair, the rebuilding, of the city.
[83]  The book of Esther shows us how the omnipresent and omnipotent God became the hiding God in protecting His captured elect, who were scattered in their captivity.
[84]  Apparently God would not do anything for His people, for He is a God who hides Himself Isa 45:15 .
[85]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZRA MESSAGE TWO AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Ezra 1:1-5
[86]  In order to have one testimony, God always kept the children of Israel together in a narrow piece of land, not allowing them to become too great in number.
[87]  God brought the children of Israel into His promised good land through His redemption and salvation that they might partake of the good land and enjoy it as their portion in God s economy.
[88]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZRA MESSAGE THREE THE RETURN OF THE CAPTIVITY
[89]  UNDER THE KINGLY LEADERSHIP OF ZERUBBABEL Scripture Reading: Ezra 1 6
[90]  Cyrus made this decree because God stirred up his spirit v. 1b . This stirring up was a work of the hiding God.
[91]  In 2:1-67 we have a clear and accurate record of the number of the captives who returned under Zerubbabel, the prince of Judah 1:8 , the governor of the former kingdom of Judah 2:2, 63 .
[92]  Chapter four gives us an account of the frustration to the rebuilding of the house of God.
[93]  The adversaries of Judah and Benjamin, people brought from Babylon and Assyria by the king of Assyria to inhabit Samaria 2 Kings 17:24 , who imitated Israel in seeking God and sacrificing to God, pretended to help the rebuilding of the house of Jehovah, but they were rejected by Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the rest of the heads of the fathers houses.
[94]  Artaxerxes decreed to stop the rebuilding of the house of God by force and power; and the work of the house of God ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia vv.
[95]  Verses 16 through 18 speak of the dedication of the rebuilt house of God.
[96]  The dedication of the rebuilt house of God was with the joy of the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity in celebration v. 16 .
[97]  The dedication was also with the offerings for the dedication and a sin offering for all the tribes of Israel v. 17 . This indicates that as they were offering burnt offerings for God s satisfaction, they could not forget their sin and therefore offered a sin offering.
[98]  For God to fulfill His promise, spoken through Jeremiah, that the captivity would last only for seventy years Jer 25:11-12; Dan 9:2 , He accomplished two returns.
[99]  Verses 11 through 28 tell us about the decree of Artaxerxes king of Persia to Ezra the priest, the scribe.
[100]  He blessed God for putting such a thing as this into the king s heart to beautify the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, saying that God had extended lovingkindness to him before the king, before the king s counselors, and before all the mighty officers of the king.
[101]  God had charged the children of Israel, when they entered into the good land, not to have intermarriage with the peoples of the land.
[102]  Ezra thanked God for leaving them a remnant to escape and for giving them a peg in His holy place by extending His lovingkindness to them in the sight of the kings of Persia to give them a reviving, to raise up the house of their God, and to give them a wall and to repair its ruins in Judah and Jerusalem vv.
[103]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZRA MESSAGE FIVE THE NEED FOR EZRAS
[104]  The Bible is unique, and everything contained in it is significant.
[105]  At the very beginning, the Bible tells us that God created Adam as a creature in His kind Gen 1:26 .
[106]  Adam was God s kind only in likeness and appearance, not in life, nature, and constitution.
[107]  God sent Moses to them to deliver them out of Egypt as a great nation, numbering about two million, and brought them to Mount Sinai, where they stayed for nearly a year to be educated by God.
[108]  In the church life today, the main responsibility of the elders is to teach the saints with the truths.
[109]  The book of Ezra is a history of the return of Israel s captivity and the rebuilding of the house of God as the initiation of God s recovery among His elect for His testimony on the earth according to His economy.
[110]  OF JERUSALEM UNDER NEHEMIAH A. The Report of the Condition of Jerusalem
[111]  4-11 , Nehemiah first praised God for what He is, praising Him for His keeping of His covenant and lovingkindness with those who love Him and keep His commandments v. 5 . Then he confessed the sins of the children of Israel vv.
[112]  6-7 and asked God to remember His word to Moses that He would bring the captivity of His people even from the ends of heaven back to the place of His dwelling vv.
[113]  Chapter five is concerned with the settlement of the interior problem.
[114]  Often as we are fighting outwardly, we have an interior problem.
[115]  LIFE-STUDY OF NEHEMIAH MESSAGE TWO NEHEMIAH S AGGRESSIVENESS Scripture Reading: Neh 1:1 2:8, 17-20
[116]  In this message we will consider Nehemiah s aggressiveness and the need for the proper aggressiveness in the Lord s recovery today.
[117]  The books of Ezra and Nehemiah describe the return of the captives from Babylon to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple and repair the wall for God s house and God s kingdom.
[118]  Second, there was the need of teaching and education to bring the people of God into a culture that was according to God.
[119]  Such a culture was not an Egyptian kind nor a Canaanite kind nor a Babylonian kind but was God s kind, a culture that expressed God.
[120]  Also, King Cyrus brought out the vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and had put into the house of his gods v. 7 . These vessels were then returned to Jerusalem v. 11 . This return from captivity was under the kingly leadership of Zerubbabel, a descendant of the royal family of David 2:1-2 . If we study carefully the record concerning him in the Bible, we will see that he was a strong governor and was very able in managing the people.
[121]  The presenting of this petition was not initiated by God it was initiated by Ezra As the one who took the initiative in this matter, Ezra was a man who trusted in God and who was one with God.
[122]  In typology many persons were temporarily used by God according to their natural capacity and natural virtues to signify something spiritual.
[123]  Nehemiah was an aggressive person who loved God, the holy land, the holy temple, and the holy city, who contacted God and had fellowship with Him, who trusted in God, and who was one with God.
[124]  LIFE-STUDY OF NEHEMIAH MESSAGE THREE THE RECONSTITUTION OF THE NATION
[125]  In this message we will begin to consider the reconstitution of the nation of God s elect chs.
[126]  Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who helped the people understand charged all the people to sanctify that day unto Jehovah their God and not to mourn or weep, for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law.
[127]  The books of Ezra and Nehemiah bear a strong intrinsic significance for the Lord s recovery today.
[128]  The reconstitution also included the dedication of the rebuilt wall vv.
[129]  They offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced with their women and children, for God had caused them to rejoice greatly; and the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar v. 43 . Today our neighbors should know that we are singing Christians, that we are the worshippers of God.
[130]  LIFE-STUDY OF NEHEMIAH MESSAGE FIVE THE LEADERSHIP OF NEHEMIAH
[131]  Nehemiah was a head, a ruler, of a nation, but he was altogether not ambitious.
[132]  This is indicated by the fact that he recognized his need of Ezra In reconstituting the nation, Nehemiah realized that he did not know God s Word.
[133]  But Ezra, who was famous for his knowledge of the Word of God, was still alive, and Nehemiah was willing to go to Ezra for help.
[134]  In order to reconstitute the people of God, there is the need to educate them with the word that comes out of the mouth of God, which expresses God.
[135]  With this message we begin the life-study of the book of Esther Esther is a sweet book, covering, as its central subject, the secret care and the open salvation of the hiding God in Israel s captivity.
[136]  Chapters one and two unveil the secret care of the hiding God for His oppressed elect as seen in Esther
[137]  LIFE-STUDY OF ESTHER MESSAGE TWO THE OPEN SALVATION
[138]  OF THE SCRIPTURES Scripture Reading: Rev 17:1-6, 16; 14:8; Matt 13:37-42; 1 Cor 3:9b-15; Rev 21:1-11, 18-21
[139]  The real condition and end of the Catholic Church are clearly unveiled in Revelation 17.
[140]  The golden cup signifies that in outward appearance the apostate church does have something of God.
[141]  The Catholic Church believes that Christ is God, that He was born of a virgin, and that He died for the sins of sinners and resurrected.
[142]  In their recent catechism, they also pointed out that God became a man that man might become God.
[143]  In today s Protestant churches, on the other hand, there are modernists who do not believe that Christ is God, that He was born of a virgin, and that He died on the cross as the Redeemer.
[144]  The original and recovered church is the genuine church.
