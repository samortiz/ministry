   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AN EXCEPTION IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is only one exception in the Bible concerning the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It happened in Cornelius's house.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Holy Spirit descended upon Cornelius's house before there was any baptism or laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Cornelius's house was an exception because after Pentecost, all the apostles thought that the Lord's grace was confined to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They were conscious that they were the Jews and that the Lord Jesus was also a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At Pentecost the Holy Spirit only descended upon the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The three thousand and five thousand people who were saved at that time were all Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who received the Lord's grace were scattered Jews in dispersion who had returned to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Up to this time, the Lord's grace had been experienced only by the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They were not sure whether this grace could be shared by foreigners the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some Chinese call foreigners foreign devils.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Jews cursed the foreigners even more.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They considered foreigners as animals and beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even Peter could not drop this attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He had the same view as the others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not easy to break through the barrier of man's darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why it was a great matter for the Lord to send Peter to Cornelius's house to open the door for the Gentiles to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He first gave Peter a vision a vessel descending from heaven like a great sheet with many things inside.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord said to Peter, "Slay and eat!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Acts 10:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Peter saw it, he said immediately, "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common and unclean" v. 14 . This means he had never had any dealings with the Gentiles before.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What should he do now?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The sheet came down once, twice, three times.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By then Peter became clear.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Had it not been for this vision, Peter would never have become clear.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Old concepts are really strong!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This vessel came from heaven, and the Lord Himself spoke to him, yet Peter still had reservations about it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord could do nothing except take back the sheet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When it came down from heaven the second time, the Lord spoke to him again, but he still could not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The sheet was taken back again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The third time the Lord sent the sheet down again and showed him the vision once more.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He spoke to him again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By this third time, Peter became clear.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He could not say, "My eyes were mistaken," or, "I have forgotten what I have seen; I cannot remember clearly."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After this vision was unveiled, men from Caesarea came.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then it occurred to Peter that the Gentiles were also able to receive God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The dogs could eat the crumbs under the table.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He went, but after he arrived at Cornelius's house, he still dared not baptize anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Cornelius's household had indeed believed, but Peter dared not baptize them for fear that the brothers who were with him might not accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They might say, "Peter, you are acting independently."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Peter was in an awkward position at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was clear in himself, but the brothers were not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At this point the Lord poured down the Spirit upon the Gentiles before they were baptized and before they had received the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Peter went back, he could say boldly, "I only said a few words; the gospel was not even clearly presented.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet the Holy Spirit came anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I had no alternative but to make up the lack by baptizing them."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Baptism is to forsake the world and enter into Christ, whereas the laying on of hands is to receive the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Cornelius's household had already received the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence there was no more need for them to receive the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is why Peter only baptized them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Later, when Paul returned from Gentile lands to the church in Jerusalem, an argument followed concerning the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Peter brought up the incident again and broke the deadlock.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From that point on, the door to the Gentiles was opened.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Samaria there was the laying on of hands, but in Caesarea there was not the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, God used the case in Caesarea to confirm Paul's work and to settle the case in chapter fifteen.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In chapter nineteen, when Paul came to Ephesus, he again practiced the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, the practice of the laying on of hands continued.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It has not suffered an interruption since.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>GOING ALONG WITH OTHER CHILDREN OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>New believers need to realize that as believers, we cannot live alone.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot be solitary Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must be fellow members together with other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must also learn to submit to the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We cannot be rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must submit to God together with the other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we do this, the anointing will be manifested in our living and our work spontaneously, and we will have a way to go on before the Lord.</S>
