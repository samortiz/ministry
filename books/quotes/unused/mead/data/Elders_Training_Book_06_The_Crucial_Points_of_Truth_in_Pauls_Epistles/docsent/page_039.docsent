   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CRUCIAL POINTS IN HEBREWS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are at least thirteen crucial points in the book of Hebrews which I consider to be thirteen mountain peaks.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every chapter has a peak and we must have the view to see these peaks in Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Chapter One</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The crucial point in chapter one of Hebrews is that the very Son in whom God speaks is the very God v. 8 , the Creator of the universe v. 10 , the effulgence of God s glory and the express image of His substance v. 3 , God s anointed One v. 9 , and also God s firstborn Son v. 6 . When God will send the Son back He will be the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As all these items, He is superior to the angels v. 4 , who are merely servants.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapter Two</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The crucial point in chapter two is that this Son in whom God speaks is a Man a little inferior to the angels vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>7, 9 , a man with blood and flesh who destroyed the Devil, who has the might of death, on the cross v. 14 . He made propitiation for the sins of God s people v. 17 . He was made a little inferior to the angels, yet He destroyed the Devil and He was glorified, crowned with glory and honor v. 7 . He also produced many brothers or many sons in addition to Himself as the firstborn Son of God, and He made them a church vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is leading these many sons into glory v. 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Chapter Three</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The crucial point in chapter three is that the One who speaks God, in whom God speaks, is the very Apostle sent by God to His people v. 1 and the Builder of God s house vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this sense, He is superior to Moses who was also sent as an apostle from God to God s chosen people, but he was not the builder of God s house, just a part of the house itself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Chapter Four</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapter four this One in whom God speaks is the real Joshua v. 8 . The Greek name Jesus is an equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua which means Jehovah the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This Joshua brings us into the real rest of the Sabbath v. 9 . To cover this point you have to study the Life-study Messages on the Sabbath rest messages 18 through 24.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Chapter Five</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In chapter five the crucial point is that the One in whom God speaks is the heavenly High Priest, much higher than Aaron as the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Aaron s priesthood was according to the order of Aaron, but this One s priesthood is according to the order of Melchisedec vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The order of Aaron was temporary, but the order of Melchisedec is eternal, so His priesthood is much superior to that of Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Chapter Six</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The crucial point in chapter six is concerning the good word of God as a part of the genuine enjoyment of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But whatever is in chapter six as the enjoyment of the New Testament bequests as the blessing of the gospel is in the kindergarten stage.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, in this chapter all the believers are encouraged to go on to reach maturity v. 1 , to go on to the heavenly ministry of Christ in the Holy of Holies in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To go on to this ministry we have to learn how to follow the Forerunner, the Pioneer, and this Christ has become the Forerunner within the veil v. 19-20 . In order to go on to this heavenly ministry, we have to enter the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The way to enter the veil is fully explained in chapter ten.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Chapter Seven</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In chapter seven the crucial point is that this heavenly High Priest is ministering not by the commandment of letters but by a life of incorruption, an indestructible life v. 16 , which is the very uncreated, eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ being the heavenly High Priest is not by commandments in dead letters but by the divine life which is eternal, indestructible, and in incorruption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is now interceding for us so He can save us to the uttermost v. 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Chapter Eight</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In chapter eight the crucial point is that this excellent One in whom God speaks or who speaks God is the heavenly Minister v. 2 and the heavenly Mediator v. 6 to execute the very New Testament, which is the new will bequeathed by Him in His resurrection and enacted by Him in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now He is the heavenly Minister according to this New Testament, and He is executing all the bequests of this new will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Chapter Nine</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In chapter nine the crucial point is that this very One in whom God speaks brings us into the Holy of Holies to enjoy all the riches within the ark where the two tablets of the law, the hidden manna, and the budding rod are vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>3-4, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This one is also the One who offered Himself as an eternal sacrifice through the eternal Spirit v. 14 . The Son s death was not only in His humanity but also with His divinity through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His offering of Himself on the cross is an eternal sacrifice offered by the eternal Spirit, so it bears an eternal efficacy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The very redemption accomplished by this offering is an eternal redemption v. 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Chapter Ten</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Chapter ten tells us that this One in whom God speaks replaces all the offerings of the Old Testament according to God s will vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>4-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is the offering.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is the fulfillment, the termination, and the replacement of all the Old Testament offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, it says in chapter ten that there is no longer an offering for sin v. 18 . By such an all-inclusive offering He cut the way through His death by crucifying our old man in the flesh for us to enter into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Holy of Holies we enjoy Him in His heavenly ministry vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Also, we have to be faithful; otherwise, we will suffer discipline vv.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>23-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we will be faithful to follow the Lord according to His New Testament economy, we will receive a reward v. 35 . For this reason we should not forsake assembling together that we may exhort one another to go on to enjoy Him in His heavenly ministry v. 25 . If we still remain in His earthly ministry, we will miss the mark and will suffer a loss of discipline because we did not go on to His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that we did not know God s word of righteousness concerning His justice and righteousness exercised in His dispensational and governmental dealings with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Chapter Eleven</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In chapter eleven the focal point is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Faith is a reaction to the scenery of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is the substantiating of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen v. 1 . For us to enjoy all the bequests of the New Testament we should exercise this faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We walk according to faith, not according to any appearance by sight 2 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to take faith as our way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Faith is the way to enjoy the heavenly ministry of Christ bequeathed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Chapter Twelve</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since we have seen all that Christ is in His heavenly ministry and we have the way to go on, we have to run the race v. 1 . We have to run the race because we all have come to eight things.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, to myriads of angels, to the church of the firstborn ones who have been enrolled in the heavens, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect, to Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks better than that of Abel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Mount Zion is mentioned not in a physical sense, but in a spiritual sense.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In a spiritual sense we have come to the church already.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We do not need to enter the New Jerusalem because we are in it already we have come.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because we have come, then we run the race.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the Bible it is not firstly to run and then to enter.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the Bible we first enter the gate and then walk on the way Matt 7:13-14 and run the race.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Chapter Thirteen</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Chapter thirteen tells us we need to follow Jesus outside the camp, bearing His reproach v. 13 . Before chapter thirteen, all the chapters are on enjoying the heavenly Christ within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Now chapter thirteen tells us to be outside the camp, outside religion, to follow the rejected Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is only when we enjoy the heavenly Christ within the veil 6:19 in the Holy of Holies, that we are able to follow outside the camp, outside religion, the very rejected Jesus who was walking on this earth.</S>
