<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING ACCORDING TO<br />
THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES</h2>
<p>In this chapter we want to see the major contents of the meetings according to the scriptural way. First, the contents of our meetings according to the God-ordained way must always be according to the teaching of the apostles. In the approximately six thousand years of human history, human society has invented many cultural and philosophical things. Christianity, including both Catholicism and Protestantism, has been on this earth as a religious system for nearly two thousand years and has picked up many pagan things from human society. Some of these things seem very good and seem very close to the teaching of the Bible, but they are not according to the teaching of the apostles. In the cathedrals, chapels, and other meeting places in Christianity, many teachings are taught that are different from the apostles&rsquo; teaching concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Since we practice meeting according to the truth of the Bible, we do not like to have only one speaker. We desire to have all the saints learning to speak. Some Christian groups do not like to have more than one speaker because to have one speaker is the most effective way to control their congregation. To them it is a great risk to allow everyone to speak. If there are one thousand members and everyone speaks, a thousand different ideas and philosophies could come into the church. To have every attendant speaking in all the meetings opens the door wide to any kind of false teaching, false doctrine, or heresy. Apparently this is true, but we have the confidence that our meeting is not a meeting in human society. Our meeting is a meeting of the saints who live in the spirit and only live Christ. We have the confidence that whenever saints like this come together, they would not speak anything other than what was taught by the apostles.</p>
<p>Acts 2:42 tells us that the three thousand saints who were saved on the day of Pentecost continued steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles. The word <em>teaching</em> in this verse is singular not plural, indicating that the apostles did not have many kinds of teachings. They only had one kind of teaching, and this kind of teaching is the content of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The apostles&rsquo; teaching is concerning God&rsquo;s eternal economy, or dispensation, and we need to realize what this economy comprises.</p>
<p>The Triune God has an eternal plan, an eternal economy, to get a people to be His corporate expression, and for Him to do this He has to be the very Christ. This Christ was completed in the four Gospels. The completion of Christ involved the Triune God plus humanity. He became incarnated to bring the Triune God into humanity and to make humanity a vessel that He might be a man and might live on this earth to accomplish His all-inclusive redemption, that is, His all-inclusive death. Then He came out of death in resurrection, and in resurrection this very Christ became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Today this life-giving Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, the planning Father, the accomplishing Son, and the applying Spirit. This wonderful One, this marvelous One, this excellent One, is the embodiment of the Triune God. Before His incarnation, the Trinity had not been consummated. Through the processes of incarnation, human living, death on the cross, resurrection from the dead, and ascension to the heavens, the Triune God has been consummated to be the Spirit. The Spirit is the very embodiment and realization of the divine Trinity.</p>
<p>This dear One is the One in whom we believe, whom we worship as our God, and whom we take as our Savior. It is this dear One who imparts life into us, who has regenerated us, and who is still sanctifying, transforming, and conforming us to His very Being. When we received the Triune God, we became the Father&rsquo;s sons and the Son&rsquo;s brothers to be His Body for a corporate expression on this earth of the Triune God. This expression is the church as the Body of the all-inclusive Christ, and this Body is the fullness of this wonderful One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:22b-23). These are the contents of God&rsquo;s economy, which is also the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>I hope that especially the young people will spend more time to get into all the details of God&rsquo;s economy. These things have to enter into your being, and you have to enter into these things in order to make these things one with your being. Week after week and year after year we teach people this divine economy based upon the sixty-six books of the Bible and even more upon the twenty-seven books of the New Testament.</p>
<p>I hope that all of us would practice to spend time on two or three verses in the New Testament every morning for two or three years. Get these verses into you and get yourself into them. I advise not going to the Old Testament until you finish the New Testament. Labor day after day on the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. When you get into these two or three verses, do not forget to get into their accompanying notes in the Recovery Version. This will help you to reach one goal, that is, the New Testament economy of God, which is the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching comprises the twenty-seven books of the New Testament in four main parts. The first part of the New Testament was spoken by the Lord when He was in the flesh on this earth. The second part was spoken by the Apostle Peter as a continuation of the Lord&rsquo;s word in the four Gospels. The third part was spoken by the Apostle Paul in portions of the Acts and in his fourteen Epistles. The fourth and final part of the speaking in the New Testament was given through the Apostle John. Besides these four main parts of the New Testament, there are also James and Jude, but these dear saints did not have as important a role as the three apostles mentioned above in the composing of the New Testament.</p>
<p>In the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, there are many different teachings, but these teachings are subordinate to the teaching of the apostles. Foot washing is in John 13 and head covering is in 1 Corinthians 11, but subordinate things like these are not that crucial. A person can lose a fingernail and still live, but if he loses his heart, he will lose his life. I have said in the past that four short books composed by the Apostle Paul&mdash;Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians&mdash;are the heart of the divine revelation. I noticed that many good Bible students and Bible scholars wore out these four books. A good reader and student of the Bible will be one who wears out these four books. The most worn-out part of the Bibles I have used is the part from Galatians through Colossians. This part of our Bible should be worn out since these four books are the very heart of the divine revelation.</p>
<p>Because every meeting in our new practice of the church life is open to us, do not consider that this affords you a good opportunity to express your philosophy. Today on this earth, everyone has his philosophy. Divorces are the result of the husbands&rsquo; philosophies and the wives&rsquo; philosophies conflicting. If all the wives and husbands would drop their philosophies, there would not be divorce or separation. Separations and divorces come through philosophies. The church has been divided today into thousands of divisions due to different philosophies. A teaching is a philosophy. Try not to bring your philosophy into the church meeting. You have to stick yourself to the teaching of the apostles. Your teaching, your speaking, should be absolutely governed, limited, ruled, and controlled by the teaching of the apostles.</p>
