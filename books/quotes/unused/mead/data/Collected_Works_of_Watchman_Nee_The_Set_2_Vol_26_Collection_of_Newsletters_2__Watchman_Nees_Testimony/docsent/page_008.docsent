   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE OF THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN CHEN HSIA KUAN IN P'ING YANG, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Before there was a meeting here, we listened to the Word and worshipped in the meeting in the Ao Nei denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At that time I listened to the Word, but I did not know that Jesus was crucified for me or that He died and lives for me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All we wanted was to change our behavior a little.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thank God, in 1928 Brothers Wang, Ts'ai, and a few other good servants of the Lord came from Wu Tai and Tai Sun to meet with us in Ts'uo Tze.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time I heard that Jesus died on the cross for us to bear our all and shed His blood to cleanse away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I immediately received, believed, and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I was not only saved but also revived.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was not the only one who was revived.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There were several other brothers who were revived at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every Wednesday and Friday evening at 5:30 we went to Ao Nei for a two-hour prayer meeting and walked back home.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was a trip of more than ten miles over narrow paths and mountain roads.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We returned home at 11:30.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One brother told us that before he believed in the Lord, he could not walk five miles in half a day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After he believed in the Lord and was saved and revived, he could walk more than twenty miles with us on foot every Wednesday and Friday to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was more than six hours round trip.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was truly the power of God overshadowing him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are some other brothers who have been attending the prayer meeting for more than a year now.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2 In 1929 a few of us discussed the possibility of having a prayer meeting in our own locality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time the brothers were all in one accord and went immediately to rent a place for the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On Wednesday and Friday more than ten people, including old ones, young ones, men and women, met to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After discussing the situation, everyone prayed and waited before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thank God for His marvelousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that time there was a five-room tiled house in which a demon had appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nobody lived in it, and it was for sale for a very good price.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They wanted one hundred twenty dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We had very few people and most were poor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We could not borrow money from other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We prayed before God; each person did his best.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We wrote down our own offering and placed it in the offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some for one, two, three, ten, twenty, thirty, fifty, or one hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After adding them all up, it totaled two hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The brothers then purchased this house.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The house is about ten miles from Chen Hsia Kuan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later, we set a time to tear down the old house.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the work was done by the brothers in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God gave us another miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The five-room house of wood and tile was torn down in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We carried the building materials, totaling more than two hundred baskets, to the river by hand and transported them by boat to Chen Hsia Kuan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>3 In 1930 a four-room tiled house was temporarily completed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The entire cost came to four hundred fifty dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thank God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do not know where the money came from.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We never expected God's grace to be so great.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In our human mentality, we wanted a two-room straw thatched house.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Who could have guessed that God would prepare a four-room tiled house for us to meet in?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God really does everything beyond what we ask or think.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>4 We began meeting in September of 1930.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There were six brothers in the table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There were more than twenty people who came to the gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now there are sixteen in the table meeting and more than sixty in the gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God has cast out demons and healed sicknesses in many places.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now many people want to come hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I ask the brothers and sisters in every place to pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>From,</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Wu Tze Chien</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>June 18, 1934</S>
