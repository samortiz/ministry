   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REDEEMED AND DELIVERED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the book of Exodus we see Christ as the delivering Angel, as the speaking Moses, and as the redeeming and nourishing lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The house of Israel enjoyed all these aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They enjoyed both the blood of the lamb and the life of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through this enjoyment they were set free and received the strength to make their exodus out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Israelites crossed the Red Sea, the Egyptian forces followed them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But God buried them all under the flood of water, just as soon as the house of Israel walked through the water as on dry land.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the Israelites were not only redeemed from God s judgment; they were also delivered from the bondage of the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is the delivering Angel, the speaking Moses, and the redeeming Lamb with the cleansing blood and the nourishing, strengthening life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By applying this Christ to our situation, we are redeemed, released, and delivered from Satan s bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hallelujah, we are free!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE PASSOVER BEING A TYPE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First Corinthians 5:7 and 8 say, Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These verses indicate clearly that the Passover in the Old Testament is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is our Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every day we enjoy Him as the unleavened bread, as the sinless element.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Day by day we feast, not only on the flesh of the Lamb, but also upon this unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have escaped from Egypt, and we have been delivered from the bondage of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we are free to follow the Lord in the wilderness, where there is no more bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>ENJOYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>AS MANNA AND AS THE LIVING WATER</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, as we follow the Lord in the wilderness, we still need to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the children of Israel were journeying through the wilderness, Christ came to them again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When they were in Egypt, He came as the Angel, as Moses, and as the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But in the wilderness He came as a small round thing, like coriander seed, for the purpose of nourishing, strengthening, satisfying, and energizing them Exo 16:14-15, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The house of Israel called the name of this small, round thing manna Exo 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without this manna, the Israelites could not have journeyed through the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Praise the Lord that day by day Christ came from the heavens to visit them and to give them nourishment!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Passover took place just one time, but eating the manna is a daily matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to feed upon Christ as the manna every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In fact, we need to enjoy Christ at least three times a day, eating Him in the morning, at noon, and in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do you enjoy Christ like this?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Did you eat Him as your breakfast this morning?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This morning for my physical breakfast I had some German bread.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was very solid; and it energized me, satisfied me, and strengthened me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is much more solid than German bread.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must daily enjoy Him as our breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ also should be our lunch at noon and our dinner in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is not only our Angel, our Moses, and our Lamb; He is our daily, heavenly manna.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is also the rock flowing with living water Exo 17:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ is our spiritual food and our spiritual drink.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First Corinthians 10:3 and 4 say, And did all eat the same spiritual meat; and did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Oh, we all must enjoy Christ to such an extent!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Day by day, He is the manna and He is the rock that follows us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever we are thirsty, we can drink of the living water flowing from this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As the heavenly manna and the heavenly drink, Christ surely is our daily supply.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Certainly this is the kernel in the book of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today we are enjoying this kernel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE ISSUE OF THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD ON EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have seen that the house of Israel was under bondage in Egypt and that Christ came as the Angel, as Moses and as the Lamb to redeem and deliver them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the wilderness the Israelites were nourished daily by the manna and the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now we must see the issue of this enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Exodus 19:4 the Lord said, Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles wings, and brought you unto myself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Exodus 25:8 we see God s purpose in bringing the house of Israel out of Egypt to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this verse the Lord commanded Moses, And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God told the children of Israel to build Him a tabernacle, and they did build a tabernacle for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This tabernacle, the dwelling place of God, also signified the house of Israel.</S>
