<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS OF REGENERATION, THE BRASS SERPENT, AND THE BRIDE</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:1-16</h1><p>At the beginning of this message I would call your attention to John 3:16, a very familiar verse to us all: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.” Please notice that this verse begins with the little word “for.” The Greek word rendered “for” here, gar, is often used in a very significant way, especially in the writings of Paul. Paul’s Epistles show that he was a very logical and reasonable person. Often he uses the word “for” to explain his thought. For example, in Romans 8:1-27, twelve verses begin with this word.<p>The use of the word “for” at the beginning of John 3:16 indicates that this is not an isolated verse. On the contrary, this is a verse that depends upon the foregoing word. Based upon what is covered in 3:1-15, verse 16 explains, “For God so loved the world.…”<h2 class=head1>GRACE AND GIFT</h2><p>Before considering this matter further, I would like to speak concerning grace. Grace refers to a gift, to something given free of charge. If you were to give someone a free gift, that gift may be regarded as grace. The Greek word for grace, charis, may be rendered either grace or gift. A gift is always a grace. According to the common understanding among Christians, grace denotes unmerited favor.<p>The Gospel of John uses the word grace in a very emphatic way. John 1:14 says that the Word, which is God, became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace. Then in 1:16 and 17 John goes on to say, “For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.” The law is lifeless; hence, it was given. Grace, however, is a person; hence, we are told that grace came. Students of the Bible know that the law is a great matter, but grace is an even greater matter. We may say that the Bible teaches two main things: the law of the old dispensation and the grace of the new dispensation. No other book in the New Testament emphasizes grace in the way the Gospel of John does. If we would know what grace is, we need to come to this Gospel, a Gospel that emphasizes grace to the uttermost, and inquire of the Apostle John what he means by grace.<p>In chapter three of John we have a definition of grace, even though the word grace is not used in this chapter. John 3:16 says that God so loved the world that He gave us His only begotten Son. We are not told here that God gave us some kind of unmerited favor; we are told that He gave us a Person, His Son. This Person whom God gave is the gift, and this gift is grace.<p>In John 3 we have a link that connects this chapter with John 1. In chapter one of John we have grace, and in chapter three we have God’s gift. Grace is the giving, and this giving is grace.
