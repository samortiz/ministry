   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE WITH THE LORD IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us go on to chapter seven.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I am so happy that we have such a chapter as this in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us firstly read verse 10: And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is this the Apostle Paul commanding or is it the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The meaning is this: when I command, the Lord commands with me; the Lord commands in my commanding.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do you think that if Paul commanded by the exercise of his mind or emotion he could say, Yet not I, but the Lord ?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It must be that he commanded in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was one with the Lord in his spirit; so when he commanded in his spirit, he could say yet not I, but the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I command in my spirit, the Lord commands with me, for I am one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now let us read verse 12: But to the rest speak I, not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If I were there, I would say, Brother Paul, if it is not the Lord that is speaking, you should not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But Paul said clearly and definitely, I speak, not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Would you dare to say this?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Would you dare to say, I am going to speak something to you, not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul makes it clear that the word he is about to speak is not spoken by the Lord, but by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But I would ask you, do you take the word which he goes on to speak as of Paul or as of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I believe you take that word as of the Lord, and I do too.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But let us go on to verse 25.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul had no commandment of the Lord, yet he gave his opinion judgment here means opinion as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was saying in effect, I do not have the commandment of the Lord, but I have an opinion as one who has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So within my opinion, there must be something of the Lord s opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have no commandment from the Lord, but I am one with the Lord; so whatever my opinion is must be the Lord s opinion too.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If this one chapter was not in the Bible, and what we are saying here was something of our speaking, all Christianity would rise up and accuse us of heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They would say, If you do not have the commandment of the Lord, you must wait till you have the inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the way of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But here is a man who tells us clearly that he does not have the commandment of the Lord, yet he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What kind of teaching is this?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>TRUE SPIRITUALITY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us go on now to verse 40: But she is happier if she so abide, after my opinion: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God this is the best rendering of this verse .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that Paul not only had an opinion, but he also had the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But notice that he said, I think I have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He did not say that he was certain he had the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the Apostle Paul were here, I would check with him: Paul, tell me, do you have the Spirit of God or not?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Apostle Paul did prophesy in this chapter, and at the end of this long prophecy of forty verses he says, This is my opinion, and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes I would like to hear a brother in the meeting prophesy for fifteen minutes and at the conclusion say, Brothers, this is my opinion, yet I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That would not be like the Fundamentalists nor the Pentecostals of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Fundamentalists would say, Now Pastor Smith has a word from the Lord for us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Pentecostals would say, Yea, thus saith the Lord, O my people...</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul did not speak like this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Too much assurance means that we are not in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more you could say like Paul, This is my opinion, yet I think that I also have the Spirit of God, the more spiritual you are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose that I stand up to speak, and after speaking a brother asks whether or not I am in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If I answer, Yes, brother, I am in the Spirit, be assured that I am not in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if I answer, Brother, I dare not say that I am in the Spirit I just feel that I must utter something; it may only be my opinion, but I think I have at least a little of the Spirit of God ; I tell you, if I could answer in this way, I am a real and spiritual prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is involved here is the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While Jesus was on this earth, He acted as a human being: He was so human, yet God was with Him, God was in Him, God was one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The same principle of incarnation has been applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ has been incarnated into all of us: He dwells in our spirit, and we are one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is rather difficult for me to tell you whether it is only I that am speaking, or that when I am speaking it is also He speaking in me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I have no assurance whether I am speaking in the Spirit; yet as one who has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful, I have confidence that He is one with me, so that when I speak, it may be that He speaks too.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is real spirituality.</S>
