   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW COVENANT 5 Issue No. 32 Scripture Reading: Matt 26:28; Heb 8:6-12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have previously seen that God is a God who makes covenants with man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have also seen that instead of uplifting Himself to an untouchable position, God has lowered Himself to our position, so that we can enjoy the same rights as He has.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We see that God has uplifted us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He has allowed us to deal with Him and ask of Him according to the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God allows us to demand that He execute everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since this is the case, we can rise up and exercise our faith to hold onto God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have seen that in the original language, a covenant is both a covenant as well as a testament or a will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Covenant and will are the same word in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hebrews uses the word covenant many times.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It first tells us that Christ is higher than the prophets, angels, Moses, Joshua, and Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All this is very wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But this is not the goal of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These teachings are indeed in Hebrews, and Bible expositors have done a commendable job on expounding them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But we see that Hebrews has one specific goal: to put the new covenant before us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is repeatedly emphasized from chapter six to thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although this book mentions the blood, Aaron, Moses, and the sacrifices, all these things are mentioned in relation to the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The goal of chapters six through thirteen is to tell us what the new covenant is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE COVENANT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>AND THE TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who is the One who made the new covenant with us?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is it the Lord or is it God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is God, not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus shed His blood to accomplish the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the One who made the covenant with us is God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why is the covenant also a testament?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The covenant is something that God has made and, therefore, is a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The covenant is something that the Lord Jesus left to us at His death and, therefore, is a will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A covenant does not require the maker to die before it becomes effective, but a testament requires the testator to die before it becomes effective.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is universally agreed that when a man is still alive, his testament will not be put into effect.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we see that God made a covenant with us, while the death of the Lord Jesus has left us the testament.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the one hand, the Lord has redeemed the inheritance with His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the other hand, He has left us the new covenant as our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hebrews 9:15-17 says, "And because of this He is the Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For where there is a testament, the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For a testament is confirmed in the case of the dead, since it never has force when he who made the testament is living."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hebrews 10:16-17 says, " This is the covenant which I will covenant with them after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws upon their hearts, and upon their mind I will inscribe them,' He then says, And their sins and their lawlessnesses I shall by no means remember anymore.'"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Please note that Hebrews 8 tells us that God has made a new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He said, "I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them..for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Chapter ten is merely a reiteration of the words of chapter eight.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Chapter nine tells us that the Lord Jesus Christ is "the Mediator of a new covenant."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A more accurate translation should be "the Executor of a new covenant."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord is the One who executes the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 10:16 says that God is the One who has covenanted the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As far as the new covenant is concerned, God is the Maker of the covenant, while as far as a testament is concerned, Christ is the Mediator.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now we will list the items included in the new covenant:</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>1 Cleansing Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>2 Knowledge Victory</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>3 Life and power Victory</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The covenant includes three main parts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Cleansing is in respect to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Knowledge is in respect to the knowledge of God, and life and power are in respect to victory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As far as making a covenant with us is concerned, God cleanses us, God grants the knowledge of God to us, and God gives us life and power.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As far as a testament is concerned, Christ has willed cleansing to us, and Christ has willed the knowledge of God to us, and Christ has willed life and power to us.</S>
