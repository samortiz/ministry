   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prophesying</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied Acts 19:6; see also Luke 1:67 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Ephesian believers were filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit, they not only spoke in tongues but also prophesied.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, prophesying is another manifestation of being filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of the five examples of the outward filling of the Holy Spirit recorded in Acts, speaking in tongues is mentioned only in regard to the disciples on the day of Pentecost, those in Cornelius s house, and the Ephesian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The other two instances the Samaritan believers in chapter 8 and Saul of Tarsus in chapter 9 do not mention the matter of speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows that the manifestation of speaking in tongues is not required as a proof of the outward filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What the Bible does not record is as meaningful as what the Bible records.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, we dare not preach, as certain groups preach, that a person must speak in tongues in order to be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not according to the record of the Bible in at least two cases in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Others Can See It</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He has poured out this which you both see and hear Acts 2:33; see also 8:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the disciples at Pentecost and the Samaritan believers were filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit, others saw it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is certain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a person is filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit, there will be a heavenly, spiritual condition that others can see.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Way to Be Filled Outwardly</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>with the Holy Spirit Repenting and Dealing with Sin</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Repent...each one of you...for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit Acts 2:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a person repents for the forgiveness of his sins, he receives the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, if we want to be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit, we must thoroughly repent and turn to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must confess all our sins before God and clear them up, dealing with them until we are clean.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the first requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Believing</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we repent and turn to God, after we have dealt with and cleared up our sins, we must believe that we are baptized in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the baptism of the Spirit is a fact accomplished upon the whole church and we are part of the church, we have already participated in the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This should be our enjoyment and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should believe in what the Lord has accomplished and what the Lord has spoken concerning this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we should use faith to receive what the Lord accomplished according to His word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Obeying</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him Acts 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God gives the Holy Spirit to those who obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, if we want to receive the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, we must obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should obey and agree with what God wants us to do and with whatever He asks of us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we will be able to receive the outward filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Praying with One Accord</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These all continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer Acts 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we want to receive the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, we must pray individually, and we should pray together with one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first group of people who were filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost prayed together in one accord for ten days before they richly received the outward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Meeting to Pursue</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled, they were all together in the same place...And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit Acts 2:1, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At times, we also need to meet together to pursue the outward filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The disciples on the day of Pentecost received the filling when they pursued in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through the Laying On of Hands</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit ; Ananias...laying his hands on him...said...be filled with the Holy Spirit ; When Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them Acts 8:17; 9:17; 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These portions in the Bible show that the early Samaritan believers, Saul of Tarsus, and the Ephesian believers all received the outward filling of the Holy Spirit through the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When new ones believe in the Lord and become a part of the Body, a representative of the Body should lay hands on them so that the anointing on the Body can flow to them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is because the Holy Spirit has already flowed from Christ, the Head, to the church, the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Under normal conditions, believers will receive the Holy Spirit when a representative of the Body lays hands on them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, we should ask the Lord to bring us into a normal condition of having those among us who could represent the Body and lay hands on the brothers and sisters so that the anointing on the Body could flow greatly among us, causing many to receive the outward filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
