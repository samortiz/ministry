   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR SELECTING HYMNS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE FELLOWSHIP MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE LORD S TABLE MEETING TEN KINDS OF HYMNS IN THE COURSE OF A MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the course of a meeting, there is the need for ten different kinds of hymns: first, for opening; second, for introducing the subject; third, for strengthening; fourth, for uplifting the spirit; fifth, for turning; sixth, for correction; seventh, for maintaining the spirit; eighth, for filling up the time; ninth, for conclusion; and tenth, for lingering or sending off.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Also, if we do not know the categories of hymns, the nature of the hymns, it will be difficult for us to consider other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to select hymns in a meeting, we must first know the nature of the hymns; some hymns are on gospel preaching, some are on spiritual warfare, others are on praising, and yet others are on building.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must know the different hymn categories before we can properly select them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The progression of the Lord s table meeting and the prayer meeting can be divided into ten steps or sections.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A meeting does not always require this many sections, but in general it may consist of not more than these ten sections.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the beginning of a meeting, we should select an opening hymn with much consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the opening hymn we need an introductory hymn to lead us to the subject of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the spirit of the meeting is not strong enough after the introduction, we need to call a strengthening hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, if the spirit is still not strong enough, we should select a hymn that uplifts the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes the introductory hymn may lead to the wrong subject.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, if we should be praising, but someone selects a hymn concerning confessing our sins, there is the need for an immediate turn, or a correction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, in a Lord s table meeting someone may choose a hymn for the worship of the Father while we are still remembering the Lord, or in a prayer meeting someone may choose a hymn of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In both of these instances there is the need for turning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During a meeting that is prolonged, there may be the need for a hymn to maintain the spirit, to prevent the spirit from being weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to fill up the time, there also may be the need for a time-filling hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Finally, there is a concluding hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, there are times after a meeting has ended when everyone wants to linger on.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When this happens, we can choose a hymn to send everyone off.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I hope we can remember all of these principles in selecting hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>AN EXERCISE IN SELECTING HYMNS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>FOR THE FELLOWSHIP MEETING Selecting the Opening Hymn</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now let us consider the hymns for the fellowship meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose the saints are like plain water that is neither sweet nor sour nor spicy and thus are indifferent toward the Lord when they come together for the fellowship meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Which hymn should we select for opening the meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Someone may suggest Hymns, #395, O Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me, / And all thing else recede.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This hymn is not appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not a general hymn but rather has a specific purpose; such a hymn can be used in leading to a particular subject.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Another person may suggest Hymns, #960, My King will soon come back again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This hymn is acceptable but still not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because it is a longer hymn, it is suitable as an opening hymn, to give the saints time for their hearts to be settled and for their spirits to be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This hymn is a better choice than Hymns, #395 because it reminds us of the condition at the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hymns, #423, Thou hidden love of God, is also good because it does not have a specific theme.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hymn #352 in the Chinese hymnal, Though we waver as the seasons, / He will every change endure, is a good hymn and is probably the best choice for a fellowship meeting, but we cannot sing this hymn every time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Consequently, we need to have more hymns in reserve.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to practice continually.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hymns, #578, My will is weak, my strength is frail, is quite a deep hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hymn #625 in the Chinese hymnal, O Lord, we gather before Thy face, has the flavor of spiritual pursuit and may therefore be used in a prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hymn #353 in the Chinese hymnal, Once I had a fervent heart, is somewhat related to spiritual pursuit and may also be used in a prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hymns, #693, He faileth not, for He is God, is not that suitable because the train of thought in this hymn does not match our subject.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hymns, #437, Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him, is also inappropriate because the feeling of this hymn is very high.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the fellowship meeting, which does not have a particular subject, we should not use hymns that have a specific subject.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hymns, #720, God hath not promised skies always blue, / Flower-strewn pathways all our lives through, is not suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a good hymn to sing to comfort those who have suffered a domestic misfortune.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hymns, #370, Abide with me! fast falls the eventide, is not suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we sing this hymn to enjoy the Lord s presence when the sun is setting, it would be quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Or if someone is dying, we can sing this hymn with his or her family.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hymns, #492, In all thy work, O Lord, Thou didst, is a very deep hymn with a specific subject; hence, it is not suitable as an opening hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hymns, #207, Lord Jesus! when we think of Thee, / Of all Thy love and grace, is toward the Lord; hence, it cannot be used as an opening hymn in a fellowship meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hymns, #333, I know not why God s wondrous grace / To me He hath made known, cannot be used because the chorus is a quotation from the Bible; it is very specific.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hymns, #707 is on counting God s blessing and therefore is not appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hymns, #657, Can you be obedient / To the Lord of all, is a challenging hymn and therefore is not suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hymns, #1048, Just as I am, without one plea, should be used in gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hymns, #397, More holiness give me, can be sung at the beginning of a fellowship meeting when there is a feeling of insipidness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hymns, #280, Lord, may Thy blood now cleanse me, / Wash all my sins away, is barely acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hymns, #705, In some way or other the Lord will provide, is very specific and therefore not appropriate.</S>
