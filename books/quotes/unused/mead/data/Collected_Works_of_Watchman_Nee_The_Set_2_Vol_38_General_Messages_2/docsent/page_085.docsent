   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT A PERFECT FAMILY LIFE A talk given on October 6, 1936,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>at the wedding of Brother Ping and Sister Bau ADJUSTING THE DIFFERENCES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BETWEEN HUSBANDS AND WIVES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every time a brother and a sister are married, I have to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is a little hard for me to speak tonight because I spoke a word just a few days ago.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am here again after only a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It seems too soon for me to speak again on this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have mentioned one thing again and again among us; perhaps, it is good to mention it again today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have said over the past few years that we should not consider marriage to be nothing but happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If our hope is too high, our disappointment will become great.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Ping and Sister Bau, this may be the beginning of happy days, but there are surely days of suffering ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It seems that the word suffering is not a very appropriate word for an occasion like today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps I should say that all of the days ahead may not be happy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A few days ago I said that happiness will come after five years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Two years ago I met a family in Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps I can say that it was an ideal family, the best that I have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I asked the brother, "It seems to me that you have an ideal family, but at what point did your family become so ideal?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Did it start from the day that you were first married, or did it begin sometime afterward?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He wondered what I meant, so I said, "I somewhat hold to the notion that a happy family life begins five years after the marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The honeymoon is the beginning of bitter waters; the waters do not turn sweet until later."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the evening we sat and talked in the courtyard.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was silent for a while and then suddenly jumped up and said, "You are right.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the beginning there was quite a lot of friction and noise between the two of us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later it went away."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>During the past few days, I have met with Brother Ping a few times and Sister Bau also.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They have bought their wok, their dishes, their broom, and their towels.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But tonight I will ask you to bring home one more thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do not bring this home, you cannot form a real family.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have to bring this home before your family can become a family.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This one thing is the adjustment of the differences between the husband and the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Formerly you both lived as individuals, and you were free to do whatever you wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But now your tent has been nailed down; the stakes are there, and something binds you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From now on there is another person in your life and living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The two are together and have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Chinese have a saying: "To make two become one."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If there is only one person, nothing will happen; there is no need for harmony if there is only one person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Oneness is the representation of harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The ultimate expression of harmony is oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, it is right to say, "To make two become one."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But this is exactly where the problem lies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the beginning everything was well between Adam and Eve because God made Eve out of Adam and gave her back to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The two became one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They were one becoming two and two becoming one again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The problem today, however, is that Sister Bau did not come out of Brother Ping.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first part of the story is missing; only the second part is present.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our wedding meeting is only the second half putting together two persons with different lives, different educational backgrounds, different upbringings, and differences in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we merely put the two together, they are still two.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only when the two become one will the family be free from trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the two cannot become one, the family will never be a success.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You can do without all the miscellaneous things in a family, but you cannot do without this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You may ask me whether I have the assurance and the way to deal with the differences between husbands and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brother Ping and Sister Bau, are you ready?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You have to start picking up this matter immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is one item of furnishing that you must have.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From now on, you will see each other more, and you will also rub each other more.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The question is whether or not there is oil in your rubbing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It may be difficult to find such a thing among the unbelievers or in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But thank the Lord that we are Christians, and it is easy to find this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some among us today are not yet believers, and it is impossible to find this among them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But we are believers, and we can consider this matter from God's view.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God has divided all people into two categories: those who are in Adam and those who are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If our brother and sister remain in their position in Christ, this couple, this family, will never run into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if they live in the other realm, if they live in Adam, it will be impossible to not get into trouble as a couple and as a family.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should never think that as long as the woman manages the home well and the man keeps his job, the family will be kept together.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Just as spirituality is needed in a meeting, spirituality is needed in the family as well.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Just as the meeting life has much to do with our spirituality, the family life also has much to do with our spirituality.</S>
