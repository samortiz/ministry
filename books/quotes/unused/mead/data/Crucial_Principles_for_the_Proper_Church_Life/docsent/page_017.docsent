   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Being Our One Teacher and Leader</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Matthew 23:8 the Lord said, Do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 5:31 says, This One God has exalted to His right hand as Leader and Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is our one Teacher and Leader.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the New Testament age God would not allow His people to have a single, unique leader among men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There was not one apostle but twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Besides the twelve, there were other apostles, such as Paul, Barnabas, and Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, in each local church there should not be only one unique elder.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In every local church the eldership should be plural.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The plurality of the eldership is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Case of Peter Revealing That Leadership in the Church Is Not Official, Permanent, or Organizational but Depends on Spiritual Capacity</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus originally appointed the twelve apostles Mark 3:14; Luke 6:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In every record of the names of the twelve apostles in the four Gospels, Peter s name always stands as the first Matt 10:2; Mark 3:16; Luke 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even in Acts 1:13 Peter s name was first.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, the Catholic Church says that Peter is the successor, the representative, of Christ, and they claim that Peter was the first pope.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the full record in the New Testament reveals that although Peter was first, he was not an official first or a permanent first.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Catholic Church claims that Peter s name always stands first in the New Testament, but Galatians 2:9 mentions James and Cephas Peter and John.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, at least one verse in the New Testament ranks Peter second.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Galatians Peter was no longer first.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Peter became second, and James became first.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, Acts 21:17-18 says, When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And on the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Paul went to Jerusalem, he did not go to Peter but to James.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although Peter was one of the elders in Jerusalem 1 Pet 5:1 , James was the only elder named in Acts 21:18, and Peter was included in all the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that at that time the leading one was not Peter but James.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Acts 15 there was a conference among the elders and the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verses 6 and 7 say, The apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And when much discussion had taken place, Peter rose up and said to them...</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then verse 12 says, All the multitude became silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, Peter gave a word, and then Barnabas and Paul gave a word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 13 continues, When they finished speaking, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 19 James said, Therefore I judge that we do not harass those from the Gentiles who are turning to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From these verses we can see that the final word at the end of the conference was given not by Peter but by James.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In human terms, James presided over that conference and gave the concluding word because at that time he was taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may wonder why Peter was no longer in the lead in Acts 15.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the day of Pentecost, Peter was like a lion 2:14 , but in Galatians 2 he was like a chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For the Jews to eat with the Gentiles was a violation of their Mosaic Law, yet Peter was bold to eat with the Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, when some came down from Jerusalem, Peter shrank back and separated himself from the Gentile believers v. 12 . Peter s actions were contrary to the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The truth of the gospel in the New Testament is that the middle wall of partition has been broken down by the cross of Christ; consequently, there is no separation between the Jews and the Gentiles Eph 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul said in Galatians 2:11 and 14, When Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned...When I saw that they were not walking in a straightforward way in relation to the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like the Jews?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From this we can see that although Peter was bold and strong on the day of Pentecost, he later became weak.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Peter lost his spiritual capacity, James rose up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This reveals that the leadership among God s people in the New Testament age is not official, permanent, or organizational; rather, it depends on the present spiritual capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When Peter s spiritual capacity was high, he took the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When his spiritual capacity became low, he lost the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Catholic Church, however, the leadership is official, permanent, and organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When a pope dies, another pope is elected.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The office of the pope is official, permanent, and organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In contrast, on the day of Pentecost Peter s leadership was not official, permanent, or organizational but was dependent on his spiritual capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God does not desire to have permanent leaders in the New Testament age, for such leaders are an insult to the headship of Christ.</S>
