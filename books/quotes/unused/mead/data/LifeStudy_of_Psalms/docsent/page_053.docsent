   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 7a says, "I will bless Jehovah, who counsels Me."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do you like to have someone as your counselor?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To take others' counsel implies humility.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A person is humble who wants to receive counsel from others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus blessed Jehovah, the One who counseled Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Isaiah 50:4 tells us the attitude of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah: "The Lord Jehovah has given me/The tongue of the instructed,/That I should know how to sustain the weary with a word./He awakens me morning by morning;/He awakens my ear/To hear as an instructed one."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ, in His human living, had the tongue of an instructed One, and He heard as an instructed One.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He took God the Father as His counselor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Psalm 16:7b says, "Indeed in the nights My inward parts instruct Me."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This shows us that when God counseled Christ as a man, Christ's inward parts instructed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The inward parts of Christ were one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God counsels, and the inward parts instruct.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is our proper experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, it is God who counsels us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the other hand, it is our inward parts which instruct us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our inward parts instruct us mostly in the nights while we are quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the night, from four to six in the morning, I receive many things and many instructions from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Most of the light I have written down in the outlines for these messages has come during these hours.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is an experience of our inward parts instructing us in the nights.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 8a says, "I have set Jehovah before Me continually."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to David's natural concept, he might have said, "I have set the law before me continually."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may want to say, "I have set the Bible before me continually."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But even this is not as good as saying, "I have set Jehovah, the person, before me continually."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 8b says, "Because He is at My right hand, I shall not be shaken."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because the Father was at Christ's right hand, He would not be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our security is not to keep the law, but to have Jehovah, the person, at our right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We shall not be shaken because we have Him as our security.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 9 says, "Therefore My heart rejoices and My glory exults;/Even My flesh dwells securely."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Glory here refers to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This verse covers our soul, which is included in our heart; our spirit, which is the glory; and our body, which is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is in this verse transpired in the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When He was in Hades He said, "My heart rejoices, My spirit exults, and even My body dwells securely."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His body dwelt in a secured tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 10 says, "For You will not abandon My soul to Sheol,/Nor let Your Holy One see the pit."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ was not bothered to be in Hades, in Sheol.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hades is from the Greek, and Sheol is from the Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They both refer to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Septuagint translates pit as corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that Christ's body would not see corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It would not be decayed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is because within three days, His body was resurrected from the tomb, and His soul was raised up from Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 11 says, "You will make known to Me the path of life."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The path of life is the way of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God the Father made known to Christ the way of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 11 continues, "In Your presence is fullness of joy."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was in Christ's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In God's presence in the heavens is fullness of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Finally, verse 11 says, "In Your right hand there are pleasures forever."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In God's right hand in ascension, Christ is enjoying pleasures forever.</S>
