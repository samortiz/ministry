   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN A FEW THINGS TO PAY ATTENTION TO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN OUR SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Serving as a minister of the word is an altogether new thing to us; we have never done such a thing before in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are like newborn babes who have never learned to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have lived on this earth for many years and have been speaking for all these years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet we have never known this kind of speaking before.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to speak this way, we have to start from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In learning to be a minister of the word, we should forget about our previous speaking and preaching experience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This kind of thought is a distraction.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The ministry of the word is very new to us; it is different from any of our former training, understanding, and practices.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No one can be careless in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot depend on past experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot consider the ministry of the word to be the same as our ordinary speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As far as being a minister of the word is concerned, we are babies; we have to learn everything from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A baby has to learn every sound of the alphabet when he learns to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today we are like babies; we have to learn everything from its very foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The flesh has characteristics in its speaking, and the spirit also has characteristics in its speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot rely on any past experiences of speaking and preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we try to bring in these elements, we will change the nature of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to be like a baby, learning everything afresh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many terms and expressions have to be picked up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many thoughts have to be acquired afresh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even the way we behave ourselves has to be taught and learned in a fresh way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No one should bring in anything old.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But neither is it a matter of introducing something novel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a matter of fact, this kind of speaking is so new and unfamiliar to us that everything related to it has to be acquired afresh, bit by bit and piece by piece.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When God gives us a word, we can say that it is a hard task to release it on the one hand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But we also can say that it is a very easy task to release it on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is like prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In one sense this is the easiest thing to do, because a new believer can pray the first day of his Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In another sense one can spend his whole lifetime learning how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The same is true of learning to be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the one hand, it is a difficult skill to acquire.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the other hand, while one is learning to be a minister, God will show him that the whole endeavor is not that hard after all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us now consider a few things we should pay attention to in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>GUARDING THE SPIRIT FROM ANY INJURY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In speaking as a minister of the word, we have to take care that our spirit is not hurt or injured.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not speak for the sake of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our speaking must be accompanied by the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is a total failure on the part of the ministry of the word to release the word without releasing the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is absolutely impossible for anyone to try to release his spirit without the word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One must have the spirit and the word at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The word is released because the spirit is released in the process.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is the spirit that touches men and moves men.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is also the spirit that opens men's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At times the spirit is so prevailing that it even subdues men.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The release of the word is actually a release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If our spirit cannot be released, it is useless for the word to be released by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If there is any hindrance in us, we will have just the word without the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes, even though we do not know what is wrong with us, our spirit is injured.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our spirit is extremely delicate; as such, it is very easily injured.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The feeling of the spirit is very sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is so delicate that it goes beyond our normal sensitivity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may not feel something, yet the spirit has felt it already.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once the spirit is injured, we are left with a word that is void of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In speaking we have to be very careful not to injure the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Several things can cause injury to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let us consider them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First, we may be touched by some sin or defilement before we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we speak, the spirit does not follow because it is injured.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is difficult to say what kinds of sins or defilements will injure our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We can only say that with many sins and defilements, a slight touch, contact, or contamination, can injure our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We do not have to actually commit these sins.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As soon as we open our mouth, we know that we cannot go on.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Before a minister of the word opens his mouth, he has to pray for forgiveness and cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He should confess all of his known sins and defilements before God, and he should seek cleansing and forgiveness for them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He should seek cleansing and forgiveness for the sins and defilements that he is not aware of as well.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He has to exercise diligence to avoid these things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He should guard himself and exercise care to turn away from these things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The spirit's feeling is more sensitive than a person's other feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A man may not realize that he is contaminated by certain sins and defilements for three to five days.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Yet his spirit has detected some warnings already.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He may have the right words and the right thoughts; every inward and outward factor may be in place.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Yet, despite his efforts to push out his spirit, his spirit seems to remain inert.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He does not seem to be able to get his spirit moving.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He has a difficult time trying to locate his spirit as he is trying to push it out.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>These signs indicate that the spirit has been defiled by sin and is debilitated.</S>
