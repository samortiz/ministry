   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Clothed in Sackcloth</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 3 says, And I will give authority to My two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth v. 3 . Sackcloth is a symbol of mourning 2 Sam 3:31 . These two witnesses will wear funeral clothes as a warning to people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They will not preach the gospel of gladness, but will warn people to stay away from God s judgment and from the worship of Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Burning and Killing Their Enemies</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 5 says, And if anyone desires to injure them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And if anyone desires to injure them, thus must he be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Unlike them, we do not have this power, and in our preaching we do not kill people or burn them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But these two witnesses will be able to say, If you attempt to injure us, you will be burned and killed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Having Authority to Shut Heaven,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>to Turn the Waters into Blood,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>and to Smite the Earth with Every Plague</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 6 says, These have the authority to shut heaven that no rain may fall during the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they desire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To shut heaven that no rain may fall resembles what Elijah did 1 Kings 17:1; Luke 4:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To turn the waters into blood and to smite the earth with plagues resembles what Moses did Exo 7:17, 19; Exo 9:14; 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Killed by Antichrist</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In His wisdom, God will allow these two witnesses to be defeated temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 7 says, And when they have completed their testimony, the beast who comes up out of the abyss shall make war with them and shall overcome them and kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The beast here is Antichrist, who will come up out of the abyss 17:8 and out of the sea 13:1 and who will make war with the two witnesses and with the saints 13:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, even the two strongest witnesses will be killed by the persecution under Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time, Antichrist will not only be fighting against man but also against God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He will continue to fight against God until Christ comes with His overcomers to fight against him directly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There will actually be a person on earth who will fight directly against God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ, the embodiment of God, will descend with an army of overcomers to fight against Antichrist, the man of lawlessness 2 Thes 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The last three and a half years will be a war between rebellious mankind under the leadership of the beast, the man of lawlessness, and the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This will force God to come and fight directly, physically, in Christ with all His overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their Corpses Being Left in the Street</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>of Jerusalem for Three and a Half Days</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verses 9 and 10 say, And those of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations see their corpses three and a half days, and they will not allow their corpses to be placed in a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them and make merry; and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their corpses will not be buried but will be left on the street of the great city, where their Lord was crucified, for a show of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The great city refers to the holy city in verse 2, which is the earthly Jerusalem and which will spiritually become Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the restoration of the nation of Israel, which began in 1948, the Jews returned to their father s land in unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They will become as sinful as Sodom cf.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Isa 1:9-10; 3:9; Jer 23:14 and as worldly as Egypt cf.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>23:3, 8, 19, 27 until the return of Christ, their Messiah, when all Israel will be saved Rom 11:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The most worldly people are found in the little nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the end of this age, in the eyes of God, Jerusalem will be as sinful as Sodom and as worldly as Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because of this, God will give up this city for the last three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God will seem to say, Let her go.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I will give her into the hands of Antichrist that he may do whatever he pleases to this sinful and worldly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In A.D. 70 Titus, the prince of Rome, destroyed the city of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Both in Daniel and in the New Testament, that prince was a type of Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Daniel 9:26-27 considers the two as being one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you read Daniel 9 carefully, you will see that there will be two destructions of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first was by Titus and the second will be by Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the prophecy of Daniel, the two are mentioned seemingly as one, but actually they are not one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Antichrist will destroy Jerusalem in a way similar to what Titus did.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to principle, the fulfillment of a type is always more complete than the type.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why the Lord said that the great tribulation will be more severe than anything that has preceded it or that will follow after it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even in Matthew 24 and Luke 21, the Lord s prophecy did not clearly distinguish the destruction of Jerusalem under Titus from that under Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The two are combined.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For this reason, the seventy weeks have a long gap between the sixty-ninth and seventieth weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is a long period of suspension until the time of the seventieth week arrives.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After the sixty-ninth week, there was a destruction under Titus, and after the gap between the sixty-ninth and the seventieth weeks, there will be the destruction under Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But in the Bible these two destructions are mentioned nearly as one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At the time of Titus, Jerusalem was sinful, and at the time of Antichrist, it will be even more sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Revelation chapter eleven does not even call the city Jerusalem but the great city, referring to it as the place where the Lord was crucified v. 8 . The Lord, of course, was crucified neither at Sodom nor at Egypt; He was crucified at Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At the time of the persecution and destruction by Antichrist, Jerusalem will have become as sinful as Sodom and as worldly as Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How we need to pray for the Jews that they might repent.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Among them there will be the faithful ones the one hundred forty-four thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After the rapture of the two witnesses, the time will be close to the Lord s coming with His army to defeat Antichrist in the war at Armageddon.</S>
