   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>10 THE TONE OF VICTORY May we shout victoriously in Your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 20:5 Whom having not seen, you love;</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>into whom though not seeing Him at present, yet believing,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>you exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1 Peter 1:8</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During the past few evenings, we have been considering the way for a Christian to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thank God that many brothers and sisters among us have entered into the experience of the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Last night we saw the way for the overcoming life to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today we will consider another subject, the tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Often a person sings with the right words but the wrong tone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Please remember that the overcoming life also has its tone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not enough for the words to be right; the tone must also be right.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today we will consider the meaning of the tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Psalm 20:5 says, May we shout victoriously in Your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word salvation can be translated as victory see margin of ASV , and the words shout victoriously can be translated as rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is no great difference between salvation and victory; they are merely two aspects of the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thank the Lord that many brothers and sisters have passed through the gate of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But after one passes through this experience, he still needs to have the right tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may not understand what is meant by the right tone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps I can put it another way: Victory has its benchmarks.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How do you know that you have overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When do you know that you have overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You know that you have overcome by Psalm 20:5: Shout victoriously in Your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>VICTORY AND BOASTING IN VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I wonder whether you know the difference between victory and boasting in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is victory, and what is boasting in victory?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Victory is something that Christ has done, and boasting in victory is something that we do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Victory is the work of Christ, while boasting in victory is our work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Victory tells us that the work is done and still prevailing, while boasting in victory is a continuous proclamation after the act of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I used to play cricket.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a strenuous game; the ball is heavy, and one s hands hurt after hitting the ball for awhile.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One competes for an hour, sweating and striving; he hits the ball through one gate, another gate, and finally through the last gate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is victory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When a team wins, the other classmates wave their flags and rejoice and shout.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is boasting in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The team wins the victory, but the other classmates boast in the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thank God that victory is accomplished by Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We did not shed any blood for it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet we can boast in His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Please remember that after a Christian has overcome, he should continue to exercise his mouth to boast in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A day without a hallelujah is a day without boasting in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we see only rivers of tears daily, there is no boasting in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our tone should be one that rejoices in His salvation, one that shouts victoriously in His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When our cricket team won, we brought the victory to our school, and our classmates boasted in this victory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the same way, our Lord has won the victory and brought this victory to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now we can boast continuously in this victory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ is Victor!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All those who cannot say hallelujah may not be defeated, but they certainly do not have the tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A man from Kiangsi may speak the Peking dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The words may be right, but the tone is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who cannot say hallelujah have the wrong tone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to not only overcome but also have the right tone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If our tone is wrong, others will doubt whether we have overcome, and we also will doubt whether we have overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Peter s tone was that of a Galilean, and even a maid could detect it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we lack the Galilean tone, our voice will betray our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every day we need to have the Galilean tone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should be identified as those who have followed Jesus, who have the Galilean tone.</S>
