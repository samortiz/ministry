<h2 class="head2">Being Delivered from Self-love</h2><p>During these years you have accumulated enough knowledge and heard enough messages, but you have not denied yourself enough. You are still very self-centered. Those who are discouraged are all self-centered. The same is true with those who love themselves. In fact, a self-loving person is very easily discouraged. Your thoughts are more active and stubborn than others'. Your thoughts probably have gone beyond the spiritual reality you have attained within. They are not real, but false. When a brother rebukes you, your mind suffers a blow. Then your thoughts, which should fall only to the level of the reality you have attained, fall below this point, and you become discouraged.</p><p>A self-loving person is very easily discouraged. A mark of those who do not love themselves is that they refuse to spend too much time thinking about themselves. A self-loving person devotes much energy thinking about himself and loving himself. There are two reasons a person cries. First, he is smitten by God, and he cries on account of God's dealing and breaking. Second, he feels sorry for himself because he loves and pities himself too much after God's smiting. In the first kind of crying, there can be praises in the midst of weeping; one acknowledges that what the Lord is doing is right. With the second kind, there is only self-love in the crying. One kind of crying is the result of God's breaking. The other kind of crying is the result of self-love. Our brother is very strong in his mind on the one hand, and very indulgent in self-love on the other hand. For years you have not been able to give up your self. You must reach the point where you no longer think about your self. You have to make a resolution to ignore your self and let your self go from now on. If you do this, your problem will go away.</p><h2 class="head2">Accepting the Dealing of the Cross</h2><p>In your speaking, your spirit was coarse. The feelings of your spirit also were very coarse. If a man has not been smitten and ground by God, his spirit is surely coarse. The degree of fineness of a man's spirit is determined by the amount of breaking and grinding he has received from God.</p><p>It is not right for our brother to be discouraged. The cross never discourages a man. The cross always leads to resurrection. Since the time of creation, there has been nothing more positive than resurrection. The cross is very positive because it removes all the undesirable elements in man. God's dealings only cause us to be discouraged about ourselves; they do not cause us to be discouraged about God. It is right for us to be discouraged about ourselves, but we have to be positive towards God.</p><p>There are two results to God's dealings through the environment. First, we become defeated, useless, and knocked out on the ground. Second, we experience resurrection. God's smiting is not merely to ruin and destroy a man, but it is also to cause him to rise up once the smiting work is finished. The smiting of the cross ushers us into the realm of resurrection. Some cannot rise up again after they pass through the cross. This means that they are sick and sunken in self-love. The cross is not the last thing that happens to a man. It is a necessary pathway to resurrection. The smiting of the cross may be severe, but it enables a person to rise up. The work of the cross destroys a man completely, even to the point of death. At the same time, however, on the other side of the grave, there arises the hope with God; one feels he can rise and have faith again through Him. Discouragement is not breaking; it is self-love. It is wrong for you to be discouraged for so long. You should say to God, "I am hopeless in myself. I am a hopeless man, but with You there is hope. You are the God of all hope."</p><h2 class="head2">Ignoring Confusing Thoughts</h2><p>You have to learn to continually turn your thoughts away from introspection. Do not look inward or analyze yourself. Introspection and self-analysis will never help us obtain deliverance. Sometimes we wonder how we can understand the things of God without using our mind. But many thoughts will not solve our problems. They are all lies. The best course for you to take is to not turn your mind inward at all. If you are wrong, you have to ask the Lord for His shining and judgment to tell you what is right and what is wrong. Do not try to replace God's light with your own thoughts. If God does not enlighten you, forget about whether or not your inward condition is good or bad. Just take care of God's light, and ignore your own thoughts. You should pray, "Lord, give me light and let me see. I will not replace Your shining with my own thoughts." No one can know whether or not he is right in himself by exercising his own thoughts. Only light will show us where we are. There is no need to set our mind upon ourselves. Simply drop the thoughts. What happens after they are dropped is none of our business. If we try to make it our business, we will come under the enemy's attack. Every self-loving person is under the enemy's attack. The best course of action is to ignore confusing thoughts. We should simply hand ourselves over to the Lord and fling everything into His hand. If we do this, the enemy will not be able to attack us.</p><p>Forget about your own confusing thoughts. Do not pay any attention to them. As long as you do not consider yourself so lovable, you will not be discouraged. You should not cherish any love for yourself. Revelation 12:11 says that the brothers overcome Satan by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life unto death. Only those who do not love their own soul-life will overcome Satan. You have to look to the Lord absolutely and be freed from your own thoughts. You have to believe that you are crucified with the Lord and are resurrected with Him. If you can ignore the confusing thoughts, you will run a straight course, and your spirit will become tender and fine. Forget about all your problems and resolutely cast your self aside. If you do this, you will find a straight pathway in front of you.</p>
