THE MEANING OF LIFE</h1>
<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Fifty-three</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE SUPERIORITY OF MAN</h2>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Gen. 1:26-27</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Man as the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; of all creation<br />
<span class="normal">The Chinese say that man is the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; of the whole creation. Man is superior to all the rest of creation.</span></li>
<li>The body of man<br />
<span class="normal">The body of man is superior to that of any other creature. The human body is the most beautiful, the most dexterous, and the most useful. It is stronger than that of any other creature.</span></li>
<li>The spirit of man<br />
<span class="normal">The spirit of man is unique. No other creature has a spirit. Because of this spirit, man can worship and receive wisdom. This wisdom makes him superior and noble.</span></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s life the highest<br />
<span class="normal">Therefore man&rsquo;s life is the highest of all created life.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Fifty-four</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE MEANING OF MAN</h2>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Gen. 1:26; Rom. 9:21-23</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Since man is so superior, there must be a meaning for man&rsquo;s existence</li>
<li>What is the meaning of man?<br />
<span class="normal">Is it to study? to work? to eat? to clothe himself? to marry? to raise a family? to serve others? Is man merely for these things? No one can give an answer to this question.</span></li>
<li>Man as God&rsquo;s vessel<br />
<span class="normal">The Bible tells us that not only is man created by God, but that he is also created for God. Man has been created to be a vessel to express the image of God. Hence, the real meaning of man is God. The meaning of man is to be for God. If man does not have God, he will be meaningless.</span></li>
<li>Today everyone who feels that life is meaningless feels so because he is not giving himself for God&rsquo;s purpose with man</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Fifty-five</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF MAN</h2>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: John 4:13; 7:37</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Man&rsquo;s body<br />
<span class="normal">Man&rsquo;s body needs four basic things: food, clothing, shelter, and transportation.</span></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s soul<br />
<span class="normal">Man&rsquo;s soul has psychological needs. These are related to his mind, emotion, and will. He seeks to meet these needs through such pleasures as education, music, sports, and cultural or social activities.</span></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s spirit<br />
<span class="normal">The spirit of man also has its need. The need of the spirit is the deepest and the most real need of man. This need is the need for God Himself. The reason God made a spirit in man is so that man may have need of Him and be able to receive Him. In the same way that God made man&rsquo;s stomach for digesting food, He made the spirit of man for receiving Himself.</span></li>
