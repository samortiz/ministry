   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 29 Date:August 2, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER C. C.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was a wonderful environment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I was not contaminated too much by the world or sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the age of about seventeen I accepted the Lord and was baptized in a China Inland Mission Church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later I was sent to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once I read The Christian published by Brother Nee, and I was moved to leave the C.I.M. Those in the denomination thought that we were creating a division.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1935 Brother Nee spoke clearly in Chuanchow, Fukien, about consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although I had consecrated my will to the Lord, there was not much reality to my consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I admit that I do not have the eloquence, knowledge, or light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I can only speak a little.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I know that if I can edify others a little today, it is altogether the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past I thought that I was not bad.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today I feel that I no longer can stand up among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I became sick with tuberculosis through overextending myself in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The sickness comes and goes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, I reaped much profit from the Lord through my sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have to exult Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have vomited blood during my stay here, but I am somewhat different now.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you send me home, I will die.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If I stay here, I have the confidence that I will not die.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord wants to break me, and the blessings I experience will multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although I am over fifty years old, I am still like a child.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have been working for the Lord for twenty-eight years, but I still feel empty.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I want to commit myself completely to the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May the Lord be merciful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope that our brother will take more rest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a person reaches middle-age, he has to exercise more care.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You are working in the region around Wenchow, Chekiang, which is the area with the greatest concentration of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You should remain there and work there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If one wants to have thicker and firmer ice, he should not break it when it is still thin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the church the knowledge of God's will is something committed to those who are more elderly; the older ones hold the reins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The younger co-workers can take care of the preaching, the gospel work, and the business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The older ones also have to take some responsibilities in initiating the new moves, but they should not be burdened too much by the many affairs of the church; the young ones should be allowed to join in and to coordinate in the service.</S>
