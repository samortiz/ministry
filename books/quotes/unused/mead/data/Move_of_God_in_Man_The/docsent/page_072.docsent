   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In His mercy He is operating within us to cause us to love Him so that He can grow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If it were not for His mercy, we would not be here.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are here loving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whether we fail or succeed, He still grows in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we lose our temper, His operation causes us to have a full repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may pray, "Lord, forgive me for losing my temper."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a sign of His operation in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many times our growth in our failure is more than in our success.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can consider David as an example of this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>David committed a terrible sin with Bathsheba, but was he more spiritual after that sin or before it?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Surely he became more spiritual after his sin, his repentance, and his receiving of God's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This does not mean that we should try to commit sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we need to realize that the Lord's mercy sustains us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At times God may put His mercy aside to try us, to test us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Regardless of how we are, when God would do this, we cannot help but fail.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Peter was so strong to tell the Lord that even if all the others would be stumbled, he would never be stumbled Matt 26:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He said that he was ready to go with the Lord both to prison and to death Luke 22:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then the Lord said to him, "Peter, a rooster will not crow today until you deny three times that you know Me" v. 34 . The Lord had to put His mercy aside for a time so that Peter's natural strength and self-confidence could be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After Peter's failure, he surely became more spiritual than before.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This illustrates how God today is moving in us to do a work for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His building is to be consummated through the church in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He operates in us in our thinking, our willing, and our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>While He is operating in us, He is growing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we grow in His growth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the work of God's new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God works on us as the old creation to produce the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The building up of the New Jerusalem as the outcome of God's new creation is not a sudden thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is altogether a progressive thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This progression started from Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, God worked on Adam as the first piece of material for His New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then God worked on another piece of the old creation, Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, Abel came out to be a part of God's new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God works throughout all the successive generations to gain the New Jerusalem as the final product of His new creation work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today as we grow in Him and He grows in our growth, He is arriving at His goal to consummate His new creation work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This work is going on, and this work will have a consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why the title of this message is "The Move of God in Man in the Consummation of the New Jerusalem."</S>
