<h1 class="title">THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK IN THE HOMES<br />
AND IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 2:46; 5:42; 20:20; 1 Cor. 16:19; Acts 12:12; 1 Cor. 14:12; 1:2</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The scriptural basis for the small groups and the home meetings is the expression <em>from house to house</em> in Acts 2:46 and 5:42; on the day of Pentecost, as soon as the church was raised up on the earth, it began to meet from house to house&mdash;2:41, 46; 5:42; 20:20; 1 Cor. 16:19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To gain the increase, we need to have the home meetings; we need to have meetings in the new believers&rsquo; homes, in the homes of the ones we gain through our preaching of the gospel.</li>
	<li>To bring the meetings to the homes is the very heart of the God-ordained way; it is a great failure in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery if we cannot bring the meetings to the homes.</li>
	<li>To meet in the homes is organic; if we only have a meeting hall with a definite, regular schedule, this will bring the entire church into the &ldquo;box&rdquo; of organization and causes us to lose the organic ability&mdash;Rom. 16:5; 1 Cor. 16:19; Col. 4:15; Philem. 2.</li>
	<li>Meeting in the believers&rsquo; homes is for all the members of Christ to function; in any big meeting it is hard for the saints to function, but in a small meeting with four or five, or two or three, even a small boy or girl could function&mdash;Acts 2:21, 46; 5:42; 12:12; Matt. 18:20.</li>
	<li>We have to realize that the way the Lord is taking is to build up His church in the believers&rsquo; homes; once the church is built up in the homes, the homes will be transformed&mdash;1 Cor. 16:19; 14:12; 1:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The children will be preserved from drifting along the current of the age; in the end, the family will become proper and normal.</li>
		<li>We can invite our relatives to the home meetings, and they will see the situation in our homes and will be touched to receive the Lord&rsquo;s salvation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In a family the focus is not on teaching the children but is on raising them by cherishing, nourishing, and fostering them so that they may grow&mdash;1 Thes. 2:7; Col. 1:5-6; Eph. 4:15; cf. 2 Pet. 3:18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Their growth is not mainly in knowledge: it is primarily a growth in life; as children grow in life, they spontaneously receive more education&mdash;Col. 1:9; Eph. 4:13.</li>
	<li>Concerning this matter, we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must have a change in our concept; do not think that in the recovery we regard work higher than life; no, we need to concentrate on life&mdash;John 17:3; 1 John 5:20.</li>
	<li>To nurture children means to bring them up, to raise them, by nourishing them; raising children requires that the parents give them the needed instruction related to human life, family life, and social life&mdash;Eph. 6:1-3; 1 Tim. 5:4.</li>
	<li>For proper human living in your home, you must teach your children to behave properly; do not say that ethical teachings are apart from Christ and therefore worthless&mdash;v. 4; Col. 1:28.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to open up our home; we do not need to meet with others first; we can initiate our home meeting by meeting with our family members&mdash;Acts 5:42; 2:46; 12:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To set up a meeting will stir up our heart and will fan the flame in our heart and in our spirit; first of all, we will be burned, and then our family will be burned; to set up a home meeting will keep out many evil things from our homes&mdash;2 Tim. 1:6a; Psa. 84:11.</li>
	<li>The meetings in the believers&rsquo; homes can be a fruitful testimony to the neighbors around, and they provide an opportunity for witness and gospel preaching&mdash;John 19:35; 3 John 12; Acts 5:42:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Many who are not willing to go to a &ldquo;church&rdquo; will be glad to go to a private house&mdash;v. 42.</li>
		<li>The influence is most helpful for the families of the Christians; from early days the children will be surrounded by a spiritual atmosphere, and will have constant opportunity to see the reality of eternal things&mdash;John 14:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In our neighborhood there must be a children&rsquo;s meeting that should not be considered as the children&rsquo;s meeting of the church; this is a children&rsquo;s meeting work in the saints&rsquo; neighborhood:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Through the children many homes will be opened for the church to evangelize; this is the community work; these are the warm doors, and the parents will welcome us&mdash;Rom. 16:10-11; 1 Cor. 16:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Although people today are occupied by many things and it seems as if they are not open to the gospel, the best way to overcome this is to have a children&rsquo;s meeting in our own home.</li>
		<li>Many times parents are saved through their children, so do not overlook the children&rsquo;s work.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Every household should preach the gospel; it is very meaningful when the whole family rises up and preaches the gospel.</li>
	<li>After the children get home from school, the elderly saints may open their home and prepare some snacks to welcome them; then they can sing with the children, tell them stories, and lead them to know God&mdash;2 Kings 4:42-44.</li>
	<li>Gaining people in this way is very safe, because they are taught by us and receive the gospel from us from their youth; thus, they should be very solid&mdash;1 Tim. 4:12; Luke 18:21.</li>
	</ol></li>
