   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAUL IN 2 CORINTHIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we read 2 Corinthians carefully before God, we seem to meet two persons Paul in himself and Paul in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everything Paul speaks of, from chapter one to chapter thirteen, is all according to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we summarized Paul's message in this book, we could cover everything with his words in chapter four, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter one we see this treasure being put into the earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From 3:1 through the end of the book, we see the earthen vessel on the one hand and the treasure on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After reading these words before God, we spontaneously will see under His enlightenment that the earthen vessel does not hinder the treasure from shining.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The earthen vessel does not bury the power of the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here we see a person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have mentioned before that 2 Corinthians is the most personal book in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many Epistles are filled with doctrine, truth, and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many Epistles move from God's point of view to our point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second Corinthians, however, is the only book in the New Testament which shows us the very kind of person whom God used to pass on His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we did not have the book of 2 Corinthians, we would never know Paul himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We would know what he accomplished, but we would never know this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second Corinthians shows us his ministry, and from his ministry, we meet the man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We see that he was an earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE IDEAL CHRISTIAN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I first became a Christian, I had my own concept of the ideal Christian, and I tried my utmost to be that kind of Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I thought that if only I could attain to the ideal I had conceived, then I would attain perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I wanted to be perfect, but I had my own ideal and standard for being a perfect Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I thought that if I could reach this standard, I would be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I thought a perfect Christian should smile from morning to night.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If he shed tears, I thought he was not victorious, but a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I would even say he was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I thought a perfect Christian should be bold, unafraid, and courageous in every situation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If he was fearful in anything, I would say he did not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I would say he was not perfect because he did not trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I also thought the perfect Christian was never sad.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a person was sad, I doubted that he was perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I could mention many other criteria, but I do not need to mention too many of these concepts to you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe that many of the younger brothers and sisters have ideals of what a Christian is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am not criticizing because I used to think the same way myself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>PAUL WAS A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One day I read the passage in 2 Corinthians where Paul was sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I asked, "Was Paul sorrowful?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I read that he shed many tears.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I asked, "Did Paul cry?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I read that Paul suffered and was sad.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I asked, "Did Paul suffer, and was he sad?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I read that he was burdened and despaired even of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I asked, "Did Paul despair?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As I continued reading, I saw that there were many things of which I had never thought.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I had never considered that a person like Paul would have these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I began to realize that Christians are not another type of angel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God has not put a race of angels on the earth and said, "These are Christians."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I also began to see that Paul was very close to us; he was not so far off.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul was someone I know; he was not a stranger.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I know him because I saw that he was a man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE TREASURE MANIFESTED</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>IN EARTHEN VESSELS</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many people have a concept of an ideal Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Please remember that this ideal was created by us, not by God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That kind of ideal Christian does not exist, nor does God want us to be such.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Here we meet an earthen vessel, but the special characteristic of this earthen vessel is that a treasure has been put into it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The treasure transcends and overshadows the earthen vessel and manifests itself from within the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the meaning of Christianity and of being a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Paul, we see a man who was afraid yet strong.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He was troubled in his heart yet had hope.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was surrounded by enemies yet was not captured.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although he met with persecution, he did not feel rejected or cast aside.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He seemingly was knocked down, but he did not die 2 Cor 4:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We see his weaknesses, but when he was weak, he was powerful 12:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We see him bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, but the life of Jesus was manifested in his body 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We see him being slandered, but he had a good name.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He seemingly led others astray, but he was honest.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He seemingly was not famous, but everyone knew him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He seemingly was about to die, but he lived.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He seemingly was punished, but not unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He seemingly was sad, but he always rejoiced.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He seemingly was poor, but he made many rich.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He seemingly had nothing, but he had everything 6:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is a real Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is true Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A Christian is a person in whom there is a basic, but harmonious, paradox.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Christianity means having a life in which there is an incomprehensible, spiritual paradox.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God gives us this paradox.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Some people think there is only a treasure but not an earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Others think that the earthen vessel prevents them from going on.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Human thought is always so extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We think it would be ideal just having the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We think that the earthen vessel prevents us from going on.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Before God, however, we see a treasure placed in earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The earthen vessel is not destroyed, and it does not frustrate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The treasure is in the earthen vessel.</S>
