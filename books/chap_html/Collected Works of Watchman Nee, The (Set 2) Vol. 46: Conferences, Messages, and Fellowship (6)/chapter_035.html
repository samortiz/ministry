<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">FOUR KINDS OF DISCIPLINE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 18:15-20; Titus 1:13; 2:15; 1 Cor. 5:2-8; 2 Tim. 3:1-5, 16; John 15:1-2; Rom. 16:17; Gal. 6:1; Heb. 3:6; 2 Thes. 3:6</h1><p>Second Timothy 3:16 says, "All Scripture is God-breathed." The object of Scripture is fourfold: "for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness." In reading these words we cannot help but notice that the purposes for which the Scripture has been given are chiefly negative. The negative element outweighs the positive. This indicates the corruption of the human heart. The tendency in man is always to go astray, so there is the constant need of correction to bring him back to the way of righteousness. Man does wrong continually, so he has to be dealt with continually. Sometimes God deals with His children through circumstances, sometimes through His Word, and sometimes through His other children. Today we shall consider four different ways of discipline: (1) discipline by the brothers; (2) discipline by the fathers; (3) discipline by the Son; and (4) individual discipline.</p><p>In contemplating the matter of discipline, a thought immediately presents itself: How totally out of place it is for one sinner to discipline another. The more we realize our failures and weaknesses, the more we are convinced that we are altogether unsuited for this task. Yet we have to admit that God has committed this very thing to man, which by nature, he is so unqualified for. Before looking further into this subject, let this fact be clearly established: We are weak, utterly weak, and in ourselves we do not have the status to discipline our brothers. If we have any part or lot in this ministry of correction, we can never exercise it on the ground of our superiority over those we seek to deal with. All have sinned. The only difference between them and us is that our sin has been dealt with by the grace of God, while theirs has not. We deal with them in the hope that grace may be shown to them as it has been shown to us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DISCIPLINE BY THE BROTHERS</h2><p>Matthew 18:15 shows that the first mode of discipline is that of a brother dealing with a brother. We should note that the one who is exercising the discipline is the offended party. This is not a case of one brother wronging another brother, and a third party taking up the case. No, if your brother offends you, you are the one who is appointed to deal with him. But the vital question is: How are you going to do it? On what ground are you going to discipline him? You can only discipline him on the ground of brotherhood. Your attitude toward him should be one of a brother dealing with a brother. If a brother offends me, there are two ways of dealing with the situation that are according to convenience: I can either lose my temper and vent my wrath on him, or I can forgive him and forget the whole affair. Getting angry with him is a very simple matter, and forgiving him is also a very simple matter. However, both of these ways are far too cheap and easy, and neither of them is the God-appointed way. If I simply flare up at my brother, I am treating him as an enemy. If I simply gloss the matter over, I am treating him as a stranger. In neither case am I treating him as a brother. In the first case I am putting myself in a distant relationship to him; in the second case I am putting myself in a superior position to him, that is, I am making myself magnanimous by pardoning him. He is not helped any more in this way than in the previous way, because the trouble is not disposed of; it is only covered over. When he sees me he will remember that he wronged me, and when I see him I will remember that I have forgiven him. We naturally think that passing over an offense committed against us is a sign of strength; as a matter of fact, it is a sign of weakness. It is a weakness to treat such a matter as though it did not exist; it is a strength to face it squarely and deal with it fully.</p><p>How then should such a matter be dealt with? We should treat it exactly as we would had the offense been committed against another and not against ourselves, that is, we should deal with this case as though we were a third party. We should take our brother aside and seek to point out his fault. Nevertheless, our attitude should not be that of the offended party bringing a charge against the offending party, but of brother dealing with brother for the specific purpose of gaining him. "You have gained your brother" (Matt. 18:15) is the goal before us in all discipline. If our brother responds, then we have gained him; if he fails to respond, then we should take two or three other brothers with us and seek him out again. Remember, in taking two or three witnesses, our attitude should still be the same as it was the first time, that of seeking to win our brother, not of seeking to win a case. If on this second occasion he is still unresponsive, then bring the matter before the whole assembly. However, we should still seek to gain him as a brother, not as bringing a charge against him. If he refuses to listen to the church, then we should treat him "just like the Gentile and the tax collector" (Matt. 18:17), because refusing to heed the church is refusing to heed the Lord. This does not imply excommunication; it merely means that the offending brother is ignored. Even at this stage of the brother's discipline, judgment is not an end, but merely a means to the end. The end is the brother's restoration.</p>
