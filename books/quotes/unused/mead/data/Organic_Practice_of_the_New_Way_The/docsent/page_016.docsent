   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR A BELIEVER S LIFE OF MORNING REVIVAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND DAILY RENEWAL Scripture Reading: Prov 4:18; Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>5:31; Lam 3:22-23; Psa 119:147-148; 2 Cor 4:16; Titus 3:5-6</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all know that in God s creation and arrangement everything has its law and principles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The center of all things is life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If our universe today has only the heavens and the earth, but does not have plant life, animal life, or human life, then the universe is void and desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although mankind s living together invariably brings in friction and arguments, where life is, there is joy, and there is pleasantness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The greatest characteristic of life is metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The flowers bloom during the flowering season, and the fruit trees bear fruit during the fruit season.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The plant life behaves differently according to the four seasons of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Likewise, the animal life has different characteristics for the four seasons of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In winter, many animals enter into hibernation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But when spring comes, they begin to propagate again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The human life is much higher than the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is even much higher than the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, according to God s law of metabolism in creation, man s life cannot be monotonous, having no change whatsoever from day to day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE FIRST STEP IN THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can discover one law from man s physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The human body needs a revival every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After we rise up in the morning, our whole body needs a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to wash our faces.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After that, all our sluggish feeling is washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After we wash our face and our mouth, and cleanse our lungs through deep breathing, our whole being is renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This proves that every morning the human body needs a renewal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The morning hour flies by quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One hour is over in no time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is why the Word of the Lord says, Redeeming the time Eph 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The period of time that needs to be redeemed the most is six to seven o clock in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During this hour, every minute is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to redeem this time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are really busy, I would rather see you sacrifice part of your time of physical exercise and use it for spiritual benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Paul wrote the Epistles to Timothy and Titus, he had the thought of the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He said in 1 Timothy 4:7, Exercise yourself unto godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The exercise here is like some kind of gymnastics.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to exercise our spirits and to live out Christ in our daily lives.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul said in 2 Timothy 1:7, God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the parts of our spirit are like the parts of our body; they need exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are many ways to exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some Chinese like the Eight Section Brocade exercise, whereas others like the Tai-chi boxing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Westerners have aerobic exercise, golf, and jogging.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the simplest way to exercise the spirit is to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>During the past twenty years or longer, we have learned to call O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every one among us knows how to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This kind of calling is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But this is not the main body of our prayer; it is only the prelude to our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we call O Lord Jesus, what follows?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot simply call on the Lord without praying.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There must not be a prelude without the main theme.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After we call on the Lord, we have to go on to speak to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can say to the Lord, Lord Jesus, I love You!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I want to live for You!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first step in the exercise of the spirit is to pray, which is to speak to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many people pray with their mentality, in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To speak to the Lord in the mind, to pray in the mind, is to exercise one s mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The prayer that comes from the exercise of the spirit is different from the prayer that comes from the exercise of the mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When you call on the Lord Jesus and say to Him that you would love Him more and would live to Him, this is a prayer that stirs up your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more you speak this way, the higher your spirit becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, you must be careful not to turn back to your mind after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once you turn back to your mind, you should have a warning sign that goes up like the red signal light at the crossroad.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At this time, you must immediately call on the Lord Jesus and turn to the spirit to speak in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hence, to pray is the first step in the exercise of the spirit.</S>
