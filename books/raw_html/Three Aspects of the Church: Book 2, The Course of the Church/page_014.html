	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>The Bible records the spread of the church through Acts 28. The Bible also records many other matters, including the desolation of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR LINES CONCERNING THE CHURCH<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>In the New Testament there are four lines concerning the church. The first line is the meaning of the church or the spiritual aspect of the church. The second line is the course of the church, the third line is the organization of the church, and the fourth line is the desolation of the church. The desolation of the church is part of the course of the church. The word <em>desolation</em> indicates that something has happened to cause a problem. In the course of the church a very serious thing happened&mdash;the church was corrupted. The church had a change resulting in a problem. Therefore, if we want to know the situation of the church, we must know about the desolation of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECORD OF<br />
THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Lying to the Holy Spirit and Quarreling</h2>
<p>According to the record in the New Testament, the desolation of the church began in Acts 5:1-11 when Ananias and Sapphira lied to the Holy Spirit. Then in Acts 6:1-6 some of the saints murmured concerning the dispensing of food. These two portions show the beginning of the problems in the church. However, at this point the church as a whole was not in desolation and failure since these matters involved only a few people and the problems were not very serious.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Divisions</h2>
<p>The first indication of the true desolation of the church is in 1 Corinthians. At that time there were already divisions in the church. Some of the Corinthian believers said that they were of Paul, and others said that they were of Apollos, Cephas, and Christ (1:11-12; 3:3-4). This shows that the Corinthian believers were very fleshly and that there were strifes among them. This was the beginning of the church&rsquo;s desolation and abnormality. Moreover, the Corinthian believers were critical of the apostle Paul, who took the lead and built up the church among them. Second Corinthians 12:16-18 indicates that they even accused Paul of taking advantage of them by guile. The problems in the church in Corinth were much more serious than Ananias and Sapphira lying to the Holy Spirit or the saints murmuring about the daily dispensing of food. Thus, we can say that the record of the actual degradation of the church begins in 1 Corinthians.</p>
<h2 class="head2">False Apostles</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians the problems in the church in Corinth included not only divisions among the saints but also some who pretended to be apostles and criticized, opposed, and condemned the true apostle, Paul. In 2 Corinthians 11:13 Paul says, &ldquo;Such ones are false apostles, deceitful workers, transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ.&rdquo; Paul was forced to boast, saying, &ldquo;I count myself to be inferior to the super-apostles in nothing...Ministers of Christ are they? I speak as being beside myself, I more so!&rdquo; (vv. 5, 23). This shows that the atmosphere in the church at that time was already improper. Paul had to speak unpleasant words of rebuke and condemnation. We see that the church had a problem; therefore, by 2 Corinthians the church had become degraded. The degraded condition was not only among the saints with their divisions; there also were problems in the relationship between the apostles and the saints, and there were false apostles.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Continuation of Desolation</h2>
<p>In principle, the condition of the church today is no different from the condition of the early church. There were problems in the early church, and there are the same problems in the church today. There are inappropriate things in the church today that were also present in the early days. For example, such things as division, criticism and lack of submission to the apostles, and strifes, pretensions, and falsehood among the Lord&rsquo;s servants are still present in the church.</p>
<p>The desolation of the church, which began in the church in Corinth, has continued throughout the past two thousand years. If we consider Taipei, we see that in only one section of the city there are more than ten different chapels for church meetings. This area can be called a &ldquo;chapel district.&rdquo; These chapels represent different sects, and there is no unity among them. This shows that the church has not been able to escape the condition of Corinth. We should apply the Epistles to the church in Corinth to ourselves. All the problems encountered in Corinth persist today. When Paul wrote 1 Corinthians in approximately A.D. 59, only a little more than twenty years after the church was produced on the day of Pentecost, its condition was already abnormal.</p>
