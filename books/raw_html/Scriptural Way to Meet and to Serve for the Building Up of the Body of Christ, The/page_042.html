 <h2 class="head1">THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST REALIZED IN HIS SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The all-inclusive Christ is realized in His Spirit (Rom. 8:9). The Spirit, as the realization of the all-inclusive Christ, consisting of the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8) with the bountiful supply for the believers&rsquo; life and work (Phil. 1:19), indwells the believers&rsquo; spirits (Rom. 8:11, 16). This is the processed Triune God becoming one with His enjoyers. When we experience the all-inclusive Christ as the Spirit and speak Him in the meeting, that meeting is according to God&rsquo;s economy in His fatherhood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT EMBODIED<br />
IN THE LIVING WORD OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Triune God is embodied in Christ, Christ is realized in and as the Spirit, and the Spirit is embodied in the living word of Christ. The processed Triune God, the all-inclusive Christ, and the Spirit are invisible, but the Word is visible and can be pray-read by us. When we pray-read the Word, we are pray-reading the processed Triune God, we are pray-reading Christ, and we are pray-reading the all-inclusive, bountiful, life-giving Spirit. Our God is pray-readable, Christ is pray-readable, and the all-inclusive, bountiful, life-giving Spirit is pray-readable. The Word is composed of the bountiful supply of Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>The living word is also available in our mouth and even in our heart (Rom. 10:6-10). The word talked about in Romans 10 is not the word in letter. This word is living, and it must be the Spirit. Otherwise, how could the word be in our mouth and also in our heart? Sometimes we may not need a Bible to enjoy the living word because we can pray-read some verses we have memorized. This is why it is good to keep some verses in our memory. When we pray-read the printed Word, the word gets in our mouth and in our heart. At that time, the word becomes the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO PARTAKE OF AND ENJOY<br />
THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The way to partake of and enjoy the riches of Christ is to confess with our mouth, &ldquo;Lord Jesus&rdquo; (Rom. 10:9-10), calling upon the name of the Lord (vv. 12-13), and to pray-read His Word. The very Christ today is available in His name and in His Word. We can call on His name in any place, on any occasion, and at any time. His name is so available, and this name simply denotes Himself, His very Person. Moreover, all the content of this Person is condensed and embodied in the written Word. We have a name and a book. We can call on His name at any time, and we can pray-read the Word all the time. When we call on His name, we get Him. When we pray-read His Word, we enjoy Him. We have to practice calling on His name and pray-reading His Word daily at all times. When we pray-read the Word, we are actually pray-reading the processed Triune God with all His unsearchable riches. Hallelujah for the availability of Christ!</p>
