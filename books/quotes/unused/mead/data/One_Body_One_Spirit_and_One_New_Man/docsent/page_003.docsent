   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When was the Lord Jesus glorified?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He entered into glory when He resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The record in Luke 24 tells us that after His resurrection and before His ascension, when He met the two disciples on the road to Emmaus, the Lord told them, "Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory?" v. 26 . This proves that when He resurrected, even though He had not yet ascended, He had already entered into His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What does it mean for the Lord Jesus to be glorified?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Originally, the Lord Jesus was the God of glory, but in His incarnation He put on humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The flesh and the humanity that He had put on did not have a single bit of glory; in this sense, they were like our own flesh and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the God of glory, or we can say the glory of God, was within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then one day, He was crucified and broken on the cross, buried in the grave, and He came out of death; this was the time of the release of the glory within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, His body, which had passed through incarnation, death, and burial, now was fully saturated with His glory to become completely transformed, transfigured, and uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, after His resurrection He bore a transformed, transfigured, and uplifted human body and human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time, the humanity He had put on entered into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified"; this means that at that time His physical body, His humanity, had not yet entered into God's glory, but after He rose from the dead, this man, Jesus the Nazarene, entered into glory, and His body, His humanity, that He had put on, entered into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At this time the Spirit came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ephesians 4:4 says, "One Body and one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This Spirit is "the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Spirit here does not refer merely to the Spirit of God; Spirit refers to "the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I pour plain water on a white handkerchief, it will not leave any stain of color, and the handkerchief will remain white.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If, however, I pour tea on a white handkerchief, it will leave a round yellow mark.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before the Lord Jesus died and resurrected, the Spirit of God was purely the Spirit of God without the element of humanity or the uplifted humanity, without the sweet death of the Lord Jesus, and without the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There was only one element divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the Lord Jesus resurrected, however, the elements of His humanity, His death, and His resurrection all entered into the Spirit of God, and from that time on the Spirit of God became "the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is why the term the Spirit is used throughout the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, because the translators of the Chinese Bible were afraid that people would not understand the meaning of the term the Spirit, they translated it as Holy Spirit even though they noted that the word holy was not in the original.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moreover, they lost the word the in their translation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They thought the word the was unimportant, never realizing that this word is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"The Spirit!"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, one Body and one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we want to see the Spirit, we must consider the holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The holy anointing ointment was made of olive oil typifying the Holy Spirit compounded with four kinds of spices.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These four kinds of spices typify the Lord's humanity, His death, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After these four spices were compounded into the olive oil, the olive oil was no longer only oil; it was an ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This holy anointing ointment typifies the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you consider the Spirit only in the New Testament, you will not see many details, but when you look at the Old Testament type, you can see the details.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One hin of olive oil was compounded with four kinds of spices.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In addition, there are details concerning the measure of the four spices: The first kind and the last kind are of five hundred shekels each, while the middle two are of two hundred fifty shekels each.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Added together they equal a total of three units, each unit of five hundred shekels, indicating three units of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This signifies the Triune God, of whom the Second was broken.</S>
