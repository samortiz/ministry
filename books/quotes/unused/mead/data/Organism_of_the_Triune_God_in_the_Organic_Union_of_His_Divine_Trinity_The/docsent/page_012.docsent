   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Transforming the Sanctified Saints</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit also transforms the sanctified saints 2 Cor 3:18b .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Transformation is a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is an inward change caused by a new element replacing the old.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit works Himself into us to be the new element to replace and discharge all of the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we are transformed into the image of the Lord from one degree of glory to another degree of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This transformation is by the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit s work is to work the elements of what the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He desires to constitute us with these elements, to make these elements our elements for our spiritual and divine constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The entire constitution of our spiritual being is a kind of organic union, and this organic union is of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE ISSUE OF THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The work of the Spirit issues in the baptism of all the believers in the one Spirit into one Body 1 Cor 12:13a .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were separate individuals, but after being baptized in the one Spirit, we became a corporate Body, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The issue of the work of the Spirit is also that all the Spirit-baptized believers are drinking of the same one Spirit 1 Cor 12:13b .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have been put into a position to drink of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To be baptized into the Spirit is to get into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To drink the Spirit is to get the Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have been outwardly baptized in the Spirit, and we are now inwardly drinking the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>SERVING THE LORD IN THE ORGANIC UNION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we need to apply what we have fellowshipped so far.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may love the Lord and love the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may like to serve the Lord in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But most of us love the Lord and serve the Lord in the church life in our natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may think that to serve the Lord in the church life, we need to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we may pray, Lord, help me and grant me to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But after a period of time, we will not be able to tolerate our situation in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A certain saint was trying to serve the Lord in the church life in a humble way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day another saint impolitely charged this one to clean the rest room thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The saint who was trying to be humble got offended.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When another saint charges us to do something, we may think something like this: Who are you to charge me and tell me to clean the rest room?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why wouldn t you do it?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Are you an elder?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are younger than I am.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am forty-five and you are only twenty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a reaction is a sign that our service to the Lord in the church life is by our natural life and not in the organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we serve the Lord in the church life by the organic union, we will always realize that we are terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the organic union, it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the organic union, for me to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we serve the Lord in the church life in such an organic union, we will not be offended by anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let us use another illustration of a brother who loves the Lord and who serves in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here is a brother who is fifty years old and who has a big heart that can embrace many things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was also told in an impolite way to clean the rest room thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At first, he became offended.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But then he thought, I am serving the Lord in the church life, and I should not be angry with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I should not be offended, but I should be patient with the one who told me to clean the rest room.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a result, this brother humbled himself to clean the rest room without complaint.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Was this service in the organic union?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Actually, this kind of service is in the principle of the teaching of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Chinese were taught by Confucius to practice self-humility in this manner.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead of the organic union service in the church life, we may have the Chinese ethics service.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to consider the content of our practical church life throughout the years.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to know the difference between the vinegar of our natural life and the sugar of the divine life in the organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Are we serving the Lord in the church life in the organic union, in our American culture, or according to Chinese ethics?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Anything other than the organic union will be exhausted sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our patience is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only the patience of Christ is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Ephesians 3 Paul prays that we may be able to apprehend the breadth, length, height, and depth with all the saints v. 18 . The breadth, length, height, and depth are the unlimited dimensions of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>His dimensions are unlimited, immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But we are so limited.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our patience, our love, and our humility are limited and will be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the organic union, however, everything is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The church as the Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This organism is not in ourselves but in the organic union of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thank the Lord that in His salvation we can experience this organic union which is wrapped up with the Spirit as the person.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We always have to be filled and saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I mostly pray for two things: the cleansing and covering blood and the anointing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I need the cleansing and the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This means that I need the working of the Spirit in the organic union.</S>
