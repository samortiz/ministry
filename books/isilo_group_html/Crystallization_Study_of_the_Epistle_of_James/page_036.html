Repentance unto Life</H2><P>God has given the sinners repentance unto life (Acts 11:18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Heirs of the Grace of Life</H2><P>All the believers are God's heirs of the grace of life (1 Pet. 3:7b). The grace of life is our inheritance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. God's Divine Power Granting to Us All Things Relating to Life and Godliness</H2><P>God's divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life concerning life within and godliness in our living without (2 Pet. 1:3). Godliness is the living of the divine life. The divine life within us becomes our living, and that is godliness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Reigning in Life</H2><P>God's grace in Christ enables us to reign in life, ruling over all the negative things that are against God and His economy (Rom. 5:17, 21). James spoke merely of being able to resist temptation, but the life presented in the New Testament enables us to reign over sin and Satan. Eventually, we will reign over the nations. We receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness to reign in life. Then grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life. We reign in this age, and grace reigns in the eternal age. We should be vital not merely to overcome but to reign. The vital groups are producing not only overcomers but also kings. As a king, we should go to visit people with the gospel. When we do this, we reign.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Eating of the Tree of Life</H2><P>The Lord promised that the overcomers will eat of the tree of life (Rev. 2:7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. The River of Water of Life</H2><P>The Triune God flows as a river of water of life in which the tree of life grows for the supply to the entire city of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 22:1-2). The Triune God flows out with two provisions: the river of life and the tree of life. One is for drinking, and the other is for eating.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Epistle of James &nbsp; pg 36</div><br></body></html>
