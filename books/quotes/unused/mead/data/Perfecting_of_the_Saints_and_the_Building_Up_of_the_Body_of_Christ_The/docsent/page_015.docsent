   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Every Day Overcoming</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2 Corinthians 4:16 Paul says that our inward man is being renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The reviving is in the morning, and the overcoming is during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are revived in the morning; but we do not stop there.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to carry on its effect, which is to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should be renewed the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such renewing is the overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For a Christian, the first thing to overcome is his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everyone has a peculiar temperament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is difficult for two peculiar persons to be put together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you can overcome your temper for three days, not in the way of swallowing down your grudge and not just in an outward way but in an inward way, then you are an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even a church as good as Philippi needed Paul s exhortation for them not to reason or murmur.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are our common problems.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the ultimate definition of overcoming is to overcome our natural person and our self.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man s temper lies in his natural person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you are a natural person, living in the old creation, being full of self, and considering the self the first and foremost thing in you, you will surely be one that is full of reasonings and murmurings in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why the Bible says that they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts Gal 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every morning we need a revival and a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This new beginning includes the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we contact Him, there is the element of death in the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When He enters into us, He operates within us to perform the killing and the sterilizing function.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is like taking in antibiotics.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The antibiotics kill the germs within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The element of the Lord s death kills the temper within us, terminating our old creation and enabling us to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Romans 7 Paul speaks of the experience of the struggle between the law of sin in the flesh and the law of good in man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is similar to the struggle between reason and lust as promulgated by Chinese Confucianism.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Both show us that only the strong-willed and clear-minded person can overcome and control himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For most people, it is the lust that wins and the reason that fails.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why Paul said that he was hopeless, that the good that he willed he did not do, but the evil that he willed not he did.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was a wretched man, one who was sold to sin Rom 7:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But in Romans 8, he overcame.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He overcame in the law of the Spirit of life v. 2 . There is a law of the Spirit of life, which is a spontaneous power.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this law, he overcame the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For this reason every morning we need a revival, and every morning we need to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This contact has a result, which is to renew us within during the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This renewing is a continuation of the morning revival, allowing the revival to develop its killing effect in us during the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way we will live an overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord promised in Matthew 28:20, I am with you all the days.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since the Lord is with us every day, He lives with us moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For Him to be with us is for Him to live with us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we are renewed every day and have the Lord s presence and His living with us every day to be the source of our supply, we will spontaneously live an overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He not only died for us on the cross but is living for us within.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today we have such a Lord who lives with us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can live an overcoming life daily.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the life that a Christian should live in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Without this kind of living, we are not qualified to talk about the new way, and there is no way for us to have the service in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>SERVICE IN THE NEW WAY Contacting People</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The first item of service in the new way is to contact people, that is, to pay the price to contact people for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First, we must shepherd and feed the Lord s sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord asked Peter three times in John 21:15-17, Do you love Me?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When Peter answered, Lord, I love You, the Lord replied the first time with Feed My lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then the second time He replied, Shepherd My sheep, and the third time He replied, Feed My sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To shepherd is to care for in a general way, like the shepherd caring for the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To feed is special; it is like the mother taking care of her child.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps there is a person that is very young or is involved in difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is the need to take care of him in a special way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we preach the gospel by visiting people and bring people to salvation, they become the Lord s lambs, and there is the need for feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For those saints who have been around longer, who are more mature, there is the need of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then there are those who are involved in special difficulties; they need the special feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the church there is a great need for people to rise up to do the work of shepherding and feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This does not mean that we have to find some clergy-like pastors or preachers to do the job while all the other saints remain in their own jobs, raise their families, come for worship on Sunday, and contribute a little money.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If that is the case, what is recorded in Ephesians 4 where all the saints participate in the work of the ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ will never be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To build up the Body of Christ, all the members have to exercise their functions.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the new way that we are taking.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I hope that, as the Bible shows, every brother and sister would bear some responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At present there are over six thousand people meeting in the district meetings in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But there are over twenty thousand that need to be cared for.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If everyone would care for one person per week, every week we could care for six thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In a month with four weeks, we could care for all twenty thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We would like to present this burden before all of you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Let us take up this burden before the Lord together.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When you go to shepherd and to visit others, there are proper ways to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You should not go just to socialize.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>For this reason, you yourselves must first be experienced in life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Second, you must study the truth well.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is not too difficult among us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Every week we are handling the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As long as we would learn, we can all pick up something.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>With the experience in life and the expression in truth, you are well equipped to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When you go to visit people, you will know where they are immediately after talking to them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Perhaps a certain one has only believed in the Lord in an outward way; within he has not touched the Lord and has no experience of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He is like the electric light bulb that is installed but not connected; there is still no electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You have to be like an electrician, helping him to connect the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You must help him to touch the Lord within and to have the experience of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Then you have to help him to know how to call on the Lord, how to pray-read the Lord s Word, how to have fellowship with the Lord, how to love the Lord, how to remember the Lord by breaking bread, how to consecrate himself, etc. You must help him item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>All these require that you have the experience and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Paul said in Acts 20, How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house....For I did not shrink from declaring to you all the counsel of God....Wherefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears vv.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>20, 27, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Here Paul set up a good example for us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I hope that we all would receive the burden to visit people from house to house, supplying people on the one hand, helping them to grow in life, and teaching people the truth on the other hand to show them according to the Bible what kind of life God wants us to live.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Although a Gentile person may repent, believe, be baptized, and be saved, yet he still knows nothing concerning the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>There is the need for some to teach him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It is not enough for him to come only on Sunday to listen to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is not to mention the fact that sometimes he does not even come at all.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is why we need to care for and to teach people so that they can be brought on step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Paul mentioned in Ephesians 4:12 the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is the most important yet most difficult thing to do during our contacting others.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The word perfecting in Greek carries the meaning of equipping.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is like a man joining the army.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He needs to be perfected by instructions, drills, equippings, as well as supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Now there are over twenty thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>To visit them is not the end. You should hope that one day they can do the work that you are doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If the six thousand go out to visit the twenty thousand, and in half a year, among those twenty thousand there are three to five thousand raised up who can do the same thing that the others are doing, then they are being perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In this way, you can go out to preach the gospel again to gain more new ones, and the cycle can repeat itself over and over.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Today we have six thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Perhaps by next year we will have ten thousand who can go out to care for and to feed others.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This can never be accomplished by a few preachers or pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>For this we need all the brothers and sisters to rise up and to strive together in one accord, to grow in life, and to be taught in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In addition there is the need to labor and to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If everyone would do this, we will surely have good results.</S>
