	 <h2 class="head3">Failing in the Wilderness</h2>
<p>The history of the children of Israel in the wilderness is altogether a history of failures. It took them a total of thirty-eight years to travel from their crossing of the Red Sea to their crossing of the Jordan River. During this period of time, the situation of the children of Israel can be described as a huge failure, and it typifies the condition of failure in the church. All the problems in the church are illustrated by the failures of the Israelites. This picture truly describes the repeated failures of the church.</p>
<p>After reading the history of the failures of the children of Israel, we may become discouraged and disappointed, because out of all those who left Egypt, only two&mdash;Joshua and Caleb&mdash;entered into Canaan. Joshua and Caleb did not fail, but the rest of the Israelites failed. This discouraging situation shows that those who failed were the older ones. The fact that the older Israelites failed in the wilderness bears a twofold significance. On one hand, the older ones typify those who fail in the church, and on the other hand, because they were born in Egypt, they typify the element of the old creation within the church. Once the old Israelites all died, the new Israelites were able to enter into Canaan. This signifies that our old creation must die during the period of wandering so that the new creation can attain God&rsquo;s goal of entering into Canaan.</p>
<p>The stories of failure among the children of Israel in the wilderness indicate that those who failed typify those who fail in the church, and the matters in which the children of Israel failed typify the matters in which the church fails. This type exposes the failures in the church. For example, in one of the seven epistles in Revelation the incident of Balaam is mentioned, indicating that the failures of the Israelites typify the failures of the church (Rev. 2:14). The failure of the older Israelites indicates that only when the nature of the old creation dies can the church achieve God&rsquo;s purpose. The new generation of the children of Israel did not enter Canaan until the old generation, which had come out of Egypt, died. The type of the crossing of the Jordan River clearly reveals that all who entered the land of Canaan passed through the water of the Jordan River. Through this crossing, their old man was buried, and they were resurrected from the dead. They were no longer old but had become new. Only those who are new are able to enter Canaan and reach God&rsquo;s destination.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Crossing the Jordan River</h2>
<p>The main significance of baptism is that the world is buried. In our experience, however, there is a second burial in which our old man is buried in the Jordan River. When the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, they were delivered from Egypt. Their failures in the wilderness, however, were not related to Egypt but to their old man. Hence, in order to cross over the Jordan and enter into the land of Canaan, the nature of their old creation needed to be terminated. In the same way, although the world was buried through baptism, our baptism was only the beginning of our following God. We still need to journey through the wilderness and cross over the Jordan, burying our old man, to enter into Canaan.</p>
<p>The main significance of crossing the Jordan is that the old man died and that the new man was raised up. The Egyptian army was buried in the Red Sea, but the Israelites themselves were buried in the waters of the Jordan River. The children of Israel left twelve stones in the Jordan River, signifying that their old man was buried in the water. Moreover, they took twelve stones from the river and brought them to the other side of the river into the land of Canaan (Josh. 4). This typifies that the new generation of Israel attained God&rsquo;s goal. This signifies that when our old man is buried in the death of Christ, God&rsquo;s purpose can be accomplished by the new man.</p>
<p>This type has two points of significance. First, when the church truly crosses the Jordan, the old creation will pass away, and everything will be of the new creation. This fulfills God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Second, the church, as well as the individual believers, is still in the spiritual process of progressing in life. Once the children of Israel crossed through the Jordan, their life of wandering in the wilderness came to an end. In terms of practical spiritual experience, once the church experiences the termination of the old creation, it begins to live in the new creation. The termination of the old creation occurs in the water of the Jordan River. After crossing the Jordan River, spiritual warfare begins.</p>
<p>What was buried in the Red Sea is entirely different from what was buried in the Jordan River. Whereas the water of the Red Sea buried the Egyptian army, the water of the Jordan River buried the children of Israel. When we were baptized, although we died with the Lord and were buried with Him, according to our experience the world was buried. Thus, we must experience a second burial, that is, the crossing of the Jordan. The crossing of the Jordan signifies that the life of wandering has ended and that our self has been terminated in Christ&rsquo;s death. These two waters typify Christ&rsquo;s death: one dealing with the world in us, and the other dealing with our self. Dealing with the world enables us to begin our journey of following the Lord; however, because the old creation, the flesh, and the self are still present, we wander. The failures of the children of Israel in the wilderness were not related to Egypt but were the result of the flesh and the self. Once the flesh, self, and old creation were dead and buried in the Jordan River, the new man rose up and entered into Canaan as the destination.</p>
