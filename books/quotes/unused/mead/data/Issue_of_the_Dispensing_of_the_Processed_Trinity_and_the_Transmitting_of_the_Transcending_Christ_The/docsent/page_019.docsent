   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ's Heavenly Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Heavens and in Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians say that Christ's ministry was finished at the end of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, the Bible says that Christ's ministry still continues after His death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His earthly ministry was accomplished and recorded in the four Gospels in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After the Gospels and the Acts, the apostle Paul wrote fourteen Epistles, from Romans through Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In these fourteen Epistles Paul opened the heavens, showed us that we are seated in the heavens, and unveiled to us that today Christ in the heavens as the resurrected One and the newborn One, the firstborn Son of God, is very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is busy in His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He accomplished redemption in His earthly ministry, but He applies this redemption to us in His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today Christ is both in the heavens and in our spirit Rom 8:34, 10; 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may use electricity to illustrate how Christ can be in two places at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The same electricity is simultaneously in the power plant and in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not two electricities but one electricity in one transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is the transmission that connects our homes with the power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today Christ is the same as electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the life-giving Spirit, He is there in the heavens and also here in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way He has brought us all into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today the heavens are in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hebrews 10:19 and 22 tell us to come forward to the Holy of Holies and to enter the Holy of Holies, and 4:16 tells us to come forward with boldness to the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After reading such verses, we may wonder where the Holy of Holies and the throne of grace are today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If they were only in the heavens, how could we come forward to them, and how could we enter the Holy of Holies?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today, the Holy of Holies is not only in the heavens; it is also in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why Hebrews 4:12 stresses our spirit to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This verse says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to this verse, we must have the capacity to discern our spirit from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The problem today is that many Christians do not have the capacity to discern their spirit from their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many even say that the spirit and the soul are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today in the Lord's recovery we have a clear sky and a clear vision to see that Christ is in the heavens, and He has brought the heavens into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This corresponds to the ladder that Jacob saw in his dream at Bethel Gen 28:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That ladder stretched from the earth to the heavens, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It brought the earth to the heavens and joined the heavens with the earth, making the heavens and the earth one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In John 1:51 the Lord Jesus told His disciples that they would "see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ today is the ladder in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because of this, when we speak the Lord's word in His ministry today, we speak not only on the earth but also in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We speak in our spirit, where the heaven is on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have much to speak because we are speaking in the heavens, yet we are still on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many Christians today know only Christ's earthly life and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Their knowledge is limited to what is recorded in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They do not like to go further.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A number of years ago one group of Christians declared that they followed only Jesus and they would not follow Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They accepted only the teaching in the four Gospels; they would not accept Paul's fourteen Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today, in name, all Christians accept the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, yet, in actuality, many know only the things of Christ in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They know very little concerning Christ in the fourteen Epistles of Paul.</S>
