   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NO EVIL WORDS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Peter 3:9-12 says, Not rendering evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing one another, because you were called to this, that you might inherit blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For he who desires to love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips to speak no guile.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it; for the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears incline to their petition; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Another kind of words which should never come out of a Christian s mouth is evil words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What are evil words?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Evil words are words of reviling, words of cursing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A child of God cannot render evil for evil or reviling for reviling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. Learning to</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Speak Words of Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many people think that they have the right to speak a certain way because others have spoken the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today the world argues about who said what first, but the Lord is concerned about whether or not one has spoken at all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may ask, Since others have already said this, can I not say it as well?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>, but please bear in mind that we cannot render evil for evil or reviling for reviling.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not a matter of who spoke first, but a matter of whether or not you spoke at all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A new believer must learn to speak words of blessing from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not allow reviling or cursing to come out of your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. Controlling One s Temper</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, a person must control his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He must control his temper before he can control his words before God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A person s words are not controlled if his temper is not controlled.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many evil words come out of a person s mouth because his temper is not controlled.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If God s children are not exercised, reviling and filthy words will come out of their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many people do not know how to control their temper, and their mouths are full of reviling words.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, these words do not glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the other hand, they deprive a person of any blessing from God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>V. BEING RESTRICTED IN WORDS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we come to the fifth point.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to know what we should pay attention to in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>James 3 specifically deals with our words.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us read verses 1 through 12.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to find out how God s children should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A. Not Becoming Many Teachers</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 1 says, Do not become many teachers, my brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Knowing that we will receive greater judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The most outstanding characteristic of those who are undisciplined in their words is their desire to be teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Wherever they go, they like to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Wherever they are, they have something to say.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They want to be teachers of others under any circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They can give their lectures free of charge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many people like to be teachers and counselors.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When they are among others, they always have a great deal to say.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you see the problem here?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A Christian must not only stop lying, gossiping, and speaking evil words.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He should not even be wordy at all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No matter what kind of words he speaks, he is wrong as long as he speaks too much.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As soon as a man speaks too much, he loses all of his blessing before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>B. The Mark of Self-control Being Seen</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>in One s Words</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 2 says, For in many things we all stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If anyone does not stumble in word, this one is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whether or not a person can bridle himself depends on whether he can bridle his words.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether or not a person has self-control a fruit of the Spirit depends on whether he can bridle his words.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many brothers and sisters misunderstand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They think that self-control is moderation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Please keep in mind that self-control is self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The teaching of moderation has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christians should exercise self-control, which means that they should control themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Self-control is a fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Galatians 5 shows us what the fruit of the Spirit is, while James tells us what the mark of the fruit of the Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>James says a person who is able to bridle his whole body is surely able to bridle his words.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Those who are loose in their words are loose in their living.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those who speak foolishly conduct themselves foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A person who is indiscreet with words is surely indiscreet in everything he does.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A person who has many words is bound to be a careless person before God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whether or not a person can bridle his whole body depends on whether he can bridle his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I hope that from now on all the new believers will learn to bridle their words before God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many brothers and sisters pray for God to deal with them and to grant them mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I will say a word to them: If God can deal with your speaking, He can deal with you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There are many people whose speaking constitutes the very life of their being.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Their speaking represents their strength, the very hollow of their thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If God can deal with their speaking, He can deal with their whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many people have not been defeated by God in their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As a result, their very being has not been defeated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If a man has no self-control over himself, he may act in certain ways.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But once others talk to him for half an hour, they realize the kind of person he is.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As soon as a man opens his mouth, his very being is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Nothing exposes a person more than his words.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As soon as a man speaks, his very being is fully exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you want to see whether a man can control himself, simply ask if he can control his speaking.</S>
