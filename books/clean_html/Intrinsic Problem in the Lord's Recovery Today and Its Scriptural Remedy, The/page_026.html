<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>Among the fifty-one cases listed above, thirty-five, the majority, are of different kinds and were all (except case IV) taken care of positively by various adequate ways, such as the proper arrangement of the service in case I, testifying according to the truth in case II, and recovering in a spirit of meekness a brother overtaken in an offence in case XVIII, leaving only sixteen, the minority, to be taken care of in the way of quarantine. This indicates that, according to His loving concern over His dear redeemed saints, the Lord&rsquo;s intention concerning all the believers who are involved in the tests of the oneness of His Body and of the one accord of His church, is to adjust, correct, rescue, recover, and perfect them so that He can carry out the building up of His organic Body.</p>
<p>Among the sixteen cases remaining to be dealt with in the way of quarantine, there are two cases of division (cases V and XXXI), thirteen cases of heresy (cases III, XII, XVI, XXIV, XXVII, XXXIII, XXXIV, XXXV, XXXVI, XXXVIII, XL, XLIV, and XLVI), and one case of gross sin (case VIII).</p>
<p>Concerning the first case of division (case V), the Apostle Paul decisively and emphatically gave us a strong charge that we should carry out a quarantine by &ldquo;turning away from&rdquo; the divisive persons (Rom. 16:17). Concerning the second case of division (case XXXI), the Apostle Paul also charged us strongly and decisively to exercise a stern quarantine by refusing the factious, divisive person (Titus 3:10).</p>
<p>As to the thirteen cases of heresy, case III was taken care of by the proper fellowship according to the truth (Acts 15:1-31); cases XII, XXIV, XXXV, and XXXVI were taken care of by teaching; case XVI was dealt with by cursing the heretics (Gal. 1:8-9); cases XXVII, XXXIII, XXXIV, and XL were taken care of by warning the saints; cases XLIV and XLVI were dealt with by condemnation; and case XXXVIII was dealt with by the exercising of a quarantine. In case XXXVIII, the Apostle John sharply and emphatically charged us not to receive into our house a heretic who does not confess Christ&rsquo;s coming in the flesh but goes beyond the teaching of Christ, and even not to greet him, that we may not share in his evil works (2 John 7, 9-11).</p>
<p>Concerning case VIII, a case of gross sin, the Apostle Paul took care of it first by judging the sinning one in the name of the Lord and delivering him to Satan for destruction of the flesh (1 Cor. 5:3-5), and then by solemnly charging the saints to exercise to quarantine the sinning one by not eating with him and removing him from the fellowship in the church (1 Cor. 5:11, 13).</p>
<p>Among all the tests of the oneness of the Body and of the one accord of the church listed above, only three&mdash;divisions, heresies, and fornication&mdash;are intolerable and need a quarantine by the churches and the saints according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching. Divisions damage the Body of Christ, and heresies insult the person of Christ and also damage the work of Christ. Thus, divisions are related negatively to the Body of Christ, and heresies are related negatively to Christ in His person and His work. Fornication is a gross sin that damages the humanity made by God to be the members of the Body of Christ. If these three things are taking place in the church, the Body of Christ would be annulled, the very Christ would be altogether damaged, and the humanity used as the constituents of the Body of Christ would be fully corrupted. Therefore, these three problems cannot be tolerated, and we should exercise to quarantine those who are involved in these problems, in order to preserve the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>I hope that we will spend some time to learn the proper way to face each kind of problem. We all must be impressed that among so many kinds of problems, only three are intolerable. Even with those involved in the three intolerable sins, we must be careful to deal with them in our spirit by the Spirit. We should be careful to carry out a quarantine over them to restrict the spreading of the contagious diseases. Concerning all the others, we must exercise our longsuffering, with love, in hope of recovering them. There might be a few hopeless cases. Concerning the three problems of division, heresy, and gross sin, we need to be very careful in dealing with those involved, in order that the building up of the Body of Christ may proceed in a proper way, not allowing the Body of Christ to be damaged by divisions, Christ to be damaged by heresies, and the humanity that is for the Lord&rsquo;s Body to be damaged by gross sins. Such a study of fifty-one cases in the New Testament as tests of the genuine oneness and the proper one accord helps us to find the proper way to solve our present problem in the rebellion among us. Thus, it also is a part of the scriptural remedy for our problem.</p>
<p>We have studied the genuine oneness in Message One, the proper one accord in Message Two, and the fifty-one negative cases as tests of the genuine oneness and of the proper one accord in this message. I consider the genuine oneness as our constitution, the proper one accord as our law, and the tests as cases of judgment. The case of the present rebellion in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery should be judged according to our constitution (the genuine oneness), our law (the proper one accord), and the fifty-one cases for reference. If a just judgment were to be rendered, none of the fifty-one cases could be used as an example to judge any item of the dissenting ones&rsquo; accusations against us as a case that requires a quarantine. In contrast, there are cases on the list of tests that can be used as strong examples to judge our case against the dissenting ones as a case that needs a thorough quarantine.</p>
