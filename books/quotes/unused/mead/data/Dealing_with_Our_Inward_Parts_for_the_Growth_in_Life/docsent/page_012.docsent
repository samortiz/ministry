   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that the inward parts of our being are the parts of our soul, and the hidden part is our spirit Psa 51:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have also seen that both our soul and our spirit are of three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have a body with many parts, a soul with three parts, and a spirit also with three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moreover, we also have a heart, composed of the three parts of the soul and the first part of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this message we will see further details concerning the inward parts and the hidden part.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I look to the Lord that we may have the grace to see all these things clearly, knowing all the parts of our being so that we may be able to exercise our spirit, heart, mind, and will to contact the Lord, to fellowship with the Lord, and to know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>DEALING FIRST WITH OUR HEART</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the Scriptures, we must deal first with our heart, not our spirit or soul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The heart comes first, because it is composed of all the parts of the soul and the first part of the spirit, the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All relationships with the Lord must start with the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even relationships with other people must begin with the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be sure, if our conscience is dark and wrong, we will be wrong not only with God but also with others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since the conscience is the main part of the heart, the heart has to come first in our relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Turning Our Heart to the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Corinthians 3:16 says, "But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The heart must first be turned to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To turn our heart to the Lord is the real repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While we were fallen, our heart was turned away from the Lord, but at the time we repented, our heart turned back to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must have a turning back of the heart to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This turning is not once for all; we have to turn our heart back to the Lord all the time, day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every morning we must turn our heart again to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I would suggest, especially to the young brothers and sisters, that every morning after you rise, when you go the Lord, tell Him, "Lord, here I am by Your mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I wish to exercise myself to turn my heart to You again, to turn to You anew for this day."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When our heart is turned to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is an important secret for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many people ask why they do not have light and guidance and why they do not know the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I would ask them "Where is your heart?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Toward what is your heart turned?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is their problem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to turn our heart to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Over thirty years ago when I was a young brother, almost every day I prayed with 2 Corinthians 3:16: "Lord, cause me to turn my heart to You."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This works; just try it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before we go to read the Word in the morning, we first have to turn our heart to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then the life will be there, and the veil will be taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I like this verse: "But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The veil between us and the Lord is taken away by our turning our heart to the Lord.</S>
