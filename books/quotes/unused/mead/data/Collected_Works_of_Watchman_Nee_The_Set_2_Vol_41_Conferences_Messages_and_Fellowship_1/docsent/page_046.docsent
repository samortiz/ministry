   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GRACE AND TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How do we receive grace?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are three ways to receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first is through the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The more we read the Bible, the more the Bible will increase our measure, and the more we will know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more we know ourselves, the more we will sense our needs, and the more grace will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second, we can receive grace directly from God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we listen to a message, pray, or fellowship with God, we receive grace directly from Him through His enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Third, we can receive grace through the help of other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a brother has dealt with a sin, and that same sin is entangling me, I can receive help from that brother to achieve victory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this way I receive more grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The grace which we receive is limited by the truth we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The amount of grace a man receives speaks of the amount of truth he has received.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more a man knows what sin is, the more grace he will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, we may find from reading the Bible that we should be anxious for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once we have this truth, we realize that anxiety is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A sister read Philippians 4:6, which says to be anxious for nothing, and concluded that this was impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then she thought that this was God's Word which could not be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the Bible was not wrong, she must have been wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She brought up the matter with another sister who had nine children, two of whom had died.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The second sister replied, "How can a mother not be anxious?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, it seems that it is a sin for a mother not to be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My anxiety has sent two children to heaven already, and I am left with seven to be anxious over."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first sister felt more confused after she heard this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later, she was enlightened to see that anxiety is indeed a sin, and she prayed that the Lord would make her overcome such a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, she did overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the meaning of truth and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Truth tells us what sin is, and grace enables us to overcome such sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before we have the truth, we may not think too much of a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after we receive the truth and are enlightened, we will know what sin is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the past, the island of Kulangsu was ceded to the British.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Later, more land was reclaimed from the sea, and the British territory subsequently increased.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same principle, the more truth there is, the more grace there is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Truth shows us what sin is, and when we apply grace, we experience full victory over such sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A sister had a watch, which her mother had given to her on her twentieth birthday.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the watch was a golden cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She kept the watch for eighteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day she read 1 Timothy 2:9 which says that women should not adorn themselves with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She had thought that it was all right to have a little ornamentation on the watch.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But that day God pointed His finger at the watch and showed her that she had to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She began to preach to God and argued that such a small thing did not matter, but eventually the Lord prevailed, and she dealt with that little matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today we should be bold to search out our sins and deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the past we might have dealt with gross sins, outward sins, obvious sins, and filthy sins.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today we have to deal with the small, fine, inward, and hidden sins that bring dishonor to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These dealings will bring us more grace to experience more victories in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>RECEIVING THE TRUTH, ENJOYING GRACE,</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>AND EXPERIENCING VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether or not you make any progress in your daily life depends on whether you have seen the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You must first find the kind of sins you have and then find how the Lord accomplishes an overcoming work within you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A Western woman missionary was working for the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She was at odds with Miss Fischbacher and often publicly defamed her.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When Miss Fischbacher would report one thing, the sister would deny it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When Miss Fischbacher would deny something, the sister would insist that such a thing happened.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once Miss Fischbacher wrote home to report on her work in China.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This sister tried to find to whom she was writing, and she wrote to the same person in an attempt to negate the things that Miss Fischbacher had said.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It seemed as if she was going out of her way to prove to others that Miss Fischbacher was being dishonest.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After this went on for a while, Miss Fischbacher could not help but harbor some bitterness against her.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Later, she read 1 Peter 1:22, which says that we should love one another from a pure heart fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is so easy for man to preach to God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>She told the Lord, "It is impossible for me to love this sister.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is even more impossible for me to love her fervently."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She prayed for two weeks without any success.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She fasted for one whole day and was determined not to leave her room until she overcame this bitterness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, she still could not get through.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Later, she conceded that the most she could do was not to hate the sister.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It was impossible to love her.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>She fasted for another day, but still to no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Finally, she realized that she could not make it by herself, and she said to the Lord, "I should love this sister, but I cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I will not let You go unless You make me love her."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The next day she prayed continuously for three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At about nine o'clock in the morning, the Lord's love filled her.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The bitterness was gone, and love came unexpectedly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>She felt that she could even die for this sister.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>She went on and prayed for her the entire night.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When she saw the sister the next day, her feeling was entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After another day the other sister also was turned.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The overcoming life has God's Word as its standard.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God has said many things.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we cannot obey what He has said, we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We live in this world for only a very brief time, but we encounter too many things during this life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is in the midst of such a life that we express the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There were three sisters in Shansi who were missionaries together.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Two of them were unmarried by their own choice, and the third was engaged to a man.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>However, she was the most unhappy of them all.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Often she felt lonely.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Even though her fiance wrote her all the time, she still felt lonely when she was by herself in her room.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>One day she was weeping again.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The other two sisters came in to console her, saying, "Why are you lonely?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>You have a fianc who writes to you!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We are the ones who should feel lonely!"</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Later, they went back to their rooms and were struck by loneliness as well, and they began to cry.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>While they were feeling sorry in this way, they thought of the Lord's Word: "In Your presence is fullness of joy;/At Your right hand there are pleasures forever" Psa 16:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They realized that the feeling of loneliness is actually a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The Lord said that in His presence there is fullness of joy, yet they said that they were lonely.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This had to be a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>They knelt down and prayed to deal with this sin, and the loneliness went away.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Nine years have passed, and they have yet to feel lonely again.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Victory is for God to expose our sins continuously and for us to grow through such knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We should not be afraid of others exposing our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This will afford us a chance to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The more we know the truth, the more we will experience the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I hope that by next year, some will stand up to testify how the truth has come to them and how grace has also followed.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This is something very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We should all receive the truth gladly so that grace can come to us more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In all the meetings, we need to stand up more and more to testify how a certain truth has produced an effect on us.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We should not worry whether others will say that we are proud if it is the Lord's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We are merely describing the Lord's work in us and how He has won a victory in us.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>By doing this, those who are in similar trouble or who have not experienced the proper dealing as we have will be able to share the grace we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>An overcoming living is wonderful because the overcoming life is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The Lord can do everything within us.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>There is nothing that He cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We do not have to be afraid of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We can just come to Him continually.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We should allow Him to enlighten us with the truth and receive Him as our very victory.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If we walk this way, there will be nothing that we cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>After a year we will realize that we have overcome some more, and we will be more able to follow the Lord's leading and go on in the way that is set before us.</S>
