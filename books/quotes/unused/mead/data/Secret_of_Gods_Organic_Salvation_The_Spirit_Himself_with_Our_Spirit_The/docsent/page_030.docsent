   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we extol You again.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Essentially You are the second One of the Trinity, yet economically You first became flesh, then You became the life-giving Spirit, and now You are the intensified sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We thank You that, essentially, You have never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From eternity to eternity You remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We thank You also that, economically, You have changed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You changed by becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then as the last Adam in the flesh You changed again by becoming the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the life-giving Spirit You changed again, and now You are the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We praise You for what You did to accomplish God s judicial redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We praise You for what You are doing to accomplish God s salvation organically and for what You are doing in Your intensification to carry out God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How we worship You!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, we ask You to teach us concerning all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We believe that this is Your complete and perfect theology.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, save Your people so that they may be transformed and become the precious materials gold, silver, and precious stones and not remain in a situation of wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, we fear and tremble, fearing that we might be in the second category.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, we want to be in the first category, having all the precious, transformed materials.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We pray that You will cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lord, You are the Alpha and Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have given us a good beginning, and now we ask You to give us a good conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The secret of the intensified work of God s organic salvation is something in addition to God s organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we have seen, God s organic salvation is of eight sections, from regeneration through glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, in order for God s economy to be completed and consummated, that is, for God to have the New Jerusalem, something further is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After His resurrection and in His heavenly ministry, the Lord Jesus established many churches, but not long afterward the churches became degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This made it necessary for Christ, who had become the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, to intensify Himself to be the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is clearly revealed in the book of Revelation 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I. THE THREE SECTIONS OF CHRIST S MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christians often say that Christ s ministry is of two parts or sections His earthly ministry and His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, Christ s ministry is actually of three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The third section of His ministry is the sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This ministry is still His heavenly ministry, but it is a heavenly ministry that has been intensified sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A. The First Section</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first section of Christ s ministry was His earthly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This ministry was accomplished by Him judicially in the flesh from His incarnation to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In His flesh He died for us according to the righteous requirements of God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>B. The Second Section</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The second section of Christ s ministry is His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This ministry is carried out by Him as the life-giving Spirit, organically in the mystical realm, from His resurrection to the end of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ s ministry in this section is altogether organic, for it is carried out by Him in His resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>C. The Third Section</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The third section of Christ s ministry is His sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This ministry is carried out by Him as the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit, sevenfold intensified organically in the mystical realm, from the degradation of the church to the full consummation of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now Christ is not only the life-giving Spirit He is the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit carrying out His sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first section of Christ s ministry was judicial, the second section is organic, and the third section is sevenfold intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Very few Christians realize that today we should not be merely in Christ s heavenly ministry but in His sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all need to be in the third section of Christ s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today the Lord is working not only as the life-giving Spirit but also as the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This Spirit may be compared to the shining of the sun spoken of in Isaiah 30:26, which says that in the millennium the light of the sun shall be sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today the Spirit who is filling us and saturating us is the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all need to see this and then pray, Lord, I worship You that You are working in me as the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the past some have tried to argue with us, saying that Christ cannot change and quoting Hebrews 13:8, which says, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, yes, even forever.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Regarding this we would point out that Christ has not changed essentially, but He has changed economically.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Essentially He is the same from eternity to eternity, but economically He has changed in three ways by becoming flesh in His incarnation, by becoming the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection, and by intensifying Himself to be the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit in His intensification.</S>
