   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE DEVIL S SECOND STRATAGEM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN TEMPTING THE FIRST GOD-MAN TO ASSUME</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>HIS DIVINITY OF BEING THE SON OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the devil s first stratagem, his temptation of the first God-man changed somewhat Matt 4:5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He brought Jesus to the wing of the temple, a very high place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The tempter said to Jesus, If You are the Son of God, cast Yourself down; for it is written, To His angels He shall give charge concerning You, and on their hands they shall bear You up, lest You strike Your foot against a stone v. 6 . This was a temptation enticing Jesus to show that as the Son of God He was able to act miraculously.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many of the so-called healings in Pentecostalism are just for the purpose of making a show and are not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may be attracted by the Lord and react to His attraction by loving and following Him, but at the same time we may desire to have a name like the Son of God and a position like the divine position of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is our trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The devil s second stratagem was again based upon what God declared that the first God-man was.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The devil then exercised his second stratagem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first one was to tempt the Lord to ignore His position as a man and to assume His divine position as the Son of God by performing a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When this did not work, the devil tried to make Him assume His position in divinity to display His power and His authority by having a miracle of protection by the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the first God-man overcame His subtle tempter by saying, You shall not test the Lord your God v. 7 , indicating strongly that He was a man before God who should not test the Lord His God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not to test means not to tempt.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He, the first God-man, stood on the ground of a creature, recognizing that God was His Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He declared, I shall not tempt My Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is My Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In being tempted the Lord had at least three statuses: first He was a man, second a creature, and third the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a man, He could not test His Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God in His eternal economy wanted to have a man as one of His creatures to deal with His enemy Satan, another creature, but the enemy tempted the first God-man to assume His divinity as the Creator of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By this subtle way, Satan mixed up the levels of God as the Creator and Satan himself as a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can see this when Jesus indicated that as a man, God s creature, He would not test the Lord, His Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we must realize first that we are a man of the flesh worthy of nothing and second that we are a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God desires to use a creature to deal with Satan, another creature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here we can see God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God would never deal with Satan directly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to Hebrews 2:14, the Lord Jesus destroyed Satan by partaking of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He destroyed Satan in His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ, as a creature, not as the Creator, destroyed Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He destroyed Satan as a creature on the same level as Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By this, He honored God s unique position as the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Satan s way was to uplift himself to the level of the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>V. THE DEVIL S THIRD STRATAGEM IN SEDUCING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE FIRST GOD-MAN TO LOVE THE GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>OF THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD, WORSHIPPING HIM</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>AS GOD AND SERVING HIM AS HIS SUBORDINATE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After his first two stratagems failed, Satan tried a third time to tempt the Lord to love the glory of the kingdoms of the world, worshipping him as God and serving him as his subordinate Matt 4:8-11; Luke 4:5-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The enemy would tempt us to love the world by getting us to consider how successful the people in the world are, while we are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I began to serve the Lord with my full time in 1933.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>About ten years later, I was imprisoned by the invading Japanese army and afterward I contracted tuberculosis of the lungs.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One day while I was still recuperating from my illness, I was walking with a stick on a bridge and a thought came to me saying, You ve been laboring for your Lord for ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What have you gained?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All you have is a stick in your hand and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But look at how successful your classmates and other people have become.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That was a temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many cannot overcome the third stratagem of the enemy: to use the world as a bait to hook us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have seen many get hooked by this bait.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It should have been that in the preadamic age God appointed the archangel to be the head of the preadamic age Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>28:13-14 , and the authority and glory of the kingdoms of the earth should have been given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After he rebelled against God and became God s enemy, Satan, he was judged by God Isa 14:12-15 , but the full execution of God s judgment upon him will not be completed until the end of the millennium Rev 20:7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, until that time he has authority over the kingdoms of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In his subtle temptation of the Lord, he offered the earthly kingdoms and their glory to the first God-man as a bait to hook Him so that He would worship him as God and serve him as his subordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But the first God-man saw through the evil tempter s devilish device and conquered him by chasing him away and telling him in a shaming way that as a man before God He would worship God and serve Him only.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I hope that these definitions will help us to see Satan s stratagems.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All of us are under these dangers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every day our enemy is busy, and he is very diligent.</S>
