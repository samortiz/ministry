ENTERS INTO MAN TO RESURRECT MAN</h2>
<p>When someone hears the Lord&rsquo;s word, the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life enters into him. The Lord raised Lazarus from the dead by speaking to him. This indicates that the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life enters into man and resurrects man by His word. His word is His voice. His resurrection life is contained in His word. His word is also the gospel, which is the words in the Bible and the words that He spoke. When His word meets the death in man, the power of resurrection life swallows up the death in man and enlivens man. Whenever the Lord visits you, His word will come to you. The Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life is in His word. When His word comes to you, His resurrection life will enliven you.</p>
<p>Unbelievers are enlivened by the Lord&rsquo;s word, and believers are also enlivened by the Lord&rsquo;s word. Initially, we were dead inwardly, but we were made alive when we touched the Lord&rsquo;s word. Now the Lord&rsquo;s word comes to us in our morning prayer, when we read the Bible or a spiritual book, or when we are listening to a message. Before the Lord&rsquo;s word comes, we may feel oppressed and inwardly dead, but after the Lord&rsquo;s word comes, we are enlivened. We may have been dead inwardly, but we are made alive by the Lord&rsquo;s word. When the Lord&rsquo;s word touches us, we are made alive. His words are spirit and life (6:63).</p>
<p>John 5:25 says, &ldquo;The dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.&rdquo; Lazarus heard the Lord say, &ldquo;Lazarus, come out!&rdquo; (11:43). The Lord&rsquo;s voice made him alive. The Bible contains many words of the Lord. Even the words in this gospel message are the Lord&rsquo;s voice. If you will listen, you will be made alive. At the beginning of this chapter we read John 5:24, which says, &ldquo;He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life.&rdquo; John 3:36 says, &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life,&rdquo; and verse 16 says, &ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.&rdquo; If you will listen to these words, you will receive the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life and be made alive.</p>
<p>Everyone who hears the Lord&rsquo;s word has some responsibility. The Lord said, &ldquo;Lazarus, come out!&rdquo; Lazarus had a responsibility to come out. After hearing the Lord&rsquo;s word, Lazarus needed to come out. Likewise, after we hear the Lord&rsquo;s word, we need to believe.</p>
<p>Those who hear the Lord&rsquo;s word need help from others as well. When Lazarus came out from the tomb, he was still bound hand and foot with cloths. Hence, the Lord told others to loose him. This is to have help from others.</p>
<p>There are three steps here. The first step involves the Lord&rsquo;s speaking, which is the Lord&rsquo;s doing. The second step involves our coming out, which is our responsibility to believe the Lord&rsquo;s word. The third step involves help from others, which is to be released from our bondage. These three steps are involved in shepherding others. We should always let the Lord speak first. Those whom we shepherd then need to believe. Following this, we can render them some help to release them from their bondage. First, those whom we shepherd need to hear the Lord&rsquo;s word, which is spirit and life. After they hear the Lord&rsquo;s word, they need to take the responsibility to believe. However, after they believe, they are still bound; hence, we need to loose them. It is useless to try to help others and loose them from their bondage if they have not heard the Lord&rsquo;s word and do not have the Lord&rsquo;s life, because they are still in the tomb. In this situation our work will be in vain. However, if the Lord&rsquo;s word enters into them, and they rise up, we can help loose them from their bondage. Then our work will be useful.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF MAN RECEIVING<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S RESURRECTION LIFE</h2>
<p>A person who passes through the three steps of hearing the Lord&rsquo;s word, believing, and being released from his bondage is not only resurrected inwardly but also released outwardly. By passing through these three steps, Lazarus came out of the tomb and was released from all bondage. Likewise, when someone is saved by the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life, he will come out of his tomb&mdash;casinos, dance clubs, and all kinds of sinful places. Furthermore, he will be released from bondage&mdash;eating, drinking, fornication, gambling, and all kinds of addictions. When someone is saved by the Lord&rsquo;s life, he is resurrected and released.</p>
<p>The ultimate issue of man&rsquo;s salvation is resurrection. The Lord does not correct man; He enlivens man inwardly. This is how the Lord saves an unbeliever, and this is the same principle of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection work in believers. As believers, we should be resurrected daily. We are not being corrected daily but being resurrected daily. Every day we need to allow the resurrection life to operate in our being in order to deliver us from the tomb and from bondage. We need to be delivered by the operation of the resurrection life in us from what buries us and from what takes away our freedom.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the issues of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation are also seen in the resurrected ones. The final condition of the eight kinds of people recorded in the Gospel of John is found in every believer. Hence, a believer is regenerated at the beginning and resurrected at the end. Between regeneration and resurrection, his thirsty human life is satisfied, his impotence is turned into strength, he lives by the bread of life and the water of life, he is delivered from sins, his sight is restored, and he is delivered from death. Thus, he is absolutely in the realm of resurrection. This is full salvation.</p>
<p>If we consider the eight cases recorded in the Gospel of John, we will see that these cases constitute a full picture of the different aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s saving life. Man is in death. He is dissatisfied in his human life. He desires to do good but has no strength. He does not have the supply or the nourishment to live in the world. He is unable to overcome sins. He is blind and in darkness, and he is dead.</p>
<p>This was our condition. One day the Lord Jesus, in whom is life, came. He came that we may have life. He desired to enter into us in order to save us with His life. After we were regenerated, we were satisfied, and our human life became meaningful. Our impotence was turned into strength. We also ate the living bread and drank the living water, by which we live before God. We are also delivered from sins, our eyes are opened, and we are delivered from death. This is the way that we are fully saved. This is the full salvation that we received when the Lord Jesus came to be our life. This is also the full salvation that we should believe, receive, and enjoy daily. May everyone participate in the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. May we all thank and praise Him for His salvation. Let us sing a hymn:</p>
