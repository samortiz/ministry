   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Being Sincere in Attitude</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do not delve into many teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Try to speak more facts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the same time, be sincere in attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Saving a man's soul is not a light matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I once saw a person who wanted to lead others to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was willing to pray, but his attitude was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He joked around as he spoke about the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whatever spiritual power he might have had was lost through his jokes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a result, he could not lead anyone to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One has to be very sincere in his attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He must not be flippant or funny in his attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He has to let others see that this is the most serious matter in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>D. Praying for the Opportunity to Speak</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You also need to pray unceasingly for God to provide you with the right opportunity to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you pray, God will give you the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One sister gathered a group of women together once a week and led them in a Bible study.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The women all worked in the same company, and none of them believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One of them was very particular about her dress.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She was very proud and would not listen to anything the sister said.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The sister took notice of her and prayed for her.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She asked God to give her the opportunity to speak to the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One day she felt a desire to invite the woman over for tea.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since this woman loved to socialize, she accepted the invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When she came, the sister encouraged her to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She replied, "I cannot believe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I like to gamble, and I love pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not want to lose these things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I cannot believe in Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The sister said, "If a person wants to believe in the Lord Jesus, she has to stop gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anyone who wants to believe in the Lord Jesus must give up vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You have to give up these things if you want to believe in the Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The woman said, "The price is too high.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I cannot afford it."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The sister said, "I hope you will go back and consider it."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After she said this, she continued to pray for her.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The woman returned home and knelt down to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After she prayed, she suddenly said, "I have decided to follow the Lord Jesus today."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She changed suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She could not explain it, but her heart just turned.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She changed her attire; she no longer dressed the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Wonderful things followed one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Within a year many of her colleagues were brought to the Lord one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You may think that it is difficult to talk to someone, but if you pray for him, the Lord will give you the opportunity to speak to him, and he will change.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The sister who was having Bible studies had been afraid to speak to the woman because the woman behaved as though she knew everything and could do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She appeared to be very arrogant, but the Lord gave this sister the burden to pray for her.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One day the Lord told the sister to speak to her.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She put aside her considerations and spoke to her.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You have to pray on the one hand and learn to open your mouth on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After you have prayed for a person for some time, the Lord will impress you to speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You will have to tell him about the Lord's grace and the things that He has done for you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He will not be able to resist you because he cannot oppose the things that the Lord has done for you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The newly saved brothers and sisters must pray daily for the Lord to provide opportunities to speak to others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What a pity that some people have been saved for several years already, yet they dare not open their mouths to speak to their relatives and friends!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps your fear has caused you to miss many opportunities that were waiting for you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>E. Speaking in Season and out of Season</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We mentioned earlier that you must pray before you speak to a person.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This, however, does not mean that you cannot speak if you have not prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You have to speak to men even if you are seeing them for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Always grasp the opportunity to speak, whether in season or out of season.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You never know who you are missing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Speak whenever there is the chance.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Always be prepared to open your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Of course, first and foremost, you have to pray for those whose names appear in your record book.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But you have to pray for those whom you do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You should pray, "Lord, please save the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Whoever they may be, please save them."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whenever you meet someone and have an urge in your heart to speak, you should speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we do not heed this urging, we may let a soul slip away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should not let so many souls slip through our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We hope that all the brothers and sisters will testify faithfully for the Lord and bring many to Christ.</S>
