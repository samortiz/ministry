[1]  1 OUR EXPERIENCE I find then the law with me who wills to do the good,
[2]  For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[3]  This life is completely at peace, has no barriers in its fellowship with God, and is not contrary to His will in any way.
[4]  Adultery is a sin of the flesh, undisciplined eyes are a sin of the flesh, and improper relationships with others are also a sin of the flesh.
[5]  The Lord has not come to deliver us from sin only, but also from our disposition.
[6]  God requires that we consecrate ourselves absolutely to Him.
[7]  He requires that we consecrate our wives and children to Him.
[8]  He also requires that we consecrate our business entirely to Him.
[9]  He requires that we consecrate all of our money to Him.
[10]  But dear brothers and sisters, we have to realize that in the Old Testament there was the ordinance of tithing, the offering of one tenth; in the New Testament our consecration should be ten tenths.
[11]  REVEALED IN THE BIBLE Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[12]  When we were saved, the grace of God filled our hearts with joy.
[13]  At that time, our life was filled with hope; we thought that from that point on, all our sins would be under our feet.
[14]  At the time we were saved, we thought that no temptation was too great for us to overcome and no difficulty was too much for us to surmount.
[15]  In the last message, we saw our experience in ourselves.
[16]  Today we want to consider the kind of life that God has ordained for Christians.
[17]  We are not talking about advanced Christians; we are talking about every saved and regenerated Christian, every Christian who has received the eternal life.
[18]  When I was in Chefoo and Peking recently, a few brothers remarked that in the past they loved calling the Lord the Christ, but that now they like calling Him Jesus, my Savior!
[19]  John 7:37 and 38 say, Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.
[20]  He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.
[21]  They will not flow out of only special Christians or the apostles Paul, Peter, or John, but out of all those who believe, out of ordinary men like us.
[22]  Romans 8:35 says, Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[23]  Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?
[24]  Verse 37 says, But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us.
[25]  Oh, our Lord who loves us has more than conquered all these things!
[26]  But in our case, we do not need tribulation or swords to come upon us; as soon as someone gives us a bad look, we lose the love of Christ.
[27]  In the Bible, victory is first mentioned in 1 Samuel 15:29 ASV margin , where it says that Victory will not lie nor repent.
[28]  We are very familiar with Galatians 2:20, which says, I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God.
[29]  It is not an evil I being changed into a good I, or a filthy I being changed into a clean I. It is to be no longer I. The greatest mistake we make today is to think that victory involves progress and that defeat involves the absence of progress.
[30]  This is why we think that everything will be well if we do not lose our temper or if we have an intimate fellowship with God.
[31]  THE PRINCIPLE OF THIS LIFE A GIFT, NOT A REWARD
[32]  Please remember that victory is a gift; it is not a reward.
[33]  A gift is a present; it is something freely given.
[34]  The latter is given to us freely; it has nothing to do with what we have done, and we do not have to exert any effort to get it.
[35]  We can look at 1 Corinthians 15:57, which says, But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[36]  The overcoming life is something that is obtained; it is not attained.
[37]  This matter can only be obtained; it can never be attained.
[38]  You may remember that Paul once said, For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure Phil 2:13 .
[39]  God is operating in us to make us holy.
[40]  We do not have to exert our own effort, because everything is accomplished through God working in us.
[41]  Such a holy and perfect life does not come about by our own effort; it is absolutely a work of God.
[42]  A LIFE OF EXPRESSION, NOT A LIFE OF SUPPRESSION
[43]  The result of an overcoming life is a life of expression rather than a life of suppression.
[44]  The problem with our victory is that most of it comes by suppression.
[45]  THE OVERCOMING LIFE 1 I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live,
[46]  but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live
[47]  in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God,
[48]  We know that the overcoming life is Christ, and we know that the overcoming life is Christ living in us.
[49]  The question we will address in this message is how to be joined to Christ, including what we should do before Christ can become our life and before He can live within us.
[50]  Yet I would ask one thing: While it is true that God has crucified us, what should we do and what process should we pass through before we can say in reality that we are crucified with Christ?
[51]  My intention is not to give a sermon this afternoon but to have a talk with you.
[52]  This is something that concerns all of us; it is not just something for me.
[53]  Why did God want to crucify us with the Lord Jesus?
[54]  I personally treasure this portion of the Word very much.
[55]  I hope that you will bear with me and consider what this passage is really speaking of.
[56]  There was a ruler who came to Jesus and asked for eternal life God s life.
[57]  Still you lack one thing: all that you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me. Do you realize that you still lack one thing? What does it mean to lack one thing? The Lord Jesus said that he still lacked one thing and that he could not get by without having that one thing.
[58]  The young ruler might have been able to fulfill five, fifty, or even five hundred conditions, but God put one thing in front of him to show him that he was not able.
[59]  Friends, the first step toward victory is to realize that we are not able.
[60]  Once we realize that we are not able, we have passed the first step.
[61]  Mrs. So-and-so, are you clear that you are not able? Have you realized your inability only after these twenty or more days? Thank God that you have finally learned that you are not able to do something.
[62]  I think we have to go one step further to consider something more.
[63]  Many brothers and sisters already know that they are not able to do anything.
[64]  Perhaps you know that you are not able to do anything.
[65]  But I must ask once again: Are you able, or are you not able?
[66]  There is no doubt that Christ will overcome for you, but there is a condition for His overcoming for you: You must not consider yourself able.
[67]  If you continue to say in your heart that you are able and that you can make it in yourself, Christ cannot live for you.
[68]  Weakness is something that one should boast in. You may have said, Thank and praise the Lord because He has made me overcome, but have you ever said, Thank and praise the Lord because He has made me fail miserably ? You thank and praise the Lord for giving you patience, but have you thanked and praised Him for your impossible temper? Have you thanked and praised Him for your pride? Have you thanked and praised Him for your jealousy? Have you thanked and praised Him for your uncleanness within and for your sin? If you have these problems, you should thank and praise the Lord for them.
[69]  The first thing you must do is realize that you cannot make it.
[70]  The third thing you should do is thank and praise God for not being able to make it.
[71]  When you see that you cannot make it and that you are totally incapable of doing anything, and when you see that only the Lord can make it, you will thank and praise Him.
[72]  Once I met a brother in Chefoo who was going through the overcoming experience.
[73]  This brother came from Manchuria and had been an army doctor for over ten years.
[74]  Some brothers brought him to the Lord when he was in Manchuria.
[75]  After he believed in the Lord, he moved to Chefoo, where he practiced medicine for over a year.
[76]  He reminded me that he would come at 9:00 a.m. and that I should not have any other appointments that morning so that I could give the whole morning to him because his problem was serious.
[77]  Tonight all the brothers and sisters who are sitting here have seen the fact of the cross.
[78]  We know that when the Lord was crucified on the cross, He not only took away our sins but also crucified our person.
[79]  We know that the matter of sin has been dealt with, and that we ourselves have been crucified with Him.
[80]  It is true that we are crucified with Christ, but why has this truth not produced an effect on us?
[81]  The Lord has brought me to the cross, but I am still I. I am still bound, and I am still weak.
[82]  Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that it is one thing for the Lord Jesus to accomplish salvation, and it is another thing for us to receive this salvation.
[83]  If we realize that the cross is our appraisal report, if we know that we are absolutely useless, and if we know that we are not even capable of having right thoughts, we will agree that we deserve only to die.
[84]  I met a sister yesterday who spent two hours telling me her history of failure.
[85]  Finally, I asked her, Are you willing to concede now?
[86]  It is one thing for us to acknowledge that we cannot make it, but it is another thing for us not to try to make it.
[87]  THE LIFE WHICH I NOW LIVE IN THE FLESH
[88]  God says that I am utterly corrupt, and I also say that I am utterly corrupt.
[89]  God says that I am absolutely useless, and I also say that I am absolutely useless.
[90]  God says that I deserve only to die, and I also say that I deserve only to die.
[91]  Brothers and sisters, God cannot tell us to believe that which is unbelievable.
[92]  Some brothers and sisters will let go and resign when you ask them to do so, but they cannot believe.
[93]  While they say that they believe, they also say that they prefer to wait and see for a few days.
[94]  But a more important step is allowing the Lord Jesus to live out His victory from within us.
[95]  God says that if we believe that the Lord has died for us on the cross, He will give us eternal life, and if we believe that the Lord is living within us, He will give us the overcoming life.
[96]  They cannot believe that the Lord is living within them, and they cannot believe that the Lord has overcome for them.
[97]  When I asked how she let go, she said, I tell God that I can do nothing.
[98]  I told her that if she believed in God s fact and if she believed that the Lord Jesus is the victory and that He lives in her, she should believe immediately that she has overcome.
[99]  In the same way, if you fulfill the condition for God to give you victory, if you let go, if you resign, and if you lose hope in yourself, you can immediately believe that you have received the overcoming life.
[100]  Brothers and sisters, if you want to wait for the result before you dare say that you have the overcoming life, you are believing your own experience and not God s Word.
[101]  Although you may feel that you are cold and that there is nothing to smile about, you can still thank and praise the Lord, saying, The life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God.
[102]  Luke 18:27 says, But He said, The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.
[103]  In Luke 18:27, the Lord Jesus said that the things that are impossible with men are possible with God.
[104]  A young man came to the Lord and asked Him, What shall I do to inherit eternal life? v. 18 . Since he asked what he should do, the Lord answered, You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and mother v. 20 . The Lord mentioned five items.
[105]  He has discerned and realized that we cannot make it.
[106]  In order for us to receive deliverance from God, the first thing that we have to do is admit to Him that we cannot make it and that we do not intend to make it.
[107]  Brothers and sisters, what happens when we see the Lord s death for us on the cross, and what happens when we believe?
[108]  Similarly, when we see that the Lord has brought us to the cross and crucified us there, we will cease fighting and stop improving ourselves.
[109]  We will say, Lord, I will never improve, and I do not intend to improve.
[110]  From now on, I will not do anything, I will not manage anything, and I will not be concerned about anything.
[111]  Second Corinthians 12:9 says, And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.
[112]  Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.
[113]  This shows us that we should not only consider ourselves weak, powerless, and incapable, but also rejoice in our weakness, powerlessness, and incapability.
[114]  Does this verse say that we should weep for our weakness?
[115]  No, on the contrary, it says that we should rejoice over our weaknesses, and we should not just rejoice but also boast in our weaknesses.
[116]  But there is not one verse in the Bible, not one word from God, that tells us that we should live a life which we are capable of living or that we should do what we are capable of doing.
[117]  7 BELIEVING Now faith is the substantiation of things hoped for,
[118]  Hebrews 11:1 IN ORDER TO OVERCOME, ONE MUST BELIEVE
[119]  Today we will read only Galatians 2:20 and Hebrews 11:1.
[120]  During the past few days, we have seen that the overcoming life is simply Christ Himself.
[121]  The overcoming life is not an improvement or advancement in ourselves, and it is not a self-effort to strive to become like Christ.
[122]  Victory is Christ living within us; that is, it is Christ overcoming for us.
[123]  We believe that the Son of God lives within us, and we believe that He is living out His victory from within us.
[124]  This is the only verse in the whole Bible that gives the definition of faith.
[125]  Suddenly, God s light dawned on him, and he confessed before the Lord, saying, God, You said that Your grace is sufficient for me, but I said that Your grace is not sufficient for me.
[126]  Now we need to ask what faith is not.
[127]  Those who have hope do not necessarily have faith.
[128]  When you talk to others about overcoming and ask whether they have overcome, you know that they do not have faith if they answer, I hope I will overcome.
[129]  If he tells you that he hopes to be saved, you know that he does not have the faith yet.
[130]  Some people constantly hope that the Lord will save them, and they constantly hope that the Lord will help them overcome.
[131]  If you believe God s Word, you should say, God, I thank and praise You because I can be meek, patient, humble, loving, and temperate.
[132]  The greatest problem among God s children today is that they cannot believe God s Word.
[133]  It is not that hard to ask them to let go.
[134]  Since they have let go, it should be an easy thing for them to believe.
[135]  After you have let go, you should have the faith that you will get through.
[136]  God has said that you are a branch and that if you let go, the Lord s life will spontaneously flow out of you.
[137]  However, you are saying that God has not delivered you even though you have let go.
[138]  Brothers and sisters, please remember that when we believe in the Lord as our Head and our life and believe that we have received everything, everything is indeed ours.
[139]  We believe that the Lord is the Head, that He lives in us, that He is our life, that He is the vine and we are the branches, and that He is overcoming for us.
[140]  I told her frankly, Sister, God says that Jesus Christ is your life, but you are saying that Jesus Christ may not be your life.
[141]  Tonight I would like you to read one verse.
[142]  First Peter 1:7 says, So that the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes though it is proved by fire, may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[143]  Tonight I will speak on the proving of faith or the testing of faith.
[144]  The Bible shows us that there can be no faith without testing.
[145]  After you have overcome and stopped sinning for a week, two weeks, three weeks, or even four or five weeks, you think that you have become good, that you have changed, and that you have matured.
[146]  You may begin to appreciate yourself and boast in yourself.
[147]  Therefore, God will give you a test and make you fail so that you will realize that you have not changed at all.
[148]  If you can endure anything, it is not because you have changed but because you are exchanged.
[149]  You have to realize that if there is any endurance in you, it is Christ who is enduring for you.
[150]  No matter how long you have overcome, you are still you; you will always be you, and you will never change.
[151]  I asked her whether Christ had changed, and she said no. I asked her whether God s Word had changed, and she said no. I said, Since Christ has not changed and since God s Word has not changed, why are you not victorious? She answered that it was because her experience did not match what she thought it should be.
[152]  One sister had the same problem as Mrs. Lee.
[153]  She said that she believed but could not overcome.
[154]  I told her that we need faith that moves the mountain.
[155]  9 GROWTH Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.
[156]  Tonight we will consider another matter before the Lord, but before doing this, we have to review what we have seen.
[157]  We have seen that our experience has been a story of constant failures.
[158]  Third, we have seen that the overcoming life which God has given to us is Christ and that human ways, such as suppression, struggling, prayers, etc., are useless.
[159]  Fourth, we have seen that there are five characteristics to the overcoming life, the most important of which is that this life is a matter of exchange and not change.
[160]  When God says that His grace is sufficient for us, it is sufficient for us.
[161]  When God says that Christ is our life, He is our life.
[162]  I told you before of the brother who rode home on a bicycle after the meeting and was knocked over on the street.
[163]  If there had been both the time and the opportunity for him to consider it, he might have had a chance to put his temper away.
[164]  But brothers and sisters, after we have entered the experience of the overcoming life, we still have to say two prayers every morning when we rise up from our bed.
[165]  But when we declare that we cannot make it and that God can make it, and when we boast in our weaknesses and glory in God s power, the temptations go away.
[166]  Some brothers have asked whether this means that we will no longer sin after we have experienced victory.
[167]  My answer is that eventually we will realize everything in our practice.
[168]  But in the meantime, there is still the possibility of sinning.
[169]  According to the Bible, what kind of life should we live?
[170]  The Bible shows us that the life of a Christian is a life of faith.
[171]  I would like to bring to your attention 1 John 5:11-12, which says, And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son.
[172]  He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.
[173]  When God gives us His Son, He is not giving us just the prescription but the very Doctor Himself.
[174]  10 THE TONE OF VICTORY May we shout victoriously in Your salvation.
[175]  into whom though not seeing Him at present, yet believing,
[176]  you exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory.
[177]  In the Old Testament, there was a king of Judah by the name of Jehoshaphat.
[178]  Let us read 2 Chronicles 20 to learn about his tone of victory.
[179]  At that time, the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other besides the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle v. 1 . At the time of Jehoshaphat, the kingdom of Judah was very weak and helpless in fighting against its enemies.
[180]  He prayed to the Lord, O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee v. 12 . He acknowledged his helplessness, and his eyes were set upon the Lord.
[181]  God sent a prophet to him immediately, and said to him, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God s v. 15 . The battle is the Lord s! Victory or failure has nothing to do with us.
[182]  The battle is not ours, but God s. God has said, Ye shall not need to fight in this battle v. 17 . God demands only that we stand still.
[183]  And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the Lord: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.
[184]  Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the Lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
[185]  And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the Lord vv.
[186]  The great mistake that we make today is that we do not have the praise that is uttered before the victory; we hold back this praise and wait to see what will happen.
[187]  We do not have to commit any great sin; as long as we do not boast in His victory and as long as we do not thank and praise, we have lost our victory.
[188]  We can rejoice and praise God joyfully over many things.
[189]  For example, if we have passed the gate of victory and power, we can rejoice and praise God joyfully.
[190]  But the Bible says that we can rejoice in many of the things that we normally do not rejoice in. We can find out from the Bible the kinds of things we can rejoice in.
[191]  In chapter four, verses 12 and 13 say, Beloved, do not think that the fiery ordeal among you, coming to you for a trial, is strange, as if it were a strange thing happening to you; but inasmuch as you share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice exultingly.
[192]  11 CONSECRATION Neither present your members as weapons of unrighteousness
[193]  to sin, but present yourselves to God as alive from the dead,
[194]  and your members as weapons of righteousness to God.
[195]  Romans 6:13 I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions
[196]  of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice,
[197]  I can say only that since the Lord died for us and lives for us, the first thing we should do after we overcome is consecrate ourselves.
[198]  If we have not experienced the overcoming life, God will not receive our consecration even if we do consecrate ourselves, because everything we have is from Adam and is dead.
[199]  Consecration is spoken of not only in Romans 6 but also in Romans 12.
[200]  God does not make any move; He waits until one day we say, God, I am Your slave not only because You bought me, but also because I want to be Your slave willingly.
[201]  The first thing we should consecrate is the people we love.
[202]  If a man does not love the Lord more than his parents, wife, children, and friends, he is not worthy to be the Lord s disciple.
[203]  If you have consecrated yourself to the Lord, there should be no one in this world that can occupy your heart and nothing that can capture your heart any longer.
[204]  God saves you in order to gain you wholly.
[205]  God has given Christ to us as our overcoming life so that we would not only know His will but also obey it.
[206]  After she died, I found the following note in her Bible next to the verse You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind Matt 22:37 : Lord, I thank You that there is such a commandment.
[207]  We have to consecrate not only people and affairs but also all objects.
[208]  There are people who have to consecrate their jewelry.
[209]  Others may have houses or clothing they have to consecrate.
[210]  Some may have only a very small thing to consecrate, but they cannot allow this small thing to become a hindrance to them.
[211]  There is nothing legal about this, but if we want to live a consecrated life, gold ornaments probably have to go, fashionable clothes have to go, and perhaps our money has to go.
[212]  The first day we take home our wages, we should tell the Lord, God, all of this money is Yours.
[213]  But I would say that if we have truly consecrated everything to God, what is consecrated belongs to God.
[214]  The first result is described in Romans 6, and the second result is described in Romans 12.
[215]  Many people do not know the difference between the two.
