 <h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S COVENANT</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;A new covenant&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 8:8).</p>
<p>God saved us not only because of His love, by His grace, and according to His righteousness but also through His covenant. Through the blood shed by the Lord Jesus, God made a covenant with us to save us (Matt. 26:28). His covenant with us is based upon His faithfulness. His faithfulness causes Him to keep His covenant and to be bound by this covenant. Based on this covenant, He must save us, and He must save us to the uttermost.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;I will not profane My covenant, / Nor will I change what has gone forth from My lips&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 89:34).</p>
<p>God is faithful, and His faithfulness will not fail (v. 33). He will not profane His covenant or change His word. Since He saves us according to His established covenant, according to His word in the New Testament, our salvation cannot be changed. Our salvation is secure and solid because of His covenant and the word of His covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S POWER</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:29; see also Psa. 89:13).</p>
<p>Our Father is greater than all, so His power is greater than all, and no one can snatch us out of His hand. Therefore, according to His power, our salvation is secure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:28).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s life, which is the eternal life, entered into us and brought us into an eternal relationship with God, a relationship of life that we can never break. Since the life of God is eternal, our life relationship with God is also eternal. His eternal life is in us, keeping us from perishing forever and making our salvation eternally secure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL BEING</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;With whom is no variation or shadow cast by turning&rdquo;</strong> (James 1:17).</p>
<p>God will not change; He does not even cast a shadow by turning. Since our salvation is out of such a One, how can it change?</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;For I, Jehovah, do not change; therefore you...are not consumed&rdquo;</strong> (Mal. 3:6).</p>
<p>We are not consumed because God does not change. Our salvation is eternally secure because God&rsquo;s being never changes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:34).</p>
<p>Who can erase the eternal efficacy of the redemption of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection and make His intercession for us of no effect? No one can. No one can ever condemn us again. Our salvation is secure.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 7:25).</p>
<p>The Lord is always interceding for us, and He is able to save us to the uttermost.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;He became...the source of eternal salvation&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 5:9).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eternal salvation&rdquo;! How sure is this phrase! Moreover, this verse says that the Lord Himself is the source of eternal salvation. Just as He is eternally unchanging, our salvation is eternally unchanging.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;By one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 10:14).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfected forever&rdquo;! How certain is this phrase! The Lord accomplished redemption once, perfecting us forever. Therefore, we receive His redemption once and are eternally saved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S POWER</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;No one shall snatch them out of My hand&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:28).</p>
<p>No one can snatch us out of the Lord&rsquo;s powerful hand, which is the hand of God. His powerful hand makes us eternally secure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S PROMISE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out&rdquo;</strong> (John 6:37).</p>
<p>The Lord promised that He would not cast out any who come to Him. This promise guarantees that our salvation is eternally secure. In His Word God shows that once we are saved, we have eternal salvation, we are perfected forever, and we will never perish. This is our eternal security. Verses such as John 15:2 and 6, Romans 11:22, Galatians 5:4, Hebrews 6:4-6, and 10:26-27 do not refer to perishing after our salvation; they refer to the consequences in this age of not living according to the Lord&rsquo;s life in our salvation.</p>
