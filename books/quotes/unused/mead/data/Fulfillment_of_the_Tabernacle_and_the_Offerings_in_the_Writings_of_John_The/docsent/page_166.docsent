   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Coming through the Son's Death and Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 16:7 indicates that the Spirit of reality comes through the Son's death and resurrection: "I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have pointed out, in these chapters of the Gospel of John, the Lord uses His going to denote His death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Son came through incarnation, but the Spirit comes through the Son's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Receiving All That Is of the Son to Disclose It to the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit of reality receives all that is of the Son in order to disclose it to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Regarding this, the Lord Jesus says, "He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All that the Father has is Mine; therefore I said that He receives of Mine and shall disclose it to you" John 16:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All that the Father is and has is embodied in the Son Col 2:9 , and all that the Son is and has is revealed as reality to the believers through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the Spirit of reality reveals to the believers all that the Son is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that our understanding of the Son is by the Spirit, who has received whatever the Son is and then reveals this to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To Testify concerning the Son and to Glorify Him</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have already pointed out that the Spirit testifies concerning the Son and glorifies Him John 15:26; 16:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we would point out that, in particular, this is a function of the Spirit of reality, who comes through the Son's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because the Spirit of reality testifies concerning the Son and glorifies the Son, we know the Son through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To Guide the Believers into All the Reality</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In John 16:13 we see that the Spirit of reality guides us into all the reality: "But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Spirit of reality guides the believers into all the reality of the Triune God and of all divine matters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit of reality guides us into the reality of justification, holiness, love, and all other divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He leads us into, brings us into, the reality of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To Convict the World concerning Sin, Righteousness, and Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 16:8-11 reveals that the Spirit of reality convicts the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment: "And having come, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer behold Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit always convicts the world, that is, mankind, concerning the three matters of sin, righteousness, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sin entered through Adam Rom 5:12 , righteousness is the resurrected Christ 1 Cor 1:30 , and judgment is for Satan, who is the author and source of sin John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We were born of sin in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be freed from sin, the only way is to believe in Christ the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we believe in Him, He will be righteousness to us, and we shall be justified in Him Rom 3:24; 4:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do not repent of the sin in Adam and believe in Christ the Son of God, we shall remain in sin and share the judgment of Satan for eternity Matt 25:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 16:8-11, the convicting work of the Spirit is related to three persons: Adam, Christ, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all became fallen in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But we may believe in Christ and be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because Christ was accepted by God in His death, God raised Him up from among the dead, and now He becomes righteousness to all who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Satan, the source of sin, has been judged and destroyed through Christ's death Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The three main items in these three verses are related to these three persons: sin is related to Adam, righteousness is related to Christ, and judgment is related to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We were born of Adam, but we have believed in Christ and have received Him as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All those who do not believe in Christ will suffer the judgment of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because they remain followers of Satan, they will have the same destiny as Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hallelujah, we have believed in Christ, and we have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No longer are we followers of Satan, and our destiny certainly will not be the same as his.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit came to us to convict us of sin, righteousness, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We repented, believed in the Lord Jesus, and escaped the judgment that is upon Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We also became children of God and members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we can be filled and saturated with the Triune God, who is dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us.</S>
