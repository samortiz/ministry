   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 4 DAY 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 5:23-25, 27-29</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>23 Therefore if you are offering your 1 gift at the 2 altar and there you remember that your brother has 3 something against you,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>24 Leave your gift there before the altar, and 1 first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>25 Be well disposed 1 quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him 2 on the way, lest the opponent 3 deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>27 You have heard that it was said, "You shall not commit adultery."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>28 But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his 1 heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>29 So if your right eye stumbles you, 1 pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>23 1 A sacrifice, such as the sacrifice for sin, is for dealing with sin, whereas a gift is for fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>23 2 The altar was a piece of furniture Exo 27:1-8 in the outer court of the temple 1 Kings 8:64 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the altar all the sacrifices and gifts were offered Lev 1:9, 12, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In decreeing the new law of the kingdom, the King referred here to the gift and altar of the old dispensation because during the period of His ministry on earth, a transitional period, the ritual law of the old dispensation had not yet come to an end. In the four Gospels, before His death and resurrection, in matters regarding the outward circumstances, the Lord treated His disciples as Jews according to the old law, whereas in matters concerning spirit and life, He considered them believers, constituents of the church, according to the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>23 3 Something against you here must refer to an offense caused by the anger or scolding in v. 22.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>24 1 We must first be reconciled to our brother so that our remembrance of the offense can be removed and our conscience can be void of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we can come and offer our gift to the Lord and fellowship with Him with a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The King of the kingdom will never allow two brothers who are not reconciled to each other either to share the kingdom in its reality or to reign in its manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>25 1 Be well disposed quickly, lest you die, your opponent die, or the Lord come back, thus leaving you no opportunity to be reconciled to your opponent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>25 2 On the way signifies that we are still living in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>25 3 This will take place at the judgment seat of Christ when He comes back 2 Cor 5:10; Rom 14:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The judge will be the Lord, the officer will be the angel, and the prison will be the place of discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>28 1 The law of the old dispensation deals with the outward act of adultery, whereas the new law of the kingdom deals with the inward motive of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>29 1 The emphasis of the new law of the kingdom in this verse and in v. 30 indicates the seriousness of sin in relation to the kingdom of the heavens and the need to put away the motive of sin at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The actions described in these verses were not meant to be carried out literally; they can be carried out only spiritually, as revealed in Rom 8:13 and Col 3:5.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must consider the seriousness of such a sin as adultery in relation to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must never be loose about this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As Romans 8:13 reveals, by the Spirit we must "put to death the practices of the body," and, as Colossians 3:5 says, we must mortify our "members which are on the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the proper way to deal with our sinful members.</S>
