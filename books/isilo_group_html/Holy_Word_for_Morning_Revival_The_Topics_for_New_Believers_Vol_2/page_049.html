<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>Rev. 21:22 And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.</strong></p>
<p><strong>23 And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Temple</h2>
<p>The second item [of the furnishings] is...the temple.<sup>316</sup>We need to consider why the temple is considered a furnishing of the holy city and not part of the structure itself. The structure itself is called the tabernacle of God (21:3). The writer of Revelation tells us that he did not see the temple. Because he was used to the temple, he was looking for it, but he saw no temple. Instead, he saw that the temple was the redeeming God [v. 22].<sup>317</sup> The holy city as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and God and the Lamb as the temple are for us to dwell in. In eternity we will not dwell in a material city; we will dwell in the Triune God.<sup>318</sup> Thus, the redeeming God is not only the basic factor for the structure of the New Jerusalem but also the very central furnishing. We human beings created by God need a temple. Our temple is the redeeming God as a part of the furnishings of the New Jerusalem.<sup>319</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Light and the Lamp</h2>
<p>The last of the furnishings is the light with its shining. The glory of God as the light is in the redeeming Lamb as the lamp.<sup>320</sup> [Revelation] 21:23...indicates that God and the Lamb are one light. God is the content, and the Lamb, Christ, is the light-bearer, the expression.<sup>321</sup></p>
<p>The light of the holy city is the unique eternal divine light in which the redeemed elect live and move within the city, needing not the natural light, the sun and the moon, created by God, nor the artificial light made by man (Rev. 21:23, 25; 22:5a).<sup>322</sup> God Himself, the very divine person, is the light....Such a light needs a lamp, and the Lamb is the lamp of the city....Without the Lamb being the lamp, God&rsquo;s shining over us would &ldquo;kill&rdquo; all of us.<sup>323</sup> However, with the redeeming Christ as the lamp, the divine light does not kill us but instead illumines us. First Timothy 6:16 says that God dwells in unapproachable light. In Christ, though, God becomes approachable.<sup>324</sup> The divine light shines through our Redeemer. [Hence,] this light has become so lovable and touchable, and we even walk in this light (1 John 1:7).<sup>325</sup></p>
<p>The glory of God as the light is in the redeeming Lamb as the lamp shining through this organic building as the light&rsquo;s diffuser. This indicates that the Triune God is one with His redeemed in His expression....In John 14:20 the Lord said to His disciples, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; This shows that the light is in the lamp, and the lamp is in the diffuser. The light is God the Father, the lamp is God the Son, and the diffuser is the Body of Christ, the New Jerusalem, to shine the divine light over the nations, the peoples who live around the New Jerusalem.<sup>326</sup></p>
<h2 class="head2">The New Jerusalem&mdash;Its Supply</h2>
<p>The supply of the New Jerusalem is the river of water of life which proceeds out of the throne of the Triune God, with the tree of life growing on the two sides of the river [Rev. 22:1-2]; the light of life also illuminates the entire city. In eternity God&rsquo;s redeemed will drink of the water of the river of life, eat of the fruit of the tree of life, and walk in the light of life. The light of life signifies the Father (1 John 1:5); the tree of life, the Son [John 11:25; 15:1]; and the water of life, the Spirit (John 7:39). The Triune God becomes the life and enjoyment of His redeemed. He is their content, and they are His expression; they dwell in Him, and He dwells in them.<sup>327</sup> [This] is the New Jerusalem&mdash;the universal incorporation of the union and mingling of divinity with humanity&mdash;the processed and consummated Triune God incorporated with His regenerated, renewed, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite elect.<sup>328</sup></p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Holy Word for Morning Revival, The: Topics for New Believers, Vol. 2 &nbsp; pg 49</div><br></body></html>
