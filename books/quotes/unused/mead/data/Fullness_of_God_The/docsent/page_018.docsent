   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Reading the Word Sequentially, Not Selectively</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When reading the Bible, it is best not to skip around according to our interest; neither should we read the Bible in a religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rather, we should read the Bible sequentially.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every mother knows that a child who is selective in his eating will not be healthy and grow normally.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Children should eat whatever their mother prepares for them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is how mothers in the United States train their children so that they will not be picky in their eating.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to eat healthy food, we must learn not to be picky.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we study the book of Romans, we should begin with chapter 1 verse 1 and then read verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even if we do not understand what we are reading, we should continue in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should spend ten minutes every morning on half a verse or one verse.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Drops of water eventually make a hole in a rock.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You have many days ahead of you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even if you gain very little in one day, in three hundred sixty-five days you will accumulate much.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this way you will complete the entire Recovery Version of the New Testament, including the footnotes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After many years, there will be a result.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I believe that after two years the truths will increase in you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you have a burden to read the Life-study of Romans, you may do so.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You do not necessarily need to read it in the morning; you can read it at other times.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are a few suggestions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Seeing with Our Eyes,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Understanding with Our Mind, and</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Receiving with Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I hope that the young people will remember my words and begin to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To read the Bible is to know, to contact, the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to be clear that doctrine is merely doctrine; it is not the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not merely have the words in the Bible; our Lord is one with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible is the written word of God, and the Lord Jesus is the living word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is God s living word, and the Bible is God s written word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These two must be linked as one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we must read the Bible with a praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not merely understand with our mind; we must use our spirit to touch the words in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our spirit must be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is possible for us to read the Bible on three levels: with our eyes, with our mind, and with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need our eyes to see clearly, our mind to understand, and our spirit to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we read the Bible, we should let the words become our prayer and then continue reading.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Reading and Praying</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Fifteen Minutes Every Morning</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus and the word of God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first line of Hymns, #815 says, Christ is the Word and Spirit too.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ, the Word, and the Spirit are three, yet these three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord is in the Word, and He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, when we read the Bible, on the one hand, we are contacting black and white letters, and on the other hand, we are touching the Lord Jesus with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, the Lord, His word, and the Spirit are mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By enjoying the Lord in this way every morning, we are daily eating healthy food.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am physically healthy mainly because of the breakfast that I eat.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I also urge you to change your physical breakfast habits.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You should eat more for breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is a pity that most young people wake up late in the morning and consider that eating something quickly is breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>People who eat in this way will ultimately have a dull mind, because their food is not healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Likewise, if you are willing to spend five minutes to pray and ten minutes to study the Word every morning, you will be fed every day, and you will be spiritually healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I hope you will daily take Christ as your life, read His word, receive Him, and be mingled with His Spirit.</S>
