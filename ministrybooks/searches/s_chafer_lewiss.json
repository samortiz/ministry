Because of this, the people feel the need for a proper leadership, and they highly esteem their leaders. To some extent the American system is right, although the morality and ethics are wrong. A few well-known Christian leaders have had a success. These include Dwight L. Moody, who founded the Moody Bible Institute, Lewis S. Chafer, who founded Dallas Theological Seminary, and Cyrus I. Scofield, who was very knowledgeable, careful, and diligent in studying the Bible. These men rendered much help to Christians in the United States. "}]}
