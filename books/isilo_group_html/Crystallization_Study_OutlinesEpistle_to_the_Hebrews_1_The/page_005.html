<h1 class="title">Heirs of Salvation,<br />
Partners of Christ as God&rsquo;s Appointed Heir</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 1:2, 9, 14; Rom. 8:17; Heb. 2:1-4</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Son is God&rsquo;s appointed Heir of all things&mdash; Heb. 1:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In His economy God has not only a great operation but also tremendous riches:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God has appointed the Son to be both the Operator and the Heir.</li>
		<li>God has given the Son the authority to do everything in His purpose and the right to inherit all things in His operation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Since the Son is the Heir of God, all that God the Father is and has is His possession&mdash;John 16:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Son was appointed by the Father&mdash;Heb. 1:2.</li>
		<li>The Son was anointed by the Father with the Spirit&mdash;Heb. 1:9.</li>
		<li>The Son was begotten of God in resurrection to be the Firstborn&mdash;Acts 13:33; Rom. 1:3-4; Heb. 1:5.</li>
		<li>The Son, in His exaltation, was inaugurated as Lord and Christ to administrate God&rsquo;s operation&mdash;Acts 2:36.</li>
		<li>The Son was designated the legal Heir to inherit everything in God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;the earth, the kingdom, the throne, and all things&mdash;Psa. 2:8; Dan. 7:13-14; Luke 1:32; Matt. 11:27.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We are saved to be the Son&rsquo;s joint heirs, sharing in His inheritance&mdash;Heb. 1:14; Rom. 8:17; Gal. 4:7; Eph. 3:6; Titus 3:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As the many sons of God and the many brothers of Christ, we have been saved to be the Son&rsquo;s joint heirs&mdash;Heb. 2:10; John 20:17; Rom. 8:29; Gal. 4:7.</li>
	<li>In God&rsquo;s salvation we are not only born of God to be His sons but also made &ldquo;heirs of God&rdquo; and &ldquo;joint heirs with Christ&rdquo;&mdash;Rom. 8:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We are not heirs simply because we are children of God; rather, there is a condition for us to be heirs:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>After being born as children, we need to grow in life to become mature sons&mdash;John 1:12-13; Rom. 8:16, 14.</li>
			<li>We also need to pass through suffering that we may be glorified to become legal heirs&mdash;Rom. 8:17.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In order to become the Son&rsquo;s joint heirs, we need to be born as children of God, grow into maturity, and be legalized.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the Son&rsquo;s joint heirs, we not only inherit salvation but also inherit all things with Him&mdash; 1 Cor. 3:21-22.</li>
	<li>As the Son&rsquo;s joint heirs, we are with Him joint owners of the universe.</li>
	<li>The joint heirs are the partners of the appointed Heir&mdash;Heb. 1:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Since the firstborn Son is God&rsquo;s appointed Heir and we as the many sons of God are His joint heirs, we are His partners.</li>
		<li>In God&rsquo;s economy the Son is the One appointed by God to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan, and we are the Son&rsquo;s partners in the divine interest&mdash;Heb. 3:14.</li>
		<li>The Son was anointed by God, and we share with Him this anointing for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;2 Cor. 1:21.</li>
		<li>Christ is our Joshua, and we are His Calebs, His partners, comrades, and companions&mdash; Num. 14:30.</li>
		<li>We are Christ&rsquo;s partakers and partners&mdash; Heb. 1:9; 6:4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>When we enjoy Him, we are His partakers.</li>
			<li>When we follow Him, we are His partners.</li>
			<li>Being a partaker is for the purpose of being a partner.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The &ldquo;so great a salvation&rdquo; mentioned in Hebrews 2:3 is able to save us to such an extent that it brings us into partnership with the Son in His appointment; thus, we share in whatever He inherits:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Salvation is nothing less than the wonderful person of Christ Himself&mdash;Luke 2:30; 3:6; 19:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ Himself, as the most profound, marvelous, unlimited, immeasurable One, is our salvation.</li>
		<li>For us to be heirs of salvation means that we inherit this profound, marvelous, unlimited, and immeasurable Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;So great a salvation&rdquo; is great in what Christ is:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the Son of God&mdash;Heb. 1:2a.</li>
		<li>As the Son of Man&mdash;Heb. 2:5-9.</li>
		<li>As the Captain of salvation&mdash;Heb. 2:10.</li>
		<li>As the High Priest&mdash;Heb. 2:17; 3:1; 4:14; 5:10; 6:20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;So great a salvation&rdquo; is great in what Christ has done, is doing, and will do:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He made purification of sins&mdash;Heb. 1:3; 7:27.</li>
		<li>He tasted death for us&mdash;Heb. 2:9.</li>
		<li>He destroyed the devil and released us from slavery&mdash;Heb. 2:14-15.</li>
		<li>He is sanctifying us&mdash;Heb. 2:11.</li>
		<li>He is able to help us&mdash;Heb. 2:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;So great a salvation&rdquo; is great in its extent:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It makes us partners of God&rsquo;s appointed Heir&mdash;Heb. 1:2, 9.</li>
		<li>It brings us into glory&mdash;Heb. 2:10.</li>
		<li>It will make us to possess the coming inhabited earth with the firstborn Son&mdash;Heb. 2:5.</li>
		<li>It will save us to the uttermost&mdash;Heb. 7:25.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Concerning &ldquo;so great a salvation&rdquo; we should give heed to it, not drift away from it, and not neglect it&mdash;Heb. 2:1-4.</li>
	</ol></li>
