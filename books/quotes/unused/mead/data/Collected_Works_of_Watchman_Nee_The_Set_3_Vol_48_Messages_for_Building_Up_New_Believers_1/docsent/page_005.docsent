   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lesson Books and Notebooks</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During the training sessions, if a new learner does not have a copy of the book, he will have to take notes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If he has the book, he must read the lesson carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If he comes across anything that he does not understand, he should ask, and everyone should discuss it together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They should consider what the main subject of the lesson is, how many sections it has, what the main points in each section are, and what the crucial words and important teachings in each section are.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They should identify the things that need to be torn down and what needs to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They should study the lesson section by section and ask questions while they listen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then they should go to their respective classes the following Thursday to conduct their own meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Achieving the Objectives</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In delivering a lesson, the main goal is not to help the new believers understand more teachings but to do some carving work on them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One should pay attention to the areas that require carving; he should know what needs to be torn down and what needs to be added.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These lessons should serve as tools to build up the believers and to make new persons out of them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of course, in order to achieve the desired objective, the leading ones first must be dealt with in the area they are speaking about.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, their speaking will not be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They will only speak vain words, and these words will be powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone who is responsible for the new believers meeting should pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Dividing Up the Classes</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a church has very few new believers or if there are not enough speakers, there is no need to divide the new believers into classes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In such cases one person should simply bear the responsibility of teaching these lessons, followed by questions, week after week.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if a church has many new believers, these believers should be divided into smaller classes and should be trained separately.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Division of classes can be according to geography or level of understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Adjust according to the local practical need.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If there is an adequate number of leaders, the classes can range from a few persons to perhaps a dozen or so.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In dividing up the classes, one should pay attention to the following points:</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paying Attention to the Students</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose one class has a relatively high standard of literacy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should arrange to have stronger ones teach such a class.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If another class consists of those with a lower standard of literacy, the leading one in the class should be experienced in teaching the truth in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once we have the right kind of students for the right teachers, the leading ones will not find it difficult to teach, and the audience will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Not Using the Textbook</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In some places only the leaders have the book.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this case everyone in the audience should carry a notebook and write down the crucial points and the subject of every portion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In some classes the new believers may be illiterate or semi- literate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In such circumstances there is no need to pass out the book.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The leading one should pick out at least one crucial verse and read it to the audience again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He should also ask them to repeat it after him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then he should explain the main points of the lesson to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He should ask them if they understand the lesson and give them the opportunity to ask questions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Using the Textbook</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In places where the textbook is used, everyone should be given a copy during the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The leader should help the new believers read the lesson together or take turns reading it section by section.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The leading one should ask questions as he moves along, and the listeners should also feel free to ask questions as they listen.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes the listeners can be asked to say something, but their speaking has to be brief and should not occupy too much time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This will make the meeting more lively.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Try your best to avoid lectures or sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who can take notes should prepare a notebook and write down the important points throughout the course of the lesson.</S>
