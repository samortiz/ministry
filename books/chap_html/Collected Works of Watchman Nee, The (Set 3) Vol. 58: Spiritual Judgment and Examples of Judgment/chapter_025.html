D.</h2><p>I was born into a Buddhist family. At one time I was a Buddhist monk. At the age of eight or nine I began to love chanting, and at the age of ten I began to listen to Buddhist sermons in the temple. I knew that the world is evil, and I desired to reach Nirvana and to save all beings. I was a monk for nine years. My brother was a businessman and had been a Christian for over ten years. His whole family believed in the Lord, and they sent me gospel literature many times, hoping that I would believe in the Lord. Once an elderly believer spoke with me at length about the gospel. When he began to pray, his expression reminded me of heaven. I felt that there is indeed a true God in this universe. Later my brother wrote me and told me that my father and family had all believed in the Lord. My mother was sick and no doctor could cure her, but through prayer she was healed. At that time I saw that Buddhism is a big mess. I was vomiting blood. I began to ask God to heal me. A few days later my vomiting stopped, and I accepted the Lord Jesus. After I was saved, I sought the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Once while I was praying, I became acutely aware of my extraordinary sins and peculiar disposition. I wept bitterly for half an hour, after which I felt happy inside. One Buddhist teacher that I used to learn from came and visited me and demanded that I immediately answer whom I would choose, Christ or Buddha. I told him that I wanted Christ. After I was saved, I was like a madman for half a year. I was intensely zealous, and I preached the gospel to whomever I met.</p><p>At one point I began to come under Satan's attacks and fell into darkness. I argued with Satan. He accused me regarding the many sins I committed as a youth. I dealt with my sins and placed them under the cleansing of the precious blood of the Lord one by one. My heart loves the Lord and I desire to go into the villages to preach the gospel and to suffer for Him. The Lord said that I have to give up everything to follow Him. Formerly, I dared not say this, but now I do. Once I was sick, but I did not take any medicine. God alone has been sustaining me. For seven or eight years I did not receive any financial support from my family or from the church. I taught in a village and supported myself this way. In 1941 I was introduced to Brother Nee through Brother Ji Yung-tung, and I was told that I could go to Shanghai to be trained. I have written a note of consecration and have handed over myself and my all to Him. I weep and repent often for the years that I have wasted. I hope that my brother will grant me much light.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Purging Rawness</h2><p>Two or three months ago, while I was in a prayer meeting in the church in Shanghai, I met our brother for the first time. This is the second time I have seen him. Brother Shia has to learn to launch his spirit further into deeper depths in God. He has to learn to grow and be matured. When a man first begins his pursuit in God, everything with him is raw and "uncooked." Anything that is raw needs to be cooked. In our pursuit of the Lord, we have to drop what is raw. Before a person believes in the Lord, everything with him is raw. Even his righteousness and morality are raw. His entire living is raw. But after he has followed the Lord and learned some lessons for a while, the raw things drop off. The deeper the cross works on a person, whomever he may be, the less raw he becomes. God grants us sufferings and chastisements not only to afflict us but to remove our rawness. Every time we go through trials, sufferings, or chastisements, we should reap some benefit not merely in our thoughts, feelings, or emotions; our spirit should be purified through these processes as well. Our brother's spirit is scarcely touched. We only find the fruit of the mind and the emotion in him; we find very little fruit of the spirit. This is the basic problem. Every experience should purify a man's spirit. Two of the Lord's disciples asked Him to send fire to burn up the cities of Samaria, but the Lord told them that they did not know their spirit. Our brother's trouble is that he does not know his spirit. Many people can talk. They are zealous, and they have pure motives, but they never know their spirit. It is not enough to have fruit in the emotion and to realize that the Lord is love. Love comes from the emotion, while teaching comes from the mind. But the spirit needs frequent dealings before it can be purified.</p>
