AND YOUNG PEOPLE&rsquo;S WORK<br />

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 22:12, 20; Luke 18:16-17; 2 Tim. 3:15; 1:5; 2:2</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>We all need to know what age we are in, what the present revelation is from God, where we should be, what we should do, and what flow we should enter into; time is short, and the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is approaching&mdash;Rev. 22:12, 20; cf. Matt. 24:37-39; 2 Tim. 3:1-3.</li>
<li>We cannot continue to work as we have in the past; in the past we neglected the work with the children and the young people, and we highly regarded a general work&mdash;Luke 18:16-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Your eyes have to be open. Do not be too busy outwardly. You should work on the young people, the junior highers, and the high schoolers. You should also work on the children until each week there are at least ten thousand children being taught by us. Those who are six or seven years old now will be high schoolers in ten years. If you are willing to do this, you can definitely succeed&rdquo;&mdash;<em>The Ultimate Significance of the Golden Lampstand,</em> p. 55.</li>
	<li>No family will disregard its children; as a priority a family looks after its children, raises them, and teaches them; hence, we must serve the many children in God&rsquo;s family&mdash;2 Tim. 3:15; 1:5.</li>
	<li>All the churches must have a children&rsquo;s work; if we work with these children, they will all be young brothers and sisters after six to seven years.</li>
	<li>The co-workers must lead the church to receive a burden for the children&rsquo;s work; the church should concentrate its effort on this work.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must let God open our eyes to see the preciousness of the young people and their importance in God&rsquo;s hands&mdash;cf. Dan. 1:2, 4; 2 Tim. 2:2; 1 Tim. 4:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In whatever a person does, the most important thing is to have a heart&mdash;2 Cor. 6:11; Col. 3:23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If you want to do this work, you must like the young people, care for them, and be concerned about their affairs; this may be considered the minimum &ldquo;capital&rdquo; required for the young people&rsquo;s work&mdash;Matt. 19:14.</li>
		<li>If you have no interest in the young people and have no heart for them, doing the young people&rsquo;s work only out of reluctance, then it is useless&mdash;v. 13.</li>
		<li>Some brothers and sisters are doing the young people&rsquo;s work out of their preference, but it is not weighty enough to do the young people&rsquo;s work with such a heart&mdash;1 Kings 4:29.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we see the importance and value of a certain matter, then spontaneously we have a heart for it&mdash;2 Tim. 2:2; cf. 1 Thes. 3:8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The future of the church hinges on the young people&mdash;2 Tim. 2:2; cf. Deut. 1:38:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If we read through the Bible carefully, we will discover a fact: it is not easy to find a case showing that God called an old person to do a new thing or a thing of great consequence&mdash;1 Sam. 3:1, 4; Dan. 1:4, 8; Matt. 4:18-20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We can say that virtually everyone used by God to begin a new thing or chosen by God to turn the age was a young man&mdash;Deut. 1:38.</li>
		<li>Nearly every work that the young people were called by God to do was a work that turned the age; for the carrying out of all these works of great consequences, God always called young men&mdash;1 Sam. 3:1, 4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>For usefulness in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom, and for the propagation of the Lord&rsquo;s work, the responsibility undoubtedly falls on the shoulders of the young people&mdash;cf. Acts 2:14-41.</li>
	<li>If the Lord delays His coming back for five, ten, fifteen, or twenty years and He wants to accomplish something, the commission will have to be entrusted to the young people&mdash;Matt. 24:14; 28:19-20; 2 Tim. 2:2; 4:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Nevertheless, the conditions today, such as the &ldquo;greenness of the crops,&rdquo; the desolation of the church, and the scarcity of overcomers, tell us that the Lord cannot come back so soon&mdash;1 Tim. 4:1-5; 2 Tim. 3:1-13.</li>
		<li>Therefore, seeing such a situation, we believe that there may be still a considerable amount of time in which the Lord wants to accomplish something on the earth&mdash;2 Pet. 3:9.</li>
		<li>Twenty years from now those who will be useful to the Lord are those who are in their twenties or younger today&mdash;2 Tim. 3:14-15, 17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>There must be a group of young people who are saved to receive proper spiritual help today so that they can gain the experience and be used by the Lord in the future&mdash;2:2.</li>
			<li>If there are no young people gained by the Lord today, after our departure there will be no one to succeed us; then there will be a gap&mdash;cf. Deut. 1:37-38.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>If there are young brothers and sisters raised up by the Lord, and if we are preserved to give them an absolutely positive leading instead of erroneous limitations, then there is no need to wait until the Lord takes us away; even today they can become useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hands&mdash;2 Tim. 3:10; 1 Cor. 16:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The future of the work and the usefulness in the future, no doubt, are with the young people; from the view of the future of the work, we should put our emphasis on the younger ones&mdash;cf. Deut. 1:38.</li>
	</ol></li>
