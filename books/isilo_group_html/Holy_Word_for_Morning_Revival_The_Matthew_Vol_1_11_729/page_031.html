In the Acts and the Epistles there is no example of such reciting.</p><p>9<sup>2</sup> In the example of prayer given as a pattern by the Lord, the first three petitions imply the Trinity of the Godhead: &#8220;Your name be sanctified&#8221; is related mainly to the Father; &#8220;Your kingdom come,&#8221; to the Son; and &#8220;Your will be done,&#8221; to the Spirit. This is being fulfilled in this age, and it will be ultimately fulfilled in the coming kingdom age, when the name of God will be excellent in all the earth (Psa. 8:1), the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of Christ (Rev. 11:15), and the will of God will be accomplished.</p><p>10<sup>1</sup> After the rebellion of Satan (Ezek. 28:17; Isa. 14:13-15), the earth fell into his usurping hand. Thus, the will of God could not be done on earth as in heaven. Hence, God created man with the intention of recovering the earth for Himself (Gen. 1:26-28). After the fall of man, Christ came to bring the heavenly rule to earth so that the earth could be recovered for God&#8217;s interest, so that the will of God could be done on earth as in heaven. This is why the new King established the kingdom of the heavens with His followers. The kingdom people must pray for this until the earth is fully recovered for God&#8217;s will in the coming kingdom age.</p><p>11<sup>1</sup> This prayer, as a pattern, cares first for God&#8217;s name, God&#8217;s kingdom, and God&#8217;s will, and second, for our need.</p><p>11<sup>2</sup> Or, bread until tomorrow, bread for this day. Daily bread indicates a living that is by faith. The kingdom people should not live on what they have stored; rather, they should live, by faith, on the Father&#8217;s daily supply.</p><p>12<sup>1</sup> This prayer, as a pattern, cares, third, for the kingdom people&#8217;s failures before God and for their relationship with others. The kingdom people should ask the Father to forgive their debts, their failures, their trespasses, as they forgive their debtors to maintain peace.</p><p>13<sup>1</sup> Or, evil. This prayer, as a pattern, cares, fourth, for the kingdom people&#8217;s deliverance from the evil one and from evil things. The kingdom people should ask the Father not to bring them into temptation but to deliver them from the evil one, the devil, and from the evil that is out of him.</p><p>16<sup>1</sup> To fast is not to refrain from eating; it is to be unable to eat because of a desperate burden to pray for certain things. It is also an expression of self-humbling in seeking God&#8217;s mercy. To give alms is to give what we have the right to possess, whereas to fast is to give up what we have the right to enjoy.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>In verses 9 through 13 we find the pattern of prayer; however,...not...for all prayers....In John chapters fourteen through seventeen...the prayer...is related to life.... The prayer in Matthew 6 concerns the kingdom....It is a fighting prayer, a prayer of warfare against God&#8217;s enemy for God&#8217;s kingdom.
