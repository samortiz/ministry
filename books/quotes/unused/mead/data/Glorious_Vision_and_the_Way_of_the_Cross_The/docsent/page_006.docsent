   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE GLORIOUS VISION AND THE WAY OF THE CROSS 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 16:24-26; Luke 9:57-62; Phil 3:10; Rev 1:9; Acts 20:24; 2 Tim 4:7-8; 1 Cor 9:27; Heb 12:1-3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapter we covered the glorious vision.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we move on to talk about the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Where there is a vision, there is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The glorious vision always leads us onto a way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we have the seeing, there must also be the walking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This walk is the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE MEANING OF THE CROSS PRIMARILY BEING "NO MORE I"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many people equate the cross with suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, the cross is not primarily a matter of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During the fifteenth century, Thomas Kempis wrote the book The Imitation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In China, this book was soon translated into Chinese by the Catholics.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There was a thorough discussion of the cross in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the whole subject was distorted in that it considered the cross a kind of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even Madame Guyon was under this book's influence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We know that in the New Testament, the primary meaning of the cross is not to suffer but to be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a person is nailed on the cross, there is not merely the suffering but also execution.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The very person is removed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The New Testament shows us that the first one to be crucified was the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When men crucified Him on the cross, not only did He suffer, He was being done away with.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hymns, #622 says:</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we take up the cross, will we but suffer pain?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nay, if we bear the cross, be sure that we will die!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The meaning of the cross is that we may be slain; The cross experienced the self will crucify.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once we have seen the vision, the vision will surely send us on the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The emphasis of such a way is not suffering but being "no more I."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The way of the cross is the way of being no more I. Those who are on this way have all put themselves aside.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is only Christ, and there is only God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>TO DENY THE SELF BEING TO ALLOW THE LORD TO BE THE PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many of you are married.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Marriage makes the living of two persons one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before you are married, you can make whatever suggestions you want.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But after you are married, you cannot do so as easily.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Marriage life requires the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The husband needs to die, and the wife also needs to die.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If so, then who will live?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ lives and God lives.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All over the world, it is difficult to find a couple which really lives as one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The wonderful thing about us who believe in the Lord is that after we have received the Lord as our life, there are now two persons in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We ourselves are one person, and the Lord is another person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Who then has the say?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I want to impress you that the meaning of the cross is the putting aside of you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By the cross, your whole being and your whole life is being put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the New Testament, the self is frequently mentioned and the soul is also.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we compare Luke 9 with Matthew 16, we can see that the self and the soul both point to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Matthew the soul is mentioned 16:26 , whereas in Luke the self is mentioned 9:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, the soul is the self, and the self is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have a hymn concerning denying the self, and we also have a hymn concerning denying the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>More than twenty years ago, there was a brother who objected to one of the hymns I had written.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He said that it was wrong to deny the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to this brother, the soul is the person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once you deny the soul, there will be no more you, that is, you will no longer live.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He did not know that to deny the soul in the Bible is not to deny the functions of the soul, that is, the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, it is to deny the person of the soul and the life of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It does not mean that you will not function anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, it means that it is no longer you who live.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the one hand, the New Testament tells you to deny your soul and your person.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But on the other hand, you still need to act.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, your acting is different from before.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Previously when you acted, you yourself were the master.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It was you who was the person.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now this person of yours is hung on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is no longer you as the person but the Lord as the person.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"I have been crucified with Christ" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To be crucified on the cross is to be brought to the end. Now it is no longer I who live but Christ living in me.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although the person and the life of my soul has been denied, the function of my soul still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I still have the mind, the emotion, and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is only the master who controls all these functions who has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is no longer I but Christ who lives.</S>
