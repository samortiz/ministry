<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>All the Local Churches<br>Being the One Body of Christ<br>Separated by the Localities of Their Existence, but Still Expressing the Same One Body,<br>Not Respectively but Corporately</H2><P>It is a wonderful thing to be saved, to have the divine life. When we received the divine life, that was marvelous. But that divine life in us brought us to the local church. It brought us to meet with the Christians in our locality to stand there as a testimony for God in that locality. But still, there is more than just the local churches. The local churches individually do not express the Body of Christ. But when the local churches come together to be coordinated and knit together, there is the expression of the Body; there is the expression of the one new man on the earth. We are not merely for our locality. We are not individual Christians, and we are not even individual churches; we are the Body of Christ. We are the one new man.</P><P>We need to see that all the local churches are the one Body of Christ separated by the localities of their existence but still expressing the same one Body, not respectively but corporately. All the local churches are the one Body of Christ, and they are separated from one another only by the localities in which they exist. Otherwise, there is no separation in the Body of Christ. In our human body there is no separation of our hand from our foot, except that they are located in different places in the body. Likewise, the local churches are separated from one another only because they exist in different geographical locations. However, all the churches have the same life, the same nature, the same essence, the same element, the same source, and the same Triune God. Just as the Triune God cannot be divided, so the local churches as the Body of Christ cannot be divided.</P><P>The local churches are separated by the localities of their existence, but they express the same one Body; and they do this not respectively but corporately. Collectively, corporately, the churches express the Body of Christ. In each locality there is some expression of the Body, but each local church, respectively, is still only a part of the Body. God desires to have the whole Body expressed. For this we need to come together to be blended together, to be knit together, and to be coordinated so that God can have His unique expression. When God has His expression, both He and we are satisfied.</P>
