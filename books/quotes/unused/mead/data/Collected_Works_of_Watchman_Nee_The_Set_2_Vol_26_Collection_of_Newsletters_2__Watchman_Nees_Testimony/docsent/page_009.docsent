   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRAVELS OF THE CO-WORKERS IN P'ING YANG</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To our two brothers in the Lord, Watchman and Witness:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How have you been recently?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Are you still in Shanghai in the heat of the summer, or have you gone someplace to get away from the heat?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We, the co-workers here, think about you often.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You must be thinking of us just as we think of you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, we want to tell you something of our recent experiences and what the Lord has charged us with in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We hope you will not forget to pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our Lord is to be praised because while we were walking in error, He called us and led us back so that we would walk according to His way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the Lord's special grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, most of the leaders of the denominations do not understand us; they have accused us again and again before the magistrate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They have used violent words to threaten our weak brothers and sisters, but the Lord's solid foundation has been laid.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No one can tear it down.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thank and praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this situation with enemies on all sides, the Lord gave us a new call to remember the souls of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For the past few years, we were busy with internal affairs and almost neglected to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this reason, we, the few useless ones, have been gathered together by the Holy Spirit to begin a gospel preaching work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On July 19 we began our journey from Fang Yen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We wanted to go to the areas around Pei Kang to preach the gospel, but during those few days it was constantly raining and the river flooded.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The steamboats on both sides of the river could not run.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We had to wait for the next day to take a sailboat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Unexpectedly, the boat was stopped in the middle of the river by flooding torrents, and we could not reach our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We were forced to leave the boat and go ashore to continue our journey in the rain until dusk.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We spent the night in a China Inland Mission chapel because one of our neighbors was working there as a teacher .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the rain stopped the next day, the flood waters had not receded.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we had to take a detour over the hills and mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We finally arrived in a place called He Hsi around noon and rested at an inn.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There was another place about five miles away called Hsia Hsi where several of our brothers and sisters meet in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We wanted to get there to break bread and remember the Lord on the Lord's Day, but the flood still had not receded, and we could not go on.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We had to stay at the inn until the water went down.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That afternoon, Brother Ts'ai passed out gospel tracts on the street and preached the gospel from door to door.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many people heard the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the people in the denomination were very unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A young believer came to our lodging and solemnly told us, "Now the government has made a declaration that you are not allowed to disturb our church."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later a preacher walked past our hotel, and a woman called to him, "Mr. So-and-so, these guests are also preachers; why don't you give them hospitality in the church building?" The preacher raised his head and looked, but he did not say a word; instead, he raised his head high and walked away.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was suffering persecution for the Lord's name, so our hearts were very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the evening, we preached the gospel to a few people at the inn and then went to bed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The next day the Lord's Day , the water had not completely receded, but the road was only covered with water up to a man's knees, so we proceeded with difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We wanted to hurry to a place where the brothers met to break bread, so we carried our luggage on our backs and carefully plodded along.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While we were walking, there was a deep drainage ditch next to the road, and Brother Chen unexpectedly lost his footing and fell in!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The water was rushing along, and the ditch was very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Fortunately, the Lord's hand held him up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We pulled him out unharmed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even his suitcase was not damaged when we pulled it out of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We really thank the Lord unceasingly for His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we got to Hsia Hsi, the brothers' hospitality in the Lord's love was very warm.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We spent the Lord's Day there.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Beginning the next day from Monday to Friday we had gospel meetings every evening.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>During the days we had a few edifying meetings for those in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We preached the gospel by first printing red announcements that had the time, date, place, and an invitation to come hear the gospel on one side and John 3:16 on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The brothers took these announcements and delivered them door to door.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the evening the brothers went out to invite them again and pull them in. In this way we surprised the entire population of the village of Hsia Hsi.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They all came, both men and women.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All the seats were filled.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is often very difficult for unbelievers to remain quiet in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But the Lord was among us, and He stretched out His powerful arm so that the whole audience listened quietly and solemnly from beginning to end without a single interruption.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many people in this place are Catholic.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They came every time to hear the preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One Catholic head of a household locked his house up and brought the entire family to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He also gave us some things for the use of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our meeting place was small, and there were not enough chairs; some of the people who came to hear the messages brought their own chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After the message, they carried the chairs home.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although they listened until the middle of the night, they did not act tired.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord was indeed drawing people to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We thank and praise Him!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On Saturday afternoon, we left the brothers, sisters, and new gospel friends in Hsia Hsi and walked thirty-five miles to Shan Men Street.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is a meeting there which recently left the denominations to meet in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They knew that we would come on that day, so they had made early and good preparations for our room and board.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Four or five brothers also walked eight or nine miles along the road to welcome us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Once we got to the meeting place, we felt the Lord's grace and love enveloping us on all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our hearts really felt sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>That afternoon the brothers went out as usual to preach the gospel and pass out announcements and tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the evening, one hundred people came to listen to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This time Brother Ts'ai got up to speak the message.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He was blessed with power by the Lord, so the listeners were very moved.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, we did not make them sign their names.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We do not like to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The next day was the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the morning, there was an edification meeting for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the afternoon, we spoke on the necessity and meaning of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After the meeting, five brothers and four sisters went to the river with us and were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the evening there should have been a table meeting, but because many people came to the meeting to hear the gospel, we had to preach the gospel to them first.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>After the crowd left, we had a table meeting late at night.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The spiritual atmosphere in this table meeting was very thick.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We all felt as if we had ascended to the heavens and seen the Lord face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>On July 30 Monday we rested during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In the evening, we preached the gospel outside in front of Brother Lee Shu Jen's house because the house was too small.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Brother Lee had already contacted all his relatives, neighbors, and clan.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>By evening there was a great number of people gathered together for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The topic of that message was John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>After hearing the message, all the people were filled with joy because they knew that God loved them.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>On July 31 Tuesday we left Shan Men Street and walked for thirty miles to Shun Hsi.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>There are more than one thousand homes in this place.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The population is about five thousand, but there are only five who believe in the Lord, counting both men and women.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>These five believed last spring when Lee Shu Jen, Hsu Chi Jen, and other brothers went there to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We spent six days there.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In the mornings of the first three days, we rested.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In the afternoons, we preached the gospel door to door and passed out announcements inviting them to come hear the gospel in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The last three days we had meetings with the brothers in the morning and evening.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>They were for the edification of those who had already believed and those who had believed in the past three days.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In the evening we still had a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We really thank the Lord for those six evenings of gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He first prepared a large house for us.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We only rented a small part of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We borrowed the courtyard and the halls around it.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It could hold one thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This solved the problem of overcrowdedness.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Every afternoon the brothers went out to pass out announcements.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>In the evening they went out again to invite people in. If some did not want to come in, we very politely pulled them in. Every evening there were more than one hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Sometimes a few hundred people came to hear the message.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We did not speak anything to them but Jesus Christ and His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Sometimes we also mentioned the coming judgment or the signs of the end times.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>God did a great work through His own Word.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Every evening after the meeting, there were always a few who stayed there and would not leave.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We spoke or prayed with them, or we asked them to stay for a snack, and then they received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>On the last day of our work there the Lord's Day , the new believers came and worshipped together with us and became our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If He does not draw people, what can His useless servants do?</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>May many sinners be saved and the Lord's name be glorified more!</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Our hearts were satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>On August 6 Monday we left Shun Hsi.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>We were going to go to Chu Hsi.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The brothers accompanied us for several miles out of town and said good-by to us in a pavilion.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>We picked up our luggage and went ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Unexpectedly, a farmer in his thirties came up to us and wanted to carry our luggage for us.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>We did not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>When we asked him why he wanted to carry the luggage, he said, "I was not able to hear you preach during the few days that you were in my town of Shun Hsi.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>I was just leaving to come and hear you last night when something came up and I could not do what I wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>This morning I heard you were leaving, and I was very sad.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>So I came here especially to carry your luggage for you and walk with you for awhile.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>This way I can hear your doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Please talk to me while we walk."</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Our hearts were filled with heavenly joy when we saw this.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>On the way we told him about man's sin, the punishment for sin, and the salvation of Christ's cross.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>We walked for more than ten miles through the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>After about one and a half hours, this friend left us.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>At that time he confessed Jesus as Lord and knew that the Lord Jesus had taken away all his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>We stood on that mountaintop praying with him.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Thank the Lord, this person got saved!</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>After he left we continued ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>We arrived in Chu Hsi around noon.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>There are more than ten brothers and sisters in the Lord's name here.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>We stayed for two days.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>There were gospel meetings both evenings.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>More than one hundred sinners heard the Lord's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>May the Lord bless His messages so that many may be saved from among the listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>We left Chu Hsi on the eighth and walked twelve miles to Ting P'u T'ou.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Brother Wang Yu T'ing was there.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>We met with Brother Wang Yu T'ing and Brother Chang Wu Sheng and the other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>Our spirits were very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>However, our bodies were a little weak, so we rested there.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>We will not go into any more details.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>We only hope you pray.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Your brothers in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>Chen Hsiang, Ts'ai Ch'i</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>Wang Ch'ung Hsin, Lee Shu Jen, Chin Tze Fang</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>August 13, 1934</S>
