In the record of the same instance in Luke it says, "And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings..." (Luke 9:28). What is the difference? Really there is no difference. It was six full days. But according to the Jewish calendar you may also say it was eight days, including the last part of the first day and the first part of the last day. In any case, the meaning here is a period of one week&#151;a week after the event referred to in chapter 16. A week is a specific turn of time, just as a full day is also a turn of time. A month and also a year with its four seasons are other turns of time. To see something of the Lord, we all need a turn of time. It does not depend upon you. Suppose that this morning you have missed the sun rising: you must wait for another turn of time, you must wait until the next morning before you will have another chance to see it. Suppose you have missed a sight of the full moon in these days: you cannot hope to see it within just a few days; you must wait until next month for another turn of time. Suppose you have missed the sight of the cherry trees blossoming this spring: you cannot hope to see such a sight in the summer, nor in the fall or winter; you must wait for another year, for another turn in time. To see something of the Lord, we all need to take advantage of the turn of time; we must not miss the opportunity. If in one meeting you do not see something of Him, you will have to wait until another meeting. If you miss the opportunity in one conference, you will have to wait for another conference. You need a turn of time. The times and the seasons are very meaningful. Be careful not to miss a day, a week, a month, or a year. Do not miss any opportunities. If you miss them, you must wait for another turn.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>On the mountain top</H2><P>Firstly the disciples saw the revelation, but they must wait a week, for another turn in time, before they could see something more. It was not up to them; it was up to the Creator of time. This time the Lord Jesus brought them to the mountain top, not only apart from all religious things and circumstances, but also apart from the earthly level. To see the revelation you must be far away from all religious things, persons, and circumstances; but to see the vision you must be on the mountain top, the higher the better. When we are on the mountain top, we get a clear view, we see the whole vision. It was there, not only apart from the religious circle, but also apart from earthly things, that Jesus became another Jesus. The Jesus you see on the mountain is not the Jesus you see at sea level. The Jesus on the mountain top is a transfigured Jesus. We need to be on the mountain top to see the vision, to see Jesus transfigured.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
