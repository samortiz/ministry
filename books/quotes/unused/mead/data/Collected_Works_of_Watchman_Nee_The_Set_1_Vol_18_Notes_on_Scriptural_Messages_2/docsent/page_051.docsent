   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE GIFT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God never sells anything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Gift means a present one gives to others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's things are always given to man as gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As long as one wants it, it will be given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If someone does not want it, it will not be given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the way with everything that God gives to man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is true not only with spiritual matters, but with material things as well.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God gives us sunshine and never asks for money.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The rain comes from heaven, and He never asks for money in return.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is the same when you ask for spiritual satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once there was a child who loved his mother very much.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He wanted to buy some flowers for her to make her happy, but he only had two coins in his pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He saw a very beautiful garden, and he went in, thinking that he could buy some flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A gentleman was there, and the child told him why he had come.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The man just picked a bunch of flowers and gave them to him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The boy said, "I cannot take them for free."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The man responded, "My flowers are always given away.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you want them, I will give them to you."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Who was that man?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was the Prince of Wales.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The garden was the royal garden.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The things of the royal family were never for sale.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If he gives you something, you only have to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you want satisfaction today, you can have it right away; you do not have to wait until you have completed something to get it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In writing a book, you have to spend a great deal of time preparing it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in receiving a book, you do not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Preparing a meal is time consuming, but eating the meal does not take much time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Preparing a dress is labor-intensive, but putting on the dress does not take much labor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you have worries within, if your environment is oppressing you, and if you want satisfaction, you can have it right away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You do not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He will come to you and provide for you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Oh, the gifts of God are free; He never sells anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the prodigal son in Luke was hungry, "he longed to be satisfied with the carob pods which the hogs were eating, and no one gave him anything" 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the principle of the world: when you have it, you have it; when you do not have it, you do not have it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One is just one, and two is just two.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The principle of the devil is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the world, if you give me something, I must give you back something.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The world never gives you anything for free.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even if you have nothing, you have to give your soul away.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, there is one place that will provide things for free: the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The best thing for the prodigal son was to go home.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He once said to his father, "Give me the share of the estate that falls to me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And he distributed to them his living" 15:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Later when the son returned to his father's home, did he deserve to eat a meal?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Did he deserve to have a robe?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No. Everything was grace because he had spent all that he deserved to have.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's way of salvation is to give you something for free.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not how much you give Him, but how much He gives you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many people think that as long as they can behave well or pray more, God will grant something to them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, this is the concept of their commercial mentality; God never acts this way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What is the gift of God?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can read John 3:16: "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This gift is not gold or silver, but the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God sent His Son to die for us and laid all our sins on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God gives us such a Son.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I like putting John 3:16, which says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son," together with John 1:12, which says, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>John 3:16 says that God gave us His Son; John 1:12 says that we receive His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He gives and we receive.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If there is anyone among us today who does not know how to be saved, let me tell you the way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All you have to do is receive the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One woman said that she had been doing good for more than thirty years and that she hoped that God would save her.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But I can tell you that this is the tiding of woe from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Bible says, "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved" Rom 10:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As soon as you call on Him, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Bible also says, "He who believes into the Son has eternal life" John 3:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As soon as you believe, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is God's gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you think that you can be saved by doing good and that salvation is dependent upon good works, the whole world will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>THE CHRIST SENT FROM GOD</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must know not only the gift of God but also the One who says, "Give me something to drink."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today the One who is sitting by the well, who is lowly and wearied, and who has experienced so much hardship is the very gift of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is useless for you to merely know that God's gift is free.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You must know that the Christ who is opposed by men today is the gift of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You must know that the Jesus who is called a bastard by many is the gift of God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This Jesus who was sitting by the well, who was wearied and despised by men the One whom men would not worship or believe in is the gift of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many of those who go to hell believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The first one among them is the devil; he believes that there is God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Everyone in hell believes in God, but no one believes in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This lowly Jesus, who was called a bastard, a traitor of Rome, and an imperialist, is the gift of God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you know this Jesus, you will surely say to Him, "You are the gift of God, please give me the living water that I may be satisfied."</S>
