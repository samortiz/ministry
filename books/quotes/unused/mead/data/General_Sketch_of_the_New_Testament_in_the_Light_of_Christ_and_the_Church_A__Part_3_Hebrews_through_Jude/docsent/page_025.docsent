   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Maintained by the Anointing of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then on the positive side, the Holy Spirit is always moving, working, and anointing within us based upon the sprinkling of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Where there is the sprinkling of the blood, there is the anointing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First John 2:27 says, "And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To abide in Christ is to have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are kept in this fellowship, this abiding, by the anointing, which is the moving of the Holy Spirit as the ointment within.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 24 of chapter three says, "And he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First John 4:13 continues, "In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Holy Spirit anoints God Himself into us more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may illustrate the anointing by painting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy Spirit is the Painter, and the paint is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Holy Spirit anoints us with God Himself as the paint.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more a painter paints something, the more paint there is on that article.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the same principle, the more the Holy Spirit anoints us, the more God Himself as our very essence is anointed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more we are in the fellowship, the more we have the very essence of God anointed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The portion, the essence, the very element of God within us increases continuously by the anointing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The divine fellowship is maintained by the anointing of the Holy Spirit with God Himself as the very essence anointed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is one of the most important matters in the entire Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must experience this in a full way so that day by day we will be in the divine fellowship, and day by day in this fellowship God's essence within us will constantly increase.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is by this anointing that we are saturated with God Himself in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, it is by the sprinkling of the blood and by the anointing of the Holy Spirit that the fellowship in Christ as the divine life is maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Remaining in the Divine Fellowship to Overcome Sin, the World, and Satan</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First John deals very much with victory over three main items: sin, the world, and Satan 5:4-5, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The way to overcome besetting sins, the seducing world, and the deceiving Satan is by the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we are in the fellowship, it is easy to overcome all the besetting sins, put the seducing world under our feet, and overcome the subtle Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is no other way for us to overcome these three enemies except by remaining in the divine fellowship, and the way to keep ourselves in this fellowship is by the blood of Christ and by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should always apply the blood to counter all the accusations, and we should take care of the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no need to exercise our human effort to defeat the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Simply by our remaining in this fellowship, all the enemies become our footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We transcend them all, and we are in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the positive side, if we remain in the fellowship, we spontaneously carry out the Lord's will, fulfill His purpose, and love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the foregoing matters are the main points with the main line in 1 John.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must learn to abide in God and allow God to abide in us by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must also learn how to have a heart that does not condemn us, by the cleansing of the blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then we will be kept in the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the negative side we will be victorious over all things, and on the positive side we will be able to do everything that God intends us to do.</S>
