   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE CHARACTER OF AN ELDER I. THE IMPORTANCE OF CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In these first few messages, we are first considering the person of an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After this, we will consider the principle of administration in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I want to repeat soberly to the brothers and sisters that whether a matter is carried out in a good way or in a poor way depends absolutely on the person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eighty to ninety percent of the success of a work depends on the person, the remaining ten to twenty percent on the method and principle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the main problem in overseeing the church is the person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today we will speak about character.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Character and habits are closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To speak of character is almost the same as to speak of habits.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During the training in 1953, we stressed heavily the matter of character.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Later at the training in Manila we spoke again on character with a few additional points.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There were altogether thirty points, composed of ten groups with three points in each group.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have said that character differs from nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nature comes completely from the hereditary traits; it comes by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Character does not come only by birth; there is the question of habits also.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From our experience, a strict analysis of character shows that it is developed from our hereditary nature plus our habits.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we add habits to the nature received at birth, we have the fixed character of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, within the character, the percentage of habit is higher than that of nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps sixty to seventy percent of character is habit, and thirty to forty percent is nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, two baby boys may be born of the same Chinese parents.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the older one may be brought into a Western family from birth and brought up and educated there, while the younger one may be born in China and raised up in a Chinese family.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When they both grow up, the elder brother will fully manifest the Western character, while the younger will fully manifest the Chinese character.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I believe all of you will accept this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, although character contains the element of nature, it is mostly developed from habits.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some are born slow; others are born quick.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a difference in the hereditary nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But some are slow by habit, and others are quick by habit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The difference is developed mostly from habits.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The character we are speaking of is primarily related to our habits.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one is ever free from the influence of his character in his walk and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The walk and conduct of every person is definitely restricted by his character.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is inevitable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of course, when a person is not broken, it is very difficult for him to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If his heart has not been dealt with severely, it will not be sufficiently large, honest, and upright.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All these surely will affect his walk.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But there is one more point: no matter what kind of walk a person may have, he can never go beyond the boundary of his character.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everyone is restricted by his character.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If it is your character to be a quick person, you cannot but work hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If your character is slow, you cannot but work at a slow pace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If your character is careless, you could never be serious in your work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If your character is inaccurate, you could never give a message with accuracy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is absolutely true.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only does character control the whole person as the heart does, but it is a person's whole world; it is his realm, and even his sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is impossible for anyone to act outside of this realm.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No matter how anyone walks and behaves, there is no way for him to go beyond the realm of his own character.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, experience has shown us that in order for the elders to be a true profit to the church, their character must be carefully considered.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all know that the demands upon a person's character increase as his undertaking becomes more lofty.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you are a man pulling a rickshaw or a man cleaning the street, the consideration of character is not so important.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But if you undertake to do something higher, such as being a physician or a professor, then the demand for character becomes higher.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today, those brothers who are elders in the church and who oversee God's house are engaged in the highest undertaking in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As such, they must pay full attention to the matter of character.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this chapter we can only deal with a few points of character that are directly related to the administration of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you neglect these few points, no matter how well you pray and how spiritual you are, I can conclude that you will be ineffective as an elder; the situation of the church will be helpless under your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These few points are: thoroughness, diligence, steadfastness, concern for others, and being accommodating.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let us consider these points one by one.</S>
