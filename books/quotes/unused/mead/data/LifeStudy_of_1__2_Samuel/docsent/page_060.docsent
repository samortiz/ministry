   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE HISTORY CONCERNING DAVID 2 PREPARED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE A MAN ACCORDING TO THE HEART OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 SAMUEL 16 2 SAMUEL 1 2 PERSECUTED AND TRIED BY SAUL 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 18 20</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we read the Bible, we should not interpret it in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We surely need guidance from the Lord, and we also need to know the controlling principles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Otherwise, we may be careless in our interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In studying the books of history in the Bible, we need to be poor in spirit and we need a seeking spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to pray, "Lord, there is something here that I do not know, but You know.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, reveal to me the intrinsic significance of this portion of the Word."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This should be our prayer as we continue to consider the history concerning David as one prepared by God to be a man according to the heart of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>V. JONATHAN'S LOVE FOR DAVID</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>David was persecuted and tried by Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Saul was nearly the unique source of all David's trials.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the trials that God gave to him in His sovereignty, God prepared a provision for David.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God prepared Jonathan, Saul's son, who loved David 18:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A. Jonathan Loving David like His Own Soul</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jonathan loved David like his own soul vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>1b, 3b .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While the father was persecuting David and plotting to kill him, his son was loving David to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It seems that there was discord in the family over David, with the father hating him and the son loving him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If God had not provided Jonathan in such a way, it is doubtful that David could have endured the trials under Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>David could pass through these trials mainly because of the help that Jonathan rendered to him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From this we see that when we are under God's trial, God knows that we need some provision.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, we have the trials; on the other hand, we have God's provision to support us and sustain us in the trials.</S>
