<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. By the Glory</H2><P>The oneness of the believers is also by the glory given to the believers by the Son through the coinhering of the Triune God incorporated with the believers. In John 17:22-23a the Son prayed to the Father, "And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one." The believers can be one as the three of the Trinity are one. The Father, the Son, and the disciples all coinhere. This is the glory. In this coinhering, Christ is glorified, and the Father is glorified in Christ's glorification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Incorporated with the Oneness<br>of the Economical Trinity</H2><P>Our oneness is incorporated with the oneness of the economical Trinity for the church life constituting the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Economically One in Harmony</H2><P>The Divine Trinity is economically one in harmony.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Father Giving His Glory to the Son</H2><P>The Father gives His glory to the Son that the Son may express Him in His nature, life, and attributes in the divine sonship for the Father's glorification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Son Giving the Divine Glory to His Believers</H2><P>The Son gives the divine glory in the divine sonship to His believers, who are the many sons of God sharing the divine sonship with Him. The Father gives His glory to His Son. The Son has the right to express God in the sonship. Such a right to glorify God in the sonship has been given to all the disciples of Christ because they are God's sons and have His sonship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Kept in the Father's Love</H2><P>Eventually, the incorporated oneness is kept in the Father's love through the coinhering of the Triune God with the believers in Christ for eternity as the New Jerusalem (vv. 23b-26).</P><P>John 17 shows us two kinds of oneness which are incorporated together through the coinhering of the Triune God with the believers in Christ. The believers in Christ are many and the Triune God is three; among the three there is no division but only harmony and oneness. Their oneness becomes the oneness of the believers in Christ, which becomes the oneness of the Body of Christ. The Body is the new man, and the new man is Christ. The new man came into being by being created by Christ on the cross and by being regenerated by the Father and born by the Spirit. We now need to put on this new man.</P>
