<h1 class="title">BELIEVE IN THE HEART<br />
AND CONFESS WITH THE MOUTH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rom. 10:6-10</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Christ has died and resurrected
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is the very Savior God prepared for man.</li>
	<li>Since He has descended from heaven, there is no need for us to ascend to bring Him down. Here it says, &ldquo;Who will ascend into heaven? That is, to bring Christ down.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Since Christ has already died and resurrected, there is no need for man to cause Him to die again.</li>
	<li>Thus, because Christ has already come to accomplish redemption for us, there is no need for us to ask Him to work redemption again.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Holy Spirit has come and is inspiring you now
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ died and resurrected, accomplished redemption and ascended into heaven. Now the Holy Spirit is sent to inspire man so that he can believe in Christ and His resurrection.</li>
	<li>The Holy Spirit is inspiring you right now; He is putting the word of Christ&rsquo;s redemption into you.</li>
	<li>This word of salvation is near you, even in your mouth and in your heart. Once you open your mouth and exercise your heart, you will receive it.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Believe in your heart and confess with your mouth
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s redemption has been accomplished, and the Holy Spirit has sent this redemption into your heart and your mouth.</li>
	<li>Now, if you open your heart and your mouth just a little, you will be saved.</li>
	<li>The heart is for believing and the mouth is for confessing. Believe that Christ died and was resurrected, and confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus.</li>
	<li>Once you believe, you are justified; once you confess, you are saved. Justification means to be accepted before God and salvation means to be separated before man. Before God we are accepted by God, and before man we have separation.</li>
	</ol></li>
