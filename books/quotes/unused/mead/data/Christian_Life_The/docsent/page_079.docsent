   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The matter of living by the Spirit is mentioned in Galatians 5:25.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To live by the Spirit equals to have Christ living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although we all are persons, we should not live by our self as the person; we must live by another person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Christian life is a life in which we live by another person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as we live by our self as our person, that is not the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As Christians, we should not have only one person; we must have two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One person is our self, and the other is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This Christ who is our person within us is pneumatic; He is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit by whom we must live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , Christ is pneumatic.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is not only our life Col 3:4 but also our person 2 Cor 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To speak of living by Christ as our life may be somewhat abstract, but to speak of living by Christ as our person is more definite.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A person is very definite, whereas life is somewhat abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether we live by Christ as our life or not is difficult to know, but whether we live by Christ as our person or not is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To speak of living by our self or living by Christ means that there are two persons by whom we can live.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not live by our self; we should live by another person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Equaling to Have Christ</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Living in Us, That Is, to Live Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>the Pneumatic Christ in Resurrection,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That Christ May Be Magnified in Us</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To live by the Spirit equals to have Christ living in us Gal 2:20a , that is, to live Christ, the pneumatic Christ in resurrection, that Christ may be magnified in us Phil 1:19-21a .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For Christ to be our person within us, He surely must be pneumatic, and He must be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before His incarnation He was God as the Spirit already, but the Spirit in the stage before incarnation was not the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The life-giving Spirit, who is the reality of Christ, is the Spirit after Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In His resurrection Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today this life-giving Spirit is the pneumatic Christ, the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We live Christ that Christ may be magnified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To magnify Christ and to live Christ are not two different things; rather, they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To live Christ is to magnify Christ, and the magnification of Christ is the real manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without the magnification of Christ, it would be impossible to have the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we live Christ, surely we magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our living by our self can be likened to copper.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In comparison, our living of Christ can be likened to gold.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The best copper may look very much like gold.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the living of some saints it may be difficult to discern whether they themselves are expressed or whether God is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Copper and gold look somewhat alike, but they are different in essence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because of their quiet and careful natural makeup, some of the saints may resemble Christ in their living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, however, their living may not be the living of Christ but the living of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In contrast, it is easier to discern whether a person who is very active and makes many mistakes is living Christ or living himself.</S>
