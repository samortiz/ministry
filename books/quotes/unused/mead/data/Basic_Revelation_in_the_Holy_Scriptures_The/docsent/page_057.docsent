   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The City and Its Street</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The city and its street are pure gold like transparent glass 21:18b, 21b .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Transparent gold signifies the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Bible teachers generally agree that in typology gold signifies the divine nature, the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Twelve Foundations and Twelve Gates</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The twelve foundations of twelve different precious stones, bearing the names of the twelve apostles, signify all the New Testament saints, represented by these twelve apostles 21:14, 19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The New Jerusalem is a composition of all the redeemed saints, both Old and New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The twelve apostles represent the New Testament saints, while the names of the twelve tribes on the twelve gates represent the Old Testament saints 21:12-13, 21a .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Pearls signify the saints produced through the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In His incarnation He was like a living oyster in the death waters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then He was wounded by us, the little particles of sand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These wounds caused Him to secrete His life juice around us, thus making us into pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here is incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through this process we, the grains of sand, have been made into precious pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Precious Stones</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The foundation and the wall built with precious stones signify the saints transformed by the sanctifying Spirit 21:19-20, 18a, 11b .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We were made of dust, but we have been regenerated into stone and transformed into precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Dust, regenerated into stone and transformed into precious stone, is qualified to be used as God's building material.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Length, Breadth, and Height of the City</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The length, the breadth, and the height of the city are equal, just as the Holy of Holies in the Old Testament had three equal dimensions 1 Kings 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The measurement there is twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the Holy of Holies in the type of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Holy of Holies in the tabernacle is ten cubits by ten cubits by ten cubits Exo 26:2-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In both cases the three dimensions are equal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The principle is that such a building of three equal dimensions signifies the Holy of Holies, which is the very place where God dwells Rev 21:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The entire city, then, is the very place of God's dwelling.</S>
