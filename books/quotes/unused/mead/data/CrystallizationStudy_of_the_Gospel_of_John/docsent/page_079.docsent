   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TAKING THE SHEPHERDING WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PREACH THE GOSPEL AND REVIVE THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I first went to Taiwan, I thought nothing could be worked out there.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At that time it was a desolate small island.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One day the Lord told me to go along the railway from Taipei to visit the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After that visitation I was deeply impressed that Taiwan could be a very good field for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I picked up a burden and decided to begin the ministry there with a conference on August 1, 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>About four or five hundred Christians from different denominations, who had escaped from mainland China to Taiwan, came on the first day of the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I said to them, "We are here to serve one kind of food Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Please be clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you want anything else, you are wasting your time in coming here."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Most of them did not come back.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only the real seekers came.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We took down their names and began to shepherd them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We distributed their names to different brothers and sisters to go and visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From the beginning of the work in Taiwan we practiced shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we had a big gospel meeting, we could get about five to six hundred names.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we distributed all the names for the proper care.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Most people want to have genuine, proper visitors.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we visit people, we should be genuine in our care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They will sense that we are not vain people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shepherding way of preaching the gospel by visiting people warms them up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church life in Taiwan began with about three or four hundred believers, but after four years we had forty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Most of the people were not saved directly by my ministry; they were saved by the proper shepherding, the proper care.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all have to learn this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before I went to Taiwan in 1949, I was in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I spoke each Lord's Day, and during the week I and an older brother went to visit the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We were warmly welcomed by every family.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They would gather their household together when we came.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Within a short time, there was a real revival in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The gospel was preached everywhere, not just by myself but by all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I also made the decision to set up a kitchen in the meeting hall, and I invited groups of twenty or thirty saints to eat together for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Within a little over half a year, I had invited all the members of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time there were at least five to six hundred saints in the church in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This kind of shepherding stirred up the entire church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I hope the elders would use the hall as a dining room and invite the saints to come for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>An elder should contact at least one person every day for the purpose of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should also invite people to our homes for a meal, not inviting the familiar ones but the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The revival in Chefoo occurred because of this kind of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Shepherding works.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not desire to be giant speakers to make a name for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>People may be attracted to come to listen to us, but who will take care of them afterward?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The way of having large gospel campaigns does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In some places this has been tested out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may have big gospel meetings with many people, but eventually not many of them are added to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Also, we should not use famous or well-known people to testify in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This will not save people to be added to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even if someone is the president of the country, he should be in the meeting just as anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The way that can save people effectively must be by small vital groups, and every one in this small vital group must be a shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After a short time, the church will be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No other way is more prevailing than this shepherding way.</S>
