<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Such Clustering Stirring Up the Neighboring Churches in Mutual Love, Mutual Care,<br>Mutual Intercession, and Mutual Shepherding</H2><P>The clustering of the churches stirs up the neighboring churches in mutual love, mutual care, mutual intercession, and mutual shepherding.</P><P>Romans 16 and the end of 1 Corinthians 16 contain greetings to saints in different localities. By considering these greetings we can see that they express the mutual love among the saints in the churches. Then, in Acts 11:27-30; 1 Corinthians 16:1-3; 2 Corinthians 8:1-4; and Romans 15:25-27 we can see examples of mutual care among the churches. Such mutual care was demonstrated in the fellowship of the giving of material things. When the churches are clustered together, this kind of genuine mutual care among the churches is stirred up.</P><P>Also, through the clustering the saints hear of the needs among the churches and receive the burden to pray for them. This is an example of the mutual intercession in the Body of Christ stirred up by the clustering of the churches. When the churches cluster together, there is also the mutual shepherding through the mutual fellowship among the saints and the leading ones, so that the riches of Christ in each individual church are communicated and supplied to all the clustering churches.</P><P>When the churches cluster together, they experience the mutual love, the mutual care, the mutual intercession, and the mutual shepherding. How wonderful that in the church life the Lord is recovering this matter of the clustering for the blending of the churches! This issues in the practical building up of the Body of Christ in these four items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Such Clustering Rendering a Stronger Testimony for Christ in the Eyes of the Unbelievers,<br>Thus Speeding Up Their Salvation</H2><P>The clustering of the churches renders a stronger testimony for Christ by the churches in the eyes of the unbelievers, thus speeding up their salvation. The Lord's prayer in John 17 reveals that there is oneness only in the Triune God (vv. 21-23). The Triune God is truly one: the Father and the Son are one, the Son and the Spirit are one, and the Spirit and the Father are one. We have no oneness in ourselves. The only true oneness is in the Triune God. Today this Triune God lives in us. In the clustering of the churches we enjoy the Triune God as the very source and factor of our oneness. This oneness displays a visible testimony to the world, and especially to the unbelievers. Such a testimony is the expression of Christ and ministers Christ to people. According to the picture of the seven golden lampstands in Revelation 1, each lampstand shines individually as a testimony of Christ. However, when the lampstands are clustered together, the testimony becomes stronger and is intensified. With the seven golden lampstands, the shining testimony was intensified sevenfold.</P><P>Such a stronger testimony for Christ will speed up the salvation of the unbelievers. According to the Lord's prayer in John 17, the testimony of the oneness of the believers will cause the world to believe that the Father sent the Son. This is for the salvation of the unbelievers. Furthermore, according to 1 Corinthians 14:24-25, in a meeting of the church, if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters the meeting, he will be convicted and examined by all, and falling on his face, he will declare that indeed God is among us. In the clustering of the churches, the testimony of the church is intensified. Such an intensified testimony will speed up the salvation of the unbelievers.</P><P>The speeding up of the unbelievers' salvation results in the increase to the Body of Christ. The increase comes through the clustering, as mentioned in Acts 9:31. This verse says, "So then the church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it was multiplied." Here the word church, not churches, was used, denoting the church in the universal aspect. Judea, Galilee, and Samaria were not cities; they were provinces. Within each province there were many cities. There must have been churches in the local sense in a number of the cities in these three provinces (Gal. 1:22). All the local churches throughout the whole of Judea, Galilee, and Samaria were considered here as one church. In Acts 9:31 we may consider that all these churches were clustered. These clustered churches were being built up and were also being multiplied. When the unbelievers see, experience, enter into, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit in the genuine oneness, the prophesying, and the mutual love, mutual care, mutual intercession, and mutual shepherding of the clustered churches, the impact of the stronger testimony for Christ will surely speed up their salvation. This is one of the marvelous results when the churches gather together and cluster in the blending way.</P>
