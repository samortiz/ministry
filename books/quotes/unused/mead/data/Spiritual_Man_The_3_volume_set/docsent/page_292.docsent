   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As we mentioned before, God wants us to do away with the soul-life, not the function of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hence, after we are united to God in life, God wants to renew our soul mind, emotion, and will to bring our soul into oneness with our new life, as well as into oneness with His will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since our will is the most important part, after regeneration, God daily is seeking the union of our will with His will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If our will is not fully one with God, it means that salvation is not fully accomplished, because man himself is still not in harmony with God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God not only wants us to have His life, but also for ourselves to be in union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The will absolutely belongs to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If there is no union in the will, we ourselves are not yet united with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we study the Bible carefully, we will see that among all our sins, there is one common principle rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Adam brought us to perdition through this sin, while Christ brought us to salvation through obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We were originally sons of rebellion; now God wants us to be the children of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rebellion is just following after our will, while submission is following after God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The whole purpose of God's salvation is to have us forsake our will and be in union with His will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today believers often make a big mistake in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They think that spiritual life is happiness in the feeling and knowledge in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They endeavor to pursue after all kinds of feelings and biblical knowledge, thinking that these are the best.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the meantime, they do many wonderful, great, and important works according to their feelings and thoughts, thinking that these must be well- pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Little do they know that God's demands are not related to how man feels or what he thinks; He wants man's will to be united with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He desires to see a believer wholeheartedly seeking after what He wants and willingly obeying all that He says.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Unless he unconditionally submits to God and willingly accepts the complete will of God, his so-called spiritual life is superficial, no matter how holy and happy it makes him feel or what he receives.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All visions, strange dreams, voices, prophecies, zeal, works, activities, and labors are outward.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a believer does not resolve in his will to go all the way to finish God's course, whatever he does is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If our will is in union with God, we immediately stop the activities that issue from the self.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that there is no longer any independent action.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are dead toward ourselves, but alive toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This does not mean that we can act for God according to our own impulses or methods.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It means that we move according to the moving of God and are severed from all the activities of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, this kind of union is a change of who is the center, a change of who is the initiating one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the past all of our works were centered upon the self, and all of our activities were initiated by the self.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now everything is unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God does not question the nature of the matters that we have initiated; He only asks who initiated it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anything that is not delivered from the self, regardless of how good it is, is ignored by God.</S>
