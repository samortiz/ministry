   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT CHRIST THE CONSTITUENT OF THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Col 3:5-11; Gal 2:20a; Rom 6:3; 8:13; Eph 4:22, 25a, 24; Rom 12:2; Phil 1:21; Col 1:27; 1 Cor 12:13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to Colossians 3, Christ is our life and the One who is all and in all vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>4, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall consider how such a Christ is the constituent of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before Paul comes to this matter, he speaks of putting off a number of things vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the new man everything other than Christ must be put off.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the church as the new man there is no room for anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In categorizing those things which we must put off, Paul speaks of fleshly things, of psychological things, and eventually of the totality of the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I. PUTTING TO DEATH OUR LUSTFUL MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 3:5 Paul says, Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and unbridled greedy lust, which is idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In our sinful members is the law of sin, which makes us captives of sin and causes our corrupted body to become the body of death Rom 7:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, our members, which are sinful, are identified with sinful things, such as fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and unbridled greedy lust.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 3:6 Paul points out that because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 7 he goes on to say that the believers once walked in these things when they lived in them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verse 5 Paul charges us to put to death our members which are on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This charge is based upon the fact that we have been crucified with Christ Gal 2:20a and that we have been baptized into His death Rom 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We execute Christ s death upon our sinful members by crucifying them, by faith, through the power of the Spirit Rom 8:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This corresponds to Galatians 5:24.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ has accomplished the all-inclusive crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we apply it to our lustful flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is absolutely different from asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ s all-inclusive death on the cross is applied to us at the time of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All those who believe in the Lord Jesus should be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In baptism we not only recognize Christ s death, but we also apply it to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, in baptism we are placed into the death of Christ and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to Romans 8:11 and 13, the putting to death of the practices of the body is an action carried out in the power of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not accomplished by self-effort.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our attempts to put to death the practices of the body are nothing more than asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although we are not to practice asceticism, we are to put to death the negative things in us by the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to do this, we need to open to the Spirit and allow the Spirit to flow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through the Spirit s flowing, we shall experience the effectiveness of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not asceticism; it is the operation of the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A number of saints have read the autobiography of Madame Guyon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This book contains definite traces of asceticism and mysticism, the very things that damaged the church in Colosse.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who read books written by the mystics must do so with discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although some things in these books are helpful, others are poisonous.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many years ago, we were helped by some of these books.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, we eventually learned that reading such books without discernment can lead seeking Christians into the error of asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore I do not recommend that you read these books without the help of some saints who are more experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even recently, some, especially sisters, have been damaged by them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to be warned concerning asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not impose anything on ourselves in an attempt to deal with the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the contrary, our practice should be to open ourselves in fellowship with the Lord and allow the Spirit to have a free way to flow within us, and to apply the effectiveness of Christ s all-inclusive death to the negative things in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Asceticism is spiritual suicide; in contrast, what we are speaking of is the application of Christ s death through the flowing of the Spirit.</S>
