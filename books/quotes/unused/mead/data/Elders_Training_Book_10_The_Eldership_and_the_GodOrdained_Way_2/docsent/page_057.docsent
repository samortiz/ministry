   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN SARDIS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH THE REMAINING THINGS BEING ABOUT TO DIE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>REVELATION 3:2a</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This also is a picture of the Protestant churches, with which some of the positive things remain but are about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every item of the positive things inherited and received by the present Protestant churches remains in a dying situation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>XLIX.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN SARDIS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>HAVING ITS WORKS NOT FOUND BY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>COMPLETED BEFORE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>REVELATION 3:2b</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This also is a portrait of the present Protestant churches, concerning which no work has been found by the Lord completed before God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The three cases related to the church in Sardis all indicate a shortage of the vigor of the divine life and a lack of the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To take care of these cases would force us to be enriched in the vigorous divine life and to be empowered in the powerful Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only the vigor of the divine life and the power of the Holy Spirit can make us living, fresh, and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>L. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BEING NEITHER COLD NOR HOT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>REVELATION 3:14a, 15-16</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The main meaning of the Greek name Laodicea is the opinion, the judgment, of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When a local church is full of peoples' opinions, it surely will become neither cold nor hot.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because of its lukewarmness, such a church will suffer being vomited out of the Lord's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is to be given up by the Lord because the taste of that church is repulsive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, a church that is full of peoples' opinions, peoples' judgments, is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even we would reject such a church in the practice of the church life, not to mention that the Lord would vomit it out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Peoples' opinions are versus God's judgment and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why the Lord is standing at the door of the church in Laodicea v. 20 , indicating that the Lord has been rejected by that church.</S>
