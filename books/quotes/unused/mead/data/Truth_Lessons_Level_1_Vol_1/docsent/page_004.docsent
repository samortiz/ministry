   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Bible Being the Holy Spirit s Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 16:13 says, But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord s word here also proves that after the Spirit s descension, what His disciples spoke and wrote was disclosed to them by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, the Lord s word here proves that after His ascension, all the books of the New Testament, written by His disciples, were of the Spirit s revelation and their divine authority was acknowledged by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Scripture, therefore, is the word written by men under God s command Exo 34:27 , the word of the Spirit of God spoken through men, the word of God spoken through man s mouth 2 Sam 23:2 , and the word spoken by men who were moved by the Spirit Mark 12:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Old Testament is the word spoken by the prophets under God s command Jer 1:7 , the word of God coming upon the prophet Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1:3 , and the word of the Spirit of God spoken through the prophets Zech 7:7; Acts 3:18; 28:25; Rom 1:2; 1 Pet 1:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some portions of the New Testament are God s speaking in the Lord Jesus John 14:10 , while other portions are words written by the apostles as taught by the Spirit 1 Cor 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The words written by the apostles as taught by the Spirit are as sacred as the Old Testament Scriptures 2 Pet 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the entire Bible originates from God; every word and every sentence, every iota and every tittle Matt 5:18 , are God-inspired.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, men should neither add to or take away anything from the Holy Scriptures Rev 22:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BIBLE A. Testifying concerning the Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first function of the Bible is to testify concerning the Lord Jesus John 5:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus is the subject and contents of the Bible; the Bible is the explanation and expression of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus is God s living Word; the Bible is God s written Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible, God s written Word, must have the Lord Jesus, the living Word, as its reality; otherwise, it is but mere doctrines and empty letters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus, the living Word, must have the Bible, the written Word, as His expression; otherwise, He is mysterious and difficult to know, vague and hard to grasp.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, since there is the clear, definite explanation and plain revelation of the Scriptures, the Lord Jesus can be known practically and comprehended definitely by men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only every book of the New Testament reveals the Lord Jesus, but every part of the Old Testament, whether 1 the Law of Moses, 2 the Prophets, or 3 the Psalms these are the three major parts of the Old Testament , testifies and speaks concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, if we want to know the Lord Jesus, we must read and understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>B. Making Men Wise unto Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The functions of the Bible are of two aspects: one aspect is to serve the Lord, and the other aspect is to serve us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, it testifies of the Lord Jesus and, on the other hand, it causes us to receive grace and be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first function of the Bible toward us is to make us wise unto salvation 2 Tim 3:15 ; it reveals to us how God saves men in Christ, and how men may be saved by faith, so that we may know the way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>C. Causing Men to Be Regenerated</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first practical function of the Bible in us is to cause us to be regenerated 1 Pet 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible is the Word of the living God, and it contains the life of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we receive the word of the Scriptures into us by faith, it comes into us like a seed of life, sowing God s life into us; thus, we have God s life and are regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>D. Being the Believers Spiritual Milk</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we first get saved, we do not have a strong enough comprehension concerning spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some portions of the Scriptures are like milk that can nourish us and make us grow in our spiritual life 1 Pet 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, a newly regenerated believer must long for the word of the Bible, like newborn babes longing for the guileless milk of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Otherwise, his spiritual life cannot grow, and he will continue to be one who is an infant in Christ 1 Cor 3:1-2 .</S>
