<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF DANIEL</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN INTRODUCTORY WORD</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Dan. 1:1-2</H1><P>Among the many books of the prophets, four books are mysterious: Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zechariah. We thank the Lord that, through the years, He has opened these books to us. In this introductory message to the life-study of Daniel, we will consider the subject, the contents, the central thought, and the sections of the book of Daniel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE SUBJECT</H2><P>The subject of the book of Daniel is the destiny of Israel apportioned out by God, the contents of the seventy weeks (Dan. 9:24-27). The seventy weeks are the destiny apportioned out by God to Israel.</P><P>This book not only covers the destiny of Israel but also covers the Gentile government and Christ. The large human image in Daniel 2 signifies all of human government from Genesis 10 to Revelation 19. Our understanding of the history of the Jewish people and of the Gentile government would be inadequate without this book. The book of Daniel shows us that Israel and human government are for Christ. Christ is the centrality and the universality of God's move, and this move is intrinsically involved with Israel and the Gentile government.</P><P>The book of Daniel reveals five particular points concerning Christ. The first point is the death of Christ. Daniel 9:25 and 26 say, "From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the time of Messiah the Prince will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks....And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah will be cut off." This word about Messiah being "cut off" is the clearest word in the Old Testament concerning the crucifixion of Christ. The crucifixion of Christ is the landmark of the ages. It is the landmark where the old creation was terminated for the germination of the new creation in Christ's resurrection.</P><P>Christ died an all-inclusive death. When He died, we and the entire old creation died with Him. Therefore, His death was an all-inclusive termination. The terminating death of Christ ushered in the resurrection, and in the resurrection the germination of God's new creation began.</P>
