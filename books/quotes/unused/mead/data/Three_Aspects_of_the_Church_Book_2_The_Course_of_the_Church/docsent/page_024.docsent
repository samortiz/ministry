   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Faithful unto Death</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second of the seven epistles was written to the church in Smyrna Rev 2:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord did not rebuke the church in Smyrna; He only praised it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, in the epistle to Smyrna the Lord commanded the saints to overcome; He wanted them to be faithful unto death v. 10 . In other words, because of their love for Him, they were not even to care for their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because they have a strong conflict between their interest and the Lord s interest, people do not remain faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we set aside our own interest, we can be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A person s greatest interest is his life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we disregard our own life, it is easy to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The young brothers and sisters must pay special attention because in many matters they have not learned the lesson to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some are not even willing to sacrifice their sleep, not to mention being faithful unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our faithfulness will be proved when we are entrusted with some matters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A person s faithfulness in the matter of service shows how much love he has for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The extent to which we love Him is the extent to which we will be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, a mother is faithful in caring for her children.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a sister would be as faithful in her service as a mother who cares for her children, she might be the most faithful one among us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, the second call, the call to be faithful, is based on the first call.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second requirement for overcoming is based on the first requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If there is no love, there will be no faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Abandoning the Teachings and Organizations</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That Were Not Present at the Beginning</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The third epistle was written to the church in Pergamos 2:12-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church in Pergamos had the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The situation described in this passage was fulfilled in church history when Constantine accepted Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire in the fourth century.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The teaching of Balaam causes people to worship idols and seek material reward; the teaching of the Nicolaitans controls people by organization.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When these teachings entered the church, the Lord commanded the believers to overcome by not accepting the teaching of Balaam or the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>None of the teachings in the church should have anything to do with idols, profit, or organization.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church should completely abandon such human teachings and organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This requirement differs from the first requirement for overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first requirement is related to recovering what has been lost, but the third requirement is related to abandoning what was not present in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this epistle the Lord does not speak of sin and the world; He touches only the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to overcome during the desolation of the church, we must not participate in human teachings or organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the epistle to Ephesus, the overcomers are promised the tree of life v. 7 ; in the epistle to the church in Pergamos, the promise is the hidden manna v. 17 . In the third epistle the requirement for overcoming is deeper, and the promise is more intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The hidden manna signifies the hidden Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Manna is a type of Christ as food to God s people, that is, as life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, the hidden manna cannot be enjoyed by those who live outside of God; it is enjoyed only by those who live in the Holy of Holies before God s face.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fruit of the tree of life is open and common, but the hidden manna is hidden and special.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The fruit of the tree of life signifies Christ as man s life, and the hidden manna signifies Christ as man s food.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The two have the same function, but the enjoyment is different.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some enjoy Christ as the tree of life; others enjoy Christ as the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The level of enjoyment in these two cases is different.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the church has the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans, that is, when the church is full of human opinions and organization, those who refuse, reject, and abandon these teachings and stand on the Lord s side to maintain His testimony will be able to experience Christ as the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They will have Christ as their life supply, but the flavor of that supply will be the hidden manna, which others do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Others will not be able to touch or taste the Christ that these overcomers experience and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today Christianity is under the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Christianity there are idols, wealth, position, and authoritarian control.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, it is difficult for people in Christianity to enjoy Christ, much less the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If people refuse human teachings and organization and live a hidden life before God, they will be able to experience and enjoy the hidden Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why we do not advertise.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are willing to serve the Lord for our whole lives without being recognized by others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are not willing to do anything in the name, organization, or realm of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The desire for even a little fame is a Nicolaitan thought.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some people eloquently argue that if we would just slightly change our methods, we would be well known in Christianity, and our work would be more effective.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Their words are very persuasive, and if we were like Balaam, they would be like the bait on a fishhook to catch us and carry us away.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The year I began to serve the Lord, an old pastor advised me, Your way of working is no good.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you do what I tell you to do, you will become a famous preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the way of Balaam and the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are seeking fame or position, we will have no share in the enjoyment of the overcomers; we will not taste, touch, or experience the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What we fear most is that what we do and who we are would be known.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The name Pergamos has two meanings: strong tower and marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whenever we aspire to a high position, we are married to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we are in union with the world, we may become famous, and our work may be a high tower.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, the church in which we meet will also be a high tower.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I fear for the young people; they love the Lord and have been called by Him, but the way that they are taking today is worrisome.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I dare not say that they are taking the way of Balaam, but I am afraid it is a way of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They want to be famous preachers and those with a position.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They want their work to be well known, to become a high tower, in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All such things are in the realm of Pergamos.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May the Lord have mercy on us that, if possible, who we are and what we do would not be known by others.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If possible, may our names not appear in the newspapers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Let us never take that way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must learn to be as hidden as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I hope that we are without a name; I hope that we will work without being famous.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we want worldly fame, a high tower, and things of the marriage with the world, then we cannot enjoy the hidden Christ or the hidden manna before God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the command and requirement in the third epistle.</S>
