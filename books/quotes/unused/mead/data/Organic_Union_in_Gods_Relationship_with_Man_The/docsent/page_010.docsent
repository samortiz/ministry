   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CREATION OF MAN IN GOD'S IMAGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND ACCORDING TO GOD'S LIKENESS God's Image and Likeness Being Organic</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that God created man in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, He created man in His image and according to His likeness Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that God created man in a living way, because His image and likeness are not lifeless, outward forms but are organic and full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both God's image and God's likeness are organic.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The image of God is what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What He is as the living God is living and organic.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise, since God's likeness is the expression of what He is, His likeness also must be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the man created by God is a living entity, because this man was created in God's image and according to God's likeness, both of which are living and organic.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man's Body Being from the Dust and</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man's Spirit Being from the Breath of Life</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second, God made a spirit for man Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To make man in God's image and likeness did not require any material, but to make a body, a frame, for man required some material.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The material used by God to make man's body is dust Gen 2:7a .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anything made of dust is lifeless because there is no life in dust.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, in itself man's body, man's frame, is lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After forming man's body from dust, God then made another part for man the inmost part.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This part is called the spirit v. 7b .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God made a spirit in man with His own breath.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's breath of life is the material with which God made a spirit within man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Proverbs 20:27 says, "The spirit of man is the candle lamp of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word spirit in this verse is neshamah in Hebrew, the same word for breath in Genesis 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, the breath of life in Genesis 2:7 is the spirit of man in Proverbs 20:27.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is confirmed by Job 32:8, which says, "But there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The breath of the Almighty in the second clause is in apposition to a spirit in man in the first clause.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the breath of the Almighty is the spirit in man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Something in man's makeup is very close to God and is related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not God the Spirit nor God's life, but God's breath of life something very close to life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not life, but it is the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God breathed this part of Himself into man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The breath of God, after being breathed into man's body, became man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With this part man can contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man's Spirit Being the Organ to Contact God</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to substantiate anything, we must use the proper organ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our body we have many organs, including two ears for hearing, two eyes for seeing, a nose for smelling, and a tongue for tasting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to see colors, we must use the right organ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is impossible to smell colors; but we can see colors.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to contact God, we must use the proper organ our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is Spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God cannot be realized by the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is a spiritual entity, a spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to realize Him we need to use the proper organ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some people who are atheists say strongly that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>During the day they may give lectures to people, stating strongly that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But at night when they go back home, something within checks with them, "Suppose there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What would you do?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we would turn from our thinking mind to our innermost part, our spirit, spontaneously we would say, "O God!" and God's presence would be realized by us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our spirit is an organ particularly made by God with His own breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We do have such an organ that is crucially related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because of this, in John 4:24 the Lord Jesus told us, "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit man's spirit ."</S>
