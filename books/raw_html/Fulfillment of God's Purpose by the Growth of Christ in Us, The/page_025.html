<P>The Bible tells us that the sisters should dress in a modest way (1 Tim. 2:9; 1 Pet. 3:3), but only the Lord knows how modest is modest. When you say, "O Lord," the Lord knows and you know. In 1943 a young lady who was very worldly began to come to our meetings. After she came to a few meetings, the Lord touched her. The first time she came to the meeting, her hair was like a "high tower," arranged high upon her head. One day she came to our meeting, and this tower was gone. Meeting by meeting we could see that something changed with her. That really means that she got rid of a number of things. Eventually, she became a simple young lady. No one told her anything. She experienced the transformation in life. The power of the divine life changed her.</P><P>One brother used to smoke before he was saved by the Lord. After he came to our meetings and was saved, he lost his taste for smoking by being transformed from within. He was absolutely changed and kept away from the old things of his old manner of life. In our meetings we do not give messages telling people to give up their sinful and bad habits. But Christ is the transforming life within the believers. If we mean business with the Lord by saying, "O Lord," there will surely be a change in life. This change in life is not something outward, but something from within. Christ is very careful. He is never careless. The more you go along with Him, the more you contact Him, the more you say, "O Lord," the more you will be restricted by Christ. Christ will restrict us in everything. This restriction is transformation.</P><P>The issue of life is growth and transformation. Life grows; life also transforms. We do not trust in teaching, but we have full trust in the Lord's life. The more you say, "O Lord," the more you will be transformed from within. This transformation might seem slow, but it is steadfast, bit by bit, and day by day. The more you take in Christ, the more you will be transformed. He is not a doctrine. He is powerfully living. As you take Him in, He will transform you in your attitude, your emotion, your motive, your desire, your aim, and your behavior in many ways. Everything will be touched by Him.</P><P>Life grows and life transforms. C. H. Spurgeon was a great preacher in England during the last century, yet at one time he still smoked. A brother of the Brethren assembly was bothered by this and went to see C. H. Spurgeon. Spurgeon was trying to argue by saying, "I smoke for the glory of God." This Brethren brother then put up a big signboard across the street which said, "C. H. Spurgeon says he smokes for the glory of God." That forced Spurgeon to give up smoking. Spurgeon lost his argument in the matter of smoking. Many times we try to argue with the Lord by saying that we have the peace to do something, but eventually we lose our case. If you will not lose the case with the Lord in this age, I am sure that in the coming age, you will lose it. I say again that this is not something legal. We have no legality, but we have the grace within. His grace is sufficient. Just say, "O Lord" from a sincere heart and mean business with the Lord. Then He will come in to take away the evil things and all the things that are not of Him.</P><P>Anything that is not a profit to us mentally, physically, or spiritually is a waste, and that is something condemned by the Lord. When you say, "O Lord Jesus," be honest and mean business with Him. You will see what will happen to you. I hope that you would go to the Lord and put this fellowship into practice. Call on the Lord over every item in your daily life, and see what the Lord will say to you. Then you will see not only the growth in life but also the transformation in life.</P>
