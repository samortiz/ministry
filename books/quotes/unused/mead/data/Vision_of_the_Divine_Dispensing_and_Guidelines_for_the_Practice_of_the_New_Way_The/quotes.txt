[2]  This book contains a series of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, Taiwan in October 1990.
[3]  The Triune God dispensing to those believing into Him the Son as the eternal life John 3:16.
[4]  The organic mingling of the life-dispensing God with the believers: The believers being regenerated to receive God's Spirit of life, having Christ who is life begotten in the believers' spirit, with the result that the Triune God is organically mingled with the regenerated believers John 3:3-6.
[5]  We know that the Gospel of John is a book in the Bible that specifically speaks of God as our life.
[6]  OF THE DIVINE TRINITY The Triune God Becoming Flesh,
[7]  The Triune God passed through all the processes to become ultimately the life-giving Spirit to be dispensed into all the believers.
[8]  We can now come to the feast Luke 14:17 to breathe God in and to eat and drink of God, that is, to breathe in the pneumatic Christ as air, that Christ may be mingled in breath with us for our existence John 20:22 , and to drink of the pneumatic Christ as the living water, that Christ may be mingled organically with us in our living John 4:10, 14; 7:37-38 , and to eat of Christ as our spiritual food in the living word of life, that Christ may be mingled organically with us in life-element John 6:48, 57b-58a .
[9]  When we enjoy and apply the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, and we are joined outwardly and mingled inwardly with Christ, the following results will be produced: 1 out of us will flow rivers of living water John 7:37-39 ; 2 we will bear fruits of life John 15:1, 4-5 ; 3 we will be able to feed the lambs in the flock John 21:15; 10:16 ; 4 we will become the bride of Christ, His counterpart.
[10]  AND THE INCREASE OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 3:31, 34-35, 3-5; 1:12-13; Heb 2:11-12; Rom 12:5; John 3:22-30; 10:10b-11, 14-16; Acts 20:28; John 12:24; 15:1, 5, 8, 16a OUTLINE The immeasurableness of Christ John 3:31, 34-35: Christ coming from above and being above all v. 31.
[11]  Christ being sent by God, speaking the words of God v. 34a.
[12]  The divine dispensing of Christ becoming His divine increase: Christ regenerating the believers to produce the children of God as the brothers of Christ, becoming the members of His Body and constituted to be His Body John 3:3-5; 1:12-13; Heb 2:11-12; Rom 12:5.
[13]  The believers who are joined to Christ and who are His branches dispensing Him to others, making them the fruit, to be the organism of the processed Triune God, having Him as the definite expression John 15:1, 5, 8, 16a.
[14]  The subject of this message is the divine dispensing and the increase of Christ.
[15]  In simple terms, the divine dispensing is God working Himself into us.
[16]  The result of this is the increase of Christ.
[17]  The first part of John 3 speaks of regeneration, which is the divine dispensing, and the second part concerns the regenerated ones, who have the life of God, becoming the bride of Christ as His increase.
[18]  Today, the church as the bride of Christ is the increase of Christ, in the same way that Eve as the counterpart of Adam was the increase of Adam.
[19]  Just as Eve came out of Adam and belonged to Adam, the two becoming one, resulting in the increase of Adam; in the same way the church came out of Christ, being joined to Christ, becoming one spirit with Him, resulting in her being the increase of Christ.
[20]  First, through regeneration we are produced to be the children of God and the brothers of Christ, becoming the members of His Body and constituted to be His Body John 3:3-5; 1:12-13; Heb 2:11-12; Rom 12:5 .
[21]  If we are revived every morning, overcoming every day, and have the Lord Himself as our supply and our supporting strength, as far as we ourselves are concerned, this is quite sufficient.
[22]  In addition to calling on the name of the Lord, we should tell them that we, the Christians, not only have to pray, but must read the Bible as well.
[23]  CONCERNING THE COMING OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Dan 9:24-27; Matt 24:15; 2 Thes 2:8; Rev 19:19-20; Matt 28:20; Rev 13:1, 3, 18; 17:8, 10-11; 2 Thes 2:1a, 3-4; Rev 11:2; 13:5-7; 12:14; Matt 24:21; Rev 3:10; 6:12-17; 8:7 9:21; 16:1-21; Matt 24:3b; Rev 12:5; 14:1-4; Matt 24:40-41; Luke 21:36; Rev 3:10; 14:14; 1 Thes 4:17; Matt 25:1-12; Rev 11:11-12; 2 Cor 5:10; Rev 11:18b; 19:7-9; 2 Thes 2:8; Matt 24:27, 30; Rev 1:7; Rom 11:26-27; Zech 12:10-14; Rev 20:1-3; 11:15; 12:10a; Matt 25:31-46; Acts 10:42b; 2 Tim 4:1; Acts 1:6; Matt 19:28; Acts 3:21 OUTLINE The seventy weeks apportioned out by God Dan 9:24: The first seven weeks, from the issuing of the decree for the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the completion of the rebuilding, being forty-nine years Dan 9:25.
[24]  The sixty-two weeks, from the completion of the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the cutting off of the Messiah Christ , being four hundred thirty-four years Dan 9:26.
[25]  The last week, during which Antichrist will make a seven-year covenant with Israel: In the middle of the week, Antichrist will break the covenant and will cause the sacrifice offered to God by Israel to cease, setting up his image of abomination in the temple to replace God, persecuting for three and a half years all those who worship and serve God, until the coming of Christ to the earth, when he will be destroyed and thrown into the lake of fire Dan 9:27; Matt 24:15; 2 Thes 2:8; Rev 19:19-20.
[26]  He will be revealed before the appearing of Christ and will exalt himself above all that is called God, even seating himself in the temple of God, proclaiming himself that he is God 2 Thes 2:1a, 3-4.
[27]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You from the depths of our being, that You have separated us from this dark age.
[28]  Although the age is dark, we have Your word as a lamp that shines in a dark place.
[29]  Revelation 13:1 points out that the beast, a symbol of Antichrist, will come out of the Mediterranean Sea.
[30]  The coming of Christ is His presence parousia in Greek .
[31]  At that time, the man-child will be raptured to the presence of Christ at the throne of God in heaven Rev 12:5 , and the firstfruits will be raptured to the presence of Christ at the heavenly Zion Rev 14:1-4 .
[32]  TOWARD THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 4:8; Phil 3:20; 1 Thes 1:10; Rev 22:20; 2 Pet 1:19; Matt 24:32-33, 42-44; 25:13; Luke 21:34-36; Rev 3:10; Matt 25:4, 10; 24:45-51; 25:19-30; 1 Cor 3:10-17; Rev 16:15 OUTLINE Loving His appearing 2 Tim 4:8.
[33]  Being watchful, at every time beseeching, that we may prevail to escape all these things which are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man, that is, to be raptured to the presence of Christ in heaven Luke 21:36 Keeping the word of the Lord's endurance, and being kept out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try those who dwell on the earth Rev 3:10.
[34]  My burden is this: when the apostles wrote the New Testament, to them the Lord was coming soon.
[35]  Luke 21:34-35 says, "And take heed to yourselves lest at some time your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and anxieties of life, and that day come upon you suddenly as a snare; for it will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth."
[36]  STRIVING, STRUGGLING Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 5:17; 1 Cor 15:10; 2 Tim 2:6; Rom 12:11; Matt 25:26; Phil 1:27; Col 1:28-29 OUTLINE Laboring 1 Tim 5:17; 1 Cor 15:10; 2 Tim 2:6.
[37]  There it says that the Head, Christ, has given to the church gifts such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers.
[38]  These people do not build up the Body of Christ directly.
[39]  Today, it is as if we have received the new way in a sedan chair.
[40]  According to my observation, among us there are only very few who are laboring and struggling.
[41]  The difference between the new way and the old is that in the old way we try to speak of Christ without having Christ, whereas in the new way we have Christ, and we minister Christ to others.
[42]  I would advise all of you here, whether you are an elder, a co-worker, or a full-timer, that if you want to take the new way today, you must give yourselves to it.
[43]  Otherwise, it is better for you not to take this way.
[44]  In this meeting I will speak in detail concerning the way to practice the new way.
[45]  After you have baptized people and have brought them to salvation, the next thing you need to do is feed them.
[46]  In order to do this well, you need to be persons full of concern for people.
[47]  When you bring a person to salvation, the joy it gives you is the same as if you yourselves were being saved, and this person becomes your child begotten through the gospel.
[48]  When he rises up from baptism, you have to provide him with a lesson, helping him to know that he has a spirit, that he is now regenerated, that God is Spirit, and that this Spirit is His ultimate consummation.
[49]  If you will work on the groups according to what I have told you, I can guarantee you that bit by bit, like a little stream that flows steadily, our number will double every year.
[50]  You will continuously have new ones added to you.
[51]  IN THE DIVINE REVELATION Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:16-17; Col 1:25-26; Rev 22:18-19; Luke 24:45; Heb 5:13-14; Psalm 119:130; Acts 8:30-31 OUTLINE The sixty-six books of the Bible being the complete revelation of God which cannot be added to or subtracted from 2 Tim 3:16-17; Col 1:25-26; Rev 22:18-19.
[52]  In order to understand the Bible, we must exercise our spirit, have our mind opened, and have our faculties exercised Luke 24:45; Heb 5:13-14.
[53]  The following are examples of passages which require explanation: the seventy weeks, the epistle of Christ being written on the believers' hearts with the Spirit of the living God, Christ making His home in our hearts, being filled unto the fullness of God, the dispensation of the fullness of the times and being headed up in Christ, becoming God's chosen inheritance in Christ, the situation at the time of the seventh trumpet when the mystery of God is completed.
[54]  Based upon the experience of many believers throughout the ages, the most comprehensive way to read the Bible is: To be nourished daily in spiritual life by pray-reading two or three verses in a book of the Bible, in a sequential way, for ten to fifteen minutes every morning.
[55]  My main burden in this time is to give you some perfecting in the areas of truth and life.
[56]  In the first meeting, we will fellowship about being trained in the divine revelation, and in the second meeting, we will fellowship about being cultivated in the divine life.
[57]  Now I would like to show you the most comprehensive way to read the Bible based on the experience of believers throughout the ages.
[58]  CHAPTER EIGHT BEING CULTIVATED IN THE DIVINE LIFE Scripture Reading: Col 3:4a; Gal 2:20a; Phil 1:21a; Eph 3:17, 19; 4:15; Col 2:19; Eph 4:13; Col 1:28 OUTLINE Christ being our life Col 3:4a.
[59]  For to me to live being Christ Phil 1:21a.
[60]  We have been joined and mingled with Christ in life.
[61]  If we are not the lord in all things and do not act independently, allowing Christ to be the Lord and following Him, Christ will increase in us, and we will grow into Him, the Head, Christ, in all things Eph 4:15 .
[62]  Even in the small things, such as cutting and combing our hair, dressing ourselves, shopping, and contacting and speaking with others, we should allow Christ to be the Lord.
[63]  When we hold the Head, Christ, and grow into Him in all things, God will grow within us, and we will grow gradually in life and function through the increase of God's element within us Col 2:19 .
[64]  Although I do not have an outline for you, I do have a definite burden to fellowship with you in a thorough way.
[65]  I hope that you would understand that the way you are taking is not the way of Christianity, nor is it the way of any work.
[66]  The way you are taking is the way the Lord has recovered according to His word.
[67]  OF THOSE SERVING THE LORD Scripture Reading: Rom 3:23; John 17:22-23; 1 Cor 3:12-13, 17; Gal 5:26; Phil 2:2; 4:2; 1 Tim 3:6; 1 Cor 6:18-20; Gal 5:19-21 OUTLINE The two shortages: Coming short of the glory of God Rom 3:23; John 17:22-23.
[68]  Another shortage of those serving the Lord is destroying the temple of God.
[69]  Again it says, "If anyone's work shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss...If anyone destroys the temple of God, God shall destroy him" vv.
