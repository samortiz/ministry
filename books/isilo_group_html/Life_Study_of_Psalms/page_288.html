Christ, Who Is the Lord (Adonai)<br>and Who Is at God's Right Hand,<br>to Shatter Kings in the Day<br>of His Anger at His Coming Back<br>and to Execute Judgment among the Nations</H2><P>"The Lord is at Your right hand;/He will shatter kings in the day of His anger./He will execute judgment among the nations;/He will fill the place with corpses;/He will shatter the head/Over a great land" (Psa. 110:5-6). The words "great land" refer to the entire earth, the whole globe. Here we see that Christ, who is the Lord, the Master (Adonai), and who is at God's right hand, will shatter kings in the day of His anger at His coming back and will execute judgment among the nations (2:9, 12; Dan. 2:44; Rev. 2:26-27). This indicates that Christ will be the greatest Victor, overcoming all the nations, shattering the kings and the head of the enemies, and executing judgment upon all who oppose Him. In addition to being the King and the Priest, Christ is the Warrior to be the greatest Victor. According to Revelation 19, in His coming back He will be the fighting One. However, He will not fight alone against Antichrist and his armies from the nations. Rather, He will come with His bride, a composition of all His overcomers, as His army, and with her He will fight against Antichrist and his armies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Christ to Drink from the Brook by the Way<br>and to Lift Up His Head Triumphantly</H2><P>"He will drink from the brook by the way;/Therefore He will lift up His head" (Psa. 110:7). While Christ is fighting, He will be thirsty. Needing some water to drink, He will drink from "the brook by the way." This brook is the overcomers. Those who offer themselves in the splendor of consecration are the dew of the morning to water Christ, and the overcomers are the brook to quench His thirst. As Christ is taking the lead to fight through to the end, He will need water to drink, and this water will be the overcomers. I believe that this interpretation is correct because it fits in with the New Testament teaching.</P><P>When Christ drinks from the brook, "He will lift up His head." This means that He will be victorious. To lower our head is a sign of defeat, but to lift up our head is a sign of victory, of triumph. Those who lift up their head are the ones who overcome all the enemies.</P><P>To the enemies Christ is the Victor, but to us He is a Drinker. We may say to Him, "Hallelujah! Lord Jesus, You are the Victor." But He may say to us, "Yes, I am the Victor, but to you I would like to be the Drinker." In this psalm we see Christ as the King, the Priest, the Warrior, the Victor, and the Drinker. Christ overcomes the enemies, and He drinks from the overcomers, from the brook by the way.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_287.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_289.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 288</div><br></body></html>
