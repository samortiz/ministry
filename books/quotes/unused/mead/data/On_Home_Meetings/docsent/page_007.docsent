   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAUL PREACHING ONLY JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THIS ONE CRUCIFIED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the end of January 1985 I flew back to the United States from Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As soon as the plane took off, I already knew that the home meetings would develop to the present stage.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At first the home meetings recovered some who had not been meeting for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who had not met for twenty or thirty years came back to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How dear it was when they all came together, and how sweet it was to sing,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Blest be the tie that binds</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our hearts in Christian love....</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And perfect love and oneness reign</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through all eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hymns, #860</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If an old sister who had not been meeting for twenty years had sung this song, she would surely have burst into tears, and everyone else with her.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, beautiful flowers fade, a full moon wanes, and good things do not last.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The meeting was good the first time, the second time, the third time, but by the fourth time it had become tasteless.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And by the fifth time old wives fables had begun.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the church began to meet, the way begun by Peter was continued by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How do we know this?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1 Corinthians 2:1-2 Paul says, When I came to you, brothers...I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This tells us that Paul preached only one subject in the church at Corinth, that is, Jesus Christ and this One crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not speak about ethics, morality, philosophy, law, or Old Testament doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What he spoke and preached was Jesus Christ and this One crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BIG MEETINGS BEING FOR EXHIBITING CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>AND EACH ONE HAVING SOMETHING TO BRING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In chapter fourteen of the same Epistle Paul talks about the Christian meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When he speaks of the whole church being together in one place, he first speaks of the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What should be done in the big meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 26, Paul says: Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation....</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word has in this verse does not indicate to have in the future but to have in the present.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you come to a meeting, before leaving home you already have a psalm or a revelation; therefore, you bring them to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before the meeting you already have something.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not that you have nothing before the meeting, yet you bring your Bible and come empty-handed, thinking that because you have had a terrible week, you have nothing, but are assured that in the meeting you will receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus you sit in your seat and wait for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the meeting begins or the Holy Spirit moves within, you are inspired, and so you choose a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No, it is that before you leave for the meeting, you are one who already has, as described by a hymn: Whene er we meet with Christ endued....and thus exhibit Christ Hymns, #864 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This hymn was written according to the types of the Old Testament feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Each year the Israelites brought the produce of the land to the feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They brought cattle, sheep, grain, and new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They brought the produce of the good land and then exhibited all these riches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the produce typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The riches of the produce that they brought to the feast typifies the Christ brought to the New Testament meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our meetings should be an exhibition of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The big meetings spoken of by Paul are those to which each one brings Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, our big meetings are not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are somewhat like Christianity, with one man speaking and the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Paul s ministry there were not only big meetings but also home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We know this because in his Epistles he mentions the church in the home of a certain brother at least four times Rom 16:5; 1 Cor 16:19; Col 4:15; Philem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>2 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the church was in a brother s home, there certainly must have been home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From this you can see that there were big meetings and home meetings under the ministries of both Peter and Paul.</S>
