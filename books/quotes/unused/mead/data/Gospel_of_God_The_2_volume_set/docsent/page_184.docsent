   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>No teaching in the Bible can have the sinners as its starting point; all teachings must have the Lord Jesus as the starting point.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It would be terrible if sinners were taken as the starting point; but if the Lord Jesus is taken as the starting point, things will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we take the sinners as the starting point, the problem of sin will become obscure to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There will be many things that we will not consider as sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many filthy matters will be regarded as clean; many matters that are weak will be considered as very strong; many shameful things will be considered as glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even after we have become a Christian, we still consider many sinful things as glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With those who know God, there are still many sins which have not been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are still many sins that a Christian considers as glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a believer is unclear concerning the matter of sin, how much more will a sinner be unclear?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are many sins that God has already judged in the Lord Jesus, but that were not manifested as sins to us when we were sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only after we believed in the Lord Jesus have we become clear that those were sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we were sinners, we were not clear; only after we believed in the Lord Jesus were we clear.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, even Christians are not trustworthy; there are still many things which they do not see.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Concerning the losing of one's salvation, if we consider the matter from man's viewpoint, we will never see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we consider the truths of the Bible from our own viewpoint, everything will become confusing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may think that one thing is greater than others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is only when we consider things from the Lord's viewpoint that we will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The question is not whether one is able to keep his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The question is whether or not the Lord Jesus is able to guard his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The proper view is one which stems from the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If it is up to us to keep our salvation, we may not even be able to keep it for two hours, much less two days.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if it is the Lord Jesus who does the keeping, even if a righteous person were to stumble seven times a day, he would still be able to get up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not we who are able, but God who is able.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we turn towards ourselves, our eyes will be in the wrong direction.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible tells us that we should look away unto Jesus, who is the Author and Perfecter of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The keeping power is the Lord's and not ours.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can trust in God because it is God who keeps us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The question today is: What method is God using to keep us?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today we have given our life to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But how will God keep us until the day of the coming of the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no other way but for God to hide our life together with the Lord's life in Him Col 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As I read this verse, I am so overjoyed that I could laugh out loud.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nothing can be better than this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I do not know if many Christians know how good this verse is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is impossible to lose the life that God gave to us, because our life and that of the Lord are already hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I remember when I was still an unbeliever, as a student, once I finished writing something very important.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I told my schoolmate that it was a very important matter and that I would not sell it even for five thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I had to go out for a while, and I asked him to keep it safely for me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I gave him that sheet of paper and left.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I came back, I asked him for the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He said that he could not give it to me, because after I had said that it was so important, he soaked it in water and swallowed it into his stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He patted his stomach and assured me that the paper was there and that it would never be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That day I did not know whether to laugh or to cry about it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That sheet of paper was in his stomach; it would never be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But neither would it ever be taken out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was indeed very secure.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What God has done today is something more secure.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has hidden our life together with that of Christ in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Where can we find it now?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How could we lose it again?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God's life to us could only be lost if God Himself were lost.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thank God that God will never be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a result, the life He put within a Christian can never be lost either.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The life of a Christian is securely kept; it is kept in God.</S>
