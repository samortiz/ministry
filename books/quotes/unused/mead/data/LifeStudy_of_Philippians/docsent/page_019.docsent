   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 21 Paul goes on to say, For to me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The little word for at the beginning of this verse is important.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It indicates that what is to follow is an explanation of the preceding verse.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ could be magnified in Paul s body because Paul lived Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to magnify Christ, we must live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the matter of living Christ is of such tremendous importance, not many Christians have paid adequate attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word for in verse 21 helps us to see that Paul could magnify Christ because to him to live was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Paul s chained body Christ was exalted, extolled, praised, and appreciated because Paul lived Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we would live Christ, we must take Him as our person and be one person with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He and we must be one in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Galatians 2:20 Paul declared, Christ lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For Paul, this was not a mere doctrine; it was a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It should also be real to us that Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is sad that some Christians do not believe that Christ actually lives in them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Neither do they believe that we can abide in Christ and have Him abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the Bible tells us definitely that Christ is in us and lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, we should abide in Him and allow Him to abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul could say not only that Christ lived in him, but also that to him to live was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the one hand, Christ lived in Paul; on the other hand, Paul lived Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Inwardly Christ was Paul s life, and outwardly Christ was Paul s living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul and Christ thus had one life and one living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ s life was Paul s life, and Paul s living was Christ s living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The two, Christ and Paul, lived as one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First Corinthians 6:17 refers to such a living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this verse Paul says that we are one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The organic union that has taken place between us and Christ causes us to be so close and intimate with Him that we are even one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To live Christ is not merely to have a holy life or to live holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To live Christ is to live a person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We admit that the expression live Christ is new.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We use this term deliberately.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the past we have spoken of living out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although this expression is not incorrect, to add the word out may detract from the proper meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should simply live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should live a life which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From my experience I can testify that the most difficult thing in our Christian life is to practice to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may be holy, spiritual, and victorious without living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even though we may be holy, spiritual, and victorious, we are still the ones living our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are not living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By nature, I am a quick person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When my sister heard that I had turned to the Lord, she was happy and wanted to help me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In particular, she tried to help me with my natural quickness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She would not rebuke me or correct me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead, she would tell me about others who were slow in their speech and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Realizing what she was trying to do, I told the Lord that I regretted my quickness and asked Him to enable me to slow down.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But my behavior was like that of a monkey imitating a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although I could deliberately be slow for a few days, eventually I reverted to my natural quickness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because I had been born a quick person, I just could not make myself slow down.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the time my sister tried to help me, she was teaching me to be slow.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But she did not help me to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now, more than fifty years later, I can be slow and patient.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I can also control my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In a sense, I can be holy, spiritual, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But I have come to see that it is possible to do all this without living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In order to live Christ we must take Him as our person and as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although I have made progress in this matter, I admit that still my practice is not very successful.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Almost every morning I pray, Lord, I thank You for another day to practice living You.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Lord, in myself, I cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I ask You to remind me to live You and grant me the grace I need for this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have found, however, that soon after praying to the Lord in this way, I may go back to living myself instead of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Everything about my living may be good, and yet I may not live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I do not yet have the assurance to testify with Paul, To me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the Christian life it is easy to follow certain practices.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For example, we may realize that we are talkative and may adopt the practice of limiting our speech.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, we may succeed in restricting our talkativeness and yet fail to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is one thing to follow a certain practice; it is another thing to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God does not care for how holy, spiritual, or victorious we are in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Actually, to live in this way by self-effort is to strive to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What counts in the eyes of God is Christ and the living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Concerning the matter of living Christ, the situation of today s Christians is far from God s goal.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the reason we are fighting and struggling to enter into the genuine living of Christ in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God wants His people to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should not care for holiness, spirituality, or victory as things in themselves, and we should not care for our natural virtues or attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Instead, we should focus our whole attention on living Christ and care only to live Christ that He might be magnified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the book of Philippians Paul encourages us to think the one thing 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This one thing is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should care only to live Christ and magnify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Instead of pursuing holiness, spirituality, or victory, we should seek to live Christ and magnify Him always with all boldness, whether through life or through death.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God s desire today is that we live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Do not allow anything to distract you from the direct, personal experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Yes, we need to understand the background of Philippians and realize what is the present religious situation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We also need to discern between the different preachings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But none of this should distract us from Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Today we need to focus our attention on the one thing to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>AND CIRCUMCISION</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Paul s life was to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>To him, to live was Christ, not the law or circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He would not live the law but would live Christ, not be found in the law but be found in Christ 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Christ was not only his life within, but also his living without.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He lived Christ because Christ lived in him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He was one with Christ both in life and in living.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He and Christ had one life and one living.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They lived together as one person.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Christ lived within him as his life, and he lived Christ without as His living.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The normal experience of Christ is to live Him, and to live Him is to magnify Him always, regardless of the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When Paul was in prison, he was living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Therefore, he could be found not in the law, but in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>At any time, men, angels, and demons could find him in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We also need to be found by others in Christ, not simply in our good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Young people, your parents should find you in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>They should sense that there is something different about you.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>All of our relatives, friends, and colleagues should find us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If we would be found in Christ, we must live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Only when we live Christ shall we be found in Him by others and by the angels and demons.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>However, if we are law-keepers, we shall be found in the law instead of in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We are not here to express the law or magnify the law; our goal is to express Christ and magnify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We all need to pray, Lord, have mercy on me and rescue me both from sinful things and from good things, even spiritual things, that replace You in my daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Lord, rescue me from everything back to Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Also, I ask You to grant me the grace each day that I may truly live You and be found in You.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>I can testify that this kind of prayer is effective.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Let us all seek the one thing and pursue the one thing to live Christ and magnify Him.</S>
