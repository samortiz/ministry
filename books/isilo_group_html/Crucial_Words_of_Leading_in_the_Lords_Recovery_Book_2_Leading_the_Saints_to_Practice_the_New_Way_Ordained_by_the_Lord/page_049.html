THE MINISTRY OF THE OLD TESTAMENT,<br />
THE MINISTRY OF DEATH AND OF CONDEMNATION</h2>
<p>Since the ministry of the New Testament is of the Spirit, it is a ministry of justification, not a ministry of condemnation. In the New Testament the result of justification is that man may have life. Romans 5:18 says, &ldquo;As it was through one offense unto condemnation to all men, so also it was through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men.&rdquo; Justification is for us to have life. The ministry of the New Testament is in contrast to the ministry of the Old Testament. The ministry of the Old Testament is of the letter and of death. Second Corinthians 3:7 and 9 reveal that the ministry of the Old Testament, the ministry in letters and of death, condemns, whereas the ministry of the New Testament justifies. The ministry of condemnation is unto death; the ministry of justification is unto life. These are the ministry in the Old Testament and the ministry in the New Testament. Since the creation of all things and man, God has had only two ministries: the Old Testament ministry and New Testament ministry. The Old Testament ministry ministers law to people, which condemns people and puts them under death; the New Testament ministry ministers the Spirit to people, which justifies them and gives them life so that they may become members of the Body of Christ to constitute the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>We need to know these points to the extent that they are constituted into our entire being. In Christianity, throughout the whole earth, you can hardly find any books or hear any speaking concerning these matters. The New Testament ministry is absolutely part of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and can be considered the theology of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING UNIQUELY ONE</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:1 indicates that the ministry of the New Testament is uniquely one. This ministry began with the preaching of repentance by John the Baptist, was continued by the work of the Lord Jesus on earth, and was brought on further by the works of the twelve apostles, who were chosen directly by Him, as well as of those who were with them. All these works are included in this ministry. We, the apostle Paul, his fellow apostles, and all those under their leading are included in this ministry. Do not think that we are being led by a particular brother; this is altogether wrong. We are being led by the apostle Paul. In other words, until the full manifestation of the new heaven and new earth, the works of all those who belong to God should be part of &ldquo;this ministry&rdquo; (Acts 1:17, 25; 2 Cor. 4:1).</p>
<p>In Ephesians 4:12 Paul does not use the word <em>this;</em> instead, he says, &ldquo;Unto the work of the ministry.&rdquo; Here the sense conveyed by <em>the ministry</em> is stronger than that conveyed by <em>this ministry. The work of the ministry</em> implies that the work of the ministry is unique. Because the sun and the moon are unique, we speak of them as &ldquo;the sun&rdquo; and &ldquo;the moon,&rdquo; not as &ldquo;this sun&rdquo; or &ldquo;this moon.&rdquo; Likewise, the work of the ministry is simply the work of <em>the</em> ministry, which is uniquely one.</p>
<p>The apostles are the many ministers of the New Testament. There is one ministry, but there are many ministers. The singular <em>ministry</em> refers to the matter, the work; the plural <em>ministers</em> refer to those who carry out the ministry. Paul uses both of these words. In 2 Corinthians 3:6 he says that the Lord &ldquo;has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant,&rdquo; and in Acts 20:24 he says, &ldquo;In order that I may finish...the ministry,&rdquo; that is, the New Testament ministry.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:1 Paul says, &ldquo;Having this ministry as we have been shown mercy.&rdquo; Here <em>we</em> refers to the ministers, that is, the apostles. <em>This ministry</em> is singular and includes the ministry of John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus, the twelve apostles, the other disciples under their leading, Paul and his fellow apostles, and all those under their leading; we are also included among them. This is the ministry spoken of in the New Testament and is what Ephesians 4:12 refers to when it says, &ldquo;Unto the work of the ministry.&rdquo; The apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers are all for the perfecting of the saints. The next phrase reads, &ldquo;Unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; According to Greek grammar, <em>unto the work of the ministry</em> and <em>unto the building up of the Body of Christ</em> are in apposition, meaning that the latter refers to the former. This means that the work of the ministry is for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 2: Leading the Saints to Practice the New Way Ordained by the Lord &nbsp; pg 49</div><br></body></html>
