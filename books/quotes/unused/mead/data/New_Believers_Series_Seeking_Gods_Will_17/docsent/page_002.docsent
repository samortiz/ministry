   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Arrangements in the Environment</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Luke 12:6 says, "Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 10:29 says, "Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If one assarion could buy two sparrows, then by right two assaria should only buy four sparrows.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the Lord said two assaria could buy five sparrows.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One assarion buys two, and two assaria buy four plus an additional one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This shows us the cheapness of a sparrow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, even a cheap thing such as a sparrow is not allowed to fall to the earth if God forbids it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although the fifth sparrow is an extra one that is given for free, no sparrow is forgotten by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If our God does not allow it, no sparrow can fall to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This clearly shows us that everything happens under God's permission.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If our heavenly Father forbids it, even a sparrow will not fall to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is difficult to number a person's hairs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the Lord said, "Even the hairs of your head are all numbered" Matt 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No one knows how many hairs he has, and no one can count his own hairs, but God has counted and numbered our hairs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our God is so fine and so exact!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If God takes care of a seemingly worthless creature such as a sparrow, how much more will He take care of His children!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If God takes care of something as minute as a hair, how much more will He take care of other things!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once we believe in the Lord, we need to learn to know His will through the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nothing that happens to us is a coincidence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everything is measured by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our career, spouse, parents, children, relatives, friends, and everything have been ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Behind everything that happens to us each day is God's sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we have to learn to read God's will in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A new believer may not be that experienced in the leading of the Spirit, and he may not know that much of the teaching of the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But at least he can see God's hand in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a believer's most basic lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Psalm 32:9 says, "Do not be like a horse or like a mule, without understanding;/Whose trappings consist of bit and bridle to constrain them,/Else they do not come near you."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many times we are just like a horse or a mule, without understanding, and must be harnessed with outward bit and bridle by God before we can avoid mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Have you ever seen a duck farmer?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has a long stick in his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the ducks wander to the left or to the right, he herds them back with his stick.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The ducks have no choice but to take the right path.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the same way, we can commit ourselves to the Lord and tell Him, "Lord, I am truly like a horse or a mule that has no understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But I do not want to make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I want to know Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please harness me with Your bit and pull me with Your bridle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once You let go of me, I will take the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Please guard me with Your will and direct me into Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I wander away, I want You to stop me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I do not know many things, but I know what pain feels like.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I reject Your will, please come in and stop me!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brothers and sisters, we must never belittle God's arrangement in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even though we may have fallen into shame and may have become like a horse or a mule, we often can still count on God's mercy to bridle us in time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God uses the environment to stop us from making mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He forces us to have no alternative but to follow Him.</S>
