   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WRONG CONCEPT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I do not believe that the Lord will use the gifts very much in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He will reveal Himself to the seeking ones as life, and this life will be expressed in love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not a human kind of love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This love is simply God Himself, living in us and expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must abandon the concept that gifts are the only requirement for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Gifts alone and, even more, the teachings cannot build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Teaching divides and causes division.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every denomination has been established by a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Church history shows that whenever and wherever there was a great teacher, there was a division.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Teaching divides, but love unites and builds up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The only thing that builds up is love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the love of which we are speaking and the love the Bible teaches is not human love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This love is God Himself; so to realize this love, we must relinquish all other things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not trust in anything but love for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not put our trust in gifts or teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some have been teaching for years, but where is one genuine church built up by teaching?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christianity is not new; it has been here for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But where is the church built up by teachings?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>History shows that teachings and gifts have not been effective in the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should never put our trust in these things, but rather in love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord be merciful to us that we may drop all distracting things and come back to love just love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all must realize that nothing can build up the church but love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ephesians 4:16 tells us it is in love that the Body builds itself up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the problem is that we are so religious and natural.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We still have the concept that we need teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Others condemn us and say that we are exclusive and do not accept all ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if we were to invite the best speakers on earth to come and speak to us, the church would simply be a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose we have twelve good, spiritual, sound and fundamental teachers speak to us every month for a year.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am afraid that by the next year, the church will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only love edifies and builds up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not merely the gifts, the teachings or the ministries that build up the church; it is love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First Corinthians 13 says that even if I know mysteries and have all knowledge and prophecy, yet without love, I am nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As far as the building up of the Body is concerned, without love I am nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These things alone cannot build up the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must all change our concept so that we do not put so much trust in teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Body can only be built up in love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we would love, we must give up many things of the teachings and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not trust in anything more than love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Look at the situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Where is the church that is built up by teaching?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the past nineteen years of experience in Formosa, those who thought they had a gift of teaching became troublemakers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There was not one exception.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They proclaimed that they had the gift, but they did not help the work much.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The work was mostly carried on by those who did not claim to have a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They just learned to serve the Lord by being what they were.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They did not consider themselves as gifted persons, but just served the Lord in love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, we see that it is not the gift, but love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the churches on the island of Formosa do not have much trust in gifts, because by past experience they saw that all the trouble came from the so-called gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we are going to practice the church life, our concept must be one hundred percent turned.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not trust much in any teaching or gift.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They do not work so well.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The real building comes from love, simply love.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must drop the concept that teachings, gifts and other things can help much in the building up of the church.</S>
