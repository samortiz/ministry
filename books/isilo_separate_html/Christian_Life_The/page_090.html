Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit for the purpose of indwelling us. If Christ as the God-man had never become the Spirit, how could He be our life within us? There would be no possibility of His dwelling in us if He were not the Spirit.</P><P>In Romans 8:9 Paul speaks of the Spirit of God dwelling in us and of our having the Spirit of Christ. Then in verse 10 he said, "If Christ is in you." "The Spirit of Christ" and "Christ" are interchangeably used. This means that the Spirit of Christ is Christ. These two titles refer to the same person. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, "The Lord is the Spirit." Then verse 18 speaks of "the Lord Spirit." This shows that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord Christ. First Corinthians 6:17 says, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit." How can we be identified with Christ? There is no way but in the life-giving Spirit.</P><P>Furthermore, in the Lord's revelation to us in His recovery, He has gone further to show us that this life-giving Spirit is the compound Spirit, compounded with Christ's divinity, with Christ's humanity, with Christ's human living, with Christ's death, with the effectiveness of Christ's death, with Christ's resurrection, and with the power of Christ's resurrection (see Philippians 1:19 and note 194). Thus, He is the compound Spirit. Since we have such a compounded Spirit, we lack nothing. In Him we have God, the uplifted humanity, Christ's death, the effectiveness of His death, Christ's resurrection, and the power of His resurrection. Everything we need is here. We have to realize that in this pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit, the compound Spirit, the death of Christ is available to us every day.</P><P>In these messages we are not burdened to merely teach the Bible. We want to expound all these things so that we would realize that the Spirit whom we are enjoying every day is a compound Spirit. This may be likened to a "compound" tea. When we drink the tea, we receive the elements of lemon, tea, and water since they have been compounded together. Similarly, as we drink the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13b), we receive all of His elements, which include the death of Christ with its effectiveness and the resurrection of Christ with its power. Thus, as we are drinking the Spirit, we are dying to live. In the next message, we will continue our fellowship on our need to live and walk under the crucifixion of Christ.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_089.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_091.html">Next</a> </body></html>
