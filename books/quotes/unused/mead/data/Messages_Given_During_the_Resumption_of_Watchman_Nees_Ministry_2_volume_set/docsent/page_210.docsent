   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A man learns restriction first through his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is most difficult for a man to control his tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A tongue that is under control only dares to speak words of the learned Isa 50:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first thing we have to see is that a person who is rebellious in his speaking is one who has given himself away.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not Speaking Reviling Words</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was in London, I met a couple who would not submit to the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The husband was a good man, and the wife was also a good sister.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The only trouble was that they were too talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They testified that whenever they spoke contradicting words, their spirit became a contradicting spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to see today that, as soon as our words come out, our spirit comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both 2 Peter and Jude as well talk about the matter of reviling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Reviling is done through our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are not careful, and we revile the brothers ahead of us, the oneness of the church will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Withstanding Reviling Words</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who take in reviling words bear the same responsibility as those who speak reviling words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is one thing for a person to dump trash on others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is another thing for a person to receive trash from others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One of the reasons the church is divided and damaged is that there are reviling words.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order for the church to maintain the oneness, the brothers and sisters have to withstand reviling words.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Example of Michael</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Michael was an archangel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the beginning, he was under Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although Satan fell, Michael did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moses' body was probably left on the Mount of Transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Michael could not revile Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He could only say, "The Lord rebuke you" Jude 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He had to invoke a higher authority to rebuke Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From this we see the importance of our words.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Reviling Words Damaging the Body</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some people's tongues are "waxed"; they are very cunning.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This kind of people never know or understand the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They unconsciously damage the Body with their words.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is bad enough for a man to have a wound.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if one rubs sand on the wound, the hurt will be greater.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The same is true when one speaks reviling words.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a man's tongue is not under control, all other kinds of controls are useless James 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Man's tongue is the most cunning of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A double-tongued person will soon find that he has no one he can perfect; he will have turned away every possible person he could have perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you are an inquisitive person and one with an itching ear, you would want others to talk to you and to entertain you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But those who have learned the lessons should rebuke you to your face.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One needs not go on speaking when he is in front of an inquisitive person; his words can stop right there.</S>
