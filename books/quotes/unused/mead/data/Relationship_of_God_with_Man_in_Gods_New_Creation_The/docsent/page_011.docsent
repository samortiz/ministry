   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE WAY FOR GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE MINGLED WITH MAN 1 THE LIGHT OF LIFE LIFE BEING THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THAT GOD MINGLES HIMSELF WITH US</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s intention is to mingle Himself with us so that we may be one with Him to become His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter we will begin to consider the way that God mingles with man, that is, how He accomplishes this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although it is correct to say that He accomplishes this mingling through the Spirit and by Christ s death on the cross, the main thing we must stress is that God s way to mingle Himself with us is by life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Life is a great subject in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God became life to us so that He could mingle Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may illustrate this by the physical food that we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order for an apple to be mingled with us, it must be life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to eat and digest it and allow it to become a life element to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then the apple will enter into our blood and will become one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the genuine mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may say that we are mingled with many cows, chickens, fish, eggs, apples, peaches, etc. For us to be mingled with a chicken does not require both the chicken and us to be chopped up and then mixed together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This would not be a mingling but a killing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order for us to be mingled with something, we need to take that thing as our life so that it becomes our content.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The matter of mingling has been lost in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many Christians today speak in different ways about Christ and God, but they neglect the fact that God in Christ is life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even though some may say that Christ is life, many times they do not understand what they are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, the matter of life is difficult to speak about.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To speak concerning our physical body is easy, but it is difficult to speak about our physical life because life is abstract and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all know that we have a physical life, but it is difficult to define our physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because it is difficult to define and explain the matter of Christ and God being life to us, this matter has been lost in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE PRIMARY MATTER IN THE SCRIPTURES</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Scriptures the primary matter is that God is life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After God created man, the first picture revealed to us concerning God is that God is life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the record of Genesis chapters one and two, God created man in His own image 1:26 , using the dust of the ground to form man s body and God s breath of life to form man s spirit, with the result that man became a living soul 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is significant that after creating man, God did not tell man to worship and serve Him or to do good things to please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, God told man to take care of his eating, implying that God wanted man to eat the tree of life, which signifies God as life to created man vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>8-9, 16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God intended that created man would take God into him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must be clear that God has no intention to ask us to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even though some may argue that there are passages in the Scriptures that tell us to serve God, this is not what is in God s mind or heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God intends that we come to Him to receive Him and take Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we take Him as life, the more we please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Mankind always thinks that he must do something for God, that he must work, serve, and worship God cf.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Luke 15:17-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We simply do not understand God s heart, mind, or desire.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God s heart and desire are that He would be life to us, that we would receive Him and take Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, in John chapter six, when the Lord Jesus fed five thousand people with five loaves and two fish, the Jewish people considered this to be a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They thought that Jesus was a great prophet, and they wanted to force Him to be King v. 15 . But the Lord indicated that, instead of coming as a great prophet or a great king, He came to be small pieces of bread to be eaten by them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>32-35, 48-51, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord does not want to be enthroned by us in an outward way; rather, He desires to be eaten by us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today many in Christianity praise Christ for His greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, whatever we take in as food must be small, certainly smaller than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, the human concept is absolutely different from the divine thought.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The human concept is that God is great and that we must serve and worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The divine thought is that God desires to come into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to be life to us, God became small, as small as a piece of bread or fruit Rev 22:2 , for us to take and eat.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although God s being life to us in Christ through the Spirit is unsearchably rich, the picture in John chapter six shows that this matter also involves smallness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The one who contributed the five loaves and two fish was not a great man but a little boy v. 9 , indicating something small yet rich.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There were only five loaves and two small fish, but five thousand men with women and children were all filled, and still there were twelve baskets left over vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>10-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the way in which Christ is life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THE BIBLE BEING A BOOK OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Bible is a book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Bible begins with the tree of life and also ends with the tree of life, proving that it is a book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Throughout the Scriptures there is a line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After man was created, he was put in front of a tree of life, which is the symbol of God in Christ as the Spirit being life to us Gen 2:9; John 15:1; 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When Christ came, He told us that He came that we may have life and have it abundantly 10:10 and that He is the life 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>John 1:4 also tells us that life is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, Christ came that we may have life, the life is in Christ, and Christ is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This gospel tells us to believe in Him so that we may have life, the eternal life 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we have the Son of God, we have life, and if we do not have the Son of God, we do not have life 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The apostle Paul tells us that Christ is our life Col 3:4 and even that it is Christ who lives in us Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Finally, at the end of the Scriptures there is the tree of life again, with the flow of the living water Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
