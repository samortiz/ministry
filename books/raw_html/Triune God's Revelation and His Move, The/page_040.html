<h2 class=head4>e. Giving Paul a Further Vision of the Macedonian Call to Direct His Gospel Trip to Europe</h2><p>The Lord gave Paul a further vision, the vision of the Macedonian call (Acts 16:6-10), to direct his gospel trip from Asia to eastern Europe. Then he evangelized eastern Europe, leaving Illyricum not touched (Rom. 15:19). Then by his fourth gospel trip he covered Rome through his Roman exile. Paul had a gospel trip by being exiled. In his exile he did not consider himself a prisoner. Rather, he considered himself a preacher of Christ, a spreader of Christ, a spreader of all the things he had seen as revelations and visions from God. God was sovereign, putting him into exile. Eventually, that exile became Paul’s last gospel journey. By this he brought the gospel more strongly to western Europe, leaving Spain not touched, although he expected to cover that land which, according to the map at that time, was considered the uttermost part of the earth (Rom. 15:24, 28).<h2 class=head3>2. Being Motivated by the Triune God’s Revelations and Visions</h2><p>All the saints should be motivated by the Triune God’s revelations and visions to join with Him for His move to accomplish His New Testament economy on the earth. Today almost all the countries of this world, except the Muslim countries, have been evangelized. Nearly every place is filled with Christians. Since this is the case, what are our revelation and our vision today? Our revelation and vision have been greatly uplifted in the last three years because we have seen the high peaks of God’s revelation. These are mainly concerning God becoming a man so that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead. This is the center of the high peaks of the divine revelation among us.<p>Today our vision is to go to tell the high-peak truths to the Christians. This is what we have been doing in Russia for the past few years. We need to enlighten those in Christianity with the high peaks of the divine revelation. There is a hot market for these high peaks today. Wherever we go today, we will be greatly welcomed if we can speak these high peaks.<p>All the groups in Christianity have been stranded on their own sands, like a boat stranded on sands in shallow water. The Catholic Church is stranded on their sands of superstitions. Most of the Protestant churches are stranded on the sands of superficiality. They are not deep; they are too shallow, on the surface. Nearly all the Protestant churches are stranded in their kind of lukewarm theology.<p>Many seeking Christians, dear brothers, in the denominations are seeking something higher, deeper, and richer than what they have heard and possess. They are tired of shallow things. If we tell them the high-peak truths, they will wake up. At first, they may oppose but gradually they will find the truth. Then what shall we do? We have to learn the high peaks of God’s present revelation and learn to speak these things. We have to go, and we have to speak. I believe that the high peaks of today’s revelation will become the hottest market among today’s Christians.<p>Of course, to do such a high mission work, we have to be prepared to encounter all kinds of difficulties. But I took Psalm 84:6 as a blessing in these kinds of hardships: “Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a place of springs; yea, the early rain covereth it with blessings” (Heb.). The valley of Baca is the valley of tears. The ones mentioned in Psalm 84 passed through a way full of tears, sufferings, but they made it a place of springs. The brothers who went to Russia can testify that they took a pathway through the valley of tears, but their stay there for the past four years has made Russia a place of springs with the early rains of blessing. I would encourage all of us to pick up this high commission: to go out with the high peaks of the divine revelation and with God’s up-to-date vision to move with God for His high peaks of the divine revelation that will consummate His eternal economy.<p>In this series of messages we have seen the Old Testament and the New Testament facts. Then we have seen the revelations based upon the Old Testament facts and the new revelations based upon the New Testament facts. We have also seen the visions with God’s move in the Old Testament and the New Testament visions with God’s move in the New Testament. This move consummates many things on this earth through the Lord’s heavenly ministry to establish many churches and to build up the Body of Christ. But many have been stranded on the sands of superstition, superficiality, and lukewarm theology. How can this situation be rescued? The only way is for us to see the high peaks of God’s revelation and to see that God’s vision in the New Testament is to bring forth all these high peaks of God’s revelation to all the Christians.
