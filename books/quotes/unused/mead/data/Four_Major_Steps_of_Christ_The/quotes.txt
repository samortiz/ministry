[1]  It is my burden that in the following messages we should see something very basic in the work of Christ.
[2]  In that plan God purposed to express Himself through His Son Jesus Christ and to have Jesus Christ expressed through a group of people.
[3]  Although it had been planned in eternity past by God and was accomplished by Christ, yet it must be realized in us by the Holy Spirit.
[4]  Now we come to the second point of this first major step of Christ.
[5]  In the incarnation of Christ, God is expressed in a man.
[6]  In the Gospel of John we are told that the Lord is the Word of God, that this Word is God Himself John 1:1 , and that one day He became a man John 1:14 .
[7]  First, we must see how it was accomplished in Christ.
[8]  After that, not much is said of Him until He was thirty years of age, but we believe that during those early years He must have been filled with the Holy Spirit.
[9]  We have been born of the Holy Spirit and perhaps have some experience of being filled with the Holy Spirit, yet we must learn this lesson: if we are going to be used by God to fulfill His purpose in this age, we must once more hand ourselves over to the Lord that He might bring us to an end. We must be put to death and buried.
[10]  Inwardly, we must have the life of God in us through the Spirit of life and we must be filled with this Spirit of life.
[11]  Christ had to die in order to bring the old creation, including mankind, to an end. Only then could He produce a new creation.
[12]  Christ's death on the cross, therefore, means that the whole creation as represented in Christ was brought to an end. Through, by, and in the death of Christ we and the whole creation were terminated.
[13]  We have seen the reasons for Christ's death; now let us go on to another point regarding His crucifixion the all-inclusiveness of His death.
[14]  Now the question is, how can we apply this death of Christ?
[15]  It was accomplished once for all by Christ on the cross, but how do we apply it personally today?
[16]  Let us remember that it was through the eternal Spirit that Christ offered Himself Heb 9:14 to die on the cross.
[17]  Thus, it is only through the Holy Spirit that it is possible for us to apply the death of Christ to ourselves.
[18]  The death of Christ is not in our mentality; it is in the Spirit of Christ.
[19]  Even as all things were created through Christ and brought to death in Christ, so now all things are resurrected in Christ.
[20]  This is the divine thought: to create all things in Christ, to bring all things to death in Christ, and then to resurrect all things in Christ.
[21]  We are dead to everything of Adam and raised up to everything of Christ, because we are joined to God in Christ through the Holy Spirit.
[22]  About 25 years ago a brother asked me if I had experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[23]  After Christ ascended to heaven, He baptized His whole Body by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit Acts 2:1-4, 16-18, 33 , and it was by this baptism in the Holy Spirit that all the members were formed into one Body 1 Cor 12:13 .
[24]  Christ told His disciples that if He did not go away, the Holy Spirit would not come John 16:7 .
[25]  The resurrection of Christ is for the regeneration of living members for the Body, while the ascension of Christ brings down the Holy Spirit of power so that we may be baptized into one Body.
[26]  We must realize that there are two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit.
[27]  If we would be a living, functioning member of the Body of Christ, we must be filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit as life, and we must be clothed outwardly with the Holy Spirit as power.
[28]  Perhaps you are now wanting to ask, "How can we have this kind of experience?"
[29]  For the filling of the Holy Spirit inwardly, you only need: 1 to learn how to exercise your spirit to contact the Lord in a living way, and 2 to deny yourself continually.
[30]  On the day of Pentecost, Christ the Head baptized the Jewish part of His Body in the Holy Spirit; and in Cornelius' house, Christ the Head baptized the Gentile part of the Body in the Holy Spirit.
[31]  In the five cases of Acts, only two are called the baptism in the Holy Spirit; the other three cases include the laying on of hands.
[32]  If we would experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, we must realize that the Lord today is ascended, that He is the Lord and Head of all to the church, and we must stand in a right position in respect to the Body.
