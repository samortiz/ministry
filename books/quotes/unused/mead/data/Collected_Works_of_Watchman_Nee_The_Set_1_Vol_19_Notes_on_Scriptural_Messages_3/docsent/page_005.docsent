   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"THAT THERE WOULD BE NO DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE BODY"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 CORINTHIANS 12:25</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In studying the book of 1 Corinthians in the past, we have seen the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can advance individually, but no growth is independent of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, my mouth eats, but my whole being is also eating.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Can I say that my mouth eats but that my whole being does not eat?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When my hand works, my whole being works.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When my feet walk, my whole being walks.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The move of one member is the move of the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have used this example before: when I take a check to the bank to cash, the cashier gives me the money.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do just my hands receive the money?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Will the cashier say, "I am giving your hands the money; I am not giving it to you"?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Are there any cashiers who would say this?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone would acknowledge that when my hands receive the money, I receive the money.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is an important truth in the Bible: the growth of one member is the growth of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When two eyes see, the whole body sees.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When two ears hear, the whole body hears.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the mouth speaks, the whole body is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the hands work, the whole body works.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When one member moves, the whole body receives the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, a person cannot live an individual life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the work and conduct of a member is related to the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why there is a need for the same care for each other.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You cannot be independent and presume that you have nothing to do with the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You should not cause the whole Body to fail by your own failures.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the eyes are blind, the whole body is blind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord says that you should testify.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet you do not open your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you turn back, the whole Body turns back.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The mouth eats, but the whole body receives the nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The nose smells, but the whole body senses the aroma.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The ears hear music, but the whole person enjoys the music.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Body that is, the Body of Christ has a universal aspect and a local aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When one meeting suffers, the church suffers as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whatever a person eats, smells, and hears affects his whole body; similarly, the goodness, evil, progress, and fall of an individual Christian affect the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should be willing to follow the Lord alone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But we should take care of the pace of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some are too individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are accustomed to fighting and doing things by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They do not care for the other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They have forgotten that they are just members.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let me say an honest word: we should soar like an eagle in the sky, advance spiritually, and obey God individually.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we should also humbly wait for the other brothers and sisters and go on and obey God corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brothers, have you seen the relationship between a member and the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have mentioned these three points to show us the corporate and individual life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should maintain the individual part of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the same time, we should pay attention to the corporate part of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On one hand, we should pay any price to allow God to gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But on the other hand, we should also pay any price to gain the oneness of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not think that you can monopolize everything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The whole body is not the eyes, and the whole body is not the ears.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not neglect God's side, and we should not neglect man's side.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May God bless us so that we know the preciousness of the individual life as well as of the corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May we not annul the corporate life by our individual life, and may we not annul the individual life by our corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us be a turned cake.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are only cooked on one side and are not turned, God will not be pleased with us.</S>
