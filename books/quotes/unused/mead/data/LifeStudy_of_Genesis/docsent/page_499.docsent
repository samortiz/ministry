   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Bearing the Name of Christ's God,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Name of the City of Christ's God,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and Christ's New Name</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Revelation 3:12 the Lord said that He would write upon the overcomer "the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Revelation Christ called God, "My God" because in this book He stands on the position of a sent One, as One sent by God to accomplish His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord also held to this position in the four Gospels, always standing on the ground of One who had been sent by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He had been sent by God and from with God to accomplish God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He never acted according to His own will, but always according to God's will John 6:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even when He was on the cross, He said, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also must stand on this position today, saying, "I am a sent one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have been sent by the Lord to accomplish His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have no other position, opinion, or concept.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is His will, not my will, that must be done."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To say, "My God," indicates that we do not act on our own; it indicates that we are doing the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are not working for our career; we are accomplishing His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Having the name "My God" written upon you designates you as this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You, like the Lord Jesus when He was on earth, are not doing your own will, but are accomplishing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You do not act on your own, but constantly walk in God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the significance of the name of "My God."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord also promised to write upon the overcomer the name of the New Jerusalem, the city of His God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is deep.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It means that the New Jerusalem is a building, not according to any man's will, but according to the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All those built into this city are people like the Jesus revealed in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They do not act according to their own will, but according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only those who are like this are qualified to be labeled with the name of the city of Christ's God, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Finally, in Revelation 3:12 the Lord promised to write upon the overcomer His new name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are the kind of person described in this message, we shall surely have new experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Most Christians have only the limited experience of Christ as their Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not many have the experience of Christ as their life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Most of those who do experience Christ as life experience this in a shallow way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How long is your experience of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Your experience of Him should not be a mere fraction of an inch; it must be many miles in length.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is not only our Redeemer and our life He is our King, Prophet, Priest, light, power, righteousness, holiness, transformation, and many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some hymns in our hymnal list more than fifty items of what Christ is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more you experience Christ, the newer He will be to you, and the more His name will be written upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Firstly, Christ as Redeemer is written upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Later, Christ as life, light, humility, patience, and love will also be written upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His name is inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The writing of His name upon you depends upon your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more you experience Him, the longer will be the writing of this name.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is like a movie camera that operates as long as the automobile in which the photographer sits is moving.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the automobile stops, the camera stops as well.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No one can say what is the new name of Christ spoken of in this verse because it is simply the designation of your new experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you experience Christ in a certain way, that aspect of Christ will become your designation, the new name written upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we would become pillars, we need to be transformed by having Christ added into us again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way our experience of Christ will be lengthened, and we shall say, "Not my will, but His will"; we shall not act on our own, but according to His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then the name of God, the name of the city of God, and the Lord's new name will be written upon us.</S>
