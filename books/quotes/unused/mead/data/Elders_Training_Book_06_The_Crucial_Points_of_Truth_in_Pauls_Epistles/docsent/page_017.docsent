   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CRUCIFIED OUT OF WEAKNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The next crucial point is found in 13:4 which says, For indeed He was crucified out of weakness, but He lives by the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Apparently this portion of the Word is easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However there is a difficult element here.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ was crucified out of, or because of, weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If Christ had not been weak, He would never have been arrested.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Weakness here is the weakness of the body, the same as in 10:10.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For Himself Christ did not need to be weak in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But for accomplishing redemption on our behalf, He was willing to be weak in His body that He might be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If He was not willing to be weak, how could He have been crucified?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was crucified out of weakness, but He lives by the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul told the Corinthians that he followed Christ to be weak in Him for their sake.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 4 continues, For indeed we are weak in Him, but we shall live together with Him by the power of God toward you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>TESTING YOURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>WHETHER YOU ARE IN THE FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The crucial point in 13:5 is closely related to the previous point.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 5 says, Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves; or do you not recognize yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The crucial and difficult point here is the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What does it mean to test yourselves whether you are in the faith?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verses 6 and 7 continue, But I hope that you will know that we are not disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we pray to God that you do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do what is good, and we may be as disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is one of the hardest portions in the New Testament for New Testament readers to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Corinthians altogether lived not only in the natural life but also in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They considered that Paul was not so strong, not so excellent as an apostle, and even unlearned.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Most Bible teachers agree that Paul was a short man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Perhaps Peter may have been a taller man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this sense, Peter may have been more preferable than Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Also, Apollos may have seemed to be more learned than Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Among the Corinthians, some may have admired Peter as a giant, and others may have admired Apollos as a learned one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, Paul may not have been admired among them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul was certainly not unlearned, but he did not behave in a way to display his learning.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In these two books he told us that when he came to the Corinthians he did not come with excellency of speech 1 Cor 2:1, 2 Cor 11:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He had the proper knowledge, but he did not apply it in his speech.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He had the adequate education, but he did not seem to use it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason the Corinthians considered him as weak.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul, standing on this point, told them that he was indeed weak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, he charged the Corinthians to test themselves whether they were in the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In doing this Paul was wise.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When he said this, he actually was asking them to test themselves whether they were in the faith related to knowing the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Apparently in verse 5 he did not ask the Corinthians to test themselves concerning knowing the apostles, but concerning knowing themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, if one is in the faith, he would not consider anyone, including himself, according to appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In chapter five Paul says that we know no one according to flesh 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We know persons not by what we can see, but by what we cannot see.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Faith is the substantiating of things not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul asked the Corinthians to test themselves whether or not they were in the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If they were in the faith, they would not consider themselves by what they saw or by what they felt.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather they would consider themselves by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They needed to be in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If they would have considered themselves not by faith and not in faith, they may have said that Christ was not in them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They may not have felt it to be so, and even the more they could not have seen it to be so.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They needed to be persons in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Just as they should have considered themselves in the faith, so also they should have done the same concerning the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The apostles should be regarded not according to sight or appearance, but rather in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Such a brother as Paul appeared to be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if you would consider him by faith, you would realize that he is powerful, not in himself but in the One who is in him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To consider others in this way, you must first test yourself, by considering yourself in the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Corinthians regarded Paul according to the outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They regarded others in this way because they had never considered themselves by faith rather than by sight.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is why Paul told them to test themselves not by appearance but by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If they would not have tested themselves in the way of faith, they would have concluded that they were in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It would have seemed to them that they were not in Christ, that they had nothing to do with Christ, and that Christ was not in them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They would have considered that only the flesh and the natural life were in them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, the Corinthians did not consider themselves in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They considered that Christ was in them, even though according to their appearance they were natural men in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But even though they would prefer to consider themselves not according to appearance, they still considered the apostle according to his appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is a very crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should always consider ourselves not by what we see or feel but in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we would consider ourselves in faith, we would realize that we are a person in weakness and a person in the enjoyment of the sufficient grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Chapter thirteen of Second Corinthians should be regarded as a continuation of chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Putting these two chapters together we can see that we must be persons always considering ourselves as well as others not by sight or by appearance but in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this state we will appear to be weak, but we will continually enjoy the sufficient grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Whenever we feel that we are strong and see the signs of our strength, we are through with the enjoyment of the grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is a great lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If I would tell you of the lofty visions that I have received, you would all admire me.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But if I would indicate to you that my vision is small, you may all put me aside.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Corinthians had almost entirely disregarded Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>To them he was weak and was even as nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore Paul asked them to test themselves to see whether or not they were in the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If they would test themselves by faith, they would learn the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Without the testing by faith, they themselves would appear even as nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>THE ENJOYMENT OF THE PROCESSED AND</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The final crucial point of this book is the so-called benediction, the blessing of 13:14.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>At the conclusion of the first book to the Corinthians the human spirit is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>First Corinthians 16:18 says, For they refreshed my spirit and yours.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The second book ends in a marvelous, excellent way.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Chapter thirteen verse 14 says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is surely a great, crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is the conclusion of all the crucial points covered in the preceding chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In chapter one we are attached to the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>By being attached to the anointed One, we enjoy the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Our attachment to the anointed One is altogether due to the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Not only is this attachment due to this benediction, but this attachment issues in this benediction.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The attachment becomes the cause for such a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In chapter two there are the captives and the incense-bearers in the procession to celebrate Christ s victory.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>To be such captives and incense-bearers, we must be in this divine benediction.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit are with us, then we can be such captives and incense-bearers.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In chapter three are the letters and the mirrors to behold and reflect the glorious image of Christ that we may be transformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>To be such a letter continually speaking Christ, and to be such a mirror beholding Christ, we must be in this divine benediction.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The treasure in chapter four and the second step of reconciliation in chapter five, as well as all the other crucial points, are also related to this benediction.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We must have the enjoyment of the processed and consummated Triune God as described in 2 Corinthians 13:14.</S>
