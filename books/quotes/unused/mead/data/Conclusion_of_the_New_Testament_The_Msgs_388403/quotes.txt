[1]  Although 1 and 2 Peter are short, these Epistles indicate that the apostle Peter, who had been a fisherman, was brought into the full knowledge of God s salvation according to His divine economy.
[2]  At Peter s time this designated the believers in Christ and separated them from the Jews, who believed Jehovah the Creator to be God yet did not believe that Jesus Christ was God, and from the Gentiles, particularly the Romans, who believed that Caesar, not Jesus Christ, was God.
[3]  Thus, His righteousness now is not the righteousness only of God nor only of Christ, but the righteousness of both our God and our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[4]  The Lord s death on the cross was in absolute obedience to God and fulfilled all the requirements of God s righteousness and gave the righteous God the legitimate position to justify all those who believe in this righteous deed of Christ.
[5]  In that the Lord is our God, His righteousness is His justice, since, based on the righteous act, the redemption of our Savior Jesus Christ 3:24-25 , He justifies all the believers in Christ v. 26 , both Jewish and Gentile v. 30 . In and by such a twofold righteousness, the righteousness of both our God and our Savior, Jesus Christ, the precious faith, the precious substantiation of the New Testament blessing, has been allotted equally to all believers among all nations.
[6]  Second Peter 1:1 tells us that we have been allotted faith equally precious as ours.
[7]  As long as we have this gift, we have the lot of God s inheritance, for living faith equals the lot of God s inheritance.
[8]  Peter realized that just as the children of Israel were allotted a piece of the good land Josh 13:6; 14:1-5; 19:51 , all the New Testament believers are the children of God who inherit that which has been promised by God, that is, faith that has been allotted to them.
[9]  This implies that the all things which relate to life and godliness 2 Pet 1:3 , including the divine nature v. 4 partaken of by the believers through the equally precious faith according to the precious and exceedingly great promises, are the real inheritance given to the believers by God in the New Testament.
[10]  Second Peter 1:2 says, Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[11]  Grace and peace came to us through the God-allotted faith, which substantiates the life-blessing of the New Testament v. 1 . This faith was infused into us through the word of God, which conveys to us the real knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[12]  Second Peter 1:3 says, Seeing that His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness, through the full knowledge of Him who has called us by His own glory and virtue.
[13]  Paul speaks clearly of this divine power in Ephesians 1 when he prays that we would know what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies vv.
[14]  Now Christ is seated on the highest peak of the universe, far above everything on earth and far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named v. 21 . In Ephesians 1 Paul goes on to indicate that the divine power that raised Christ from the dead and seated Him at God s right hand in the heavenlies, far above all, has been applied to us v. 22 .
[15]  Who Has Called Us by His Own Glory and Virtue
[16]  In verse 3 Peter says that the divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness through the full knowledge of Him.
[17]  As those who have received equally precious faith, we, the believers in Christ, should be partakers of the divine nature.
[18]  The divine nature refers to what God is, that is, the riches, the elements, and the constituents of God s being John 4:24; 1 John 1:5; 4:8, 16 .
[19]  The divine nature, which mainly refers to the constitution of the divine life, the constitution of God, is constituted with Spirit, love, and light.
[20]  On the other hand, the New Testament reveals that we, the believers in Christ, have God s life and nature and that we are becoming God in life and in nature but will never have His Godhead.
[21]  Through the precious and exceedingly great promises we, the believers in Christ, who is our God and Savior, have become partakers of His divine nature in an organic union with Him, into which we have entered through faith and baptism John 3:15; Gal 3:27; Matt 28:19 .
[22]  The virtue energy of life of this divine nature carries us into His glory godliness becoming the full expression of the Triune God .
[23]  Based upon the glory and virtue to which we have been called by God, He gives us promises.
[24]  In this message we will continue to consider aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ as our God and Savior.
[25]  The eternal kingdom in this verse refers to the kingdom of God, which was given to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Dan 7:13-14 and which will be manifested at His coming back Luke 19:11-12 .
[26]  It will be a reward to His faithful believers, who pursue the growth in His life unto maturity and the development of the virtues of His nature that in the millennium they may participate in His kingship in God s glory 2 Tim 2:12; Rev 20:4, 6 .
[27]  To enter thus into the eternal kingdom of the Lord is related to entering into God s eternal glory, to which God has called us in Christ 1 Pet 5:10; 1 Thes 2:12 .
[28]  In order to bring us into the eternal kingdom, Christ will come in power, majesty, and glory as the beloved Son of God revealed on the holy mountain.
[29]  Verses 16 through 18 say, We did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we became eyewitnesses of that One s majesty.
[30]  For He received from God the Father honor and glory, a voice such as this being borne to Him by the magnificent glory: This is My Son, My Beloved, in whom I delight.
[31]  In contrast to the false teachers, we need to escape the defilements of the world by the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ v. 20 . This indicates the importance of having the full knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the Master who bought us.
[32]  The Word of life in this verse is the Word mentioned in John 1:1-4 and 14, who was with God and was God in eternity before creation, who became flesh in time, and in whom is life.
[33]  This Word conveys the eternal life and is the divine person of Christ as an account, a definition, and an expression of all that God is.
[34]  First John 1:3 says, That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
[35]  It is in this fellowship of the eternal life that we, the believers, participate in all that the Father and the Son are and have done for us; that is, we enjoy the love of the Father and the grace of the Son by virtue of the fellowship of the Spirit 2 Cor 13:14 .
[36]  Since the Spirit is the realization of Christ, when the Spirit is in us, Christ and God are in us.
[37]  When we called on the name of the Lord, we may say that the Spirit came into us, that God came into us, or that the divine life came into us.
[38]  The fellowship of the divine life is a fellowship between the believers and the apostles 1 John 1:3b; Acts 2:42 .
[39]  This means that there is a joint enjoyment of the Triune God among the believers and the apostles.
[40]  In this message we will continue to consider aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Word of life.
[41]  First John 1:5-7a says, This is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.
[42]  If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth; but if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another.
[43]  In John s Gospel it is God in the Son coming to us as grace and truth that we may become His children 1:12-13 ; in John s Epistle it is we, the children, in the fellowship of the Father s life, going to the Father to participate in His love and light.
[44]  Henry Alford says, The light is the element in which God dwells: compare 1 Tim 6:16....this walking in the light, as He is in the light, is no mere imitation of God, but is an identity in the essential element of our daily walk with the essential element of God s eternal being: not imitation, but coincidence and identity of the very atmosphere of life.
[45]  First John 1:7b says, The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.
[46]  When we live in the divine light, we are under its enlightenment, and it exposes, according to God s divine nature and through God s nature in us, all our sins, trespasses, failures, and defects, which contradict His pure light, perfect love, absolute holiness, and excelling righteousness.
[47]  At such a time we sense in our enlightened conscience the need of the cleansing of the redeeming blood of the Lord Jesus, and it cleanses us in our conscience from all sins that our fellowship with God and with one another may be maintained.
[48]  Eternal life issues in its fellowship, the fellowship of eternal life brings in the divine light, and the divine light increases the need for the blood of Jesus the Son of God that we may have more eternal life.
[49]  OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED NINETY-THREE EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST
[50]  In 1 John 2:1 Christ is an Advocate with the Father.
[51]  In 1 John 2:1 the divine title the Father indicates that our case, which the Lord Jesus as our Advocate undertakes for us, is a family affair, a case between children and the Father.
[52]  Not only has God provided the blood of Jesus Christ, which was shed for us so that we may be forgiven and cleansed, but God has also prepared Christ as our Advocate.
[53]  The fact that Christ is our Advocate with the Father, and not simply with God, indicates that our case, which the Lord undertakes for us, is a family affair, a case between the Father and us as the Father s children.
[54]  The Lord Jesus Christ offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins Heb 9:28 , not only for our redemption but also for the satisfying of God s demand, thus appeasing the relationship between God and us.
[55]  It is by this enjoyment, by Christ as our propitiation, that we may converse with God and He with us, and that together we may enjoy Christ and have fellowship around Christ.
[56]  In 1 John 2:5-29; 3:5-8, 24; and 4:9-15, we see that we may enjoy Christ, who is a living person, as our abiding place.
[57]  God sent His Son into the world not only to be a propitiation for our sins that we might be forgiven 1 John 4:10 but also to be life to us that we might have life and live through Him.
[58]  First John 4:14-15 goes on to say, We have beheld and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world.
[59]  Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God.
[60]  The Father s sending of the Son to be our Savior is an external act, so that through our confessing of the Son He can abide in us and we in Him 1 John 4:15 .
[61]  In addition to this, God s internal act toward us is the sending of His Spirit to dwell in us as inward evidence that we abide in Him and He in us v. 13 .
[62]  We should also tell them that if they confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God will come into them and abide in them, and they will be able to abide in God.
[63]  As He Abides in Us, Our Abiding Both in Him and in the Father and Enjoying the Eternal Life 1 As He Abides in Us,
[64]  Not to deny but to confess that the man Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God 2:22 , is to let the Word of the eternal life abide in us.
[65]  In so doing we abide in the Son and in the Father and are not led astray by the heretical teachings concerning Christ s person v. 26 . This indicates that the Son and the Father are the eternal life for our regeneration and enjoyment.
[66]  and Teaches Us, Our Abiding in Him 1 The Anointing Abiding in Us and Teaching Us
[67]  First John 2:27 says, As for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.
[68]  This all-inclusive life-giving Spirit from the Holy One entered into us at the time of our regeneration and abides in us forever 1 John 2:27 ; by Him the young children know the Father v. 13 and know the truth v. 21 . As we abide in Christ, we enjoy the divine anointing, which is a wonderful person, the Spirit, moving and working in us.
[69]  The anointing is the moving and working of the indwelling compound Spirit to apply all the ingredients of the processed Triune God and His activities into our inner being so that we may be fully mingled with Him for His corporate expression vv.
[70]  Because we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are spontaneously anointed with Him by God.
[71]  John concludes verse 27 with an exhortation to abide in the Triune God.
[72]  We may also say that to enjoy the riches of the divine life, we need to maintain the fellowship; to maintain the fellowship, we need to abide in the Lord; and in order to abide in the Lord, we need to take care of the inner anointing, which is the moving of the indwelling Spirit in our spirit.
[73]  The more anointing we enjoy, the more life we have; the more life we have, the stronger the fellowship we are in; the stronger the fellowship we are in, the more light we have; and the more light we have, the more cleansing of the blood we need.
[74]  The Lord s abiding in us and our abiding in Him are altogether a matter of His being the life-giving Spirit in our spirit; by the bountiful, immeasurable Spirit in our spirit, we know with full assurance that we and God are one and that we abide in each other 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17; Phil 1:19; John 3:34; 1 John 3:24; 4:13 .
[75]  We abide in Him and His words abide in us so that we may speak in Him and He may speak in us for the building of God into man and man into God John 15:7; 2 Cor 2:17; 13:3; 1 Cor 14:4b .
[76]  In this message we will continue to consider the aspects of Christ as our abiding place.
[77]  Verse 28 indicates that some believers, those who do not abide in the Lord that is, remain in the fellowship of the divine life according to pure faith in Christ s person but are led astray by the heretical teachings concerning Christ v. 26 , will be punished by being put to shame from Him, from His glorious parousia.
[78]  If we do not abide in the Triune God, continually living the divine life, then at the Lord s coming back we will suffer shame, which will be a kind of discipline exercised upon us.
[79]  If we abide in Christ and bear much fruit by His life to glorify God, when He is manifested, we will boldly meet Him and not be put to shame from His glorious presence cf.
[80]  The Greek word rendered take in verse 5 is the same Greek word as in John 1:29, where we are told that Christ as the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world, which came into the world through Adam Rom 5:12 .
[81]  In 1 John 5 we see Christ as our life and our victory.
[82]  We must believe that Jesus is the Christ sent by God to be our Savior before we can obtain the life of God.
[83]  We do not need to do anything but believe this in order for the Holy Spirit to enter into us, give us God s life, and cause us to be regenerated, to be born of God.
[84]  This divine birth, which brings in the divine life, is the basic factor of all the mysteries concerning the divine life, such as the fellowship of the divine life 1:3-7 , the anointing of the Divine Trinity 2:20-27 , the abiding in the Lord v. 28 3:24 , and the divine living that practices the divine truth 1:6 , the divine will 2:17 , the divine righteousness v. 29; 3:7 , and the divine love vv.
[85]  First John 5:6 through 8 say, This is He who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ; not in the water only, but in the water and in the blood; and the Spirit is He who testifies, because the Spirit is the reality.
[86]  The reality here refers to the reality of all that Christ as the Son of God is John 16:12-15 .
[87]  Jesus, the man of Nazareth, was attested to be the Son of God by the water He went through in His baptism Matt 3:16-17; John 1:31 , by the blood He shed on the cross 19:31-35; Matt 27:50-54 , and also by the Spirit He gave not by measure John 1:32-34; 3:34 .
[88]  By these three God has testified that Jesus is His Son given to us 1 John 5:7-10 , that in Him we may receive His eternal life by believing into His name vv.
[89]  The water of baptism terminates people of the old creation by burying them; the blood shed on the cross redeems those whom God has chosen from among the old creation; and the Spirit, who is the truth, the reality in life Rom 8:2 , germinates those whom God has redeemed out of the old creation, by regenerating them with the divine life.
[90]  Through the water of His baptism, through the blood of His cross, and as the Spirit, Christ has been testified as the Son of God and has come into our spirit.
[91]  Therefore, there are three occasions His baptism, crucifixion, and resurrection that testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who is qualified to be our life for our divine birth that we may overcome the world.
[92]  This Life Being in Him and Even Being Himself
[93]  He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.
[94]  God gave to us His eternal life, and this life is in Christ, the Son of God, and is even Christ Himself.
[95]  In this message we will continue to consider aspects of Christ as our life and victory and then go on to see Christ as the source of mercy, grace, and peace.
[96]  First John 5:20-21 says, We know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding that we might know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ.
[97]  The word come in verse 20 indicates that the Son of God has come through incarnation to bring God to us as grace and reality John 1:14 that we may have the divine life, as revealed in John s Gospel, to partake of God as love and light, as unveiled in this Epistle.
[98]  Before we were saved, we did not have this understanding, but the Son of God has come to us and has given us this understanding so that we may know God.
[99]  In verse 20 John also says that we are in the true One.
[100]  We not only know the true God; we are also in Him.
[101]  John tells us that we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ v. 20 . To be in the true God is to be in His Son Jesus Christ.
[102]  The word this refers to the God who has come through incarnation and has given us the ability to know Him as the genuine God and be one with Him organically in His Son Jesus Christ.
[103]  In 2 John, Christ is revealed as the source of grace, mercy, and peace.
[104]  Verse 3 says, Grace, mercy, peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
[105]  Truth here denotes the divine reality of the gospel, especially concerning the person of Christ, who expressed God and accomplished God s purpose; love is the believers expression in loving one another through receiving and knowing the truth.
[106]  A false Christ is one who pretends, deceivingly, to be the Christ, whereas an antichrist is one who denies Christ s deity, denying that Jesus is the Christ, that is, denying the Father and the Son by denying that Jesus is the Son of God 1 John 2:22 , not confessing that He has come in the flesh through the divine conception of the Holy Spirit 4:2-3 .
[107]  Jude 20 through 23 say, You, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
[108]  According to Jude 20, if we would build up ourselves upon our most holy faith, we need to pray in the Holy Spirit.
[109]  Faith is related to the Word, and in the Holy Spirit we have life.
[110]  If we want genuine, spiritual prayers, prayers that reach God, touch God, breathe in God, and are in God, we must pray in the Holy Spirit.
[111]  Therefore, if we have the Word applied to us and the Spirit working within us, we will be kept in the enjoyment of God s love as we await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
[112]  4 Awaiting the Mercy of Our Lord Jesus Christ
[113]  Then Jude tells us that we should be those who, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep ourselves in the love of God the Father , awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ the Son vv.
[114]  The mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ the Son in Jude matches the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ the Son in 2 Corinthians.
[115]  We need to pray in the Holy Spirit that we may touch the source, the love of God, in which we await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[116]  We need to pray in the Holy Spirit, keep ourselves in the love of God, and wait for the mercy of Jesus Christ so that we may have the enjoyment and increase of eternal life forever and be set before God s glory.
[117]  In this message we will see that we may express Christ by putting Him on Rom 13:14 and by triumphing in Him in our ministry 2 Cor 2:14-16 .
[118]  This verse indicates that we need to take Christ as our new garment and put Him on so that we may express Him.
[119]  a. Manifesting the Savor of the Knowledge of Him
[120]  In verse 14 Paul also likens himself and his co-workers to incense-bearers scattering the savor of the knowledge of Christ in His triumphant ministry as in a triumphal procession.
[121]  The apostles are such incense-bearers in their ministry of Christ as well as captives in the train of His triumph.
[122]  Concerning the phrase the savor of the knowledge, Vincent says, According to the Greek usage, savor and knowledge are in apposition, so that the knowledge of Christ is symbolized as an odor communicating its nature and efficacy through the apostle s work.
[123]  The apostles, being permeated with Christ, became a fragrance of Christ to God.
[124]  They were not merely a sweet savor produced by Christ, but Christ Himself was the savor being exhaled in their life and work to God.
[125]  The transcendent power of Christ s resurrection in us enables us to endure the sufferings that others cannot bear and to live a life that others cannot live, thereby manifesting the fragrance of Christ.
[126]  If in our daily living we enjoy Christ, depend on Christ, fellowship with Christ, and are filled with Christ, then we can say that for us to live is Christ Phil 1:21a .
[127]  Because the Spirit is the realization of Christ, when the Spirit touches us, it is Christ who is touching us, and when the Spirit motivates us, it is Christ who is motivating us.
[128]  As we triumph in Christ in our ministry, God manifests the savor of the knowledge of Christ as a fragrance to God in those who are being saved a savor out of life unto life and in those who are perishing a savor out of death unto death.
[129]  Second Corinthians 3:3 says, Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh.
[130]  A letter of Christ is one composed of Christ as the content to convey and express Christ.
[131]  All believers of Christ should be such living letters of Christ so that others may read and know Christ in their being.
[132]  The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not an instrument, such as a pen, but an element, the heavenly ink used in writing, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content for the writing of living letters that convey Christ.
[133]  To have this ink in our experience, we must enjoy Christ, possess Christ, be filled with Christ, be saturated with Christ, and be covered with Christ.
[134]  He is within us to write the elements, the riches, of Christ into our whole being, but if we are rebellious in our mind, emotion, and will, there is no way for the Spirit of Christ to write something of Christ into our being.
[135]  When we are truly subdued by Christ, the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of Christ within us, will have the opportunity, the free way, to write something of Christ gradually into our being so that Christ is inscribed into every part of our inner being with the Spirit of the living God to make us His living letters.
[136]  By the dispensing of the Spirit into our being, we human beings become a letter of Christ written by the apostles with the Spirit as the writing substance.
[137]  Our heart, as the composition of our conscience the leading part of our spirit , mind, emotion, and will, is the tablet upon which the living letters of Christ are written with the living Spirit of God.
[138]  This implies that Christ is written into every part of our inner being with the Spirit of the living God to make us His living letters.
[139]  Therefore, for the Spirit to write Christ on us as living letters means that He writes Christ into our mind, emotion, and will; that is, the Spirit takes our whole heart as the tablet for inscribing Christ.
[140]  Christ as the life-giving Spirit desires to be mingled with our mind, emotion, and will in order that there will be the description of Christ in our mind, the definition of Christ in our emotion, and the expression of Christ in our will.
[141]  According to verse 18, we behold and reflect as a mirror the glory of the Lord.
[142]  Beholding is to see the Lord by ourselves; reflecting is for others to see Him through us.
[143]  As the life-giving Spirit, He dwells in us to make Himself and all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained real to us, that we may be one with Him and be transformed into His image from glory to glory.
[144]  from Glory to Glory, Even as from the Lord Spirit
[145]  Thus, we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence, transfigured, mainly by the renewing of our mind Rom 12:2 , into His image.
[146]  As we open to the Lord, He as the life-giving Spirit enters into our being to infuse His life essence into us, to operate within us by His life power, and to shape us into His image.
[147]  If we are transformed in our spirit but not in our soul, it means that although we have Christ as life in our spirit, we do not have much of Christ in our soul.
[148]  To be transformed into the image of Christ from glory to glory is to be transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another degree.
[149]  We express Christ in this way by experiencing and enjoying the Lord Spirit.
[150]  In 2 Corinthians 4:11 Paul declares, We who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
[151]  The Lord s life was a life under the killing of the cross for the manifestation of the resurrection life, a life lived in such a way that His person was one with His ministry and His life was His ministry John 6:14-15; 12:13, 19, 23-24 .
[152]  When we are under the killing of the Lord s death, His resurrection life is imparted through us into others.
[153]  God s shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything.
[154]  There is a need for the hand of God to break our being outwardly; that is, there is a need for the Spirit of God to arrange the outward environment to break and consume our being.
[155]  In Philippians 1:19-21 we see that we may express Christ through life or through death.
[156]  All of Paul s life and work were not for expressing himself or for displaying his knowledge, ability, or other merits and strong points; what he was and what he did were for expressing Christ, even magnifying Christ.
[157]  In order to magnify Christ, we must deal with our circumstances by the empowering Spirit, present Christ to the unbelievers, fellowship with the believers, and serve God by the Spirit of God.
[158]  In Philippians 1:20 Paul speaks of his magnification of Christ in his body.
[159]  To live Christ means that no matter what our circumstances may be, Christ is magnified in us, and we are not put to shame in anything.
[160]  Furthermore, to live Christ also means that in our daily life we are saved from murmurings, reasonings, crookedness, and perverseness and that we present our living Lord as the word of life to those whom we meet day by day 2:14-16 .
[161]  To live Christ for His magnification is to participate in Christ s salvation in life Rom 5:10 , in which we are saved from the failure of not living Christ and from the defeat of not magnifying Christ.
[162]  It should matter to the church whether we remain or go to be with the Lord, but this depends on our living Christ, magnifying Christ, ministering Christ, and transfusing Christ from the depths of our being into that of the saints cf.
[163]  In Philippians 1:19, Paul indicates that he lived Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[164]  In this verse he declares, This will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[165]  Philippians 1:19 speaks neither of the Spirit of God nor of the Holy Spirit but of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[166]  This is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord s incarnation but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord s resurrection, compounded with the Lord s incarnation humanity , human living under the cross, crucifixion, and resurrection.
[167]  In this Spirit is all that we need the death of Christ and its effectiveness, the resurrection of Christ and its power, and Christ s divine nature and human nature.
