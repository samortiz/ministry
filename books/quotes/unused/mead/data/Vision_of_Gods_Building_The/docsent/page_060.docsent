   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HINDRANCES TO THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today's problem is not that there is a lack of individual, personal spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The great problem today is the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is a corporate problem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>An example of the way we can damage the church rather than build it up is in the way we conduct ourselves daily.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we live by Christ, such a life will save us from the dreaded practice of gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This life will even demand that we do not gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Oh, gossiping among the saints is a great damage to the church life!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever we begin to speak, we must exercise care that the words which proceed out of our mouth may build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may protest that we have never done anything to damage the church life; yet we may have killed people with our gossiping tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is so easy for germs to be passed from one to another by way of the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you have experienced the real church life, you are already aware of how much the enemy utilizes the gossipers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Gossip damages the church life and spreads the element of death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In practicing the church life we must also be careful never to criticize.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Regardless of our intention, as long as we criticize we are damaging the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are many lessons for us to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we would practice the church in the spirit, our spirit will constantly be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will know what we must say and what we must do, and we will never do anything to damage anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church life is a life of building; thus we must learn to live in the way of building up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may say that we have learned the lessons of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To learn the cross in great issues is easy, but most of the lessons of the cross are in the small matters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is the cross experienced in the small matters day by day which teaches us the real lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are many teachings concerning the building in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of these we must be exceedingly clear concerning three major points: first, Christ came that we may have life for the purpose of the building; second, all the gifts and all the gifted persons are for the building; and third, all the members with their functions and services are also for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's intention is to have a building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Throughout the world today it is easy to meet group after group of Christians who are loving and seeking the Lord, Christians who are seeking to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is very difficult, however, to find a group of believers who are growing up together as one building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even in places which are well known for spirituality, you cannot perceive the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead, there is criticism and strife.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today, among the Lord's children, the most needful thing is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Oh, we have greatly neglected this matter!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of this, we are weak, and the church is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus the tide of spiritual life in the church is very low.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us forget ourselves, our personal spirituality, and our personal victory; let us just care for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we will indeed have wonderful victory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Pay full attention to the building; forget your personal problems; bring your problems to the Body, and the Body will swallow them up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Learn to care for the Body, and do not damage any member.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Oh, this is a real lesson and a good test!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is abundantly clear that God's goal is not to have many spiritual persons, but to have a building.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In every locality, each Christian must be built up with other saints in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If others will not go along with you, that is their business you cannot be responsible for that.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But you must take the right standing and learn the proper lesson of being built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You will experience victory over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's ultimate goal is the New Jerusalem, but today, before that comes into full manifestation, God loves to have His saints in every locality built up as a miniature of the New Jerusalem, as a little expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are many lessons involved here.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet, praise the Lord, God's blessings are waiting for us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we take the right standing, we will enjoy the blessings and have the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, may we not be so stupid as to practice the church life and at the same time damage it by being careless.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may not have the intention to do so, yet damage is done by our carelessness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we have a critical attitude or participate in gossiping, we spread the element of death and thus destroy the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>May we learn all these lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have seen the stages of the building in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First there was a little tent with an altar; then came the tabernacle with the brass altar, and afterward the temple with a larger altar.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Finally we saw the prospect in Ezekiel's vision.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now we have seen the order in the New Testament: Christ came to be the tabernacle, and His intention was that the tabernacle be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is for this purpose that He is life to us, and it is for this purpose He has given the church many gifted persons with gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Finally, all the members with their functions and services are for this one purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the meaning of the entire Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Eventually, in the fullness of time, the New Jerusalem will come as the ultimate manifestation of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Oh, if we have seen such a vision, we will be caught by it!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whatever we are, whatever we do, and wherever we go, we will be completely for this vision, for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We will take God's goal as our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There are many lessons to learn in this matter of building; yet, praise the Lord, we will also experience many blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>May we be faithful to the Lord, and go on with Him in the fulfillment of His vision.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we are not faithful, the Lord will still go on; He will choose other persons for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
