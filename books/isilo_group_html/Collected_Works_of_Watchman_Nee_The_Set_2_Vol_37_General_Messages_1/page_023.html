A man who thinks that he is rich but, in reality, is poor has a Laodicean attitude and a Laodicean heart.</p><p>In spiritual matters, the matter of having or not having is easy to resolve, but the matter of being poor or being rich is not as easy to resolve. Those who have nothing can easily see God, but those who have a little do not easily see God. Many people have nothing before God, and they often meet God. The worst kind of people are those who have a little; they understand a little of this and a little of that. But do they really know? Do they really understand? No. They speak a great deal, but they have not moved a single inch or advanced a single step. They are poor ones indeed.</p><p>The biggest problem with poverty is that a man will not easily admit that he is poor. Those who have nothing readily admit that they have nothing. If they have something, they say so, and if they do not have something, they also say so. This is very simple and clear. But poverty is something relative. If Mr. A is worse off than Mr. B, it means that Mr. A is poorer than Mr. B. But Mr. B can be worse off than Mr. C, which means that Mr. B is poorer than Mr. C. It is easy to make a judgment when one has nothing. It is not so easy to make a judgment when one is poor.</p><p>The first time a child has some money, he thinks that he is the richest man in the world. He does not know his poverty. If he does not have any money, he easily understands that he has nothing. But if he has a little money, it is more difficult to show him that he does not have enough money for certain things. In spiritual matters, God can deal with those who have nothing. Those who are poor, however, are hindered by the little that they possess. They think that they have something, and they become proud and self-sufficient.</p><p>Someone may have obeyed God only three times during the past ten years, but he never forgets that he has obeyed God. While he is talking about obedience, others who have truly learned the lesson and who are sensitive almost have to stand up and shout to him: "Do you really know what obedience is?" Those who talk about obedience in this way are poor men, truly poor men.</p><p>Many people constantly talk about the cross. One may say that what we need before the Lord is the cross. Another may say the same thing, but those who truly know the cross almost have to say: "Brothers, do you know what the cross is?" Just because God has dealt with you a few times does not mean that you have been thoroughly dealt with before the Lord. God dealt with you on the day that you were saved, but this does not mean that you have learned a deep lesson. You are still very short! Those who do not know the cross, yet who talk glibly about it, are indeed poor!</p><p>Some brothers say that they are clear that the church is this and that; they say that they did this and that when they saw the Body of Christ. Some sisters say that they are pursuing after the kingdom; they say that they are willing to forsake everything for the kingdom. But those who know them will say that they do not know what the Body or the kingdom is. Many of the things that God's children have are very cheap. They have cheap obedience, cheap crosses, a cheap Body, a cheap kingdom! Actually, they do not know obedience, the cross, the Body, or the kingdom. They are poor men!</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Poverty is not a hindrance if it does not come with pride. But nothing can be done about poverty when it is in a proud person. Poverty is not the problem. Being like Laodicea is a problem because Laodicea was poor and proud yet thought that she was rich. In the spiritual realm, it is hard to find a person who is poor but not proud. On the contrary, it is often the rich ones who are not proud. It is a pity that many of God's children go around in circles and never advance. The sole reason that they suffer loss is because they think that they have something. Many people talk about the flesh, but actually they do not know what the flesh is. Many people talk about revelation, but they do not know what revelation is. They can say much about obedience. They can say much about the kingdom. They can say much about the cross, dealing with the self, or dealing with the natural life. Yet what they say and how they speak reveal that they are poor and ignorant. They have never touched God. They speak what they do not know and only deceive themselves and those who are like them. In spiritual matters, those who think that they are rich can never make others believe that they are rich. On the contrary, they only expose their poverty.</p><p>The church in Laodicea said, "I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing" (Rev. 3:17a). This does not refer to material riches, but to spiritual riches. She felt that she had something. But God said, "You...do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked" (v. 17b). Did she have something? Yes, but what she had was of no benefit to her. If she really had something, she should have rejoiced, yet she was wretched and miserable. She did not behave as if she had anything. Her wretchedness and misery tell others that she was poor.</p><p>Poverty is always linked to blindness. Those who are spiritually poor are always blind. The blind ones always think that they are rich. Those who have not seen the cross think that they know the cross. Those who have not seen the kingdom think that they know the kingdom. Those who have not seen the Body of Christ think that they know the church. All those who think that they have something are poor. Whenever we truly see something, we will not dare to boast that we are rich. Whenever our eyes are opened, we will see that we are naked. Only the foolish ones boast of what they have. A Laodicean is poor, but does not see his own poverty. This is a warning to us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 37: General Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
