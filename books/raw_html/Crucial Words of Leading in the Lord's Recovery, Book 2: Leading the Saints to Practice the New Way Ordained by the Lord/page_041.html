 <h2 class="head1">THE URGENT NEED AT PRESENT BEING THE ABILITY<br />
TO LEAD, TO TEACH, AND TO PROPHESY</h2>
<p>At home most of the married brothers listen to their wives. If their wives are proper, the husbands will be able to serve peacefully. Hence, in the church life it is necessary to lead the sisters well. According to my observation in 1946, the sisters in Shanghai, especially the middle-aged sisters, were more trustworthy than the brothers. This was due to the help rendered behind the scenes by Ruth Lee and Peace Wang. These two sisters helped the sisters in Shanghai to be obedient and submissive. Because the leading sisters overthrew the &ldquo;nest&rdquo; of problems, the brothers and the co-workers had no problems whatsoever in regard to the sisters&rsquo; service.</p>
<p>Ants have nests, but the ants will leave if the nest is toppled. These two sisters&mdash;Ruth Lee and Peace Wang&mdash;were skillful in overturning the &ldquo;nests.&rdquo; No matter which household had problems, as long as these two sisters handled them, everything was solved. Hence, the work is difficult if no one leads the sisters. The experienced sisters need to be able to lead the sisters and teach them at the same time. Ruth Lee was truly apt to teach. She wrote hymn #127 in our Chinese hymnal. This hymn was written in a skillful and precise manner. From it we can tell that she was a teacher, one who was apt to teach.</p>
<p>If all of the brothers and sisters learn to prophesy, it will be a great matter. When they go out, they will all be useful wherever they go. Within half a year, churches will be raised up one after another. In another three or five years, there will be churches all over Taiwan. This is what we need today. If we want to gospelize Taiwan, we must carry it out in this way. In order to gospelize Taiwan within the next five years, we need to develop these three matters: the ability to lead, teach, and prophesy. Once we succeed in these three matters, the purpose of the full-time training will be accomplished.</p>
<p>In the early days, when we came to Taiwan to serve full-time, we were empty-handed and had nothing. Fifteen years later, however, thousands of people had been saved, and group after group of elders and co-workers were perfected; this was due to leading, teaching, and speaking the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>These three matters are the most important matters related to administrating the church; we must take the lead well, be apt to teach, and be able to prophesy. If we look back in history, we will find that the success of the church depends upon leading, teaching, and prophesying. Whenever leading is lacking, weakness is manifested; whenever teaching is lacking, breaches and leaks occur; and whenever prophesying is lacking, there is no strength. However, when some are able to take the lead, are apt to teach, and are rich in prophesying, the Lord&rsquo;s work will be strong and the church will prosper. I hope that the elders will take this word and not merely understand it but strive together so that the church can advance even further.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING AND LEADING IN MANY ASPECTS</h2>
<p>On one hand, leading is general; on the other hand, leading involves many details. An elder should not be afraid of being capable. For instance, he should not be afraid to know multiple languages. Darby, an Englishman, was competent in English. He was a scholar produced by the Episcopalian Church and translated the Old Testament and the New Testament into three languages&mdash;English, French, and German. Moreover, he also knew the two original languages of the Bible&mdash;Hebrew and Greek. Hence, he was proficient in all five languages, not just familiar with them in a general sense. He remained single for his whole life, and consequently all of his time and energy were spent on studies and acquiring proficiency in these languages. This enabled him to do the work of translating the Bible. This was not a simple task. Laboring in this way, he became the &ldquo;king of Bible exposition&rdquo; in the past two hundred years of Christian history.</p>
<p>Due to certain circumstances, I was not able to obtain a college degree; nevertheless, after I was saved, I studied on my own because of various needs. Eventually, what I obtained through self-study exceeded what I had learned in school. This shows that we really need to learn and continue to pursue further studies.</p>
<p>In a sense, there is no need for training centers; I myself have never gone through any training. One time, some brothers asked me, &ldquo;Brother Nee praised you and said that your progress could be likened to flying; please tell us how you &lsquo;fly&rsquo;?&rdquo; This question was difficult to answer, because what use would it be for them to ask me how I fly if they would not fly? In fact, all they needed to do was fly. If we want to know how to fly, the best way is to fly. If we try, we will learn to do it. At the beginning we may have no idea how to fly, but we will learn within a few hours. When I was young, I did not learn to ride a bicycle. Later, when I went to Shanghai at the age of thirty, I needed to ride a bicycle for transportation. At that time, no one was able to teach me, so I borrowed an old bicycle and learned on my own. When I first tried, I fell, but I tried repeatedly. Through repeatedly getting up and falling down, I eventually learned to ride skillfully. This is why there is the saying &ldquo;Where there is a will, there is a way.&rdquo; As long as we have the heart to do something and are persistent in carrying it out, we will succeed.</p>
<p>What lies before us is a great opportunity; the whole earth is our work place. Our only concern should be that of not entering in. If we enter in and propagate, the future will be immeasurable. Hence, whether we are elders or co-workers, we should proceed toward this goal. The co-workers must have an adequate pursuing. If we are inadequate in languages, it will be difficult for us to propagate anywhere. Today in Taiwan, for the purpose of international trade, people regard learning languages as a very important matter. If a businessman wants his products to spread into a certain country, he must at least know the language of that country. If he does not, it will be difficult for him to create business contacts. As a result, some university students in Taiwan not only know English but have also learned Spanish. After they graduate from college, they can enter the import and export trade. Some may even go to South America to do business there.</p>
<p>A Christian from Chile told me that the suit pants and shirt he wore, though bought in Chile, were in fact imported from Taiwan. This shows Taiwan&rsquo;s position in the international market. This is the world situation. All the more, we must not fail to advance in the Lord&rsquo;s work. For example, the aborigines and local Taiwanese are all within our reach and need our visitation. It is a shame if none of the co-workers speak Taiwanese. Anyone who has a heart to serve must be able to speak Mandarin and Taiwanese in order to be qualified to be a co-worker. If we do not have this kind of spirit, how can we accomplish anything? Thus, we hope that we would all have an aggressive spirit so that we can propagate.</p>
<p>Although the supply of the word in our midst has been rich, and our spiritual publications have been bountiful, we still need to use some effort to receive the supply. For example, when we eat, we must use a little effort; no one is able to eat for us. In the same way, receiving the supply from God&rsquo;s word also depends on our effort. Sometimes we may be so busy that we think it troublesome to eat three meals a day. In this respect, our human body can be very troublesome. Not only does it need to eat, but it also needs to get rid of the waste and be maintained in many other ways. On one hand, this may be troublesome, but on the other hand, if we do not serve our bodies well, our bodies will not and cannot serve and work for us.</p>
<p>All the leading brothers in the churches should study the content of this book so that the churches under their leading might be living. Some elders have said that given the condition of their localities, no matter how much they endeavor, it is difficult to go on. This may be true, but even in such an unfavorable condition, considerable progress can still be made if the elders are willing to endeavor. Let us consider the cleaning of the meeting hall. Everyone can improve the way that it is cleaned. There is room to improve the manner in which the curtains are opened and closed, the doors to the restrooms are pulled shut, and the chairs are arranged in the meeting hall. Perhaps the present condition is already satisfactory; nevertheless, there is always room for improvement. It is always good to make progress. As long as we all have the heart to endeavor, the churches will be able to advance.</p>
<p>Due to the Lord&rsquo;s grace in the past, there are more than one hundred churches in Taiwan. If all of these churches, regardless of size, would rise up, if the elders would take the lead well and be apt to teach, and if the young ones would strive, be faithful, and prophesy well, the future will be bright. Let us consider the church in Kaohsiung. The situation of this church is very good. If the brothers would resolve to strive together, I believe that the whole church would have a new look within a year and the number of saints meeting would double. If this does not occur, the brothers who coordinate should come together to fast, pray, and come up with a strategy. They should not let the situation go. Since the Lord has given us so many brothers and sisters who love Him, so many rich truths, a definite ground, and a clear way, we should take the lead faithfully and bring in a flourishing situation. May we not go home and sleep peacefully; rather, let us give our whole being to strive and endeavor. If we do not, even the angels cannot help us.</p>
