<h2 class=head2>Concerning the Will</h2><p>What, then, about our will? If we go to the Lord concerning our will, He will expose it in a thorough and detailed way. It may seem as if we are being examined under a divine microscope, for one by one there will be brought to light all the germs in our will. In particular, we shall realize that we are very rebellious, that we do not know what it means to be submissive to the Lord. One by one, we need to confess the germs of rebellion in our will. The Lord may show you that, a few years ago, you were wrong in a particular matter. Then He may go on to show you how you were wrong with a certain brother or a certain sister. Each time you will need to confess. You should thank the Lord that you are under His light, under His exposure. By confessing all that the Lord exposes in our will, we unclog the artery of our will.<h2 class=head2>Concerning the Emotion</h2><p>The artery of the emotion also needs to be unclogged. When we realize how serious is the problem we have with our emotion, we may be deeply sorrowful. We may despair and feel utterly ashamed of the condition of our emotion. We shall realize that in many cases we hate what we should love, and love what we should hate. When we come into the light of the sanctuary, we shall see that the most ugly aspect of our being is our emotion, for we do not use it properly. Both our joyfulness and our sorrow may be altogether natural. As the Lord exposes us, we may feel ashamed of the way we have expressed joy and sorrow, for that expression often was natural, fleshly, even fleshy. No wonder our psychological heart does not function normally.<p>If we take the time necessary to unclog the three main arteries of our psychological heart, we shall have the sense that our entire being has become living. Our mind, will, and emotion will all be in a very healthy condition. All the “dirt” in these “ditches” will then be dug away.<p>No one can do this unclogging for you. I can speak to you concerning it, but you must do it yourself. Thus, you need to go to the Lord day by day and ask Him to expose everything wrong in your mind, will, and emotion. Then in the light of what He exposes, you need to confess.<p>Perhaps you do not feel that you are wrong in your thoughts, in your decisions, or in your emotion. This is the reason you need to go to the Lord for His enlightening. As an illustration, sometimes we may have a physical problem that we are not aware of. Even after the doctor discovers our problem and prescribes the proper medication, we may not feel the medication is necessary. However, when we take the medication and it does its work to cleanse and heal our bodies, we shall be convinced that the doctor’s advice was right. In like manner, even though we may not feel that we are wrong in our mind, emotion, and will, we need to go to the Lord and take the “medication” He gives us. If we take it, the arteries of the psychological heart will be kept clean and unclogged.
