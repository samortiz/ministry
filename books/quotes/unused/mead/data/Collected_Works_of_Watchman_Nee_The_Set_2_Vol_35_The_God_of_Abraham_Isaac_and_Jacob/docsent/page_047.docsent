   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Necessary Experience of a Christian</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order for a Christian to take God's way, he must receive everything from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, it is not enough for us to just be Isaacs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are Isaacs, but at the same time we are also Jacobs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need God to touch the hollow of our thigh, to weaken us, and to put us out of joint.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The day will come when God will touch the hollow of our thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our advance cannot always be slow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we advance as slowly as we are now, it is questionable that we will reach Bethel in twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has been disciplining us for twenty years, but now we need to have the hollow of our thigh put out of joint so that we can no longer stand tall before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a specific experience, one that is as specific as our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just as we needed to be saved in a definite way, and just as our eyes needed to be opened to see the riches of Christ in a definite way, the seat of our strength also needs to be touched in a definite way so that our natural life will be dislodged.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every Christian has his own thigh hollow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With some, their natural strength is lodged within their conniving.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With others, their natural strength is lodged within their talent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some Christians have their natural strength lodged in their emotions, while others have their natural strength lodged within their self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every Christian has his own particular strong spot.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His natural strength is lodged in that spot.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once that spot is touched, his natural strength is touched by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I cannot tell you where your natural strength is lodged, but I can say that every Christian has his own particular spot.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every aspect of his life is under the influence of this spot, and this spot can be considered as the hollow of his thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The natural life of some Christians is manifested in their love for exhibition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They love to exhibit what little spirituality they have.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Their so-called "testimonies" are actually not testimonies for the Lord, but a kind of self-boasting and self-manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All of their actions, life, and work issue from their desire to exhibit themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, God will touch their love for exhibition.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some Christians have their natural strength lodged in their self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everything that they do originates from their self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who are experienced can tell immediately that they are doing this and that and are saying this and that only because they love themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From all of their behavior, one can find a thigh hollow, which is their self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is always a nerve center for our natural life within which strong power is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, the Lord will have to destroy this before we can bear the fruit of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Otherwise, everything will still come from our self.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some Christians have their natural life hidden behind their strong mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They always think and reason when others speak to them; they always judge whether or not something is rational or justifiable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They analyze everything that comes their way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their minds are too active, and their heads are too big.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They live in their mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If they do not think and analyze, they cannot live.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Their mind becomes their life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They may be capable in doing many things, but they are useless in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, God will have to touch their mind before His purpose in them can be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Other things can also be the lodging place of our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When God touches this spot, it means that He is working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This does not mean that we have become perfect, but it does signify a turning point in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many Christians seem to have committed unrelated mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They make small mistakes here and there.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The outward expressions of these mistakes may be different, but the root is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This root is the hollow of the thigh we mentioned earlier; it is the lodging ground of their natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God will not let this go; He will always come back to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God's attention is not on the many outward, minor expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His intention is to touch the nerve center of the natural life and to bring about a basic change in them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thank the Lord that He touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After this touch, Jacob became crippled.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He became weak, was defeated, and could no longer wrestle.</S>
