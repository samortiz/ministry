   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRANSFORMED BY THE RENEWING OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The practical way for us to be transformed is by being renewed in our mind Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Transformation takes place by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The mind is of major importance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our whole being is under the influence of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whatever we do and however we behave is very much related to our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The mind takes the lead to direct at least ninety percent of the activities of our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, if we want to be transformed from the natural form into the form of Christ, we need to be renewed in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1946, the year after World War II ended, I went to Nanking, the old capital of China.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I stayed there for a while to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While I was there, I was invited to dinner and introduced to a nice Christian gentleman.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This man told me that he was very grateful to God, for he had the assurance that he was regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He proceeded to tell me his thoughts about doing this thing and that thing for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His mind was very active in thinking about doing many things for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although he sounded very good, I realized that this man had been regenerated in his spirit but not renewed in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He still possessed a natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our mind must be renewed in many respects, and the first thing that needs to be renewed is the thought that we can do something for God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we desire to be transformed, our mind needs to be adjusted in this particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not think that we can do something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, we need to receive something of God into us and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When that gentleman was talking with me about his thoughts to do this and that for the Lord, I said in my heart, No, you need to change your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You must realize that your need today is to receive God and enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Stop thinking so much about doing things to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You must give up this thought of doing things and realize the fact that you need to take in something of God to be filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Your need is to be fed with God and satisfied with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we intend to be transformed and be normal Christians, the first thing that needs to be changed is the thought that we are able to do things for God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need a renewed mind in order to realize that we should take God into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a rule, most of us have the thought that since the Lord is so good to us, we can express our gratefulness by doing something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a natural thought which we have spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever we have such a thought, we have to realize that there is the need of the renewing of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May we abandon the thought of doing something for the Lord and realize the fact that we need to receive something of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some may still ask what they should do for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we receive the Lord into us and enjoy Him, something will spontaneously issue forth from our enjoyment of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our real need is to be filled with Christ and be satisfied with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, if we want to know the Lord in the way of life and not in a natural way, we need to have our mind renewed from the thought of doing things for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When our mind is renewed in this way, we will be clear that we need to enjoy the Lord and be filled and satisfied with Him day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will desire to have not only more fellowship with the Lord but deeper fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only will there be a change in the way we think, but many things will be different; our way of choosing and deciding will also be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>RENEWED BY DENYING THE SELF</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are told in the Scriptures that we need to deny ourselves Luke 9:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to be transformed by renewing, we need to deny our self.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>More than ninety percent of our self is expressed through our mind; our mind is the expression of our self Matt 16:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, to deny our natural mind is to deny our self.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One day a brother came to me and said, Brother Lee, I do not know how to deny my self.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord tells us to deny the self, but I simply do not know how to deny it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I said, Brother, to deny your natural mind and natural way of thinking is the real denial of your self.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You need to hate your natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many times believers like to use the expressions I think or I thought.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is often the self expressed through the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever we use the words I think or I thought, we need to tell ourselves that our natural mind has been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It has been brought to an end by being put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to deny it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our old man which has already been crucified with Christ is expressed almost exclusively through the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, we need to be renewed in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we want to be renewed in our mind, we need to deny the natural thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Recently another brother and I were traveling together.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As we stayed together, we had differences in our way of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He considered me merely as a northern Chinese, and I considered him merely as a Cantonese.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Much trouble like this originates from our unrenewed mind.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The more I thought about that brother in this way, the more ground I gave to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If I had gone along with my thoughts about him, I might have gone to his room and started quarreling.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In order to avoid this, I needed to deny my natural mind, my thinking, and my self.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I even needed to say, Satan, get away from me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I will not go along with you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I will not go along with my natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I will walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ is now indwelling my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I will not follow my mind, but I will walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then I was able to go to the brother and say, Let us pray for the Lord s work and for the meeting tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I had a different attitude.</S>
