   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Rebellion of Satan</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ezekiel 28:15 says that Satan was perfect in his ways from the day he was created.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Of course, God didn't create an evil Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God created a good and perfect archangel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But at a certain time, this archangel, the anointed cherub, rebelled against God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1 The Cause</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Satan rebelled against God because of pride in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ezekiel 28:17 says that his heart was lifted up because of his beauty, that he corrupted his wisdom by reason of his brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was "full of wisdom and perfect in beauty"; he "sealed up the sum," Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>28:12 meaning that he had the full measure of completeness and was short of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But he gazed on his beauty and was proud.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He looked at his brightness and became corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To look at what God has made us and forget God Himself always tempts us to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Pride was the cause of Satan's rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So, the Apostle would never allow "a novice" to be an elder in the church, "lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment of the Devil" 1 Tim 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the natural virtues and attributes, and all the spiritual gifts can be utilized by the Devil to make us proud.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even the Apostle Paul could be "exceedingly lifted up by the transcendence of the revelations" 2 Cor 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The proud Devil is still prowling about on the earth, seeking the proud ones whom he may devour 1 Pet 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The only way to "resist" him is to "humble" ourselves, to gird ourselves with humility because "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble" 1 Pet 5:9, 5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus is a good example in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Satan exalted himself, but the Lord Jesus "humbled Himself" Phil 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, the Lord overcame Satan, and Satan had nothing in Him John 14:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2 The Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The purpose of Satan's rebellion was to exalt himself to be equal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Isaiah 14:13-14 we find that five times Satan said "I will," at the time of his rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"I will ascend..I will exalt my throne..I will sit also upon the mount..I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Satan wanted to be equal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That was the purpose of his rebellion against God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ambition for position was the motivation of every rebellion recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The rebellion at Babel Gen 11:4 , the rebellion of Dathan, Abiram, and the two hundred and fifty princes of the Israelites Num 16:1-3 , and the rebellion of Absalom 2 Sam 15:10-12 , were all because of the evil ambition for position.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the Lord Jesus "emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave...Wherefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name" Phil 2:7, 9 .</S>
