The Trespass Offering</h2><p>The trespass offering is Christ for the sins of God&#8217;s people (5:1-6:7; 7:1-10). Christ has made propitiation for our sins, our trespasses, as well as for our sin. With Christ as the sin offering and as the trespass offering, we no longer have any problems with God. We may now be at peace and in peace enjoy Christ with God.<p>The types in chapters one through seven of Leviticus show us how much Christ is to us. These chapters show us many fine points concerning Christ. We need to learn to be fine in experiencing Christ in all these fine points.<h2 class=head2>F. The Burnt Offering Being the Qualification for the Sin Offering</h2><p>The burnt offering is the qualification for the sin offering. As the burnt offering, Christ is absolute for God. If Christ had not been absolute for God, He would not have been qualified to be our sin offering. Adam fell because he was not absolute for God. If he had been absolute for God, he would not have been deceived. Adam was deceived because he was not absolute for God. Eventually Christ came, and He was absolute for God and He was never deceived. This absolute One was perfect and was qualified to be our sin offering to deal with the sin in our nature. Christ&#8217;s absoluteness for God qualified Him to be the sin offering.<h2 class=head2>G. The Meal Offering Being the Qualification for the Trespass Offering</h2><p>The meal offering is the qualification for the trespass offering. If Christ had not been perfect in His humanity but had had many defects, shortcomings, and wrongdoings, He Himself would have needed a trespass offering and thus would not have been qualified to be our trespass offering. However, in His humanity Christ was perfect, fine, and balanced; He was altogether without defects, mistakes, shortcomings, and wrongdoings. His perfection qualified Him to be our trespass offering.<p>The burnt offering is for the sin offering. Thus, these two offerings are linked. Likewise, the meal offering is for the trespass offering. Thus, these two offerings are linked. If Christ had not been absolute for God, He could not have been our sin offering to deal with the sin in our nature. If He had not been perfect in His humanity, He could not have been our trespass offering to take away our trespasses. Christ was absolute toward God, and He was perfect in His humanity. Therefore, He was qualified to deal with our sin and to take away our trespasses.<h2 class=head2>H. The Peace Offering Being the Issue of All the Other Four Offerings</h2><p>The peace offering is the issue of all the other four offerings. This means that the peace offering is the totality of the other four offerings. Christ&#8217;s being these four offerings consummates in peace between God and God&#8217;s people, and this peace is simply Christ Himself. As the peace offering, Christ is the food we enjoy with God and the food God enjoys with us. In Christ as our peace offering we have co-enjoyment in fellowship.<p>We need to bring all these points concerning Christ as the offerings into our church life, and practice cooking Christ and presenting Christ to God in the church meetings. We all need to learn to cook Christ finely, to eat Him finely, and to present Him finely. This is the way we should study the book of Leviticus. We should not only have a doctrinal knowledge of the fine points concerning Christ; we should also learn to cook Christ, to present Christ to God, and to enjoy Christ with God as the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. By doing this we shall be fully constituted into those who desire to enter into the tabernacle and dwell there to enjoy the contents of the Triune God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
