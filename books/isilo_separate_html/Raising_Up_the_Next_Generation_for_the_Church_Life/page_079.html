<h1 class="title">BRINGING THE YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
INTO THE CHURCH LIFE<br />
THROUGH THE HOMES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 2:46-47; Rom. 16:5a; Acts 20:20; Heb. 10:25</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>We see clearly that the building of the church is based on home meetings; the home meeting is God&rsquo;s unique way to build His church and reach His goal&mdash;Acts 2:46-47; Rom. 16:5a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the early days of the church life, the apostles built up the church very quickly, and the way of building was the small groups and home meetings&mdash;Acts 9:31.</li>
	<li>The home meetings are the top way, the super way, and eventually the unique way to meet&mdash;Rom. 16:5a and footnote 1.</li>
	<li>At the very beginning the way created by the Holy Spirit and ordained by God was to meet in two ways, in the congregational way and in the home way&mdash;Acts 20:20.</li>
	<li>The home meetings are the unique way for the increase and building up of the church.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We should endeavor to bring the young people into the practice of the church life through the homes; the small group becomes our practical church life:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to be in a definite local church that we can say is our local church; those who are not in the church life are orphans without a home; the day we came into the church life, we knew that we had come home.</li>
	<li>To bring the meetings to the homes is the very heart of the God-ordained way; it is a great failure in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery if we cannot bring the meetings to the homes:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The influence of the home meetings is most helpful for the families of the saints; from early days the children will be surrounded by a spiritual atmosphere, and will have constant opportunity to see the reality of eternal things&mdash;2 Tim. 3:15.</li>
		<li>The children in the home meetings will be preserved from drifting with the current of the age; in the end, the family will become proper and normal.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>According to today&rsquo;s situation, you should not consider that to recover someone, you must bring that person to the big meetings in order to be successful; as long as he can come to the home meetings every week, that will be very good&mdash;Acts 2:47; John 15:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The big meetings cannot keep them, but the meetings from house to house bring people into the foundation of the church; once a person joins the home meetings, he is kept; this is God&rsquo;s wisdom.</li>
		<li>To bring the young people in is easy, but to keep them is not so easy; begin by keeping them through their junior high years; then you have to keep them through their high school years; finally, labor to keep them through college; after that, they will be safe and secure.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need the young people to go to the campuses, especially those who are eighteen and nineteen years old; all the young people in the church life are useful; this is why we have to work with our high schoolers:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The gospel must go out from the homes; even the campus work can go out from the homes; for a church to be strong, the home meetings must be built up.</li>
		<li>The young people in the church can invite others to the homes of the middle-aged ones and of the young couples; all these homes need to be open and ready to receive the young people.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Actually, the church life will be carried out practically in the group meeting; the most important thing today is to have our own group meeting, which can be considered as our own assembly&mdash;Heb. 10:25.</li>
	<li>We need to lead the young people to come together to break bread and teach them to understand what the breaking of bread is and what its significance is; this is part of their church life.</li>
	</ol></li>
