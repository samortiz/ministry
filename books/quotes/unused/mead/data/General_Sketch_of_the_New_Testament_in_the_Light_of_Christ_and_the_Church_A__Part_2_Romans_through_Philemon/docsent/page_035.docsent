   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Work of the Ministry Being to Turn Our Soul from the Body to the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The soul of an unbeliever is one hundred percent on the side of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not one bit of his soul is turned to his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The soul of a young believer in Christ is also very much on the side of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although he loves the Lord, his soul is not much incorporated with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How much of our own soul is attached to our flesh, and how much does our soul stand with our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We spend too much time with the flesh and very little with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In what way can our soul turn from the flesh to the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not by teaching but by suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Teaching is not adequate to turn our soul from the body to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Teaching can cause us to understand, but it does not bring us into the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more a brother or sister suffers physically and materially, the more his or her soul progressively turns from the side of the flesh to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that the outer man is being consumed and the inner man is being renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have seen many dear brothers and sisters who were strong persons prior to their suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were strong in the body and in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then the Lord put them into a situation of sickness, and they suffered physically for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Gradually, the more they suffered physically, the more their mind, will, and emotion were turned from the body to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, such persons who have been suffering physically for a long time become very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their mind, emotion, and will are very much on the side of the spirit instead of on the side of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that the outer man is consumed and the inner man is renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is in this way that the Lord deals with our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suffering turns our soul from the body to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the work of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>MINISTERS OF GOD BY THE WORKING OF THE CROSS Being Wrought with the Lord and Knowing Him</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Chapter six stresses the working of the cross and Christ being wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 4 says, "But in everything we commend ourselves as ministers of God."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other books written by the apostle Paul, he called himself a servant or slave, but in this book he uses mostly the word minister.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Greek text, the words slave and minister are different.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word slave has a particular background.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At that time around the Mediterranean Sea there was a custom that one could be sold to a master to be a bondman, someone without any freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was Paul's meaning when he used the word slave.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The apostles were the Lord's slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word minister, on the other hand, means that something of the Lord has been wrought into someone to make him the minister of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Someone may be a person's slave but not be a good minister to him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be a slave means that he has no liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He has been sold to another, he has no rights, and he submits to his master.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, it is very possible that he may not know anything about his master.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He may know how to submit to him, but he does not know what his master intends to do and what his thoughts and desires are.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then, although he may be a good slave, he is not a good minister.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to be a minister and deal with people on behalf of his master, a person must be wrought by his master.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The master's heart, desire, intention, thought, and relationships with others must be clear to that person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then he can go to others as a minister representing his master and speaking exactly according to him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can see this in diplomatic affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The foreign minister of a country, such as the American ambassador to China, must be a man who knows the affairs of his government.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If someone knows his government's intention, purpose, policy, desire, and relationship with other nations, he can be the proper representative to another country.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, if someone is a citizen of a country yet does not know anything about his government's affairs, he can never be a minister of his country.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the same way, if something of the Lord has been wrought into a servant of the Lord, he becomes a minister of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 2 Corinthians the term minister is used more than in other books because in this book the servants of the Lord are wrought by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Something of the Lord's character, life, intention, desire, and purpose has been wrought into them to make them the ministers of Christ.</S>
