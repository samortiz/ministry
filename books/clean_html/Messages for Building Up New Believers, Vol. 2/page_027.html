<h2 class="head2">B. How to Return</h2>
<p>Our manner of life has to be righteous, and our conscience must be void of offense before God. God&rsquo;s Word says, &ldquo;Then it shall be, when he sins and is guilty, that he shall return what he took by robbery&rdquo; (v. 4). The word <em>return</em> is very important. There are two aspects to the trespass offering. On the one hand, there is the need of propitiation before God. On the other hand, there is the need to &ldquo;return&rdquo; to man that which has been taken. Do not think that propitiation before God is sufficient. You must also return to man that which has been taken. If you do not return it, something is lacking. The trespass offering in Leviticus 5 deals with sins that do not involve material transgressions against people. Of course, there is no need to return anything in that case. But the sins spoken of in chapter six involve material loss, in which case one must return something. Propitiation through sacrifice was not enough. One still had to &ldquo;return&rdquo; that which was taken. This is why verse 4 says, &ldquo;Then it shall be, when he sins and is guilty, that he shall return what he took by robbery.&rdquo; Everything acquired through sinful means must be returned. One must return what was taken by robbery, what was gained through extortion, what was deposited with him, whatever has been found, and whatever has been falsely sworn. All of these things must be returned.</p>
<p>How does a person return these things? &ldquo;He shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more; he shall give it to whom it belongs on the day he is found guilty&rdquo; (v. 5). Here are three things that we need to take note of.</p>
<p>First, we have to make restitution in full. We are wrong if we do not make any restitution. We are equally wrong if our restitution is not made in full. No one should consider an apology as being sufficient. If the object in question remains in our house, it proves that we are still wrong; we have to return it in full.</p>
<p>Second, God wants us to not only return in full, but also to add one-fifth more when we make a recompense. Why must we add one-fifth? According to this principle, we have to return abundantly. If we have taken money or things from others, God wants us to add one-fifth to the full amount when we return it. God does not want His children to return the bare minimum. In printing books one has to leave margins at the top, bottom, left, and right of a page. Similarly, we should not be stingy in apologizing to people and returning what has been taken from them. We must be generous and liberal.</p>
<p>Some people do not add one-fifth to their recompense. In fact, they return much less than one-fifth of what was owed. They apologize by saying, &ldquo;Although I offended you in this matter, I was not wrong in other matters. In other matters I did not offend you; rather, you offended me.&rdquo; This is a settling of accounts, not a confession. If you want to confess, do not be that stingy. It is all right to apologize more than you need to, but do not apologize less. Why did you sin in the first place? Since you have to recompense now, be more generous. Do not take things away from others and then return only that much to them. You have to return generously.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s children should behave in a way that is worthy of their dignity. Even in the matter of confession, we should do it in a way that is worthy of our dignity. An apology that is in the way of settling accounts is not the kind of confession that God&rsquo;s children should have. God&rsquo;s children should confess their transgressions thoroughly and add one-fifth to the recompense. No one should be calculating and unwilling to make the smallest of sacrifices when confessing. If you are concerned about how much each party owes the other when you apologize, you are not behaving like a Christian. Some people say, &ldquo;I was not angry at first, but your words made me angry. Since I have confessed my wrong already, it is your turn to confess your wrong.&rdquo; This is altogether a matter of settling accounts; this is not a confession. If you are making a confession, you should go an extra mile. Be more generous in the matter of confession. Do not withhold anything in your confession; instead, try to be liberal in it.</p>
<p>Adding one-fifth to our confession or recompense reminds us that offending others is a losing proposition and that we should never do it again. When a new believer offends others, he should realize that he will suffer loss eventually, even though he may gain something temporarily. He took five-fifths, but he has to return six-fifths. It is easy to take something from someone. But when you return it, you have to not only return it in full but also add one-fifth.</p>
<p>Third, we should make our confession and recompense as soon as possible. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;He shall give it to whom it belongs on the day he is found guilty.&rdquo; If it is within our ability to return the object, or if the object in question is still in our hand, we should return it on the day we learn of this sin. It is easy for people to delay in this matter. But the more God&rsquo;s children put off confession and recompense, the more their feeling will become dull. As soon as we receive the light, we have to act upon it. We have to return it that very day. Hopefully, our brothers and sisters will take a straight path from the day they become a Christian. We should never take advantage of others and never be unrighteous. The basic principle of the Christian life on earth is not to take advantage of others. Taking advantage of others in any way is wrong. We must not take advantage of others. Instead, we must be righteous from the very beginning.</p>
<p>We have to give back to others. But this is not all. We should not think that everything is settled after we have made our apology and recompense. The matter is not settled. &ldquo;Then he shall bring to the priest his trespass offering to Jehovah, a ram without blemish from the flock, according to the valuation, for a trespass offering&rdquo; (v. 6). After we have confessed to and recompensed others, we still have to go to God for forgiveness. The trespass offering in chapter five deals with just God because no material loss is involved. But chapter six speaks of transgression against man. Therefore, one must deal with man first, before going to God to ask for forgiveness. Before a matter has been settled with man, one cannot go to God to ask for forgiveness. What happens once one has settled the matter with man and has asked for forgiveness before God? &ldquo;The priest shall make propitiation for him before Jehovah, and he shall be forgiven for whatever he may have done by which he has become guilty&rdquo; (v. 7). This is what the Lord wants. Whoever has transgressed materially against man should try his best to make recompense. Then he can come before God and ask for forgiveness through the Lord&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>We should not consider this as a trivial matter. Once we are careless, we take advantage of others and transgress against them. God&rsquo;s children should remember this point and pay attention to it all their lives. In whatever matter they have transgressed against others, they should return these things to them and ask God for forgiveness.</p>
