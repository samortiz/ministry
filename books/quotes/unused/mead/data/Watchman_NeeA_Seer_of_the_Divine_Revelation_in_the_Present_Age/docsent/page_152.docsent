   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE WITNESS LEE'S RELATIONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH WATCHMAN NEE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FROM 1925 TO 1935 INITIAL CONTACT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the beginning of our history, a great geographical distance existed between me and Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was in the southern province of Fukien, and I was in the northern province of Shantung.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was saved in 1920 and I in 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My mother's maternal grandfather was a Southern Baptist, who in turn brought my mother into Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She studied in the American Southern Baptist mission school and as a teen-ager was baptized into the Southern Baptist Church about 1885.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I was born in 1905.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She brought me in contact with her Baptist Church in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I studied in the Southern Baptist Chinese elementary school and in the English mission college operated by the American Presbyterians in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Though I attended the Southern Baptist Church services and Sunday school in my youth, I was not saved and was never baptized by them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, for about five years, I ceased attending any Christian services.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After my second sister experienced salvation, she prayed for me and introduced me to a very fine Chinese pastor of the Chinese Independent Church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This pastor paid me a number of visits, encouraging me to attend his Sunday morning services.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After a long delay on my part, on the second day of the Chinese New Year in 1925, I decided early in the morning to attend the services of that Chinese Independent Church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After about two and a half months, they baptized me into their membership by sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But it was not until a short time later that I was actually saved and turned to the Lord through the preaching of Sister Peace Wang in April of the same year.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At that time I was exceedingly ambitious as a young man for my education and my future.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But after I was saved under Sister Peace Wang's preaching that afternoon, while I was walking home, I stopped and prayed to God, according to Sister Wang's message, somewhat as follows: "God, I don't like being usurped by Satan as Pharaoh, through the world as Egypt; I would like to serve You and preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus through the villages at any cost for my whole life."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From that day I loved the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word of the Bible became sweeter than honey, as mentioned in Psalm 19:10 and in Psalm 119:103.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Word nourished me, changed my life, and caused me to love the Lord and follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I collected as many books on the Bible as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Soon I was led to attend the Brethren Assembly the Benjamin Newton branch in our town.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The way they expounded the Bible and taught biblical truths attracted me very much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From the year I was saved, I continuously attended their meetings for seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I learned much from them, especially in the matters of biblical types, prophecies, and parables.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their teachings helped me to give up worldliness in its outward aspect and kept me from drifting away from the Lord's pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, I did not receive much help from them in the matters of life, the Spirit, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I received a great deal of knowledge from their teachings but very little life.</S>
