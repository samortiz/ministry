   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Jehovah's Commission to Elijah</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in His Discouragement</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 Kings 19:9b-18 we have the record of Jehovah's commission to Elijah in his discouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Elijah was thoroughly disappointed, God came in to give him a further commission so that he might learn something more.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Elijah's shutting up of the heavens, his opening of the heavens, and his calling fire down had nothing to do with God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the disciple John asked whether the Lord Jesus wanted them to command fire to come down and consume a village, He rebuked them, saying, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are" Luke 9:55 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that the Lord Jesus did not come to be an Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, He came to accomplish God's economy by being put on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's economy is altogether beyond the physical world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today's Christianity, however, focuses on the physical world, and many like to see miracles and healings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus did many healings and even raised people from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when He was arrested, He did not call fire down.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He delivered Himself into His killers' hands.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even though they came to kill Him, He did not do anything to save Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The situation was similar with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the beginning of his ministry, Paul did many miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, later, when Timothy was sick, Paul only said to him, "Use a little wine for the sake of your stomach" 1 Tim 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Paul was ready to be martyred, there was no miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, there was only the Triune God to be Paul's enjoyment in the spirit as the bountiful supply, enabling him to endure persecution willingly and triumphantly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul was ready for persecution and martyrdom because he was full of God, saturated with God, and constituted with God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Caesar Nero killed him, but through his fourteen Epistles Paul gained the entire world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Elijah had not learned these lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He ran away in fear because, unlike Paul, he did not have the Triune God wrought into him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He entered into a cave to hide, thinking that he could do nothing and that it was better for him to die.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God did not rebuke him, but instead He indicated that there was still a commission for Elijah to carry out.</S>
