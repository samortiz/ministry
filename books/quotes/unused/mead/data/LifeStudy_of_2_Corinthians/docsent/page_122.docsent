   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FORTY-SIX THE APOSTLE S FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MINISTRY TO THE NEEDY SAINTS 1 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 8:1-15</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul wrote the Epistles of 1 and 2 Corinthians as a loving father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In his first Epistle Paul disciplined the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Parents know that in disciplining children we run the risk of alienating them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a parent disciplines a child without limitation, the child may want to run away from home.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After writing 1 Corinthians, Paul was concerned about how the believers at Corinth would react to his discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul was not at rest about the matter, and he even regretted somewhat writing that Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was concerned that the entire church in Corinth would be alienated from him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because of his deep concern, he was eagerly awaiting Titus to bring him news of the response of the Corinthians to his first Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In chapter two Paul did not have rest in his spirit, for he did not find Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But we see from chapter seven that Titus came with good news.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul s first Epistle had caused sorrow to the Corinthians, but this sorrow produced repentance unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That salvation was a full reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Paul heard this good news, he was beside himself with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As he says in 7:13, We rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When he wrote his second Epistle, Paul was in such an atmosphere of encouragement and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, as we read chapter seven, we can touch the feeling in Paul s spirit, a feeling of deep concern for the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>DEEP FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All those who would care for the churches or serve the Lord need to be impressed with Paul s spirit in chapter seven.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we see the proper attitude in serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We also see that in ancient times the fellowship between the believers and the apostles was not as shallow as it is among believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In ancient times, the believers were in the hearts of the apostles, and the apostles were in the hearts of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fellowship among them all was very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They lived together in such a deep fellowship that they were even willing to die together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The situation among many Christians today is very different.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christians may travel from group to group without having deep fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For them, a Christian group is like a hotel where people come, stay for a while, and then go elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our fellowship in the Lord s recovery should not be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The local churches should not be motels for those traveling from place to place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As members of our Father s family, our fellowship should be deep.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should be in one another s hearts, and nothing should be able to separate us from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even if we are disciplined by others, we should still love the church family and never forsake it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>AN EXTRAORDINARY MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Chapters eight and nine of 2 Corinthians are both on the matter of the apostle s fellowship concerning the ministry to the needy saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Apparently this has nothing to do with what Paul has covered in chapters six and seven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 2 Corinthians 6 and 7 we have Paul s work of reconciliation, and in chapters eight and nine, the ministry to the needy saints.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without the reconciliation described in chapters six and seven, it is not possible to have the ministry to the needy saints presented in chapters eight and nine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, the ministry in these chapters is the issue of the work of reconciliation in the preceding chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that if we would carry on a proper ministry to the needy saints, we need to be reconciled to God, brought back to Him in full.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to be those living in God, those who have no separation between them and God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The ministry to the needy saints recorded in chapters eight and nine is extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to have this extraordinary ministry, a ministry to the needy saints in other parts of the world, we need a reconciled life, a life fully reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In his second Epistle, Paul first pointed out to the believers at Corinth that as ministers of the new covenant, the apostles had received the ministry to reconcile God s people fully back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then in chapter six Paul carried on this ministry, doing a fine work to reconcile the distracted Corinthians back to God in full.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After accomplishing such a work, he went on to fellowship with them that they should have a ministry to supply the needy saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The sequence in these chapters is important.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If chapters eight and nine were at the beginning of this book, they would certainly be out of place.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But one chapter follows another like steps in a staircase.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I believe that as Paul was writing this Epistle he had the sense that he was taking one step after another.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only after he had done an excellent work to reconcile the distracted saints back to God did he present them with the ministry of caring for the needy saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, we should not regard these chapters as separated and isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Apparently chapters eight and nine are on a different subject from chapters six and seven.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Actually in Paul s thought all these chapters are connected.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Through Paul s reconciling work, the saints in Corinth were brought back to God, repented, and received more salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then in 8:1 Paul says, Furthermore, we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God which has been given to the churches of Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The word furthermore indicates that certain preparations have been made and that a particular atmosphere and condition exist for the writer to present something further.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, Paul goes on to speak of the grace of God bestowed upon the churches of Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His aim was that the Corinthian believers would participate in supplying the needy saints.</S>
