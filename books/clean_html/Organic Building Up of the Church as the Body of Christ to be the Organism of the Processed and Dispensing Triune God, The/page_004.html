<h2 class="head2">Through the Release of the Divine Life<br />
by Christ as the One Grain of Wheat<br />
Falling into the Ground and<br />
Dying There for His Multiplication</h2>
<p>Christ became the essence of the church through the release of the divine life. This divine life had to be released from His divine being. If the divine life had only remained in His divine being, concealed in His human body, it could have never been our life. For this life to be yours and mine, it had to be released. The divine life was released by Christ as the one grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying there for His multiplication (John 12:24). The life of a grain of wheat is confined within the shell of the grain. When the grain falls into the earth and dies, the shell is broken and the inner life of the grain is released. Christ went through such a death. He was like a grain of wheat falling into the earth and dying in order to be released. With His death, the divine life was released from one grain into many grains.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through the Impartation of the Divine Life<br />
by Christ as the Firstborn<br />
Son of God in His Resurrection,<br />
That God May Have Many Sons<br />
as the Many Brothers of Christ</h2>
<p>We were made the children of God as the bride of Christ through the impartation of the divine life by Christ, as the firstborn Son of God in His resurrection, that God may have many sons as the many brothers of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:11-12). The release of the divine life is one thing, but the impartation of the divine life is another. The divine life was released out of Christ&rsquo;s human shell. Now this released divine life has been imparted into us, the believers of Christ. This took place at the time Christ was resurrected. His resurrection included us (Eph. 2:6). We all were resurrected in Him, with Him, and by Him. Before we were born, we had already been resurrected nearly two thousand years ago (1 Pet. 1:3). The church is a resurrected item. Before resurrection, God had only one Son, His only begotten Son (John 1:18; 3:16). In His resurrection, He became the firstborn Son with many brothers. Now He is our big Brother, and we are the many sons of God. The divine life imparted into us in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is the intrinsic essence of the church, the organic Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Many Brothers of Christ Being<br />
His Many Branches Grafted into Him,<br />
the True Vine in the Universe, to Bear Much Fruit<br />
for His Enlargement in His Spreading, That They<br />
Might Express the Triune God as His Organism</h2>
<p>The many brothers of Christ are His many branches grafted into Him, the true vine in the universe, to bear much fruit for His enlargement in His spreading, that they might express the Triune God as His organism (John 15:1, 5, 16, 8). This universal vine tree is our essence. God is our essence, Christ is our essence, and the vine tree is also our essence. The vine tree with its branches, the intrinsic and organic spreading of Christ, becomes Christ&rsquo;s enlargement. In London, England, there is a vine tree which is called the Queen&rsquo;s vine. Someone took me to see this vine tree in 1958. When he remarked about how large this vine was, I replied that this vine did not surprise me because I had seen a much bigger one. I am a branch of that big vine. The Queen&rsquo;s vine is very small in comparison to the true vine. The vine of which I am a part is so long that it encircles the whole earth. This is the real great vine, which is the essence of the church. As the branches of the true vine, we are the multiplication of Christ, the duplication of Christ, the spreading of Christ, and the enlargement of Christ. This multiplication, duplication, spreading, and enlargement, the true vine with its branches, is the organism of the Triune God.</p>
