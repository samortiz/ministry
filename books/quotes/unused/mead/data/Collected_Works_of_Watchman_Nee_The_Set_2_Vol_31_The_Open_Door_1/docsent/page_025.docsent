   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although I have not yet written to you, I have never forgotten about you.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Holy Spirit released many profound messages through Mr. Sparks.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I cannot greet the saints one by one by name in this letter, but every one of you is most precious in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the name of the Lord whom we all love, I greet you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all share the same life in Him!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This letter shows you the oneness that is in the Body of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A Letter from Lin Kwang-biao, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sister X:</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the beginning of last month, I heard that planes bombed Ning-Po.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because my mother and my two sons were there, I had to leave Shanghai to see them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But after arriving in Ning-Po, the coastal regions were blocked off, and I could not return to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Communication did not resume until three weeks later.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although the city is no longer as busy as it was before the bombing, the situation is much better than at the time of the bombing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although my mother and my two sons suffered much shock, they are safe.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They do not want to come to Shanghai, and they have decided to move to the countryside for now.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although this cannot guarantee their safety, it is nevertheless more peaceful than in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the city there are air raid sirens every day; one does not find this in the countryside.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the third of this month I left Ning-Po for Shanghai and arrived in Shanghai on the fourth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All the brothers and sisters in Shanghai are well.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Please do not worry.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The number in the meeting has dropped greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some have left because of their jobs; some have left because they lost their jobs, but God has preserved the brothers and sisters here.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May the Lord be merciful to us, and may He grant grace to afford much opportunity for many to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord's grace be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Brother Lin Kwang-biao</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>December 8</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Address omitted</S>
