   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REALIZING THAT WE ARE HOPELESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND ACCEPTING CHRIST AS OUR VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During the past two years, I have seen two kinds of sickness among many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One is temper, and the other is anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many people only know that temper is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They do not realize that anxiety is also a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people cannot deal with their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Neither reading the Bible nor praying will help them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They struggle for eight or ten years, yet still remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They can do nothing about themselves, and they see no change in them at all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God knows that we do not have a way in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why He gave us another way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His way is to remove us and have the Lord Jesus be our life and victory within and to live instead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many of us have not seen this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result we wonder what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I was preaching in England, a friend of mine invited me to his home which was not far away.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He had several sons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He and his wife could not overcome, and they were continually defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When one child cried, he became unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the second one cried, he became angry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the third child cried, he could not hold back his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He often tried his best to suppress his temper, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not suppress it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He insisted that I come to his house to tell them how they could overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When I went that evening, his wife said, "Mr. Nee, you know what victory means.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both of us want to overcome, but our children are very trying on us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can overcome everything else, but our children are our real test.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can be patient when we are among our friends and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But we fail completely with our children."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I heard this, I laughed because I realized that here were two more persons whom Christ could deliver.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some people are too moral and too refined; they can never realize the meaning of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord only has a way with those who cannot find their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was why I laughed; I felt that they were ready for deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I asked the wife, "Why do you want to be patient?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She said, "Because I have a quick disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have asked God to give me patience so that I will not lose my temper."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I said, "You can do nothing about this, and you have asked God for patience, but He has not given it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is that right?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She said, "That's right.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have prayed for eight or nine years, but God seems to have ignored my prayer; He has not given me any patience."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I said, "You have asked God for patience, but He knows that you do not need it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has not given you patience, because you are not lacking in patience."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She said, "Mr. Nee, what do you mean? I have never heard of such a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Don't you think that I lack patience?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Are you saying that I do not need patience?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I said, "That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You lack only one thing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has put Christ in us to be our life, righteousness, holiness, redemption, and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Everything that God wants to give us is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God has given us Christ so that Christ would overcome on our behalf."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then she realized that the way to victory had nothing to do with her.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not we who overcome; it is Christ who overcomes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the biblical secret to victory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not the power of Christ that lives in me, but Christ Himself who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I no longer live; it is altogether Christ who lives.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is victory.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This was God's goal in the garden of Eden that Christ would live for man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's goal is for Christ to be life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once I was at a brother's house, and his wife said to me, "Mr. Nee, something has been wrong with me for the last few days.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everything with my family has been fine except for my few children, who have been very naughty.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If I lock them up in the house, they become rowdy, and if I let them out of the house, they fight with other children.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They cannot keep quiet in the house, and I worry about them when they leave the house.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many times I am driven to tears by anxiety over them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I cannot do anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What should I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I smiled because when man does not have a way, the Lord will have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I said to her, "Is victory something of yourself or of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If it is of you, you will not know what to do when there are three or four more children.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But if it is of Christ, will three or four children fighting with each other be too much for Christ to overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Of course not!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You are failing because you are bearing this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is why you cannot be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But if Christ lives for you and Christ disciplines your children for you, you will be patient."</S>
