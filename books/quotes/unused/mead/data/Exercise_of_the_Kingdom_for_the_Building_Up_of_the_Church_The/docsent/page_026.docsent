   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RUNNING THE RACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND PRESSING TOWARD THE PRIZE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 Corinthians 9:24-27 Paul said that he was running the race.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this portion of the Word he tells us clearly that he was concerned for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 9:27 says, But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be disapproved Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>. Paul realized that although he was preaching the gospel of the kingdom to others, he himself might be disapproved, that is, be cast away.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some versions use the word disqualified.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In a race some are qualified and others are disqualified; some are approved and others are disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are approved, we shall gain the prize, which is the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if we are disapproved, we shall be cast away and not receive the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Philippians 3 Paul said clearly that he did not count himself to have gained.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verses 13 and 14 he said, Brethren, I count not myself to have gained: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and stretching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>. The way Paul was pressing toward the prize was by knowing Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He wanted to know how Christ suffered for the kingdom, and he wanted to share in that suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul realized that Christ had been spun into thin thread, and he wanted to be the same as He, even conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ had been crucified on the cross to become nothing, and Paul also wanted to become nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul realized that in himself he could not attain to this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He had to know the power of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, Paul said that he could do all things in Him who empowered him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This One, the resurrected One, today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is the bountiful supply within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are willing to cooperate with Him and open to Him, He will fill us to the brim.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The tide of the bountiful supply of the Spirit will fill us and flood us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There will not even be the need for us to swim, for the tide will flood us and carry us on.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 2 Timothy 4:6 Paul said that he was already being poured out as a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The next two verses say, I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Notice in verse 8 Paul does not speak of a crown of mercy, grace, or love, but a crown of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 2 Timothy 4:18 he says, And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here the Apostle Paul even uses the term the heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This refers to the reward of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No doubt, Paul will be one of the co-kings with Christ, one reigning over the nations during the thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That will be Paul s reward and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE PARTICULAR ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To receive the kingdom reward is to have the uttermost enjoyment of the Lord in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today we enjoy Christ, and in eternity we also shall enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the Christ we enjoy today and shall enjoy in eternity is the common portion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the millennium, Christ will be the common portion to all His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But during the millennium He will be a particular portion to the overcomers, to His co-kings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This particular portion will be the prize, the reward, to His faithful followers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the reward of the kingdom, which is altogether a matter of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today we have a marvelous foretaste of the sweetness of enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if we exercise ourselves in the kingdom today, the topmost, particular portion of the enjoyment of Christ will be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE JOY OF THE EXERCISE OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even today, as we are under the exercise of the kingdom, we are enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Apparently it is not a pleasant matter to deny the self, to take up the cross, and to lose the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, when we enter into the exercise of the kingdom, all this becomes an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once you have tasted it, you will never want to leave it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You will desire to deny yourself because the best enjoyment of Christ is in self-denial and in the losing of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you do not believe me, I ask you to try it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some may say, This sounds like Hinduism.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I don t want to suffer this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you hold this attitude, you will find it difficult to pray or to smile inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The only smile you will have will be an outward, manufactured smile.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You may claim to be happy, but you will have no happiness deep within.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But those who are willing to take Christ as their life by His bountiful supply, denying the self, taking up the cross, and losing the soul, will be full of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What joy they will have!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the time comes for them to praise the Lord, their joy will burst forth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Which do you prefer an outward smile or this deep joy?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I am not an angel; rather, I am a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At times I may be offended by a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, if I do not deny myself, bear the cross, and lose the soul when I am offended, I shall be saving my soul.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whenever I save my soul like this, I cannot pray or read the Bible well.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, I cannot even sit comfortably or rest well.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But if, by the Lord s mercy and grace, I take Christ as my bountiful supply and live by Him, exercising myself under the kingdom, I shall lose my soul.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I deny myself, take up my cross, and have joy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To deny the self, to take up the cross, and to lose the soul is not a Hindu teaching or a form of asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the contrary, it is an enjoyment of Christ Himself deep in our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What comfort and intimacy this is!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How real is the presence of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the enjoyment of the exercise of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This will qualify us to receive the reward of the kingdom so that we may enter into the highest enjoyment of Christ in His millennial reign.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The matter of the exercise of the kingdom should not merely be a teaching to us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It must be our genuine experience today for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we continue in this exercise, the kingdom will be ours, the church will spontaneously be built up, we shall be qualified to reign with Christ in the kingdom, and we shall be rewarded with the special enjoyment of Christ in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As an exercise, the kingdom is ours today, and we are in it Matt 5:3, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As a reward, the kingdom will be our enjoyment in the future, and we shall enter into it Matt 5:20; 18:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the exercise of the kingdom today, we are under the heavenly ruling; but in the reward of the kingdom in the next age, we shall rule as kings over the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hence, in the exercise of the kingdom today, being ruled by the heavens, we are losing our soul, that is, losing the enjoyment of our soul; but in the reward of the kingdom in the future, ruling over the nations, we shall save our soul, that is, gain the enjoyment of our soul.</S>
