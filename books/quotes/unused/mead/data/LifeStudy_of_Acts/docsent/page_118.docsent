   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE THE PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ASIA MINOR AND EUROPE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PAUL S COMPANY 5 Scripture Reading: Acts 14:1-28 A BOOK OF GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not my burden in this Life-study of Acts to cover all the minor points contained in this long book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, I am not burdened to speak on such a matter as David being a man according to God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, my burden in this Life-study is to cover all the crucial points regarding God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, I am concerned with all the things in Acts that bear a dispensational significance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I do not use the word dispensational to refer to an age or to God s way of dealing with people during a certain period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, in these messages the word dispensation denotes the divine arrangement in God s eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the book of Acts there is much to see concerning this divine arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Acts, therefore, is a book of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many Christians do not have this understanding of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Acts is not merely concerned with acts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a book showing us God s dispensation, God s economy, God s arrangement in His eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>My burden in these Life-study Messages is to cover the matter of God s economy in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As I come to a particular chapter in Acts, my goal is to see something concerning the divine arrangement of God s economy in that chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is my goal as we come to chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It may seem that in this chapter we cannot see anything concerning the divine arrangement in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if we study this chapter carefully, we shall be able to see some matters related to this divine arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TO ICONIUM</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 14:1 says, Now it came about in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews and spoke in such a way that a great multitude believed, both of Jews and of Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As in 13:5 and 14, they did not go to attend the Jewish synagogue gathering, but to take advantage of that gathering to announce the word of God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 2 continues, But the Jews who disobeyed stirred up and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here the Greek word rendered minds literally means souls.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Word of God s Grace</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Acts 14:3 goes on to say, Therefore they stayed a considerable time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who testified to the word of His grace, granting signs and wonders to be done through their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we have pointed out, the Lord s grace is the Triune God received and enjoyed by the believers and expressed in their salvation, change in life, and holy living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the Lord testified to the word of His grace, He granted signs and wonders to be done through the hands of Paul and Barnabas.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Wonders and signs are not part of God s central testimony of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ; neither are they part of His full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, signs and wonders are only evidences that what the apostles preached and ministered was absolutely of God, not of man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The phrase the word of His grace denotes certain dispensational points.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the synagogues the Jewish people did not read the Old Testament in order to know the word of the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, they read the Scriptures in order to know the word of God s law, a word belonging to the old dispensation, to the former divine arrangement of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the word of the Lord s grace replaces the law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The minds of the Jewish people in the synagogues were occupied with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But Paul preached Christ as grace to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They edified the new believers by testifying the word of life and the word of the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word testified in verse 3 implies that the word of grace already existed and that it had already been preached.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the word of grace had been preached, testimony was borne to it.</S>
