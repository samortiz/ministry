   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD FORGIVING MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCORDING TO HIS ABOUNDING MEASURE,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>NOT ACCORDING TO A SINNER'S NEED</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nevertheless, the slave was willing to ask for the master's leniency.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As soon as he asked, the master was moved with compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was merciful to him and forgave his debts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a master forgives and releases a slave, his intention is not for the slave to earn money to repay him but for him to be free.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What God does in man far exceeds man's requests and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The slave only asked for patience, but the Lord was moved with compassion and forgave him all his debts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord acts according to what He has.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He answers our prayer according to what He has.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The gospel is God granting salvation to man according to His own pleasure; it is God bestowing His abundant mercy and forgiveness upon the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God acts according to His abounding measure, not according to the sinner's need.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The robber on the cross prayed to the Lord, "Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord immediately replied, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" Luke 23:42-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Salvation is God saving men according to His own mind and His own riches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As far as propriety was concerned, the prayer of the robber who was crucified with the Lord was inappropriate, but he received God's grace just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord does not save sinners according to their thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His measure of forgiveness is according to His own riches, not according to man's need.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible shows us a tax collector praying to God in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He beat his breast and said, "God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Luke 18:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The tax collector knew that he was a sinner, and he asked God for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His only plea was for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Mercy, however, is only the starting point of God's work, not its consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord likes to be asked to spend Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The man only asked for God to be propitiated to him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God heard his prayer, but He did not answer him according to his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, He said, "This man went down to his house justified..." v. 14 . In other words, the man went home justified.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God looked at him as if he had not sinned; He considered him righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was far more than what the sinner prayed for.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is another example in the Bible the story of the prodigal son in Luke 15.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the prodigal son was away in a far country, he prepared to go home and say to his father, "I have sinned against heaven and before you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He merely thought of convincing his father to grant him the grace to return home.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He would have been satisfied to be treated as a hired servant.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He dared not hope for his father to spend anything on him again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When he reached home, he only was able to say half of what he had prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His father fell on his neck, kissed him affectionately, and would not allow him to go on with his speech.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He ordered the slaves to bring out the best things for his son vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>20-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We often pray in a poor way, but God's answer is beyond what we ask or think.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The gospel is God working to His own satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whether or not man prays enough, God sheds His rich grace and mercy, not to the sinner's satisfaction, but to His own satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The fourth example is found in Mark 2.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here we are told that four men carried a paralytic to the Lord Jesus, hoping to find healing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Being unable to bring him to the Lord because of the crowd, they removed the roof where the Lord was and lowered the mat on which the paralytic was lying.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord told the man, "Child, your sins are forgiven" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The man was seeking for healing, but the Lord did more than heal him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He forgave his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The paralytic was healed, and the sin which brought about his sickness was forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God grants us much grace according to His own knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The paralytic did not have enough knowledge of grace, but his very thought of securing some gain from God earned him God's favor.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nothing glorifies God more and nothing pleases Him more than giving Him the opportunity to dispense His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Ten thousand talents may be a debt which cannot be repaid in ten generations.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's forgiveness, however, is far greater than this debt.</S>
