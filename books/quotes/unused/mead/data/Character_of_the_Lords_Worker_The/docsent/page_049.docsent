   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once our words go out, they will not stop, and the trouble they create will not stop.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to pray for the Lord to burn our tongues with a burning fire so that they will not utter any idle words or lies and will be unbridled no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should pray that our tongue would become the tongue of the instructed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only when the Lord puts our mouth under strict control and it ceases to say things carelessly can we expect Him to use us as His mouthpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Otherwise, the one spring will never produce two kinds of waters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot serve others with sweet water as well as bitter water.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may say that we are burdened to serve God and to share in His work, but we cannot speak God's word one moment and the devil's word the next.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to serve others, we have to sanctify ourselves in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Speaking is a great temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When three, five, eight, or ten people are talking together, it is a great temptation to join in and be part of them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to learn to sanctify ourselves, to set ourselves apart from others, and to not mix with them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not speak lightly.</S>
