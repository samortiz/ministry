The elders must be interested in people and have much concern for them. In this chapter we shall fellowship concerning the purpose of the elders' contact with people. The purpose of the elders' contact with people is related to the God-ordained way to meet and to serve. The God-ordained way is firstly to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, that is, to bear the burden to spread the gospel to get sinners saved. Then, it is to feed the young ones and to raise them up. We must not only feed the new ones but also raise them as we would raise a family. Lastly, the God-ordained way is to train the new ones to prophesy for the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONTACTING PEOPLE IN ORDER TO GAIN THEM<br>FOR THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</H2><P>The purpose of the elders' contact with people is to gain people for the increase of the kingdom of God. Matthew 28:19 says, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." To disciple the nations is not merely to help sinners to have their sins forgiven and be saved. It is to bring them into the kingdom, making them citizens of the kingdom of God.</P><P>The purpose of the elders' contact with people is also the feeding and the raising up of the new members of the Body of Christ (John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7). After we gain people and disciple them into the kingdom, we have to feed them and raise them up as the new members of the Body of Christ. We have to endeavor to feed the new ones and raise them up, so that they may be the practical members of the Body of Christ.</P><P>The purpose of the elders' contact with people is also the perfecting of the saints (Eph. 4:12). To perfect the saints is to train and equip them. After a young person graduates from high school, he must learn a trade or go to college. To learn a trade or a skill is to be perfected. We all must be impressed that each one among us has a special spiritual "trade." The new ones must be saved, nourished, and raised up. At the same time, they need to be trained to pick up a spiritual trade. We may say that every member of our physical body has a "trade." When a baby is born, he has all his members, but the members do not all function skillfully. They have not learned their trade. While a mother cares for her child, she trains him, and after a number of years, all his members function properly. This is what it means to be perfected and equipped.</P><P>The purpose of the elders' contact with people is also for the building up of the organic Body of Christ through prophesying (1 Cor. 14:3-5, 31). Some among the elders may say that to carry out the above points is too difficult. However, they should not be disappointed. The spiritual, divine life within us has an unlimited capacity. If we will exercise, we will learn our spiritual trade and will have the ability to carry out the eldership. However, without exercise we will not be able to learn. A young lady may not have been taught how to cook or to raise children, but after being married for a while, she can learn to cook and eventually learn how to raise a family. She picks up these skills by practicing. In the same way, learning to be a proper elder is a matter of exercise and practice.</P><P>The elders in a local church may feel that they are not adequate to be proper elders. However, if they are faithful for a period of time, they will learn much. When we exercise, our capacity is manifested and developed. Then we will know how to be elders. Developing our capacity may be illustrated by the acquiring of an education in school. In society a young person needs eighteen or more years of education. After graduation from high school, a person may study for four more years in college and then several more years for an advanced degree. To be educated in this way is to be developed. We have the capacity to do many things. However, we need education and practice to develop our capacity. Even making mistakes is an education for the elders. The more mistakes the elders make, the more they will learn.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
