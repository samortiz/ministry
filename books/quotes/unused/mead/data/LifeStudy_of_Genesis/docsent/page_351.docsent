   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>c For a Burnt Offering for God's Satisfaction</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The picture in Genesis 22 is very vivid.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In his hand Abraham held the fire and the knife.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Isaac, who was carrying the wood for the burnt offering, said, "Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He did not know that he himself was to be the offering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do you know that your destiny is to be a burnt offering?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be a burnt offering is to be killed and burned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The growing, living, and calling on the name of El Olam at Beer-sheba are all for the building up of a burnt offering that we might be burned on the altar on Mount Moriah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The water at Beer-sheba is for the fire on Mount Moriah.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more we drink the water from the well of Beer-sheba, the more we shall grow, and the more we grow, the more we shall be prepared for the fire on Mount Moriah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because of this, the Lord's recovery will never be a mass movement; it is a narrow way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the time of Genesis 22, Isaac was the only person living and walking in this narrow way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not expect that many will take the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many are happy to be a bowman, for that is a sport.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But living at Beer-sheba and calling on the name of the Lord may seem, in a sense, to be boring.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, after we enjoy a good time with the Lord, He will ask us to offer our Isaac to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He will not allow us to offer Isaac at Beer-sheba.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We shall have to travel a long distance and climb Mount Moriah.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The proper church life does not produce bowmen; it produces burnt offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all must become a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although this is a narrow way, it is prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although it is a long journey from Beer-sheba to Mount Moriah and it is a journey which causes some suffering, it results in blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the following message we shall see the blessing which comes from the life that grows up by the well of Beer-sheba and is offered to God on Mount Moriah.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I know of a good number of very brilliant young brothers who came into the church life with an honest heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although their heart was honest, they expected that one day, after having all the necessary experiences and receiving all the visions, they would become something in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In other words, they expected to be spiritual giants.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Gradually, as the years went by, I learned what was on their heart, for they came to me and told me their story.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One brother said, "When I came into the church life, I came in honestly, but I expected that one day, after I had been perfected, equipped, qualified, experienced, and had seen all the visions, I would be so useful in the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But now the Lord has told me that He intends to burn me up."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you expect that someday you will become a strong bowman?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you do, one day the Lord will say to you, "I don't want an Ishmael, a bowman.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I want an Isaac, a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Don't try to do anything for Me. I can do anything I want.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I just want you to be a burnt offering."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The life at Beer-sheba only produces a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we stay in the church life, the more it will bring us from Beer-sheba to Moriah, from the growing water to the burning fire.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Are you growing?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thank God for this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But your growth is a preparation for your being burned.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day we all must pass through the process of being burned as a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Hebrew the burnt offering means the ascending offering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the burnt offering has been burned, its sweet odor ascends to God for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is ascending and not spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a burnt offering, we must not be spreading but ascending to God by being burned.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The experience of Genesis 22 cannot come immediately after that of Genesis 12.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There must be a long journey from Genesis 12 through Genesis 21.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When many of us came into the church life, that was our chapter twelve, not our chapter twenty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Abraham had to pass through the separation of Lot, the rejection of Eliezer, the casting out of Ishmael, and the birth of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although God had promised Abraham a seed, He did not give it to him until Abraham had made a thorough clearance of Lot, Eliezer, and Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only then was Isaac born.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But not even Isaac's birth was the end. Isaac needed to grow and be offered.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As we have seen, Isaac did not grow up in the wilderness but in Beer-sheba, properly growing by the life of calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At a certain point, God came in and asked Abraham to offer Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It seemed that God was being somewhat troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, God would never have troubled Abraham in that way if Abraham had not been qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When God comes to trouble you like this, it is an honor, because it testifies that you are qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God did not ask Abraham to offer Lot as a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Neither did He request that Abraham offer Eliezer or Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, God told Abraham to cast Ishmael out.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only the seed who was promised, confirmed, and brought into being by God was the right person.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He was the one who grew up by the well of Beer-sheba and who called on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God seemed to say to Abraham, "You love Isaac, and I love him too.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now you must give him to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Eventually, Isaac became the forefather of the entire chosen race.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He also became a forefather of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God's eternal purpose can never be fulfilled by anyone other than Isaac, the one who was brought up under the care of Abraham and offered to God.</S>
