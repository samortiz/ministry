<P>As we mentioned in the last chapter, Revelation covers the particular enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life, as the hidden manna, and as the feast. These are the fulfillment of the tree of life in Genesis 2, the manna in Exodus 16, and the feast of the riches of the good land in Deuteronomy 12. Even the sequence is right. First comes the tree of life, then the manna, and then the feast. This indicates that the Son of Man who is in the midst of the lampstands not only purifies the churches, but also feeds the churches with particular enjoyment of Himself as the divine nourishment. By this kind of nourishment we grow and are transformed into a white stone for the building of God's temple to be His expression (2:17). Some may even be built into pillars in the temple of God (3:12).</P><P>We also saw that in the consummation of God's expression there will still be the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life and the water of life. In Revelation 22 there is God and the Lamb with a river of water of life. These signify the Triune God. There is God the Father, there is the Lamb, the Son, and there is the flowing river, the Spirit. This is not merely my interpretation, because the Lord Jesus in John 7 told us clearly that the flowing river is the Spirit (vv. 38-39). So even in eternity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;the Triune God&#151;will be dispensed into His redeemed people continuously. This is the divine reality. We need to pray-read all these verses concerning these revelations and to seek after them and experience them and even learn how to present them to others. Let us all be rescued from paying attention to doctrines and to practices. We should learn how to understand God's economy according to His divine revelation and His Holy Word.</P><P>When people ask us about the local churches, it is so easy just to talk about the ground and the one city and the one church. But you have to realize that this may be just an outward show. People need the inward divine reality. The inward divine reality is the most convincing and satisfying and subduing element.</P>
