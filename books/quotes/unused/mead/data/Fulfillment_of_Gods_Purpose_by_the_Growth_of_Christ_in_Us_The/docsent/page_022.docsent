   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RENEWED BY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The divine life, the highest life, the eternal life, the everlasting life, never gets old.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If anything can become old, that is not the real life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our human life is becoming old, so this is not a real life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The real life is always new; it is everlastingly new, ever fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 5:10 says we will be saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then Romans 6:4 says that we should walk in newness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Life renews.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should tell the Lord, "O Lord, every day You are new."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are faithful to the Lord and honest in saying this, we will never be the same as we were yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every day we will be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We will have the new experience of Christ every day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I would say a word to the elderly brothers and sisters among us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No doubt, physically speaking we are old; we may be at least one generation older than the younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But Psalm 103:5 says that God can satisfy us so that we may have our youth renewed like the eagle's. Our youth can come back by taking Christ as life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to drop our oldness and say, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have Christ within, so our youth has to come back."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is possible for us to have our youth renewed like the eagle's by taking in Christ all day as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord may tell the elderly saints to be more excited and the younger saints among us to be less excited.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all need to be renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yesterday's manna should not be today's food.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every day we have the new manna Exo 16:14-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By this renewing we will be delivered from our old manner of life, and we will be renewed into the new manner of life Eph 4:22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To put on the new man includes the putting on of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to be renewed again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some of the brothers, according to their nature by birth, like to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They like to stay home in their own room.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This kind of disposition is not good for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all need to be renewed day by day from the old manner of life into a new manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This new manner of life is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some are not used to talking to others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But in the church life you need to talk with others and be mingled with others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Otherwise, how can we be one Body?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the other hand, there are some who are so open according to their natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These brothers are used to being one with others, not in the spirit, but in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One young brother may even be so open that he would exchange his shoes with another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some would say that these two brothers love one another, but eventually these brothers will fight one another.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Their relationship is not spiritual for the church life, but something in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to be renewed in every aspect of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you are closed, the Lord will say, "Be open."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you are so open, the Lord will say, "Be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Don't be so open."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you like to contact people by your nature, the Lord will say, "Restrain yourself a little bit."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you don't like to contact people by your nature, the Lord will say, "Go out."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind Eph 4:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we call on the Lord day by day, we will be renewed little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually, we will have the Body life, the church life, absolutely not in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will have a lot of contact, fellowship, and mingling in a very spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Natural relationships do not last.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Enemies are made between people who were once friends.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you are fellowshipping with the brothers and sisters in a natural way, be prepared for discord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today you may love a certain person, but later you may dislike him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We all need to be renewed by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By continually calling, "O Lord Jesus," we will be renewed in the spirit of our mind.</S>
