   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Some Sins That Are Trespasses against Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Leviticus 6:2-7: "When a person sins and acts unfaithfully against Jehovah," All sins are ultimately trespasses against Jehovah "and lies to his fellowman in regard to a deposit or a security, or through robbery, or if he has extorted from his fellowman, or has found what was lost and lied about it, and has sworn falsely concerning any of the things a man may do to sin thereby then it shall be, when he sins and is guilty, that he shall return what he took by robbery, or what he got by extortion, or the deposit which was deposited with him, or the lost thing which he found, or anything about which he swore falsely; he shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more; he shall give it to whom it belongs on the day he is found guilty.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then he shall bring to the priest his trespass offering to Jehovah, a ram without blemish from the flock, according to the valuation, for a trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And the priest shall make propitiation for him before Jehovah, and he shall be forgiven for whatever he may have done by which he has become guilty."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A person who has offended anyone or transgressed against anyone in material things has to settle it with men before he can be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he does not settle it with men, he will not be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are six kinds of transgressions against man in these verses:</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 Lying to one's fellowman in regard to a deposit: This means to be entrusted with something and then to purposely withhold the good and costly portions while surrendering the inferior portions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is lying, and it is a sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not lie to others in regard to their deposit but rather guard it faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's children should always guard faithfully the things that others have entrusted to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we cannot guard it, we should not accept such a deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once we accept it, we should do our best to guard it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If anything happens to it through our unfaithfulness, we have trespassed against man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2 Lying to one's fellowman in regard to a security: This means to deal falsely or to lie in business transactions or to profit through improper means or to usurp something that is not yours in trade.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is to sin before the Lord, and it should be dealt with in a strict way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3 Robbing a fellowman: Although this may not happen among the saints, we still have to say something about it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No one may acquire anything by way of robbery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Anyone who tries to usurp the possessions of others by means of his status or power has committed a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>4 Extorting from one's fellowman: It is a sin to take advantage of anyone through the influence of one's own position and power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In God's eyes His children should never do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This kind of conduct must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>5 Finding what is lost and lying about it: New believers must pay special attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many people have lied about the things which others have lost.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To turn something into nothing, to reduce much to little, or to exchange what is bad for what is good is the same as lying.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Something is there, yet you say that nothing is there.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There may be much, but you say that there is little.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Something may be good, but you say that it is bad all this is lying.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Others have lost something, and you take advantage of them, extorting some gain and benefit out of them; this is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A Christian must not take possession of others' belongings and make them his own.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you have picked up something by accident, you have to guard it well and return it to the owner.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Never claim lost items as your own.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is wrong to keep lost articles; it is more wrong to usurp the possessions of others by illegal means.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To turn other's possessions into one's own by any unrighteous means is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A believer should not do anything that profits himself at the expense of others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>6 Swearing falsely: It is a sin to swear falsely concerning any material thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You know something, yet you say that you do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You have seen something, yet you say that you have not seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Something is there, yet you say that nothing is there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Anyone who swears falsely has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"Concerning any of the things a man may do to sin thereby" this refers to transgressions against men in terms of material things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's children should learn and always remember this lesson they should not make the possessions of others their own.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The possessions of others belong to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not make their possessions yours.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whoever swears falsely in any of the things mentioned above and transgresses against others has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brothers and sisters, if there is any dishonesty in anything you do, if you have acquired anything at the expense of others, or if you have acquired anything by means of these six ways, you have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You have to deal with these sins thoroughly.</S>
