Putting it another way, they want Christ but they do not want the church. It is fine to have individual prayers and Bible studies, but it is too troublesome for them to be related to other people. For this reason many Christians refuse to join any church. This is an unhealthy as well as erroneous concept among Christians. When a person has believed in Christ, not only does he have to negatively reject the world, but he has to positively be part of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PART OF A WHOLE</H2><P>According to the Word of God, there is a corporate aspect to the Christian life. First, we are born into the family of God. We are children in this family. God's family is a big one, and we have to be children with many others. Second, all the redeemed ones are corporately a house for God's dwelling. God makes His abode here. Third, together we constitute the Body of Christ. Individually we are members of this one Body and are related to one another.</P><P>Hence, no matter from what angle you look, individual Christians are only parts of a whole. It is improper for us to be Christians individually without relating to others. Such an attitude cannot last for long and is damaging to growth. A Christian who takes such a stand will never be able to touch the riches of God or manifest the glory of the light of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BORN INTO THE BIGGEST FAMILY</H2><P>With this view in mind, we have to realize that we are not the only begotten son in this family. If my father has only begotten me, then I do not have to care about anyone else, because I have no brother. But if I have five other brothers and sisters in my family, then I cannot say, "I just want to be my father's son. I want nothing to do with the other five brothers and sisters. They are not my concern." I cannot do this.</P><P>Now that we are regenerated and have become Christians, we have to realize that we are born into the biggest family of the world. In this big family we have hundreds and thousands of brothers and sisters. The life we possess demands that we have fellowship with them. If there is no desire within you to visit other brothers and sisters or to shake their hands, I doubt that your regeneration is a genuine one.</P><P>The desire to regard the children of God as one's own brothers and sisters is something that comes from the life of God. It is something sweet and full of love. The nature of the life of God forbids us to be individual Christians. We cannot merely seek our own gain. We have to fellowship with all the children of God and live in this family of love, which is the church of God.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_109.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_111.html">Next</a> </body></html>
