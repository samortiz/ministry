   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S SOVEREIGN ARRANGEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF OUR CIRCUMSTANCES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My reason for dwelling on this matter is to point out that our circumstances are always sovereignly arranged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sometimes His sovereign arrangement puts us in a low situation, and at other times in circumstances that are quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul realized that even though the supply had come from the church at Philippi, his circumstances were still in the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In God s sovereign arrangement, the Philippian church did not send the supply until now.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps they had the heart to send him a gift, but not the opportunity until Epaphroditus could come.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the opportunity was available, the Philippian believers sent a gift to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This supply brought him out of the condition of humiliation, want, and abasement and set him on a peak.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But he did not know how long that would last.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, he had the assurance that he knew both how to be abased and how to abound, both how to abound and how to be in want.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He had learned the secret; he had been initiated into the basic principles of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 13 we find a basic principle related to the apostle s secret of sufficiency in Christ: I can do all things in Him who empowers me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul was a person in Christ 2 Cor 12:2 , and he desired to be found in Christ by others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now he declared that he could do all things in Him, in the very Christ who empowered him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is an all-inclusive and concluding word concerning his experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the converse of the Lord s word concerning our organic relationship with Him in John 15:5: Apart from Me you can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>DOING ALL THINGS IN HIM WHO EMPOWERS US</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 4:13 Paul refers to Christ as the One who empowers me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To be so empowered is to be made dynamic inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ dwells in us Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He empowers us, makes us dynamic, from within, not from without.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By such inward empowering Paul could do all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 4:13 we find the secret to which Paul refers in verse 12.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here Paul says that he is in Christ, in the One who empowers him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In chapter three Paul testified that he pursued Christ in order to gain Him and be found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now in 4:13 Paul says that he is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Christ as the One who empowers him Paul could do all things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He could say, Christ is my secret of sufficiency.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As long as I have Him and as long as I am in Him, I can do all things in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To appreciate Paul s word we need to join the phrase in Him in 4:13 to the same phrase in 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 3:9 Paul aspired to be found in Him; in 4:13 Paul declared that being in Him he could do all things in the One who empowered him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Have you seen the secret?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you have this secret?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our circumstances may change.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In certain circumstances we may abound, and in others we may be abased.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But whether we abound or are abased, the enjoyment of the Lord is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It may even have been the case that Paul enjoyed Christ more when he was abased than when he was abounding.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps he enjoyed more of Christ when he was poor than when he was rich.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This, however, is my understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perhaps Paul would say, No, I enjoy Christ equally when I am abased and when I am abounding.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It makes no difference to me whether I am rich or poor, high or low.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The enjoyment of Christ is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even though the enjoyment might be the same, the taste might still be different.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whether or not there was any difference in enjoyment or in taste, it is certain that Paul had learned the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>COUNTERACTING ANXIETY</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have learned the secret, we shall know how to counteract anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you are in poverty, there is no need for you to be anxious or to worry.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord is still at hand, and He will take care of you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By nature, we are given to worry, to anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is true as much of the rich as it is of the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who are poor have their particular worries, and those who are rich have theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only those who are truly in Christ in their experience and who are inwardly empowered by Him have no need to worry or to be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have pointed out that when the church at Philippi did not have the opportunity to supply Paul, he was in want.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was humiliated and abased.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do you think that during that time of abasement Paul was worrying?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may have the ground to answer this question with both a yes and a no. On the one hand, we can say that Paul was not worried, for he tells us that he had learned the secret both to be abased and to abound.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the other hand, there is an implication that, in referring to his situation, he must have had some human feeling of worry or anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If Paul did not have any worry, why then did he refer to his situation?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When he was in want, he must have had some feeling about it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Otherwise, he would not have told the Philippians that he rejoiced in the Lord greatly that at length they had caused their thinking for him to blossom anew.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This positive word implies that, prior to receiving the supply through Epaphroditus, Paul was concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It seems as if Paul was saying, Your thinking for me has blossomed anew.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For a period of time, you may have forgotten me and did not care for me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Your thinking concerning me passed through a time of winter.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But now I rejoice that your thinking for me has blossomed anew.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If Paul did not have any feelings of worry or anxiety, why would he find it necessary to write such things in his Epistle to the Philippians?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As a human being, Paul did undergo suffering with respect to material needs.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Paul was not an angel, and he was not like a lifeless statue without feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>No doubt, he had learned the secret of sufficiency in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When he was in want and was tempted to worry about his situation, he applied this secret.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then, in his experience, this secret eliminated his worry.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, he could have the boldness to testify that he knew both how to be abased and how to abound.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The very fact that Paul knew how to be abased indicates that he experienced feelings of abasement.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He knew what it was to have worry and anxiety in times of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But at those times he applied the secret of the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He applied the very Christ in whom he could be found.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This Christ is real, living, near, available, and prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This was the Christ who was Paul s secret.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Using a Stoic term, Paul could say that he had learned, in whatever circumstances he was, to be content.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Although Paul used a Stoic word, he was by no means a Stoic.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>On the contrary, he was a person in Christ, and he experienced Christ and applied Him in all circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Paul could be content not because he had been instructed by the Stoics, but because he applied the very Christ in whom he lived and in whom he remained.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Again I say, this Christ became Paul s secret.</S>
