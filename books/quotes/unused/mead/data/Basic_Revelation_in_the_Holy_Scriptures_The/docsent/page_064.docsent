   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A REVIEW OF THE SIGNS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All these signs are the main scenes on this divine television screen of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The telecast begins with seven lampstands, signifying the churches; then follow seven shining stars, signifying the messengers of all the churches; then there is a jasper stone, signifying God's appearance; then a lion and a lamb, both signifying Christ; then a universal woman with twelve stars on her head, the sun clothing her, and the moon under her feet; then a red dragon ready to swallow her child; then a man-child brought forth by her and raptured to the throne of God; then a beast coming up from the Mediterranean Sea; then a harvest on this earth, and out of the harvest a firstfruit; then a great prostitute, the great Babylon, terrible, ugly, abhorred; but then, hallelujah, a beautiful wife. the bride; then finally, something brighter, something greater, the New Jerusalem, which is God's tabernacle just as Jesus was God's tabernacle when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This New Jerusalem is not only a tabernacle to God but also a wife to God's Son, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God will have a tabernacle and Christ will have a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both the tabernacle and the wife are the same: the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>UNDERSTANDING REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the book of Revelation, containing all these crucial signs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you understand them, you understand the entire book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With such a clear and accurate view, do you believe that the New Jerusalem will be a physical city built by God throughout all the centuries?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Revelation is a book of signs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every main item is a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Signs should not be interpreted literally.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you think the church is an actual stand with seven lamps shining?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a wrong understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you believe that Jesus Christ is a real lamb?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is ridiculous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do you believe that the coming Caesar of the Roman Empire will be a real beast that comes out of the Mediterranean Sea and jumps onto the shore?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you believe that the wife of the Lamb in Revelation 19 will be a woman adorned with a long wedding gown?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Again, it makes no sense to understand it this way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>INTERPRETING THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then how about the New Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the same principle, it does not make sense to think of the coming New Jerusalem as a physical city.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just because this book uses the lion as a sign of Christ as the triumphant king, we should not think that Christ is like a lion in the zoo.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The lion is not a real lion it is a sign of Christ as the triumphant king.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The lamb is not a real lamb it is a sign of Christ as the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the same way, the New Jerusalem is a sign; it signifies something spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A principle in interpreting the Bible is to be consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since we do not take the other signs literally, we may be sure the New Jerusalem is not a physical city for us to live in. Such an interpretation is altogether natural.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you do not interpret Christ as a lion with four legs and a tail, why would you think the New Jerusalem is an actual city?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The lion is a sign, and the city is also a sign.</S>
