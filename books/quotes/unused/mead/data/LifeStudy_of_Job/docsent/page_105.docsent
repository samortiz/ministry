   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD REDUCING JOB TO NOTHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND MAINTAINING HIS EXISTENCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THAT GOD MIGHT IMPART HIMSELF INTO HIM</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead of speaking to Job regarding these things that were on His heart, God asked him about other things, including himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For instance, in 40:10-14 He said to him, "Deck yourself now with majesty and excellency,/And array yourself with honor and splendor./Pour forth the overflowings of your anger,/And look upon everyone who is proud, and abase him./Look upon everyone who is proud; bring him down;/And tread down the wicked where they stand./Hide them in the dust together;/Bind their faces in the hidden place./Then even I will praise you,/That your own right hand can save you."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here God was asking Job if he had any majesty, excellency, honor, and splendor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's intention was to cause Job to realize that he had nothing and that he was nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Job did not know God's purpose in dealing with him, and God had no way to tell him about this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not knowing about the councils held in the heavens concerning him, Job was enjoying his life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then, suddenly, he lost his possessions and his children.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was the stripping away of Job's possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Following this, there was an attack upon Job's body, and this led, through his daily sufferings, to the gradual consuming of Job himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we read the record in this book, we can see that layer after layer was peeled away from Job This peeling away was the consuming.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Job was consumed to such an extent that he became skin and bone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Job did not know what was going on.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He questioned God, but there was no answer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually God came in to show Himself to Job In His appearing, God seemed to be saying to Job, "Now here I am.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Job, you must realize that I am unlimited, unsearchable, and untraceable.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Look at Me I am the One with majesty, excellency, honor, and splendor.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do you think that your small mind can search Me out or trace Me out?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do you still intend to litigate against Me, to take Me to court?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You do not know what I intend to do with you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You do not know what I will give you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Job, My intention is to reduce you to nothing, yet to maintain your existence so that I may have a time to impart Myself into you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Job, I intend to give You Myself."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the central point of God's appearing to Job, but Job did not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I believe, however, that Job will be with us in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I also believe that when we see him, we and he may rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then he may say, "Brothers, now I am just as clear as you are concerning God's intention.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let us all be at peace and praise the Lord!"</S>
