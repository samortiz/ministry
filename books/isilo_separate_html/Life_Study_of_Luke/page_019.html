The Lord Jesus was circumcised and named on the eighth day.</p><h2 class="head2">Presented and Adored</h2><p>In 2:22-39 we have an account of the Man-Savior being presented and adored. As a Child, on the one hand, He was presented, offered, to God; on the other hand, simultaneously He was adored, praised, and worshipped by man.</p><p>Concerning the presenting of the Man-Savior, 2:22-24 says, &ldquo;And when the days were fulfilled for their purification according to the law of Moses, they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord, even as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord, and to give a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves or two young doves.&rdquo; That the Man-Savior might be a proper Israelite as a proper Man before God and men, whatever was required in the law was fully fulfilled in verses 21 through 24.</p><p>Verse 24 speaks of a pair of turtledoves or two young doves. This kind of sacrifice indicates the poverty of the offerers (Lev. 12:8), which also was a characteristic of the Man-Savior&rsquo;s life.</p><h2 class="head3">Adored by Simeon</h2><p>In 2:25-35 the Child Jesus was adored by Simeon. Verse 25 says, &ldquo;And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him.&rdquo; Simeon was righteous mainly toward men and devout toward God. As such a one, he was looking for the consolation of Israel. The Man-Savior is the consolation of God&rsquo;s chosen people.</p><p>Simeon&rsquo;s adoration of Jesus was in the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit was upon him (v. 25), it had been communicated to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he saw the Lord&rsquo;s Christ (v. 26), and he came into the temple in the Spirit (v. 27).</p><p>When Joseph and Mary &ldquo;brought in the little child Jesus for them to do according to the custom of the law concerning Him&rdquo; (v. 27), Simeon received Him into his arms and blessed God and said, &ldquo;Now You are releasing Your slave, Master, according to Your word, in peace; because my eyes have seen Your salvation, which You have prepared before the face of all the peoples, a light for revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel&rdquo; (vv. 28-32). In verses 30 and 32 Simeon speaks of salvation and light. The Man-Savior is God&rsquo;s salvation to His people and also a light for the Gentiles and the glory of Israel.</p><p>In 2:34 and 35 Simeon says to Mary, &ldquo;Behold, this One is appointed for the falling and rising up of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against (and a sword will even go through your own soul), so that the reasonings of many hearts will be revealed.&rdquo; Here we see that the Man-Savior was appointed by God to be a test to the children of Israel so that many of them would be stumbled by Him and many raised up by Him (Rom. 9:33).</p><p>The Man-Savior is also a sign, a token, spoken against, contradicted or opposed by the people who take sides with His enemy, so that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed.</p><p>In Simeon&rsquo;s word the Man-Savior is revealed as the consolation of Israel, God&rsquo;s salvation, a light for the Gentiles, the glory of Israel, a test to Israel, and a sign opposed.</p><p>In verse 35 Simeon told Mary that a sword would even go through her own soul. This indicates that while the Man-Savior as a sign is spoken against, the suffering also goes through the inner being of the one who brings Him forth. This is the experience of His suffering in experiencing Him.</p><p>In verse 35 Simeon also speaks of the reasonings of many hearts being revealed. What is within man&rsquo;s heart is easily revealed by his attitude toward Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
