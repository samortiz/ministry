   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE TRANSFORMATION FOR THE BUILDING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:10-17; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 12:2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul covers the matters of feeding, drinking, eating, planting, watering, and growing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are all related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 3:9 Paul goes on to refer to the church as God s farm and God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The farm certainly is a matter of life, and the building is the issue of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No material building involves anything of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the spiritual building mentioned in this chapter has much to do with life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul talks about this building not only in 1 Corinthians, but also in Ephesians, Colossians, and Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the basic points regarding the building are covered in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s building is altogether a building in life and of life, for it is the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE FARM AND THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Apparently, there is no connection between the farm and the building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to our natural concept, a farm is a matter of life, but a building is a composition of lifeless materials.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, there does not seem to be a proper continuation between the expressions God s farm and God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, if we realize that the building here is a life building, a building in life, we shall see that there is a direct connection, an excellent continuation, between the farm and the building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever is produced on the farm is not for the farm itself; it is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The produce grown on the farm is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the produce grown on the farm is for the building, it does not go into the building directly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, we may say that it goes to the church restaurant to be eaten, digested, and assimilated by the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through this process, what is grown on the farm is consumed by the saints and eventually even becomes them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The farm produces not only vegetables, the plant life, but also livestock, the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both the plant life and the animal life must be eaten by us in the church restaurant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 3:2 Paul says, I gave you milk to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Milk is a product of both the plant life and the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is produced by cows, which feed on grass.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Milk is a product of the mingling of the animal life with the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This mingling of two lives also produces meat.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without the animal life, we cannot have meat.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Likewise, without the plant life, we also cannot have meat, for cattle are dependent on the grass for their food.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First they eat the vegetable life and then produce milk and meat for us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I mention this because both milk and meat are figures of Christ as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In John 6:48 the Lord Jesus says, I am the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Bread is made primarily of flour, which comes from the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, the Lord goes on to speak of the bread as His flesh: And the bread which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world John 6:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that the composition of this bread is not only of the vegetable life, but also of the animal life; it is flesh-bread.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, it is difficult to say whether Christ as our life supply is of the vegetable life or the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This bread is a product, a mingling, of both lives.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more we eat of Christ as our life supply, the more we shall be transferred into God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First we are the farm to produce something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By eating what is produced on the farm we are brought into the building.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A METABOLIC PROCESS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order for the food we eat to become our constitution, there must be the process of metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Bible this process is called transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Transformation involves a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, transformation is altogether a metabolic process.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First we eat a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After a period of time, the food is digested and assimilated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually, the digested and assimilated food becomes the fibers of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is metabolism, transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order for an infant of seven pounds to grow into a mature man weighing one hundred seventy pounds, there must be a regular eating and a normal process of metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Gradually, the food taken in by an infant will cause him to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eventually, as a result of a metabolic process over a long period of time, he will become a full-grown man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a mature man, he is a product, a composition, of all the food he has eaten, digested, and assimilated.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This illustrates the process of spiritual metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The produce grown on the farm is eaten and digested by us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Eventually, through the process of metabolism, this food supply becomes us and transforms us into material for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The church is a farm to grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every item of the produce grown on the farm is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The farm produce includes many different aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ is the milk, the vegetables, and the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church grows Christ, and all the saints eat Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Eventually, through digestion, assimilation, and metabolism, Christ becomes us, and we become Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then we are the proper materials for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Paul s writing in 1 Corinthians 3 has a direct connection from item to item.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>First he refers to feeding, drinking, and eating.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then he goes on to mention planting and watering, after which he tells us that it is God alone who gives the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Following this, he says in verse 9 that we are the farm and the building.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, there is a direct connection between all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As we have seen, the farm becomes the building.</S>
