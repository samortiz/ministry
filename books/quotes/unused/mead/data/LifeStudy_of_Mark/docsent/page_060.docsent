   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Fornications and Thefts</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After evil reasonings, the Lord lists fornications.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to be impressed with the fact that the Lord did not speak of these things in a careless way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the contrary, knowing man s inward situation, He speaks in a careful way of what proceeds out of man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First come the evil reasonings and then fornications.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that the evil reasonings are related to fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The third item in verse 21 is thefts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some may claim that they have never stolen anything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In fact, everyone has committed theft in one way or other.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, fornication itself is a kind of theft, for it is a matter of obtaining something improperly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To steal is to take something illegally.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In principle, fornication is in this category.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fornication is a matter of following an illegal course, a course not ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Anything that is taken illegally is a matter not only of theft but also in the principle of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although we are saved ones, children of God, our fallen nature, including our old heart, is still with us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In particular, the two evil things fornication and theft are crouching behind us, waiting for an opportunity to ruin us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Throughout the centuries, many Christians, including pastors and ministers, have fallen into the snare of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even many of those who love the Lord Jesus have been caught in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many have disregarded the fact that their heart is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, they failed to keep a proper distance from the opposite sex and fell into fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In a real sense, the church life is a social life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Males and females often have contact with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because of the danger of fornication, we need to keep ourselves at a proper distance from the opposite sex.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I wish to emphasize the fact that even though we have been regenerated, according to the teaching of the New Testament, our old nature remains with us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should never forget this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Until our body has been redeemed, transfigured, our fallen nature will be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No matter how holy you may be, you need to realize that you still have your fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the reason I advise the saints not to be in a room alone with a member of the opposite sex.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I appreciate and respect this country very much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, I am bothered by the fact that males and females are too free in their contact with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many women are not aware of the danger of being defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If they had such a consciousness, they would keep themselves at a proper distance from the opposite sex.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we have indicated, in our preaching of the gospel we need to touch the condition of man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In particular, we need to expose the fact that in principle all fallen people are fornicators and thieves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I was preaching the gospel in China, I often used to say, You ladies and gentlemen appear to be very nice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But suppose I could take an x-ray picture of what you are inside.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If I did this, you would not have the boldness to remain here.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You know that you are evil inside and unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Perhaps even as you are listening to this message, you are reasoning concerning evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You have the appearance of a lady or gentleman, but in your inward condition you are filthy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is a fact that evil reasonings proceed out of man s heart, and these reasonings are related to fornication and theft.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is very significant that in chapter seven of Mark the Slave-Savior in His gospel service touches the inward condition of man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should remember that the Lord s word in 7:21-23 is a word uttered not to the crowd but to His intimate followers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It seems that here the Lord is saying, Peter, John, James you all need to realize that out from your hearts proceed evil reasonings, fornications, and thefts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Murders and Adulteries</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The next item mentioned by the Lord as proceeding out of man s heart is murder.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many murders are committed for the sake of fornication or theft.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Fornication and theft often issue in murder.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Next, the Lord goes on to speak of adulteries.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is a difference between adultery and fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a married person commits sin with another married person, that is adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if an unmarried person commits sin with another unmarried one, that is fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here the Lord speaks concerning both fornication and adultery.</S>
