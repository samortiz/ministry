<b>1</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>We have a most glorious King;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>The heavens, He says, are His throne;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>All worlds are His mighty domain,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>All kingdoms His scepter shall own.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>He dwells with His people below,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>He loves in their trials to share;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>We dwell with the King for His work,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>His burden we willingly bear.</span><br>

<div style='padding-left:1px; padding-top:8px;'>
<b>2</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>I'm dwelling with Jesus my King;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>I've found where He dwells with His own;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>I've opened the door of my heart;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>He's made it His temple and throne.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Like Mary I sit at His feet,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Like John I recline on His breast;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>His presence is fulness of joy,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>His bosom is infinite rest.</span><br>
</div>
<div style='padding-left:1px; padding-top:8px;'>
<b>3</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>I dwell with the King for His work,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>I've part in His glorious plan</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>To bring in His kingdom to earth</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>And tell His salvation to man.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>The world has its work and rewards,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>I count them but folly and loss;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>My business is only His work,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>My message is only His cross.</span><br>

<div style='padding-left:1px; padding-top:8px;'>
<b>4</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>I dwell with the King for His work,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>The work, it is His and not mine;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>He plans and prepares it for me</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>And fills me with power divine.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>So duty is changed to delight,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>And prayer into praise as I sing;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>I dwell with my King for His work</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>And work in the strength of my King.</span><br>
</div>
<div style='padding-left:1px; padding-top:8px;'>
<b>5</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>We'll dwell with the King for His work</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>And work thru each day of the year.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Perhaps ere it passes, the King</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>In glory Himself shall appear.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Oh, then in some closer embrace,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Oh, then in some nobler employ</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>We'll dwell with the King for His work</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>In endless, ineffable joy!</span><br>
