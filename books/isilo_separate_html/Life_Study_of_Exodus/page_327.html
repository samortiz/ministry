THE MEASUREMENTS</h2><p>The length of each board was ten cubits. Ten is composed of two times five. Since five signifies the number of responsibility, ten is two times responsibility. As standing boards in the church, we need to bear a double responsibility. Furthermore, the number two stands not only for doubling, but also for testimony. Our double responsibility is a testimony. If we all bear responsibility in a double way, we shall have a testimony.</p><p>The width of each board, one and a half cubits, is the same as the width of the ark and its height. The length of the ark is two and a half cubits. This means that the dimensions of the ark are all in half units. This is also true of the width of each standing board. One half of three cubits indicates that every believer is a half needing to be matched by another to form three cubits for the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p><p>According to the Old Testament, the numbers three and five are the basic numbers of God&rsquo;s building. With the tabernacle there are many instances of the numbers three and five or of multiples of these numbers. We have seen that five is the number of responsibility and that three is the number of the Triune God in resurrection. Hence, the use of the numbers three and five in God&rsquo;s building indicates that the building requires much responsibility in resurrection by the Triune God.</p><p>As boards, none of us is complete. In the church life, as in married life, we all are halves. We are one and a half cubits, and we need another board to make a complete unit. Throughout the years in the church life I have learned that I cannot be independent, that I cannot be a single board. I need to be coupled; that is, I need another half, another board, to make a complete unit.</p><p>Married life can be illustrated by a three-legged race. In this race each pair of runners has one leg free and the other tied to one of his partner&rsquo;s legs. Running the race successfully depends on each pair working together in good coordination. The two must run as if they were one person. However, in married life it is not easy for a husband and wife to be one. The wife may freely express her opinions, and the husband may be difficult and demanding. Thus, instead of a couple living in true oneness, there is division. The same problem is often found in the church life. What is most damaging to the service of the church is the expression of opinion. Even in the matter of vacuuming the carpets in the meeting hall, saints may have many different opinions. In the church life it is very difficult to be coupled, to be matched, with others. We can be matched with other boards only when we experience the acacia wood overlaid with gold.</p><p>Certain saints are willing to serve in the church, but they want to do things all by themselves. Some may even say, &ldquo;If the brothers want me to do a certain thing, they should let me do it alone. Don&rsquo;t let anyone interfere with what I am doing.&rdquo; Those who serve the church in this way make their area of service their private possession. However, we all must learn to do things in the church in the way of sharing. Nothing should be kept in our hands in a private way. A brother may bear the responsibility for a certain matter faithfully and diligently. Nevertheless, he may be too individualistic and keep the matter of service too private. He may not be willing to allow others to share in this aspect of the church service. At times I have advised the saints not to take care of church matters in their homes, but to do everything in the meeting hall in a public way. To serve the church privately and individualistically is to serve as a single board which is not joined to another. The tabernacle, however, was built of many boards which were connected. We need to realize that we are just one of many boards, that we are only half a unit, and that we need another board to complete us.</p><p>We thank the Lord that during the last ten years the situation and condition among us regarding the standing boards has improved. But we still need more improvement. I hope that everyone who serves in the church will serve in a corporate way, realizing that he is a half unit and needs another to match him.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_326.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_328.html">Next</a> </body></html>
