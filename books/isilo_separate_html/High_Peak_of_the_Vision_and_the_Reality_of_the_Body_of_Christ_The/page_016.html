In this age You have revealed to us Your recovery, and You have also entrusted us with Your recovery, charging us to spread Your recovery throughout the whole world. Lord, because of Your mercy and Your grace, You have truly carried it out to this extent. Lord, we sense, however, that up to this day we are still very short and we are weak in many ways. We have not lived like God-men sufficiently in our life, walk, and work on this earth. O Lord, we pray that You will open our eyes again tonight that within us we may see clearly that the reality of the Body of Christ is the living of God and man together. Oh, we really look to You for Your blessing and for Your speaking a clear word to us. We also pray that You will deliver us from superfluous words and give us the pure words, the purified words. Amen.<p>Concerning the reality of the Body of Christ, I sense that the burden within me is still not discharged. So, tonight we still need to speak about this matter. Afterward, we will speak a word of warning and caution.<h2 class=head1>THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST-THE LIVING TOGETHER OF GOD AND MAN</h2><p>Simply, the reality of the Body of Christ is the living of a God-man life by a group of God-redeemed people together with the God-man Christ. Before the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, in the universe there was God in heaven and man on the earth. But in the universe there was not one human being who was both God and man. Furthermore, this One who was to be God yet man did not become a man in the twinkling of an eye. Rather, according to man&#8217;s natural law, He was conceived in His mother&#8217;s womb for nine months, and then He was born to be a man. He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, beginning as a child. In the past I had a question concerning this matter: Why did the Lord have to live on the earth for such a long time? He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, and it seems that it was in the last three and a half years, when He came out to do the preaching and to lead the disciples, that He was really doing the work of God. Concerning the first thirty years of the Lord&#8217;s life on earth, the Gospels do not say much. However, we can find out that He lived in a poor carpenter&#8217;s home and He was called a carpenter (Matt. 13:55; Mark 6:3). I did not understand, however, what the significance was of the Lord&#8217;s living the life of a carpenter for thirty years on the earth. Now, because of the shining of the light, I have seen that He used those thirty-three and a half years to live out the model of a God-man living.<p>After His death and resurrection He produced many brothers who, with Him as the oldest Brother, become the one great man in the universe. What is this great, universal man? This is a God-man, one who is God yet man and man yet God. First, He lived on the earth to live out a model. How did He as the God-man live? He had the life of man, and He definitely was a man on the earth. He hungered, He thirsted, He slept, and He even wept and shed tears and was tired and weary. Not only was He like a man, but He was a man. However, as a man, He lived not by the human life but by the divine life within Him. He lived, yet He did not live alone. He lived not by His own life but by the divine life. He told us clearly that He spoke and did things not by Himself but by the One who sent Him (John 5:19; 8:28). In John 6:57 He said, &#8220;The living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father.&#8221; But for what purpose did the living Father send Him? In general, Christians would spontaneously reply that the Father sent Him to be our Savior and to accomplish redemption for us. Perhaps they would go on to say that He came to bring God&#8217;s life to us. There is nothing wrong in saying this, but it is altogether a superficial statement. What was the purpose of God in sending the Lord Jesus? God sent Him to be a man and to live a God-man life by the divine life. This kind of living issues in a universal great man that is exactly the same as He is-a man living a God-man life by the divine life.<p>I earnestly hope that you will clearly remember the Lord&#8217;s word in John 6:57. For what purpose did God send the Lord Jesus? If you read the entire Gospel of John, you will know the meaning of this verse. God sent Him to be a man and to live a God-man life by the divine life. He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years and produced a model of such a living. At the end of this life He went to die on the cross, and then He passed through death and resurrection. In His resurrection He brought His human nature into God and was begotten by God as the firstborn Son of God. Not only so, in His resurrection all the God-chosen ones were born together with Him in His birth. Ephesians 2:5-6 tells us that God &#8220;made us alive together with Christ...and raised us up together with Him....&#8221; This making alive and raising up is the begetting. How do we know? Because in Acts 13:33 we are told that when God raised Jesus from the dead, He said to Him, &#8220;You are My Son; today I have begotten You.&#8221; On what day did the begetting take place? It took place on the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. Hence, when the resurrection was accomplished, the firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God all were begotten. As such a One He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) and brought forth Himself and the many sons of God in resurrection.<p>The Lord Jesus resurrected and ascended to the heavens, and He is now in heaven as the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is the One who is God yet man, who was incarnated, passed through human living, died, and was resurrected. After regenerating us, the life-giving Spirit dwells in us and is mingled with our spirit to live a God-man life with us. He is the very One who is God yet man and who died and was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ. In His ascension He is the Mediator of the new covenant (Heb. 8:6), the surety of the new covenant (7:22), the High Priest (8:1), and the heavenly Minister (v. 2). Now in the heavens He is doing one thing, that is, to work on all His redeemed and regenerated people to make them God. How does He do it? He does it by being in them to continuously sanctify them, renew them, and transform them. This transformation is to deify them.<p>The purpose of transformation is to make man God until man is conformed to the image of God and is exactly like God (2 Cor. 3:18). The image of God is the One who is God yet man. It is true that He lived on earth as a man, but He did not live by His human life; rather, He lived by God as His life. Therefore, He rejected and denied Himself. During His thirty-three and a half years on earth, every day He lived a life by God, a life in which He rejected and denied Himself. This kind of life is a life lived under the cross by the resurrection life. Therefore, as far as Christ is concerned, before He went to the cross to die and be resurrected, every day He lived a life of death and resurrection. To die is to reject ourselves and put ourselves to death; to be resurrected is to live out God as our life. Although what is lived out is a human life, the virtues that are manifested are something transformed from the divine attributes.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
