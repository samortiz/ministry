   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. A Definite Process</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some find fault with the word "processed" and argue that it is impossible for God to be processed because He is eternal and unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although God is eternal and unchanging, He has nevertheless passed through a process.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Was not incarnation a process?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From eternity past until the incarnation of Christ, God did not have a body of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when He was born in a manger, He was the mighty God incarnated as a baby.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Isaiah 9:6, the child born to us is called the mighty God....this child, God incarnate, lived in a carpenter's home for years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Imagine that the Creator of the universe lived in the home of a carpenter in Nazareth!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Was that not a process?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, were not the crucifixion and resurrection a process?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God certainly was processed through Christ's incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our God today is not a "raw" God, but a processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today He is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>CHRIST AND THE SPIRIT BEING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second Corinthians 3:17 tells us that now the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The last Adam in 1 Corinthians 15:45b and the Lord in 2 Corinthians 3:17 both refer to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates clearly that today Christ and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The One who was crucified on the cross was Christ, but the One who entered into the believers was the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In crucifixion for the believers' redemption He was Christ, but in the indwelling to be the believers' life He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who is the all-inclusive and ultimate blessing of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because many are not clear concerning this, they talk about a so-called second blessing, or about receiving the Spirit apart from regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When some Christians learn that another has believed in Christ, they proceed to ask him if he has received the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, to be a genuine Christian is to believe in Christ and to receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be a real Christian is to believe in Christ, and to believe in Christ is to receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nevertheless, those who regard Christ as separate and distinct from the Spirit may consider that it is possible to believe in Christ without receiving the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a serious misunderstanding!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CHRIST AS THE INDWELLING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Redeemer, it was the life-giving Spirit who came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many believers do not realize that they received the Lord Jesus not only as the Redeemer and the Savior, but also as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we knew that we were sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we prayed, repented, confessed, and received Him as our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, we were not told that He would come into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At least I was not told this when I believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, I later found out that after believing in Him, there was something inside me that made me happy and joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes I even felt like leaping.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Have you not had this experience?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the experience of Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although we received Him as our Redeemer, He came into us not only as our Redeemer, but also as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today He is in us mainly as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you ask believers where their Redeemer, the Lord Jesus, is, many lift up their eyes, point to heaven, and say, "He is in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rarely do you find a Christian who, when asked where the Lord Jesus is, will say with rejoicing, "Christ is in me!"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you ask me where my Jesus is, I will say, "Jesus my Redeemer is, on the one hand, in the heavens as my Lord and, on the other hand, in me as the life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this reason sometimes I am rejoicing, bubbling, and even beside myself with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rejoice, Jesus Christ is the life-giving Spirit within us!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before coming into the churches, you probably never heard that the Redeemer became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But there is a verse in the Bible telling us that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It seems that those in Christianity do not have the second part of 1 Corinthians 15:45.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After completing the work of redemption, Christ became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
