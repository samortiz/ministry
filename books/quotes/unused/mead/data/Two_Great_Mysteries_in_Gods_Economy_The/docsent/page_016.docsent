   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT TO TEACH DIFFERENTLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We also have the word economy in 1 Timothy 1:4.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There it says that some kinds of teachings stir up questions rather than God's economy, which is an economy to dispense God into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Apostle Paul warned us in these two books that among so-called Christians there are many other teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He even charged Timothy, his young co-worker, to take care that some not teach differently.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To teach differently does not mean to teach a wrong doctrine, or to teach heresies, but just to teach things different from what we have been taught concerning the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we read 1 Timothy, we can see clearly that these things include the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some taught the law, and some taught the genealogy which is the history of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The law of Moses is in the Bible as well as the history.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both are in the holy oracle and are not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The law of Moses is built upon three columns, three pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One is circumcision, the second is the Sabbath, and the third is the levitical diet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a young male of the race of Israel you must be circumcised on the eighth day and this is once for your whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then, after this, every seventh day you must keep one day as the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not only so, every day you have to keep the holy diet three times.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These are all in the Old Testament, but in the New Testament these three pillars have all been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, the Lord Jesus removed the pillar of the Sabbath Matt 12:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second, Paul was so bold to remove the pillar of circumcision Gal 5:6; 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Finally, the pillar of the holy diet was removed in Acts 10.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All these things are in the Bible, but they are not the kernel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The kernel of the Bible is this: the mystery of the universe is God, the mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This God is triune, dispensing Himself into our being that we may become members of the Body of Christ, which is the church; and we are tripartite, having a human spirit as a receiver to receive the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Day after day and morning and evening, we can drink of Him for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul charged Timothy to take care of some and tell them that they should not teach differently, but speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The same thing is Christ and the church, the mysteries of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can find different teachings other than God's economy in the Bible, even in 1 and 2 Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many other doctrines such as the seventy weeks with the seven last years in Daniel can raise question after question.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we will argue and be snared.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the very reason many Christians are divided.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is the Lord's recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord's recovery is to bring us back to the beginning, to a beginning without any questions, and to a beginning without any division.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the very beginning all the apostles spoke the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peter, John, and Paul all spoke the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be recovered back to the beginning to speak the same thing which is Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We care for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We care for our daily and hourly drinking of the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We care for a living testimony to our in-laws, our cousins, our neighbors, our classmates, our schoolmates, and our colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We care for the complete gospel of God to be preached to the sinners, for the proper church life, and for taking Christ as our life and person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We care for these kinds of things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do not care for the ten horns in Revelation or the ten toes in Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These are in the Bible, but we do not care for them because they are not the kernel of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We only care for Christ and the church as the mysteries of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the first chapter of this book, Paul urged Timothy to charge some not to teach differently 1 Tim 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He said that some have missed the goal, misaimed 1 Tim 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is the goal?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The goal is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may say that the goal is Christ, the goal is the church, and the goal is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is altogether the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are in the central lane, driving the car toward the goal, but there are many distractions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some have missed the goal, thinking that they are teachers who can teach people this doctrine and that doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul charges us not to care for these kinds of doctrines but always to be preserved in the central lane.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The central lane is the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The central lane is Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The central lane is that the Triune God today is altogether the compound Spirit, that we have a regenerated spirit mingled with the divine Spirit, and that we can enjoy Him in our spirit as our everything to have a practical, present church life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only such a clear vision can preserve us all the time in the central lane.</S>
