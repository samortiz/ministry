[4]  In 1 Corinthians 12:12-14 we see two main things: the Spirit and the Body.
[5]  . We, as the many members, have all been baptized in one Spirit into one Body, and now we are all drinking of this one Spirit.
[6]  Let us consider a number of verses in the book of Acts pertaining to the Spirit.
[7]  By these examples we can see that in the book of Acts there is nothing of a movement.
[8]  There is just the living move of the living Person of Jesus, and this living Person is the Holy Spirit.
[9]  When Barnabas and Paul were confronting a sorcerer, a false prophet, we are told that Paul was filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak to him Acts 13:9-10 .
[10]  Barnabas and Paul did not hold a conference in which Barnabas said, "Paul, you have studied at the feet of Gamaliel, and you are more learned than I. Now that we are on our mission, let us make the decision that from now on you will be the speaker and I will be the helper." Instead of the record of such a discussion, we are simply told that in a certain situation Paul was spontaneously filled with the Spirit and took the lead to speak.
[11]  Although the Lord has burdened us to go to the campuses, we should not turn this into a movement.
[12]  Any decisions that you make by yourself for others are an insult to the Spirit.
[13]  If you have done this, you must repent and, if necessary, ask the others to forgive you because you gave them instructions about what they should do.
[14]  The tragic history of Christianity must not be repeated among us.
[15]  We must not insult the Lord and offend Him by not caring for His leading.
[16]  Suppose the leading ones, after much prayer, are truly burdened about a certain matter.
[17]  What they should do then is through fellowship pass on their burden to the saints and ask the saints to pray.
[18]  In the Body the young ones, the middle-aged ones, and the elderly ones are all one.
[19]  Yes, the young people need to go to the campuses for the Lord's purpose.
[20]  But this must not be a movement, and it must not in any way cause division among us.
[21]  In this message we shall consider a number of crucial verses pertaining to the Spirit and to our experience of the Spirit.
[22]  In John chapter four the Samaritan woman brought up the matter of the worship of God, saying, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship" v. 20 . In His reply to her, the Lord Jesus said, "God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality" v. 24 . If you are religious, in your worship of God you will bow down and say, "O God." But according to John 4:24, we must worship God in spirit and in reality.
[23]  You need to drink of Me. The more you drink of Me, the more you worship Me." Have you ever realized that the true worship of God is the drinking of God? The more you drink of God, the more you worship Him.
[24]  First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit" Gk.
[25]  . Because we all have been baptized into one Body, we all have been made, or positioned, to drink of one Spirit.
[26]  Not many Christians fully realize that we have been positioned to drink of the Spirit.
[27]  Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all" Gk.
[28]  Verse 6 of 2 Corinthians 3 says, "The letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life," and verse 17 says, "Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
[29]  If we put these verses together, we see that the Lord is the Spirit who gives life.
[30]  Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is no bondage, no deadness, no entanglement of letters and regulations.
[31]  According to the New Testament, the word of God, which is God's breath, has various functions.
[32]  John 7:39 says, "But this He said concerning the Spirit, Whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified."
[33]  At the time the Lord Jesus was speaking these words, "the Spirit was not yet"; this means that the Spirit was not there yet because Jesus was not yet glorified.
[34]  I simply could not understand how the Spirit could not have been there when Jesus was speaking.
[35]  At the time of John chapter seven the Spirit of God was there, possessing merely divinity, but the all-inclusive Spirit, including all the other items, was not there yet.
[36]  The Spirit of God was there from the very beginning Gen 1:1-2 , but the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , was not yet at the time the Lord spoke the word recorded in John 7, because He was not yet glorified.
[37]  After His resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ, who was breathed into the disciples by Christ in the evening of the day He was resurrected John 20:22 .
[38]  In this compound ointment we have the Triune God signified by the numbers one and three and humanity signified by the number four.
[39]  But after the Lord's resurrection, this Spirit of God has been compounded with humanity, with the death of Christ, with the resurrection of Christ, with the effectiveness of Christ's death, and with the effectiveness of His resurrection.
[40]  Day by day we must put on the life-giving Spirit as a repellent to Satan.
[41]  When you call on the name of the Lord Jesus, you not only drink of Him; you also put on the life-giving Spirit as a repellent.
[42]  If the first thing in the morning you do not put on this repellent, the snake will attack you, and you may lose your temper during the day.
[43]  This is neither the Spirit only with humanity nor the Spirit only with resurrection, for in the Spirit of Jesus Christ we have both humanity and resurrection.
[44]  Whenever I speak about the compound Spirit, I sense that I am short of utterance.
[45]  I simply do not have the language adequate to express fully what I have seen regarding this matter.
[46]  In this all-inclusive Spirit we enjoy God, the uplifted humanity of Jesus, the sweetness of the death of Christ, the effectiveness of the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the power of the resurrection of Christ.
[47]  Hallelujah, today we do not have a Spirit simply composed of divinity alone, but the all-inclusive Spirit compounded with divinity, the humanity of Jesus, the death of Christ, and His resurrection.
[48]  By our experience we can testify that God, the humanity of Jesus, the effective death of Christ, and the powerful resurrection of Christ are all in the all-inclusive Spirit.
[49]  The main point we must see in this message is that the very Spirit of God is no longer just the Spirit of God, but the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[50]  John 20:22 says, "He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit."
[51]  This is the Spirit expected in John 7:39 and promised in John 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; 16:7-8, 13.
[52]  In John 7 the Spirit the disciples were to receive was not yet because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
[53]  If we have an all-inclusive bird's-eye view of the Bible, we shall see that after Christ's ascension, our God, who is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, is today the all- inclusive Spirit.
[54]  Within this Spirit there is divinity, humanity, the effectiveness of Christ's death, the power of His resurrection, and the ascension.
[55]  In other words, in this all-inclusive Spirit there is all that God is, all that man in a proper sense is, and all that the Lord Jesus has passed through, gained, and obtained.
[56]  In order to have this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit and to experience the Spirit, we must first be reborn or regenerated by Him.
[57]  If you argue that the Spirit here is not the Holy Spirit, then I would say that you believe that there are two Spirits that give life.
[58]  In the New Testament there are two lines of the experience of the all-inclusive Spirit: the line of John and the line of Luke.
[59]  In John's Gospel and in his first Epistle we have the experience of the Spirit within.
[60]  This Spirit is the water to quench our thirst and the breath for us to breathe in. As we breathe in this Spirit, we have our life in this breath.
[61]  Besides John's line, the line of the inward aspect of the Spirit, we have the line of Luke, the line of the outward aspect.
[62]  We need to experience the life-giving Spirit both from within and from without.
[63]  In Acts chapter two there is a great secret, a secret which has been overlooked by most Christians.
[64]  Acts 2:17 says, "And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh."
[65]  At least one book in the New Testament 1 Corinthians was written to the calling people.
[66]  This book was written to all those who call on the name of the Lord Jesus 1 Cor 1:2 .
[67]  When you call on His name, you will be filled with the Spirit, saturated with the Spirit, permeated with the Spirit, and soaked with the Spirit.
[68]  In this message we shall consider some symbols of the Spirit.
[69]  Second Corinthians 1:21 and 22 say, "Now he who firmly attaches us with you unto the anointed one and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the foretaste of the Spirit in our hearts" Gk.
[70]  The anointing and the sealing are the earnest, the foretaste, the guarantee.
[71]  By the all- inclusive Spirit, we receive the element of God, we have the image of God, we taste God Himself, and we also have God as our enjoyment of the firstfruit.
[72]  In this message we shall consider three crucial aspects of the Spirit: the Spirit of holiness Rom 1:4 , the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , and the Spirit of sonship Rom 8:14-16; Gal 4:5-6 .
[73]  If you do not know what the Spirit of holiness is and what the Spirit of life is, then you cannot know what the Spirit of sonship is.
[74]  No one can be a member of Christ if he is not a son of God, and no one can be a proper member in the Body of Christ without knowing what sonship is.
[75]  Furthermore, to be a proper member of Christ's Body, we must know the meaning of the Spirit of holiness and the Spirit of life.
[76]  At the moment we believed in the Lord Jesus, a certain element came into us.
[77]  It is only when you cease your activity and spend time in the presence of God to fellowship with Him that you begin to realize that there is an inward working, an inward moving, endeavoring to saturate and permeate your being in order to make you separate from all things other than God.
[78]  It is even more difficult to say what the Spirit of sonship is.
[79]  If you have the Spirit, you have the life of a son of God and the position of a son of God.
[80]  According to God's economy, Christ passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.
[81]  Now, in resurrection, He is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, ready for us to receive and enjoy 1 Cor 15:45 .
[82]  As long as we are one with Him in our spirit, our whole being will be permeated with the Spirit of holiness, and we shall become separate, absolutely different, from everything other than God.
[83]  The wonderful, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit is the sanctifying Spirit.
[84]  In this message we shall firstly cover the sanctifying aspect of the all-inclusive Spirit.
[85]  As the Spirit sanctifies us from within, He imparts God's life into us.
[86]  To impart God's life into our being means to give us life.
[87]  According to the book of Romans, transformation issues in conformation.
[88]  The life imparting of the Spirit not only imparts a new essence or element into us to replace the old and to create a new situation to transform us; eventually, it conforms us to the very image of the firstborn Son of God.
[89]  In this message we shall consider the Spirit in the book of Revelation.
[90]  In Revelation we see that the Spirit of God is now the seven Spirits.
[91]  Revelation 1:4 speaks of the seven Spirits who are before God's throne; 3:1, of the seven Spirits of God; 4:5, of seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God; and 5:6, of the seven eyes of the Lamb, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.
[92]  Before you came into the church life, you probably never heard a word about the seven Spirits of God being the seven lamps and the seven eyes.
[93]  In the book of Exodus we cannot see that these seven lamps are the Spirit of God.
[94]  THE LAKE OF FIRE AND THE CITY OF WATER
[95]  At the end of the book of Revelation we see two consummations, one negative and the other positive.
[96]  On the one hand, the seven Spirits of God are the seven judging and searching lamps; on the other hand, they are seven transfusing eyes, transfusing all that Christ is into us to make us part of the city of water, the positive consummation.
[97]  Revelation 2:7 says, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
[98]  Whenever you listen to the speaking of the seven Spirits of God to the churches, you are immediately under a precious, sweet, and dear transfusing, an infusing that changes you, transforms you, makes you the proper material, and builds you into God's building.
[99]  If we look at this picture, we shall see that today the life-giving Spirit is the seven Spirits of God, who are the seven lamps burning to search and judge the negative things and the seven eyes to infuse us with the positive things and with Christ's essence for God's building.
[100]  Although we have seen many things concerning the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, I have the burden in this message to help you realize that this Spirit has been wrought into us and that we have also been put into this Spirit.
[101]  At this point we need to see the difference between life and resurrection.
[102]  If you would consult the books in Christian bookstores and libraries, you would be unable to find a sentence telling you that today our God is such an all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.
[103]  Whenever we contact God or fellowship with Him, we must be restricted to our spirit, remembering that we have been born of the Spirit in our spirit.
[104]  It means that you realize that you have been born of the Spirit in your spirit and that you come to the meeting to contact God the Spirit in your spirit.
[105]  Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit.
[106]  Galatians 6:18 and Philemon 25 both say, "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
[107]  Right now the Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in our spirit, and grace, the full enjoyment of the riches of the Lord, is also in our spirit.
[108]  Romans 8:4 reveals that we need to walk according to this wonderful Spirit.
[109]  You simply need to realize that you have such a spirit within you and that you should do everything according to your spirit.
[110]  In the past messages we have covered many crucial aspects of the wonderful, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.
[111]  Because our spirit is now our inner man, every Christian is two beings: the old being in the soul and the new being in the spirit.
[112]  Our old man is in our soul, and our new man is in our spirit.
[113]  Let us now consider, as examples, some of those who lived and walked in the spirit.
[114]  Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, was such a one.
[115]  A number of times the book of Acts says that Stephen was full of the Holy Spirit Acts 6:3, 5; 7:55 .
[116]  Acts 19:21 says that Paul even purposed in his spirit.
[117]  Paul was "absent in body, but present in spirit" v. 3 . Verse 4 says, "In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ." This means that when the believers in Corinth and Paul's spirit were gathered together, his spirit was meeting with them.
[118]  The New Testament is the story of those who lived, walked, and worked in spirit.
[119]  When I was young, I read books on the life of Paul and the life of Peter.
[120]  In Acts 1:8 the Lord Jesus said, "But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth."
[121]  Apart from all the foregoing messages on the Spirit, we would not be able to understand what it means to be a witness to the Lord.
[122]  To be a witness to the Lord is to be a person wholly saturated with the life-giving Spirit, a person inwardly filled by the life-giving Spirit and totally immersed into the Spirit.
[123]  We have seen clearly that in God's dispensation the Lord Jesus Christ today is the life-giving Spirit.
[124]  Being a witness does not depend on what you say or do; it depends upon your being a person filled with Christ, immersed into Christ, and fully saturated and permeated with the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.
[125]  Along with an uplifted daily life we must have church meetings that are living.
[126]  Three things will attract people to the church: our daily walk, the rich meetings, and the proper communal life.
[127]  Now we come to the matter of gaining the young people.
[128]  When anyone comes to you with a negative, opposing attitude, do not touch the points he raises right away, because at that time the opposer is on fire.
[129]  If you touch the points of opposition, you will be burned.
[130]  With this message we begin a series of messages on the Body.
[131]  This indicates that the Body is something of the Spirit and that the Spirit has a great deal to do with the Body.
[132]  Most Christians do not adequately realize that the Spirit is for the Body and that the Body is for the Spirit.
[133]  The last three words of verse 22, "to the church," are crucial.
[134]  This indicates that whatever Christ has undergone, whatever He has obtained and attained, has all been transmitted to the church.
[135]  We may say that the book of Ephesians is a biblical lexicon, for it contains many new terms.
[136]  Ephesians 2:15 and 16 put the Body with the new man, telling us that the new man is the Body and that the Body is the new man.
[137]  The Body is also a matter of being joint-partakers Eph 3:6, Gk.
[138]  If we would have the Body, we must learn the lesson that the Body is such a joint matter.
[139]  In the previous message we saw in the book of Ephesians four main aspects of the Body: that the Body comes into existence through the transmission of Christ; that the Body has been brought forth through the abolishing of all the ordinances; that the Body is a matter of our being joint-heirs and joint-partakers of the promise in Christ; and that the Body is a matter of the Spirit.
[140]  The words "one body and one Spirit" indicate that the Body of Christ is wholly a matter of the Spirit.
[141]  If we have the Spirit, we have the Body.
[142]  In this message we shall see further, from 1 Corinthians 12, that the Body is a matter of the Spirit.
[143]  First Corinthians 12:2 says, "Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led."
[144]  If you remain silent in the meetings, you are a dumb idol.
[145]  After mentioning the diversities of gifts in verse 4, Paul says in verses 5 and 6, "And there are differences of ministries, but the same Lord.
[146]  . The gifts are by the Spirit, the ministries are of the Lord, and the operations are of God.
[147]  Verse 12 says, "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is the Christ" Gk.
[148]  . In this verse Paul brings in the concept that Christ is the Body.
[149]  You may be familiar with the fact that in verse 12 we see the Body-Christ, the corporate Christ, not the individual Christ.
[150]  OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE BODY DRINKING BY SPEAKING
[151]  If we consider this verse in the light of verses 3 through 12, we shall see that to drink is both to call on the name of the Lord and to speak.
[152]  Do not say that you are not of the Body.
[153]  After speaking of the self-despising members, he says, "And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you" v. 21 . For the eye to say that it does not need the hand is pride.
[154]  For the foot to say, "Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body," is self-made humility.
[155]  Today in any Christian group there may be two categories of people: the self-despising ones and the proud ones.
[156]  As a result, they do not count themselves as part of the Body, and they do not function.
[157]  In his wisdom Paul touched the real problem of the practical Body life the matter of the self-despising ones considering themselves inferior to others.
[158]  Many of you still hold the concept that you are inferior to others.
[159]  Let us now consider 1 Corinthians 12:22 and 23.
[160]  If the members exercise their spirit to be spiritual and to speak for Christ, something of Christ will be manifested, although their speaking will not be eloquent.
[161]  At this point, I would like to say a word about mutuality.
[162]  This verse does not say, "God hath set some in the church, first tongues, secondarily interpretation of tongues, thirdly healings, and after this miracles and lastly prophets."
[163]  Then Paul proceeded to say, "And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues" v.
[164]  In verse 30 Paul says, "Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?"
[165]  One of the other leaders of this group told another Chinese brother and me that God had given him the grace to speak Chinese.
[166]  We told him that we did not understand a word of what he was saying.
[167]  Then he began to make other sounds, and we told him that we still did not understand what he was saying.
[168]  At another time the interpretation may go like this: "You must love Me. If you don't love Me, you'll be cursed." But still a different interpretation may be given to the same sounds, something like this: "You rich people must give money for the building of a temple." At other times the interpreter may say, "Among you there is a wolf, one who is not a real shepherd." Any linguist could tell you that these "tongues" are not genuine.
[169]  In 1963 a so-called prophecy was given in Los Angeles that there would be a great earthquake and that Los Angeles would fall into the ocean.
[170]  . Although Paul does not tell us to reject the lesser gifts, he says to earnestly desire the greater gifts because they are more profitable for the Body life.
[171]  In 1 Corinthians 1:7 Paul said that the Corinthians came behind in no gifts.
[172]  However, in 3:1 he said, "And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ."
[173]  However, there is still the need for the growth in life.
[174]  In the New Testament we have not only 1 Corinthians, but also 2 Corinthians.
[175]  In 2 Corinthians 3:3 the Apostle Paul likens us to an epistle: "Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart."
[176]  Many Christians cannot differentiate Romans 12 from 1 Corinthians 12.
[177]  To them, Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12 are the same, for both speak of the Body life.
[178]  This transformation requires that our body be presented and that our spirit be burning Rom 12:1, 11 .
[179]  For the Body life, our body must be presented, our soul must be transformed, and our spirit must be set on fire.
[180]  You may love the church and present your body to the church, but you may not have much transformation in your soul.
[181]  In this message we need to see something further concerning the Body.
[182]  Ephesians 4:4 says, "There is one body, and one Spirit."
[183]  As long as you are not in the Body with the Spirit, you are in a division; and as long as you are outside the Spirit, you are outside the oneness.
[184]  The history of Christianity is a history of divisions.
[185]  Sometimes people have argued with me and said, "Brother Lee, denominational names are not important.
[186]  If you are Mrs. Smith, why do you go by another name? If, as you say, this means nothing and is just a convenience, then drop it.
[187]  Some Christians may argue with us and say, "You say that the Body is one.
[188]  If we truly intend to practice the Body life, we need to see that locally we are the Body and that universally we also are the Body.
[189]  According to the New Testament there are no high churches or low churches.
[190]  In the Lord's recovery today we need to have a mutual trust.
[191]  In this message we come to the matter of the site of God's building.
[192]  The spiritual things of the New Testament are mysterious.
[193]  In Deuteronomy 14:23 Moses said, "And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there."
[194]  Moses seemed to be saying, "After you enter into the land, you must be careful where you eat the best part of your harvest.
[195]  Now we need to apply this matter of the unique oneness to the situation today.
[196]  If Christians do not like one another, they simply feel free to start another meeting, claiming that they are worshipping God and that God is with them.
[197]  In order to answer this question, we must notice two things that Moses says repeatedly in Deuteronomy: that both God's name and God's habitation would be in the place which the Lord would choose.
[198]  When the Lord Jesus was talking to the Samaritan woman in John 4, she subtly changed the subject from the matter of her husband to the matter of the worship of God.
[199]  She said, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship" John 4:20 .
[200]  In this message I have the burden to share concerning the ground of the church.
[201]  In this message I want to give you all, especially the young people, a clear map for your driving in the church life.
[202]  But suppose the saints were divided into four churches: the church of Peter, the church of Apollos, the church of Paul, and the church of Christ.
[203]  Now we need to see how a group of Christians becomes a denomination.
[204]  When people ask you what kind of church we are, you should simply say, "We are just the church.
[205]  But we Christians should have just one unique and common fellowship, the fellowship of the Lord Jesus Christ 1 Cor 1:9 .
[206]  Since we are in the Lord's recovery and are practicing the Body life, we must be clear concerning what we are.
[207]  In this message I would like to cover a number of miscellaneous matters pertaining to the Body.
[208]  In addition to these basic doctrines, the Bible contains many other doctrines.
[209]  As long as you believe that God is one yet triune, that the Son of God was incarnated as a man, that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins, that He was resurrected on the third day, and that He is coming again, you are saved and you are a member of the church.
[210]  Now I wish to say a word concerning the leadership in the local churches.
[211]  Furthermore, in the church life we all need to learn not to teach differently 1 Tim 6:3-5 .
[212]  This does not mean, however, that any should be dissenting.
[213]  Although you may fight with someone, you should still love him because you are both in the same church.
[214]  In dealing with opposers, we need to prepare ourselves by reading the many books we have printed.
