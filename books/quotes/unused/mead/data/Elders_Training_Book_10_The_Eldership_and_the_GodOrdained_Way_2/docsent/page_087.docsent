   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FACTORS OF A DENOMINATION SECT Scripture Reading: Acts 2:42</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter my third burden is to show you the factors of a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A denomination is a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, there is a difference between a denomination and a sect: a sect is not a denomination if it does not denominate itself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The divisions that have been produced among us in recent years have not yet denominated themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, they are not yet denominations, but they are surely sects.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. A Special Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first factor of a denomination or a sect is a special teaching that differs from "the teaching of the apostles" Acts 2:42 in the entire New Testament, such as baptism by immersion, the presbytery to administrate the church by the eldership , head covering, the keeping of days, diet, or a particular stress on a certain point of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All of these matters may be scriptural, but we should not make any of these a special teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is right for us to have all our practices according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, in our practice we baptize people by immersion and we have the eldership, but we do not make these things particular items that divide us from other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Certain Christians divide themselves from other Christians over the matter of baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a believer desires to be received into their membership, they require him to be baptized by immersion in their baptistry, by their pastor, and in their water.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If he is baptized by immersion in another place and by other people, they will not recognize him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a special, particular teaching that divides these believers from other Christians, making them a sect and a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>B. A Special Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second factor of a denomination is a special fellowship based upon a special teaching in a realm narrower than that of "the fellowship of the apostles" Acts 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the entire Body universally, covering all kinds of genuine believers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 14 tells us that we must receive different kinds of genuine believers, regardless of what days they observe or what dietary regulations they keep.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether they eat herbs or eat meat, they are genuine believers because they believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, we must receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>C. A Special Name</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The third factor of a denomination is a special name, either according to a special teaching or according to a particular practice, that designates a certain group of believers who are of the same teaching or the same practice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The taking of such a name denominates a particular sect, making it a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>D. Any of the Three Factors</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Being Adequate to Make a Division</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Any of the above-mentioned three factors is adequate to divide the believers from others who are different from them in teaching or in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, although we should practice things such as baptism by immersion, the presbytery, and head covering, we should not make these things a special item that divides us from others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, we should not make them our creed, and we should not designate ourselves by a name, such as Lutheran, Baptist, or Presbyterian, that is according to a particular teaching or practice.</S>
