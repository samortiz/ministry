   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verses 5-7 form one section.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They speak concerning the history of the foolish virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While on earth we cannot discern this foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The bridegroom's delay in coming was intended as a test to see who is prudent and who is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At first both the prudent and the foolish ones have the light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Perhaps the foolish would laugh at the prudent for unnecessarily taking an extra portion of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many are qualified to be caught up in the beginning, but eventually they fail because of the Lord's tarrying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who consider the Lord to be tarrying are the evil slaves, and those who expect the Lord to return soon are the foolish ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The parable of the evil slave instructs the believers to prepare themselves to meet the Lord today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The parable of the virgins teaches us to consider that the Lord will return no sooner than a few decades later.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the Lord comes back after fifty years, will you be prepared to meet Him?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Take heed lest your lamp contains enough oil to burn only till midnight and not after.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you prepare only enough to last till midnight, the Lord will surely tarry until midnight is past.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not underestimate the Lord's testing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord's tarrying speaks of the need for the oil in the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether our lamps will burn only till midnight or will burn throughout the night depends on whether or not we have oil in our vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The shining at the beginning is not so crucial here.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The bridegroom is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Lord tarried, the virgins all slumbered and slept.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Parables should be interpreted, of course, spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sleep in the Scriptures has two meanings: 1 spiritual deadness Rom 13:11-14; 1 Thes 5:6 and 2 physical death 1 Thes 4:13; John 11:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sleep here must fall under one of the above two explanations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If sleep denotes spiritual deadness: 1 Why did the prudent not overcome the sleepiness?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2 Sleep here is not crucial because the prudent did not suffer any loss because of their sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>3 The Lord did not reprove them for their sleeping He was not concerned for this matter at all.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>4 Note the instruction in verse 13.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord tells us to follow the example of the five prudent virgins in their watchfulness; therefore, it is not reasonable to say that sleep implies spiritual deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Based on these reasons, we know that sleep is physical death and that slumber is to become seriously ill, to be at the juncture of life and death Acts 9:37; 1 Cor 11:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"At midnight there was a cry."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The midnight cry refers to the shout of the archangel in 1 Thessalonians 4:16.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This shout is to wake up the dead believers, whereas the trumpet in 1 Corinthians 15:52 is to gather them together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The hearers are the dead believers; the cry at midnight must refer to 1 Thessalonians 4:16.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be raised up refers to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The bridegroom has come, so go forth to meet Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus both parties come together and meet in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"All...arose" proves that all Christians are resurrected together.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It seems that here there is time for some conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yet in 1 Corinthians 15:52, "in the twinkling of an eye" does not seem to allow for such opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Remember that this is a parable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Parables are always like this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In reality there is no time, yet there may appear to be time in the parable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Matthew 20:11-12, in the beginning there is work; then comes the reward and the argument with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In reality the latter surely will not happen.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The same is also true of Matthew 22:1-14.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason, in our study of the parables we pay our attention mainly to the teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why are not the dead ones caught up into the air immediately after resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As revealed in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, the dead will rise first, then those who are living and left remaining.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since there is an order, there can be a period of time between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"The twinkling of an eye" in 1 Corinthians 15 refers to the resurrection and not to the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, it is neither surprising nor unlikely for the virgins to be able to trim their lamps after their resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A dying person in his last five minutes can also recall the things he did in his whole lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is thus quite natural for the resurrected ones to do the same immediately after they resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verses 8-9:"And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But the prudent answered, saying, Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This shows the discovery of the lack.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the bridegroom tarried, the foolish ones found that they were lacking oil.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The bridegroom's tarrying was a test to expose their prudence or foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The foolish virgins might have thought that the five prudent virgins were over-cautious by taking oil with their vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now they discover their need.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"Give us some of your oil."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means, "Give us of the gift of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One should know that the gift of the Holy Spirit can be given, but not the fullness of the Holy Spirit Acts 8:17; 19:6; 2 Tim 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To ask only for the gift of the Holy Spirit is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>One must have both the gift and the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We cannot borrow oil from others, whether they are our parents, brothers, sisters, or close relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our spiritual fullness requires that we pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Pretending to be spiritual can get us by today, but it will not be sufficient for that day.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Obtaining the Holy Spirit requires fellowshipping with the Lord and paying the price to pursue Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>No matter how long you stay with other spiritual ones, it will not help you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do not think we can borrow oil from others.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To borrow light, yes; but to borrow oil, no.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>"Perhaps there will not be enough."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In other words, we cannot help you; it is not possible to help others in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There are times when the Lord will permit certain kinds of "holy selfishness."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Just because some are foolish, we should not allow ourselves also to become foolish for sympathy's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Although we should express our concern for others, we must reserve for ourselves a certain "sacred selfishness"; otherwise, there will not be enough.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>That is, both will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The other party will not receive any help, and your effort will not improve the situation.</S>
