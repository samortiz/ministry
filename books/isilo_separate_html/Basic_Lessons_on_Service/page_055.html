The Offering Priest's Portion</H2><P>Leviticus 7:12 through 14 says, "If he offers it for thanksgiving, then with the thanksgiving sacrifice he shall offer unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes of fine flour saturated, mingled with oil. With the thanksgiving sacrifice of his peace offering, he shall offer his offering with cakes of leavened bread; and from it he shall offer one from each offering as a heave offering to Jehovah; it shall be for the priest who dashes the blood of the peace offering." Out of the many cakes offered, one of each kind had to be set apart and heaved unto God as a heave offering. This became the portion of the serving priest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. One Cake out of Each of the Following<br>as a Heave Offering unto Jehovah&#151;<br>Christ in His Humanity as Nourishment<br>in Ascension to the Serving One</H2><P>All the cakes are types of Christ in His humanity, and these become a heave offering to Jehovah. This shows that Christ in His humanity becomes nourishment in ascension to us, the serving ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Unleavened, Perforated, Thin Cakes Mingled<br>with Oil&#151;Christ Living a Crucified Life Mingled with<br>the Spirit and Easy to Be Contacted and Received</H2><P>The unleavened, perforated, thin cakes mingled with oil signify Christ living a crucified life mingled with the Spirit and easy to be contacted and received (Lev. 7:12a). The thin cakes are easy to eat, meaning that Christ is easy to be contacted and received. If a cake is too thick, it is hard to eat. These cakes are also perforated, pierced through. This indicates the dealing of the cross and signifies the crucified life.</P><P>The four Gospels show us that the Lord's life on this earth was "full of holes." His life was a perforated life, a crucified life. He was living a life which was always pierced through by some sufferings. Furthermore, the four Gospels show us that Christ was easy to be contacted and received, as typified by the thinness of the unleavened cakes. These cakes were mingled with oil, signifying that Christ was mingled with the Spirit.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> </body></html>
