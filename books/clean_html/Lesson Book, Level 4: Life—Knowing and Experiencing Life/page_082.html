This may be overlooked by most saints. Memorizing the Word of God is very helpful. Have you ever experienced a lack of the Word of God in your preaching of the gospel? You may not know what to say when preaching to a friend. If you memorize a verse a day, in three years, you will have about one thousand verses memorized. You will not have to worry about what to say or where to find the verses you want to quote. Young people should definitely memorize verses. What you memorize in your youth may never be forgotten. You can use the verses for the rest of your life. Your mind becomes cluttered with too many things when you get older. Ecclesiastes 12:1 says, “Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth.’’ One of the best ways to remember the Lord is to memorize His word. Psalm 119:11 says, “Your word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against You.’’ What you keep in your heart (mainly your mind) will help to keep you from sin and will help to form you according to God’s desire.<p>In conclusion, we must use our spirit and our mind to contact the Word of God daily to receive the Spirit and life that we may be enriched.
