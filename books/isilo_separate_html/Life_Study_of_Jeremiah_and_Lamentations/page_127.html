Jehovah Forgiving Their Iniquity<br>and Remembering Their Sin No More</H2><P>In Jeremiah 31:34b we have yet another aspect of the new covenant. Here Jehovah says, "I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more." Our sin and iniquity are great problems, but they have been dealt with. Before Jeremiah spoke of the new covenant, he spoke concerning Christ as the righteous Shoot of David, as the One whose name will be called Jehovah our righteousness (23:5-6). This One has accomplished redemption; He has taken away our sin. "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" (John 1:29). He has solved the problem of sin, and now He is our redemption and our justification. In Him we have been justified by God, and God has forgiven our iniquity and our sin. Because we have been justified, there is no obstacle or frustration to keep us from having fellowship with God and to prevent Him from dispensing Himself into us. Because we have been redeemed, justified, forgiven, and cleansed, we are free to contact God, and He is free to work Himself into us.</P><P>God has forgiven our sin, and He does not remember it. As a result, there can now be communication, fellowship, between us and God. Day by day we may converse with Him, enjoying Him and receiving His dispensing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. ISRAEL SERVING<br>JEHOVAH THEIR GOD AND DAVID THEIR KING</H2><P>A further promise of Jehovah concerning the restoration of Israel is in Jeremiah 30:9. Here we are told that Israel will serve Jehovah their God and David their King, whom Jehovah will raise up for them in the time of the millennium.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_126.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_128.html">Next</a> </body></html>
