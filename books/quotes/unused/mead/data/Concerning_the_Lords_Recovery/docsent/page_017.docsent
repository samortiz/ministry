   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was the fourth section.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then the incense altar was placed in the middle of a triangle formed by the showbread table, the lampstand, and the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The sweet incense was burned upon the incense altar to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Finally the curtains were hung to close the entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was the fifth section and completed the tabernacle on the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the sixth section an altar was set up.</S>
