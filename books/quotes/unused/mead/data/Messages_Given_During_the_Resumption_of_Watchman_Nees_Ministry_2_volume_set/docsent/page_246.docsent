   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTY-SEVEN A TRANSPARENT PERSON 1 THE LORD'S DAY MORNING MESSAGE 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:10:00 a.m., The Lord's Day, May 9, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Scripture Reading: John 8:12; 1 John 1:5; Matt 11:15; Eph 5:14</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Prayer: Lord, help us not only to remove the world, sin, and the flesh, but help us not to come with our mind or our will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Turn the darkness within us into light, the foolishness into clearness, so that our spirit can meet You face to face in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>IT BEING DIFFICULT TO FIND A TRANSPARENT PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Two weeks ago, I had a deep feeling that among God's children it is difficult to find many who love the Lord and who are consecrated for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But it is more difficult to find a transparent person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No matter where a person goes, you can always find some people who love the Lord and who live for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But it is difficult to find one who is transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is a difference between being bright and being transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To the Chinese, to be bright means to be good, righteous, moral, law-abiding, and just; brightness to them means cleanliness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in the Bible, brightness does not refer to this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As far as cleanliness goes, this glass may not be as clean as this table.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But as far as transparency goes, the glass is more transparent than the table.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The table is hard and dark, but the glass is transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although a handkerchief may be white and clean, light cannot pass through it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Transparency is there when a person lives in the light and when he becomes shining.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every person should be a shining and transparent person before God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Revelation tells us that the four living creatures have eyes all over them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You can find people who pray every day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You can find people who are zealous for the Lord and who run around for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You can find people who have a strong interest for spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You can even find people who are willing to give up everything, but it is difficult to find one or two persons who are as clear as crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Among God's children, there are very few clear and transparent people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even when many have handed over themselves, it is still difficult to find a few among them who are transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some people are very proper and moral, but they are not transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some people are very nice, but they are not transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In my daily contact with many individuals, I have come to know all kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Among them, two are like smoking chimneys; not only are they not transparent, but they are full of foul air and smog.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Clearness and transparency here refer to a person's knowledge of spiritual things and his discernment of the spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A transparent person can give others light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are not shining within, it means that we do not carry much weight before God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today, there are too few transparent persons.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>SALVATION BRINGING US THE LIGHT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's word says that He has transferred us from darkness into light Acts 26:18; 1 Pet 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Formerly, we were sinful and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we do not sin any longer, and we have become proper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is right, but this is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The salvation as revealed in God's word shows us that once we were blind, but now our eyes are open.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we are no longer in darkness but in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the one hand, salvation opens our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the other hand, as the Lord Himself is the light, and salvation brings the Lord into us, it also brings light into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord said that He is the light of the world John 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brothers and sisters, what kind of life have we received?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This life is the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whether through God's salvation or through His word, we find that God's children should be transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today, men think that it is normal for God's children to be dark, and when one or two of them are shining, others think that they are abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Actually, to be shining is to be normal, and to be dark is to be abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we touch the life within the brothers and sisters, we touch light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we come into the church, we also see light.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When a man reads the Bible day by day, there are lights all over the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With a Christian, everything and all things about him and around him are lights.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is therefore a strange thing for a Christian not to touch any light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Where are the transparent ones today?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Are you transparent?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Are the ones sitting next to you transparent?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I dare not say if they are.</S>
