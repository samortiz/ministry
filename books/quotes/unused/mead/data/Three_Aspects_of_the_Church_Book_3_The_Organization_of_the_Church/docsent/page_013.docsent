   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HAVING TWO ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church has both a universal and a local aspect, and its organization also has a universal and a local aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In terms of organization, the apostles are related to the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Scriptures none of the apostles were apostles in relation only to a single local church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The office of an apostle is universal, not local, whereas the office of an elder or a deacon is local.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If an elder in the church in Kaohsiung moves to Taipei, he will not necessarily be appointed an elder of the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a person has been appointed to be an elder in one locality, he does not automatically continue in that office should he move somewhere else.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a brother is an elder in Kaohsiung, he may not even be appointed to be a deacon if he moves to Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, an apostle will continue to be an apostle whether he is in Kaohsiung or Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Offices related to a locality are restricted to that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, apostleship is not restricted to a particular locality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The basic constituents of both the universal church and the local churches are the same; that is, in both its universal and local aspects the church is constituted of people who have the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, there is a distinction in regard to the offices in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This distinction corresponds to the churches universal and local aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The office of an apostle is altogether related to the universal church, whereas the office of an elder or deacon is related only to a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sphere of these offices should never be confused.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN OFFICES AND GIFTS The Definition of Offices and Gifts</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the organization of the church, there is a distinction between the offices related to the universal and local aspects of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, there is also a distinction between office and gift.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Being an elder or a deacon is a matter of office, not gift.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, to speak for God as a prophet is a matter of gift, not office.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All offices are on the administrative side, and all gifts are on the spiritual side.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, offices are for administration and government, and gifts are for spiritual building up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These two aspects are closely related, yet they are quite distinct from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the universal and local aspects of the church, the office of the apostles and the offices of the elders and deacons are not related to the same sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Apostles are universal, whereas elders and deacons are local.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be an apostle, elder, or deacon is a matter of office.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, to be a prophet, teacher, or evangelist is not a matter of office.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Among the offices in the church, in the universal aspect as well as the local aspect, apostles have the highest office, then elders, and then deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Each has an office in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Among the gifts there is also a distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some gifts are for the church, and some are for individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The gifts that God gives to the church are for the church, and the gifts that He gives to an individual are related to the individual.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The gifts given by God to the church are persons, as spoken of in Ephesians 4:7-16.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After Christ ascended to heaven, He gave various gifts to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers v. 11 . Christ gave these persons as gifts to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church receives these gifts; thus, they are for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The gifts that individuals receive are spiritual abilities and capabilities.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through the Holy Spirit, God gives certain individuals the ability to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This ability is a gift given to them by God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such gifts are referred to as gifts for individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Among these gifts for individuals, some are ordinary and others are miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ordinary gifts are those spoken of in Romans 12:4-21.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Love for one another is included among these gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our seeing the brothers off at the train station is also a matter of an ordinary gift.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to Romans 12, the gifts that we have received are different.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some of us do one thing, and others do something else.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some may love people, and others may give hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These gifts are ordinary gifts given to individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The other kind of gifts are the miraculous gifts spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12:9-10.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These include speaking in tongues, interpreting tongues, healing, and carrying out operations of works of power.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, there is a gift that is both ordinary and miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the gift of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To prophesy is to speak for God and speak forth God, including predicting and foretelling.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The emphasis in 1 Corinthians 12 is predicting, which is miraculous, whereas in Romans 12 the emphasis is not on predicting but on speaking for God as a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Greek word translated prophesy also means predict.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every person who functions as a mouthpiece of God speaks for God and thus is a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sometimes a person s speaking may be a prediction, and sometimes it may be an ordinary teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The ordinary teaching rendered by a prophet is related to his regular spiritual learning.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Based on his regular learning, when he is inspired, he will rise up to speak for the edification of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Strictly speaking, this is not predicting.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is an ordinary gift.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At another time a person may have the instant inspiration of the Holy Spirit and rise up to speak a word of prediction.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is what happened in the case of Agabus.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He rose up and predicted that there was about to be a great famine over the whole inhabited earth Acts 11:27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>His prediction was a miraculous gift, as spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12, and was the result of inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>According to the organization of the church, there is a distinction between the offices as they relate to the universal and local aspects of the church, and there is also a distinction between offices and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>With respect to offices, they either are related to the universal church or to the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>With respect to gifts, they are either for the church or for individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the entire Bible only three portions speak of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The first portion is Ephesians 4, which tells us that some gifts were given by Christ to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The second portion is Romans 12, which speaks of ordinary gifts, such as showing mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The third portion is 1 Corinthians 12, which speaks of miraculous gifts, such as speaking in tongues, interpretation of tongues, and healing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The following outline shows the distinctions between the types of offices and the types of gifts:</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Offices: Universal apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Local elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Gifts: For the church Eph 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>For individuals: Ordinary gifts Rom 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Miraculous gifts 1 Cor 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Strictly speaking, the apostleship is the only office in the universal church, but in a broader sense prophets as well as shepherds and teachers are also offices in the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>How do we distinguish between offices and gifts?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>To have an office is a matter of appointment, whereas to have a gift is a matter of ability.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>For example, to be a carpenter is a matter of ability, but to become a foreman is a matter of office.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Although two carpenters may have the same ability, one may be a senior foreman and the other a junior foreman.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Even though both have the same ability, they may have different offices.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Let us use another example.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>On one hand, to be a teacher is a matter of gift; on the other hand, it is an office.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In terms of the ability to teach, a teacher has a gift, but in terms of being hired to teach, a teacher has an office.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This should be very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Importance of Offices and Gifts</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In the church both the gifts and the offices are indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>An office may be compared to a husband, and a gift, to a wife; we should never emphasize one and neglect the other.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Nevertheless, in their spiritual pursuit, most Christians pay more attention to gifts than to offices.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Throughout the centuries there have always been problems in regard to the organization of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Most of the problems have been due to offices.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Gifts tend to be less problematic, but it is very easy for problems and mistakes to arise in relation to offices.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If a person is not gifted yet claims to be gifted, others quickly can detect his lack of gift.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>However, it may be difficult to tell whether or not a person has a certain office.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>While it is difficult to pretend to have a gift, it is much easier to pretend to have an office.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is why the matter of having an office gives rise to more problems than the matter of having a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>There is no human hand in the formation of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>People cannot arrange for someone to be a prophet or for another to be an evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>However, human hands are involved in the appointment of offices.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The appointment of offices must pass through human hands, as in the laying on of hands by the apostles in Acts 14:23 and Titus 1:5.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Church history tells us that the majority of the problems in the church are due to offices.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is why most of those who pursue the Lord desire gifts and despise offices.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>However, it is not sufficient to have only gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Office is a matter of authority, and gift is a matter of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>First Corinthians 12 is a chapter on spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>When the church lacks gifts, it lacks spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>However, gifts are not life.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>There is a difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The primary requirement for someone to speak as a prophet is that he must be spiritual; that is, he must have the Holy Spirit operating in him.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>In recent years many people have paid too much attention to spirituality and disregarded authority.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is to be extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>On the other hand, in organized Christianity the emphasis is altogether related to office, to man s authority, and gifts are neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This is also to be extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Although some preachers have been appointed to their offices, they do not have the gift of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Their appointment is merely an official arrangement, and it is a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Hence, although they are appointed to be carpenters, they do not know how to use a hammer.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>However, if we try to correct such mistakes by caring only for gifts and neglecting offices, this will also be a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>In the organization of the church there must be gifts as well as offices.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>In the church there needs to be spirituality as well as authority.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>If in the church there are only gifts, there will be no authority, and if there are no gifts, there will be no offices.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>If there are spiritual gifts in the church, there should also be authority; otherwise, the church will be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Under normal conditions a church should take care of both matters: spirituality and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>When both these matters are properly coordinated, all the problems of the church will be solved spontaneously.</S>
