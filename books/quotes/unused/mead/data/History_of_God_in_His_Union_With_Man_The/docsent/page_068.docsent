   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the previous messages, we saw God's working on Abraham and Isaac, and we began to see His working on Jacob with Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order for us to understand the book of Genesis thoroughly, we have to know the life of Jacob even more than the life of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The experiences of Abraham are not as subjective as those of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The book of Genesis has fifty chapters, and the last twenty-six chapters speak of Jacob's life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jacob's history begins in Genesis 25 and is wrapped up with two persons his father Isaac and his son Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jacob needed such a father and such a son to complete his life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Genesis 25 shows us Jacob's birth and his gaining the birthright from Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even from his mother's womb, Jacob was struggling to be the firstborn of the twins vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>22-26a .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Genesis 27 shows us how Jacob struggled to receive the blessing of the firstborn son through his deceiving according to his mother Rebekah's device vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rebekah caused trouble for her husband and her two sons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Isaac, in a sense, lived a peaceful life, but in another sense, he did not because his second son was forced to leave him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From the time that Rebekah devised to send Jacob away to her brother Laban, she never saw Jacob again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows that if we exercise our natural, human wisdom and device, we will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have seen that in God's working on Jacob, He loved Jacob and chose him before the foundation of the world Mal 1:2b; Rom 9:10-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was the same with us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ephesians 1:4 and 5 say that in eternity past before the foundation of the world God chose us and predestinated us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The phrase "in love" is in Ephesians 1:4.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just as He loved and chose Jacob, God chose us because of His love 1 Thes 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then God raised Jacob as an heir to Abraham and to Isaac Gen 28:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God loved him, chose him, and ordained that he would be Abraham's and Isaac's heir.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Jacob did not need to struggle to get the birthright, to be the heir, because God had already destined him for this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God was doing everything to raise Jacob up so that he could inherit God's promise to Abraham and Isaac and His covenant with them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, Jacob obtained the birthright, apparently because of his endeavoring.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But we need to see that if God had not destined Jacob to receive the birthright, he could have never obtained it no matter how much he endeavored.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The history of Jacob is mostly a history of treachery, deceit, falsehood, and struggling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From the womb of his mother, he tried to come out first, but he did not make it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was a person who was always deceiving, striving, and struggling with others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through his cunning, he gained much cattle from his uncle Laban 30:31-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Later, when he was about to confront the threatening situation with his brother Esau, he sent nine droves of cattle to him as a present 32:13-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This present was actually a bribe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jacob did not have a sincere, loving heart toward his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His present to Esau did not issue out of a heart of love but out of a heart of fear.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then as he was approaching Esau, Jacob put the handmaids and their children foremost, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph last 33:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The ones whom he loved the most were kept at the rear for their protection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This shows that he was still striving and struggling according to his self-effort.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God destined that Jacob should live a struggling life all his days.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From his mother's womb to the end of his life, he was struggling.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the previous message we saw seven points concerning Jacob's life of struggling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, he was destined from his mother's womb to struggle to be the firstborn of the twins 25:22-26a .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Second, he struggled to receive the blessing of the firstborn son through his deceiving according to his mother's device 27:1-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Third, he was forced by his brother's hatred and his mother's partial love and natural wisdom to leave his parents and go to his uncle Laban 27:41 28:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Fourth, he suffered loneliness and homelessness in the journey to his uncle 28:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Fifth, he arrived at his uncle Laban's home by suffering a long, lonely journey, indicated by his weeping to his cousin Rachel 29:1-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sixth, he married four wives and begot eleven sons by fourteen years of hard labor and much grinding under his wives 29:15 30:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Seventh, he endeavored to become rich by deceiving his uncle Laban with his subtle skill 30:25-43 .</S>
