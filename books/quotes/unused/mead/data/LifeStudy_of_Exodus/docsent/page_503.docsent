   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-EIGHT THE HOLY ANOINTING OIL 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 30:22-33; Psalm 133:2; 1 John 2:20, 27</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider the details related to the holy anointing oil in 30:22-33.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ITS MATERIALS Four Kinds of Spices</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The materials of the holy anointing oil are of two categories and are five in number.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first category includes the four spices: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second category consists of one item olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Flowing Myrrh</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Flowing myrrh, smelling sweet but tasting bitter, signifies the precious death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Bible myrrh is used mostly for burial.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, myrrh is related to death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to John 19, when Nicodemus and others were preparing to bury the body of the Lord Jesus, they used myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Myrrh comes from an aromatic tree.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This tree drops its juice either as a result of being cut or through some kind of natural opening or incision.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In ancient times, this juice was used to reduce the suffering of death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the Lord Jesus was being crucified, He was offered wine mixed with myrrh to reduce His pain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, He refused to take it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No doubt, the myrrh in Exodus 30 is a symbol of the Lord s death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The aromatic liquid of myrrh not only reduces pain, but also can be used for healing the body when it gives off the wrong kind of secretion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Myrrh can correct this condition in the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our human life there are many wrong secretions, but the Lord s death on the cross corrects this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Fragrant Cinnamon</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Cinnamon not only has a distinctive flavor, but it can also be used to stimulate the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Cinnamon may be prescribed to stimulate a weak heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Myrrh signifies the precious death of Christ, and cinnamon signifies the effectiveness of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we apply the Lord s death to our situation, it will reduce our pain, correct the wrong secretions, and eventually stimulate us and make us happy and joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I can testify of this from my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are times that negative things in my environment would cause me to be low.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But when I apply the Lord s death, I am corrected, adjusted, stimulated, and stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Fragrant Calamus</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The calamus in Exodus 30 is a reed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Hebrew root of the word myrrh means flowing, and the root for calamus means standing up.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Calamus grows in a marsh or muddy place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But even though it grows in a marsh, it is able to shoot up into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to the sequence of the spices, this calamus signifies the rising up of the Lord Jesus from the place of death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord was put into a marsh, into a death situation, but in resurrection He rose up and stood up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Calamus, therefore, signifies the precious resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Cassia</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fourth spice, cassia, signifies the power of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Cassia and cinnamon belong to the same family.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Cinnamon is from the inner part of the bark, and cassia, from the outer part of the bark.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Both cinnamon and cassia are sweet and fragrant.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, the plants from which they are derived often live and grow in places where other plants cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In ancient times cassia was used as a repellent to drive away insects and snakes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Cassia thus signifies the power, the effectiveness, of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ s resurrection can withstand any kind of environment, and His resurrection certainly is a repellent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It repels all evil insects and especially the old serpent, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia are all of one category of materials, the category of the spices.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now we come to the olive oil, the only item in the second category.</S>
