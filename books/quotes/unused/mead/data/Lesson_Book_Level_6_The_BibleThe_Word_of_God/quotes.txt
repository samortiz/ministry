[3]  This is the sixth and the last lesson book of this series of six lesson books for the summer school of the truth.
[4]  The first lesson book showed us God s full salvation concerning how God saved us, the tripartite beings, in three stages for His purpose, the church.
[5]  The second lesson book showed us Christ s person and work and the Triune God.
[6]  The Spirit and the Bible are two sides of one matter.
[7]  THE ORIGIN OF THE BIBLE A. The Bible Being God-breathed
[8]  This tells us that the Scripture did not come out of man s thought, man s mind, but rather, it is God s breathing His thought and His word through His Spirit into and out of the writers.
[9]  Hence, the Bible contains God s elements and carries His flavor.
[10]  The functions of the Bible are of two aspects: one aspect is to serve the Lord, and the other aspect is to serve us.
[11]  On the one hand, it testifies of the Lord Jesus and, on the other hand, it causes us to receive grace and be built up.
[12]  The first function of the Bible toward us is to make us wise unto salvation 2 Tim 3:15 ; it reveals to us how God saves men in Christ, and how men may be saved by faith, so that we may know the way of salvation.
[13]  When we receive the word of the Scriptures into us by faith, it comes into us like a seed of life, sowing God s life into us; thus, we have God s life and are regenerated.
[14]  Lesson Two THE WRITING OF THE BIBLE 1 Scripture Reading 2 Tim 3:16; John 6:63; Gen 11:31; Isa 19:18;
[15]  Mark 5:41; 15:34; Gal 1:19; 2:9; Jude 1; Luke 24:44; 27 Outline Before the Bible was written Without the written revelation of God There being instructions handed down through oral tradition The languages used in the ancient time The ancient languages Akkadian The Babylonian writing of the tribe of Shem The language of Canaan and the Hebrew language Aramaic Greek The languages used in the Bible Hebrew Aramaic Greek The authors of the Bible and the places in which it was written The Old Testament The New Testament The times when the Bible was written The recognition of the authority of the Bible The Old Testament The Pentateuch of Moses The other books The New Testament The gospels The other books
[16]  We know that the Bible is the word of God.
[17]  We also know that God did not write a book in heaven and then send an angel to bring it down to earth.
[18]  Why do we recognize the writings of those who wrote the Bible as God s word?
[19]  AND THE PLACES IN WHICH IT WAS WRITTEN A. The Old Testament
[20]  The Pentateuch of Moses Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy was written by Moses.
[21]  He was originally a tax collector, and his origin was not honorable.
[22]  The Lord called him to be one of the twelve apostles.
[23]  Among the Old Testament writings, the Pentateuch has always been recognized by the Jews as being from God and having absolute and divine authority.
[24]  Isa 14:13-14; Gen 3:1-6, 15; John 1:29; 10:10; 2:19;
[25]  John 1:1; 5:39; Rev 19:13 Outline The subject of the Bible The subject of the Old Testament The subject of the New Testament The central thought of the Bible The central thought of the Old Testament leading man to Christ for redemption The central thought of the New Testament in Christ the church being redeemed and built up Subdivisions according to the structure of the Bible The Old Testament: The Pentateuch History Psalms The books of the prophets The books of the prophets before the captivity The books of the prophets during the captivity The books of the prophets after the captivity The New Testament Subdivision according to spiritual experience The Old Testament The New Testament Subdivisions of the Old Testament according to the Jews or the rabbis The law of Moses The prophets: divided into the former prophets and the latter prophets The other books Subdivision of the Old Testament by the Lord Jesus
[26]  If we want to know any book, we have to grasp its subject and central thought.
[27]  In addition, we need a proper analysis of its structure and a clear understanding of its sections.
[28]  The Bible has its own subject, its central thought, and its sections.
[29]  Although there are sixty-six books in the Bible, it has its subject and central thought; there are also distinctive sections within its structure.
[30]  In Christianity there are many books of Bible exposition.
[31]  Most of them say that the central thought of the Bible is Christ.
[32]  But today, according to the light we have received through His mercy, we feel it is insufficient merely to say that Christ is the central thought of the Bible.
[33]  There are many ways to subdivide the Bible into sections.
[34]  This is the best way to subdivide the Bible and is the way we recommend.
[35]  THE APOCRYPHA, THE FALSE REVELATIONS, AND THE TRANSLATIONS Scripture Reading Heb 6:13, 17; Gal 3:15-17; Rom 6:14; Gal 3:22-26;
[36]  Heb 8:13, 6; John 1:17; Heb 9:22; Gal 3:10, 12;
[37]  Many Christians do not fully understand the difference between the New Testament and the Old Testament.
[38]  It is good to spend some time to study this matter.
[39]  As we come to study the new and old testaments, we must first know the difference between these terms: a promise, an oath, a covenant, and a testament.
[40]  Everyone who kept the law would be blessed Deut 6:1-3 , and everyone who did not abide by all the things written in the book of the law to do them would be cursed Gal 3:10 .
[41]  There were fourteen books of the Apocrypha which were not included in the Bible.
[42]  Some have thought that these fourteen books were included in the Old Testament before the Septuagint translation of the Old Testament into Greek in 277 B.C. But we can find out from verified historical information that such a postulate is wrong.
[43]  The Lord Jesus Christ said, I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this book Rev 22:18-19 .
[44]  Any addition or deletion resulting in any changes to the complete revelation of God the Bible is wrong.
[45]  From 1870 to 1885, about one hundred scholars from England and America revised the Authorized Version and called it the Revised Version.
[46]  When these scholars were revising the Authorized Version, some of the suggested revisions by the American scholars were not accepted.
[47]  It is translated into more languages than any other book written by man.
[48]  More than six hundred million Bibles were sent out in 1989.
[49]  The Bible is most definitely the precious gift of God for man.
[50]  Isa 4:2; 6:1; 7:14; 9:6; 42:1-3; 52:14; Micah 5:2;
[51]  Isa 53:2-12; 52:13; Psa 2:6-7; 132:11; Isa 62:11-12 Outline The proof by logic Authorship Moral tone Content Availability The proof by its completion The writers The number seven Truthfulness The perfect law The proof by its prophecies Concerning Christ Concerning Israel Concerning Tyre Concerning Sidon Concerning Babylon The proof by its power In gospel preaching In changing behavior In sensitizing the conscience The proof by people s love toward the Bible Persecution by the Roman Empire Persecution by the Roman Catholic Church The scientific proof The round and rotating earth The unlimited number of stars
[52]  As Christians, we believe that the Bible is the Word of God given to man.
[53]  The entire Bible does three things: it manifests God, exposes man, and unveils Christ.
[54]  First, it shows us that the God who blesses us is loving, righteous, and faithful.
[55]  The way the Bible was completed proves that the Bible is the Word of God.
[56]  The Bible was not written by God in heaven and sent down to man, nor was it written by one man.
[57]  The Bible took nearly 1,600 years to complete, and it was written by over forty people.
[58]  Prophecies are the strongest proof of the authenticity of the Bible as the Word of God.
[59]  The Lord prophesied in Ezekiel 28:22-23, Behold, I am against thee, O Sidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.
[60]  For I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her, with the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
[61]  Sidon was surrounded by the Persian army in 35 B.C., and forty thousand inhabitants chose to die rather than to surrender.
[62]  TOWARD THE BIBLE A. Persecution by the Roman Empire
[63]  Some love it so much that they would even die for it.
[64]  Ezra 9:4; Rev 1:9; 3:8, 10; 6:9; 22:18, 19 Outline The proof by the history of the Jewish people Chosen by God Becoming a great nation Being led by the judges The height of their experience Degradation Being tossed to and fro The recovery of the temple and the city of Jerusalem The Lord s first coming to them The destruction of the temple and the city; their being scattered again Their being kept as a people The restoration of the nation of Israel The proof by its indestructibility The proof by its spread during persecution A Bible hidden inside a chair A Bible baked inside a loaf of bread The proof by the word of the Lord and other writers of the Bible The proof by ancient documents Three main ancient manuscripts Books and letters of early believers The proof by archaeology The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls The discovery of clay tablets The discovery of Nineveh
[65]  I. The Destruction of the Temple and the City;
[66]  Before the Lord was crucified, He prophesied in Matthew 24:2 that not one stone of the temple would be left upon another.
[67]  This indicated that the temple would be destroyed and the people would be scattered again.
[68]  The spreading of the Bible under persecution proves that the Bible is the Word of God.
[69]  Most people will give up something if they are persecuted for possessing it, but not the Bible.
[70]  Some people who doubt that the Bible is the Word of God may not be able to argue with the previously mentioned proof, but they may argue that the Bible we have today is not necessarily the same as the original Bible.
[71]  It is true that there is not one single copy of the Bible s original manuscripts left today.
[72]  But there are manuscripts, documents, and letters from ancient times that tell us that the Bible we have today is accurate.
[73]  AND THE CROSS OF CHRIST Scripture Reading Col 1:17-18; 1 Cor 8:4; Matt 28:19;
[74]  John 14:9-10, 16-17, 20, 23; 2 Cor 13:14; 1 Cor 15:45; Matt 1:16, 21, 23; Col 1:15; Acts 1:8; John 15:26;
[75]  In the next four lessons, we will talk about fourteen key topics of the Bible.
[76]  Because the Bible is so long, it is helpful to know the key topics of the Bible in order to better understand what you are reading.
[77]  Some of these topics were covered in earlier lesson books.
[78]  If you wish to know more about salvation, God, Christ, the Spirit, the human spirit, eternal life, and the church, you may study the previous lesson books in this series.
[79]  Christ is the subject and center of the Bible and is the main content of the Bible from beginning to end. Even more He is the reality of our faith.
[80]  We who have believed into Him and received grace must know Him in a thorough way.
[81]  This is the third great thing He did, solving, once and for all, the problem of everything that God had condemned in the universe, such as Satan, sin, the world, the flesh, the old man, and the old creation.
[82]  Therefore, we should also know Him that we may richly experience Him.
[83]  The cross of Christ accomplished God s eternal redemption for us according to the requirements of God s righteousness, holiness, and glory to become the basis of our eternal salvation.
[84]  AND THE BELIEVERS Scripture Reading Rev 13:8; Gen 3:15; 1 John 3:8; Gal 3:16; 1 Pet 1:2;
[85]  2 Cor 3:18; Rom 8:5-11; Rom 15:16 Outline Man The creation of man Man being created according to God s image and likeness To have man to express God To have man to exercise God s dominion God placing man in front of the tree of life in order for man to receive Him as life The fall of man The first step of the fall The cause 1 The serpent s temptation 2 The woman s assuming the headship The process The result The second step of the fall The third step of the fall The fourth step of the fall Salvation God s promise The seed of the woman The seed of Abraham Salvation being in three stages The initial stage The progressing stage The completing stage Eternal life The definition of eternal life Laying hold of eternal life Believers The baptism of the believers The regeneration of the believers The growth of the believers The function of the believers
[86]  The Bible is not only a book about God; it is also about man.
[87]  If you took away God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the cross of Christ from the Bible, the Bible would be an empty book.
[88]  Likewise, without man, there is no one for God to speak to in the Bible.
[89]  Therefore, just as God and the Lord Jesus have a special place in the Bible, so does man.
[90]  After God made man, He placed man in front of the tree of life, that man might contact the tree of life and receive His life which is the uncreated life.
[91]  He tempted man to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and caused man to have an illegal union with him.
[92]  The first result of the fall was that the soul was polluted, corrupted, and occupied.
[93]  Even before Eve partook of the tree of knowledge, her mind had been polluted already.
[94]  In His eternal plan, God planned to create all things and to have man to fulfill His eternal purpose.
[95]  Furthermore, according to His foreknowledge and foresight, that is, according to His foreknowledge of man s fall, He planned to redeem man after the fall.
[96]  God s redemption was neither an addition to His original plan, nor an afterthought to remedy the problem, but was planned and prepared from the beginning.
[97]  In God s eternal plan, He foreordained that after man s fall, Christ would accomplish redemption.
[98]  Many Christians hold the concept that eternal life is a blessing given to the believers, in which they merely go to a heavenly mansion to enjoy a better life.
[99]  When I was in Christianity, no one told me that eternal life is not a blessing, but that it is simply life.
[100]  In our physical body we have a biological life bios , and in our soul we have a psychological life psuche .
[101]  The believers have been sanctified positionally by the blood of Christ Heb 13:12 and are being sanctified dispositionally by the Spirit Rom 15:16; 6:19, 22 , that they may be renewed, transformed in their soul Rom 12:2a; 2 Cor 3:18 , conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29 , and glorified redeemed in their body Rom 8:23 in the glory of the processed Triune God Rom 8:30, 17-18 .
[102]  Although the believers have been regenerated in their spirit, their soul and body remain old.
[103]  Thus, the believers need to be renewed, transformed in their soul, conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God, and glorified in their body in the glory of the processed Triune God.
[104]  THE NEW JERUSALEM Scripture Reading Matt 16:18; Eph 1:22-23; 5:25; Matt 18:17;
[105]  16:8 Outline The church What the church is The called out assembly The Body of Christ The counterpart of Christ The house of God The new man The constituents of the church The two aspects of the church The universal aspect The local aspect The designation of the church It has no special name It may be designated by the name of its locality The kingdom The divine image and the divine authority The kingdom and the chosen race The kingdom in the New Testament The kingdom of God The kingdom not being suspended The three aspects of the kingdom of the heavens The New Jerusalem Not a physical city The crystallized product and masterpiece of God s work of the new creation throughout the generations A composition of the redeemed saints throughout the generations The Old Testament saints The New Testament believers The bride of the Lamb The consummation of the Bible
[106]  The church is the goal God wants to obtain in His eternal economy.
[107]  Each one of us who is saved participates in this goal, that God may obtain His heart s desire according to His good pleasure.
[108]  On this rock I Christ will build My church Matt 16:18 .
[109]  The church mentioned by the Lord in this verse is in the universal aspect.
[110]  In the New Testament the first preacher was John the Baptist.
[111]  The first word preached by him was Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near Matt 3:2 .
[112]  When the Lord Jesus began to preach the gospel He said the same thing as John the Baptist: Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near Matt 4:17 .
[113]  The book of Revelation tells us that at the Lord s coming back after His judgment upon the nations, the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of Christ 11:15 .
[114]  The New Jerusalem cannot be a physical city, as commonly believed by Christians, for the following reasons:
[115]  The Bible is a record and a revelation of God s two great works, the first being God s work of the old creation, and the second, God s work of the new creation.
[116]  It is His work of the new creation that will accomplish His divine and eternal economy.
[117]  The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of His two great works; it is the masterpiece of His divine work and the crystallized product of His works of the old creation and the new creation.
[118]  Since the completion of the creation of the old heaven and old earth and everything therein, and since the fall of man, God has used four different dispensations the dispensation of the Patriarchs, the dispensation of law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of righteousness to carry out the work of the new creation in man, who is of the Satan-ruined and God-judged old creation, by the Spirit and life of Himself as the Triune God who has been processed through incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension; by His heavenly ministry after His ascension; and by what He will accomplish in His second coming.
[119]  His work of the new creation through the different dispensations in the old creation and His work of restoration in the short inserted period will have the following results: 1 all the redeemed people of the Old Testament and New Testament will be produced; 2 among the redeemed, a group of overcomers who are perfected and have arrived at the maturity in God s life will be obtained; 3 the overcomers will be constituted the New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom and become the kings in the heavenly part of the millennium; 4 all Israel will be saved and serve as priests in the earthly part of the millennium; 5 at the end of the dispensation of grace, the remainder of the nations will be restored as the citizens in the earthly part of the millennium; 6 the redeemed but immature believers, who are unable to participate in the New Jerusalem of the millennium, will be perfected and become mature in God s life; 7 the nations, having been restored as the people in the millennium, will be purged and be brought into the new earth of the new heaven and new earth as God s people for eternity; 8 as a secondary result, all the creatures who rebel against God will be terminated and cast into the lake of fire; and 9 all the Old Testament and New Testament saints who have been redeemed and perfected and have reached the maturity in God s life will be constituted the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.

[121]  Text I. THE COVENANTS A. The Covenant Which God Made
[122]  In the entire Bible God made eight covenants with man: seven in the Old Testament and one in the New Testament.
[123]  The One who made this covenant was Jehovah God, the One who always is and the mighty One who is faithful.
[124]  The one with whom the covenant was made was the created man who was without God s life and without sin, but who had a spirit and a free will and who was assigned to dress and guard the garden of God.
[125]  God made a covenant with Abraham at six different times, the contents of which mainly included the following items: first, God would make him a great nation, and nations would be made of him and kings would come out of him; second, God would bless him and make his name great; third, God would give the land of Canaan to him and to his seed for an eternal possession; fourth, God would cause Sarah, his wife, to bear a son, would multiply his seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is upon the seashore, and would make him the father of many nations and Sarah, a mother of nations; and fifth, God would give him the promise of grace that all the nations of the earth might be blessed in him and in his seed.
[126]  After the children of Israel entered into the good land of Canaan, and from the time that David became the king and there was peace in the entire nation, David desired to build the holy temple for God.
[127]  God s original intention was to do the work of the new creation on the fallen man of the old creation according to His promised grace.
[128]  However, because the fallen man did not know his weakness and corruption, and therefore did not realize his impotence and his need of God s grace, God temporarily changed the way of His work of the new creation on the fallen man of the old creation.
[129]  That is, He gave the fallen man the law, which was established according to what He is.
[130]  Thus, He initiated another dispensation, the dispensation of law, which extended from Moses to Christ John 10:10; Gal 3:24; Luke 2:25-26, 36-38; 3:15; 7:19; Rom 5:20; Gal 3:19 .
[131]  God s intention in setting up this dispensation of law according to His economy was to accomplish the following things through the law; first, to keep the chosen people in custody that they might satisfy the requirements of the law through the offerings, which typified Christ, and thereby be guarded, as sheep are guarded in the sheepfold; second, to provide the chosen people with a child-conductor that they might be led to Christ, that through the offerings they might be forgiven, and that through the tabernacle and temple they might enjoy God s riches; and third, to cause the chosen people to have the knowledge of sin and of themselves, and thereby realize and sense their need of God s grace.
[132]  The subject of Satan is very negative and we would rather not talk about it.
[133]  However, God talks about it in the Bible and we need to know about it in order to fight against him.
[134]  Matt 16:18; Rev 21:2; Gen 12:1; 1 Cor 5:7;
[135]  I. THE BIBLE A. The Writer s , the Place, and the Time
[136]  Thus far, we have seen that the Bible as a whole is the speaking from God by men borne by the Holy Spirit 2 Pet 1:21 .
[137]  God, with the cooperation of forty writers, authored the Bible.
[138]  It was primarily written in the good land, although certain portions were written in Gentile lands, including Babylon and Rome.
[139]  It took nearly 1,600 years, from 1500 B.C. to A.D. 96, to complete the Bible.
[140]  Genesis brings birth to everything, gives the origin of everything.
[141]  The subject of Leviticus is the redeemed s worship to God and their living of a holy life.
[142]  The events recorded in this book took place between 1491 B.C. and 1451 B.C. Please see this section in Genesis.
[143]  The subject of Deuteronomy is the preparation of God s redeemed people to take the good land.
[144]  He wrote most of this book in Canaan and a smaller portion in the plains of Moab.
[145]  C. The background: The purpose of God s calling was not only to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt, the land of bondage, but also to bring them into Canaan, the land flowing with milk and honey Exo 3:8, 10, 17 . In typology, to bring the children of Israel into the good land signifies the bringing of man into Christ, the all-inclusive One typified by the good land.
[146]  A. The writer s , the place, and the time: The book of Ruth is connected to the preceding book of Judges and the following books of Samuel in history and in time.
[147]  A. The writer s , the place, and the time: The writers were Nathan and Gad.
[148]  It was written in Canaan about events that took place between 1056 B.C. and 1018 B.C.
[149]  This book has been generally ascertained by many authorities to have been written by Ezra If we compare the ending of Chronicles and the beginning of Ezra, we can see that the style, the grammar, and the phrases are all very similar and have to be from the same author.
[150]  Ezra was a descendant of Levi, the tribe of the priests.
[151]  JOB THROUGH THE SONG OF SONGS Scripture Reading Job 1:6-12, 22; 2:3-10; 42:7, 10, 12a; Psa 8; 133; 150;
[152]  Prov 1:1-4; 3:5-6; 4:23; 8:12, 22-36; 9:10; 29:18;
[153]  David wrote most of the psalms; therefore, the Psalms are sometimes called the Psalms of David.
[154]  According to the headings of the psalms, seventy-three psalms were written by David; twelve psalms were written by Asaph; one psalm was written by Heman; and one psalm was written by Ethan.
[155]  Just as David is the most important contributing author of the Psalms, Solomon is the most significant author of Proverbs 1:1; 10:1; 25:1 .
[156]  A. The writer s , the place, and the time: Although this book does not clearly name Solomon as its author, and although many Bible readers attribute its authorship to other people, yet according to the contents of the entire book we can say with certainty that Solomon wrote it.
[157]  A. The writer s , the place, and the time: The Song of Songs was written by Solomon in Israel during his later years and is just as difficult to understand as Proverbs and Ecclesiastes.
[158]  B. The subject: loving the Lord to experience Him as life for the building up of His Body, the bride.
[159]  C. The background: This book follows Ecclesiastes and is in contrast with and supplementary to it.
[160]  Ecclesiastes tells us that if man abandons God and seeks anything under the sun, the result is vanity of vanities, all is vanity.
[161]  Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah the priest, was born in Anathoth Jer 1:1 .
[162]  He was born as a priest and was called to be a prophet in the thirteenth year of King Josiah.
[163]  V. DANIEL A. The Writer s , the Place, and the Time
[164]  This book covers approximately seventy-three years, from 607 B.C. to 534 B.C.
[165]  This book was written in Judah, probably between 870 B.C. and 865 B.C.
[166]  B. The subject: repentance and calling upon the name of the Lord bringing in salvation and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
[167]  A. The writer s , the place, and the time: Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah Micah 1:1 . He was a contemporary of Isaiah, Hosea Isa 1:1; Hosea 1:1 , and possibly Amos.
[168]  His book was written in Judah about 750 B.C. to 710 B.C.
[169]  B. The subject: the forgiveness out of God s love saving His disciplined people by Christ issuing in the restoration of the kingdom.
[170]  A. The writer s , the place, and the time: Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah Zeph 1:1 , was a prince in the royal house of Judah.
[171]  Iddo was one among the first group of priests to return Neh 12:4, 16 ; hence, Zechariah was both a prophet and a priest Zech 7:3-4 , like Jeremiah and Ezekiel.

[224]  Lesson Twenty-Two PRINCIPLES OF INTERPRETATION Scripture Reading Isa 55:11; Matt 4:7; Acts 8:30-31; Rom 10:14-15;
[225]  1 Cor 10:32; Gal 1:7; 1 Tim 1:3-4, 6-7; 6:3-5, 20-21; 4:1-3;
[226]  2 Tim 3:16; 2 Pet 1:20-21; 3:15-17 Outline As literally as possible No literal and spiritual interpretation within the same sentence, verse, or section One portion not sufficient to represent a whole truth Every verse containing all the truths Not sacrificing any portion of the Word All appositional expressions being equal Neither being confined by the background nor ignoring the background Paying attention to the differences in the dispensations Taking care of the difference in the persons being addressed Persons, events, and objects in the Old Testament not clearly referred to as types not to be treated as types but as illustrations Text
[227]  In this chapter we need to see some of the principles in interpreting the Bible.
[228]  If we want to study the Bible, we have to understand the Bible.
[229]  The first principle is to interpret and understand the Bible as literally as possible.
[230]  We have to grasp firmly the fact that when God inspired men to write the Bible, He used words that are fully comprehensible to man.
[231]  When we attempt to understand the Bible today, we must understand the thought of God strictly and accurately according to the letter of the words.
[232]  We should not think that since the Bible is inspired by God, it will always transcend human language, and is therefore open for spiritual interpretation.
[233]  In interpreting the Bible, we have to pay attention to one more thing: one portion of the Word is not sufficient to represent the whole truth.
[234]  There are many expressions in the Bible that are in apposition one to another.
[235]  In expounding the Bible, one has to take care of the persons to whom a word is spoken.
[236]  Lesson Twenty-Three OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD THE BIBLE Scripture Reading Num 23:19; 14:24; Psa 119:11, 103; Prov 30:5;
[237]  2 Cor 1:20; Gal 3:2, 5; Eph 1:13; 4:15-16;
[238]  Heb 4:12; 1 Pet 1:23; 2:2 Outline The need to believe the Bible Accepting the Word of God Agreeing with the Word of God Believing the Word of God Having faith by hearing the Word of God The need to know the truth in the Bible Knowing the interpreted truth Knowing the truth for ourselves Knowing the truth for the church Knowing the truth for the gospel The need to apply the truth of the Bible Applying the truth in our daily Christian life Applying the truth in the church life Text
[239]  After nineteen lessons of seeing how the Bible was written and learning some of the crucial truths in the Bible, we should be very attracted to the Word of God.
[240]  When God says something, it is right; it is established.
[241]  Merely studying and knowing the truth is not enough; we need to apply the truth in our daily Christian life and in the church life.
[242]  Lesson Twenty-Four THE WAY TO ENJOY THE BIBLE
[243]  DWELL IN US RICHLY Scripture Reading Deut 11:18; Psa 119:47, 130; Isa 59:21; Jer 15:16;
[244]  Another simple, spiritual, and most beneficial way to read the Bible is pray-reading.
[245]  We take the Bible text as prayer and pray-read with it.
[246]  Not only do we read and pray simultaneously, or pray and read, read and pray; but also we directly turn the text we are reading into the very words of prayer to pray with.
[247]  Let us suggest a way to use a Life-study Message to study the Bible.
[248]  This is crucial because you need to use your spirit to study the Bible.
[249]  We must see a principle, a fundamental, a law: you must speak if you want to be healthy.
[250]  You will be the most healthy person if you speak unceasingly each day.
[251]  D. Speaking by the Spirit of Faith with Boldness
[252]  The apostle Paul said that we can be filled in spirit by speaking Eph 5:18-19 and by praying Acts 4:31 .
[253]  On the one hand, we get filled to speak.
