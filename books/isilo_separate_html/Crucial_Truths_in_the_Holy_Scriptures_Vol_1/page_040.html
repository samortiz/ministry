<h1 class="title">RECONCILIATION</h1>
<p>Let us now look at the matter of being reconciled to God. According to the original Greek language, to be reconciled to God means that we have a complete change before God. Since we had problems with God, we need to have a thorough change before God. This complete change before God is our reconciliation to God.</p>
<p>The Bible does not tell us that God is reconciled to us but that we are reconciled to Him. Since God never had problems with us, He does not need to be reconciled to us. We were the ones who had problems with Him and who need to be reconciled to Him. In order for us to be reconciled to Him, He did something particular for us in His salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NECESSITY OF BEING RECONCILED TO GOD</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You, though once alienated and enemies in your mind because of your evil works, He now has reconciled&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:21-22; see also Rom. 5:10).</p>
<p>Because of the fall, man is not only far from God but also alienated from Him. He is even an enemy to God in his mind because of his wicked works. Therefore, man not only needs to repent, turn to God, and be forgiven by God, but he also needs to be reconciled to Him.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be. And...cannot please God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:7-8).</p>
<p>Since man is at enmity against God, he is not subject to the law of God; he cannot be subject to the law even if he so desires. When man rebelled against God, he inherited a rebellious nature that keeps him from being subject to the law of God. Man cannot please God. Man is sinful and needs forgiveness. He also cannot be subject to God in order to abide peacefully with God. Consequently, he needs to be reconciled to God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;They did not approve of holding God in their full knowledge&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 1:28).</p>
<p>Man is alienated from God to such an extent that he does not approve of holding God in his knowledge. It is not that man cannot know God; rather, he does not approve of knowing Him. Since man deliberately refuses knowledge of God, sets Him aside, and rejects Him, man needs to be reconciled to Him.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;There is no fear of God before their eyes&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:18).</p>
<p>Since man is at enmity against God in his heart and is unwilling to subject himself to God or approve of knowing God, there is no fear of God before his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Hateful to God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 1:30).</p>
<p>Man not only has no fear of God, but he is even hateful toward Him.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;A blasphemer&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 1:13).</p>
<p>Man not only hates God but he goes a further step to blaspheme God. Hate is an inward feeling, whereas blasphemy involves outward words and actions. Man hates God in his thoughts inwardly and blasphemes God in his words and actions outwardly. He is at enmity with God in his heart, does not approve of Him or agree with Him, and even detests God. He has no fear of God before his eyes, then he hates God in his heart, and ultimately, he blasphemes God. Man truly needs to be reconciled to God.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;The fool has said in his heart, / There is no God&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 14:1).</p>
<p>Man has problems with God to such an extent that he says that there is no God. How much he has forsaken God! How blasphemous!</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;The wicked man...his thoughts are this: There is no God!&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 10:4).</p>
<p>Since man says that there is no God, he thinks and schemes as if there is no God, and he is audacious in his desires, committing all manner of acts to oppose, despise, and deny God.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;There is none who seeks out God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:11).</p>
<p>Since man thinks there is no God, he does not seek God; he remains a godless person, spending his life in a godless existence with a godless living.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;Sons of disobedience...Children of wrath&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:2-3).</p>
<p>Because of the above conditions, man is a son of disobedience before God, rebelling against God and resisting God. He is a child of wrath in God&rsquo;s eyes. The relationship between God and man has fallen to such a state. How man needs to be reconciled to God! How he needs a thorough change before God!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> </body></html>
