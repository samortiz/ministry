   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE CONTENTS OF THE HOME MEETINGS 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The most difficult area with the home meetings is their contents.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the big meetings the main emphasis is on one speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the speaker is rich, the contents of the big meetings are also rich.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But in the home meetings there is no big speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead, those who come together are all small potatoes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What content do these small potatoes have?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you want to see a spiritual giant, you have to go to the largest meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a person were not a spiritual giant, how could he gather an audience of one hundred thousand?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How could he maintain such a meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But as we know, not everyone can be a spiritual giant, just as not everyone can be the president of a country.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the human realm, not everyone can be the principal of a school or even a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not easy to find one among ten who can really teach well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the spiritual realm, there are many who are saved, tens of thousands, but they are all small potatoes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One can only find a few spiritual giants.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In general, there are more small potatoes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH DEPENDING</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>UPON THE ORDINARY BROTHERS AND SISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let us now look at this matter from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the day of Pentecost three thousand people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On another day five thousand were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They all were filled with the Holy Spirit, meeting from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Were there many spiritual giants among those few thousand?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the record in Acts, we see a man called Stephen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Acts 7 there is a long message given by him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then there was the evangelist, Philip, who had the experience of being caught away.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, in the Bible we cannot find one gospel message preached by him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Acts there is also a record of one named Barnabas.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But again in the Bible we cannot find a record of his preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After these three, we cannot find any other names.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there were outstanding ones among those eight thousand, they would not have been omitted by Luke, the author of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The preaching of Peter, message after message, is recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even the lengthy messages of Paul are recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From this we can see that at that time, besides Stephen, Philip, and Barnabas, the believers were all more or less at the same level.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They were all small potatoes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By reading the Bible in this way, we discover that what the Bible does not record is more meaningful than what is recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first time Paul went out to preach, he went out with Barnabas.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But Barnabas did not preach.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever there was the occasion to preach, it was Paul who spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the Bible there are prophets and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet the prophets and teachers are not necessarily spiritual giants.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If Barnabas were an outstanding preacher, then Luke certainly would have recorded that fact.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Probably the preaching of Timothy was also average, for among the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, not one was written by Barnabas or Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only Paul was a real spiritual giant.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Among the twenty-seven books, he alone wrote fourteen of them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here I want to point out to you all that for the church to be built up, it must be general, and it must depend on the small potatoes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE CHURCH BEING GOD S FARM,</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>WITH EVERYONE GROWING TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The strength or weakness of a local church does not depend on spiritual giants, but on each small brother or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible likens the church to a cultivated field, the farm of God 1 Cor 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A field planted with grains of wheat will be full of golden grain at harvest time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The field will be all even, just as if it had been cut by a barber.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There will be no exceptionally high ones, nor any exceptionally low ones, but all will be the same height.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church is God s growing crop.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The normal ones are all on the same level.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is the extraordinary ones who are abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But our view is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we go to visit the churches, we always look at the few outstanding ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If there are a few outstanding ones in a certain church, that church appears promising to us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Based on my fifty years of observation and from my experience, I know that wherever there are outstanding ones, eventually that local church will have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those local churches with ordinary believers are the ones which go on steadily.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those churches which depend upon able speakers are in a good condition for a short time, like the blossoming of the night-blooming flower, which does not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Their good condition does not last because the spiritual giant does not live very long.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Moses said that the days of our lives are eighty years if we are strong.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even if a man lives to be eighty, the span of his life is only a handbreadth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After the spiritual giant has passed away, it is all over.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But with the small potatoes, one generation follows another.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Those born of the small potatoes are all small potatoes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They go on for generations.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Paul has passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In these two thousand years, many would have liked to listen to Paul s preaching, but he passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is not a second Paul on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Yet there are many small potatoes.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Those whom the Lord has saved on the earth are all small potatoes.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God has no intention to use spiritual giants to build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In Ephesians 4 there are apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers v. 11 . But they are not the ones who build the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Those who build the church directly are all small potatoes, which are all the members v. 16 . All the members of the Body hold Christ in love and grow because of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Those apostles, prophets, and gifted persons do not build the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They can only be counted as middlemen.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>For a local church to be built up, it must rely on a group of ordinary people.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They are all average persons with nothing outstanding about them.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The more ordinary the saints are, the more normal the church will be, and the longer its good spiritual condition will last.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The principle in the Bible is that God uses gifted persons to save people.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Then, after the people are brought in, God uses all the saints to build the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Therefore the Bible speaks of the meetings that are from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The church must have home meetings.</S>
