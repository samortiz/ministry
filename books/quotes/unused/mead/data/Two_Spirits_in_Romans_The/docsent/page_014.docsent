   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN WALKING ACCORDING TO THE MINGLED SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:4 THE PRACTICALITY AND CENTRALITY OF ROMANS 8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 8 is real, practical, and subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is a test to prove how real God is and how faithful we are.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To speak of God far away in the heavens is not subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, Romans 8 speaks of God in a very subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It tells us that God today is the Spirit, and as the Spirit He is real, practical, and subjective to us because He indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 8 calls this indwelling One the Spirit, the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because Romans 8 speaks of God as the indwelling Spirit, everything it reveals is practical and should be tested in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 8 is central in the Bible and in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God existed in eternity past without any beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When He created the universe, He came out of eternity and began to travel in time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first stage of God s journey was His work of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Creation is a great thing, for without God s creation, the universe with the heavens, the earth, the billions of created things, and man would not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After creation the next major stage that God passed through was incarnation, in which He entered into man and became one with man by becoming a man Matt 1:23; John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Incarnation is even greater than creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years as a lowly man named Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He experienced all the sufferings of human life, including hunger, thirst, and sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then He was crucified, dying an all-inclusive death to redeem us, terminate the old creation, and solve all the problems between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After three days He came out of death and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The death and resurrection of Christ are the main contents of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From resurrection Christ entered into a further, exalted stage ascension in which He was glorified and enthroned as the Lord of all and Head over all things Rom 10:12; Eph 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Romans 8 Christ is the Spirit because He became a life-giving Spirit in resurrection 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today God is still traveling on.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Romans 12 we see the Body of Christ, which is the fullness of God, the new man, and the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All these things issue from our experience of Christ as the Spirit in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, the Body will become the bride, and in eternity future, the New Jerusalem, the ultimate union of God and man Rev 21:2, 9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is where God will end His journey.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, without Romans 8 there is a great gap in this journey.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, Romans 8 is a central and crucial focus in the Bible and in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE TWO SPIRITS IN ROMANS 8 The All-inclusive Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 8 mainly covers two profound items the divine Spirit and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 2 reveals that the Spirit is the Spirit of life and possesses a law, an automatic power, that functions within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 9 calls the Spirit the Spirit of God, which means the Spirit of the One who existed from eternity past, made an eternal plan, and created the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because it was God who took the initiative to create the universe, He is the origin, the Originator, and the origination.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 9 the Spirit is also called the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is God s anointed One, God s appointed One, and God incarnated to be a man in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He passed through human living, an all-inclusive death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After the old creation was terminated in Christ s crucifixion, the new creation was germinated with a new life in His resurrection 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Next Christ ascended to the heavens, where He was crowned with glory and enthroned as the Lord and Head of the universe Heb 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then Christ descended as the Spirit into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Romans 8 reveals that this indwelling Spirit is the Spirit of life with the divine life and an automatic law, the Spirit of God with all the contents of God s being and work, the Spirit of Christ with all Christ s being and accomplishments, and the resurrecting Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>2, 9, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Resurrecting Work of the Spirit in Us</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The life-giving Spirit is all-inclusive, yet His goal is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The life-giving Spirit in our spirit is doing a resurrecting work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His goal is to resurrect every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to see a vision of the resurrecting work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Soon after we were saved, we may have told ourselves, In the past I was a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I did not treat my family or others well.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now that I am saved, I make up my mind to be a good person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I will try my best to improve my behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is altogether wrong and in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The thought that God wants us to improve our behavior is a religious misconception.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s intention is to resurrect us by infusing His divine life into every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Wherever God s divine life spreads in our being, there is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Regeneration is the first step of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before we were saved, our spirit was deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we believed in the Lord and called on His name, God s life was imparted into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, our deadened spirit was resurrected by and with the divine life of God v. 10 . From our spirit God intends to impart His life into every part of our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When God s life is imparted into our mind, our mind will be resurrected, and we will have a renewed mind v. 6 . A renewed spirit is a regenerated spirit; a renewed mind is a transformed mind 12:2 . Transformation is a part of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God also imparts His life into our will and emotion to make them new.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is also part of the Spirit s resurrecting work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God s intention is to eventually impart life into our mortal body to resurrect our body 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The work of the Spirit in Romans 8 is to resurrect us by imparting the divine life into every part of our being.</S>
