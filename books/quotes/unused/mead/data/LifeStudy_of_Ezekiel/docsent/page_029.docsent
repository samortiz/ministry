   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ISSUE OF COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At this point we need to consider the issue, the result, of the coordination of the four living creatures the burning coals and the burning torches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all need to bear the likeness of living creatures, the likeness of a man, and the likeness of burning coals and burning torches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Becoming Burning Coals</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ezekiel 1:13 says, As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here we see that the result of the coordination of the living creatures is that they become burning coals.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is a fire among them and within them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because they are coordinated ones, God comes in as fire, and each of them becomes a burning coal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How can we know whether or not there is the proper coordination in a particular local church?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We know this by the presence of the burning coals.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there are no burning coals in a certain church, there is no coordination there.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Where there is coordination, there will surely be the burning coals.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the coordination we burn one another.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You burn me, and I burn you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, if we are isolated from the saints and do not attend the meetings, we will not be burning coals.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead, we will be cold, black coals.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The spiritual principle is that we burn one another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From experience we can testify that the more we coordinate together, the more we burn one another.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The issue, the result, of coordination is that we all become burning coals.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Burning Out the Negative Things</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The burning of the coals does at least three things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First, it burns out everything that is negative.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If something is put upon a heap of burning coals, that thing will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there is proper coordination in the church, there will be a burning to burn away such things as worldliness, the flesh, self-aims, self-goals, pride, opinions, and boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All kinds of negative things will be burned away by the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anything that does not correspond to God and to the nature of God will be burned out by the sanctifying and purifying fire of the burning coals, and only what is of God will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the proper condition of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Making Us Fervent</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Second, the burning of the coordination will make us fervent, intensely hot.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead of coldness and lukewarmness, everyone will be burned and burning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When others come to the church, they will realize that they cannot stay unless they are willing to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Coordination brings in a real burning, a genuine fervency.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This burning will not allow you to be like the church in Laodicea, which was lukewarm, having no fervency, no burning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Producing Power</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Third, the burning in the coordination produces the power and impact of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The impact in a local church comes out of the burning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This power is internal and mysterious because it comes from the burning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you want to have impact, you must be coordinated, and in this coordination you will become burning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then out of this burning will be the impact and the power.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The negative things will be consumed, you will be set on fire, and you will have power and impact.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Becoming Burning Torches</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The four living creatures look not only like burning coals but also like burning torches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whereas the coals are for burning, the torches are for enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From the proper coordination in a local church, there will not only be burning but also enlightening and shining.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a church is normal in its condition, it will be full of burning coals and enlightening torches.</S>
