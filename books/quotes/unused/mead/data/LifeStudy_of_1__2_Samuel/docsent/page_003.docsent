   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>For this life-study of 1 and 2 Samuel, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see what is revealed in these two books.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 and 2 Samuel there are four main persons Eli, Samuel, Saul, and David and at this point I would like to say a brief word about each of them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The crucial matters regarding these persons may be expressed in the following four statements, which are extracts of 1 and 2 Samuel:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1.Eli's failure in the people's degradation brought in the waning of the stale priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2.Samuel's ministry in the Nazarite vow ended the judgeship and brought in the priesthood for God's oracle and the kingship for God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>3.Saul's fleshly life insulted the kingship in the divine government and caused him to lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>4.David's godly life secured the kingship in God's economy, and his indulgence contaminated the kingship of God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the beginning of 1 Samuel, there is a picture of Eli's failure.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This failure took place in the degradation of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eli was a priest who brought in the waning of the stale priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Samuel's ministry brought in the prophethood for God's oracle and the kingship for God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The priesthood ordained by God was supposed to do two things: to speak the word of God and to carry out God's administration, His governmental dealing with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, on the one hand, the priests were God's spokesmen and, on the other hand, they were God's representatives.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They spoke the things of God, and they represented God in His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because the priesthood at the time of Eli was stale and was waning, Samuel was raised up to replace the stale and waning priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Samuel did not have a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, he had a ministry in the Nazarite vow that ended the judgeship and brought in the prophethood for God's speaking, for God's oracle, and also brought in the kingship for God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although it may be difficult for us to understand Samuel, it is easy for us to understand Saul because he and we are sick with the same disease.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Saul's life was fleshly, and our life also is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No matter what our nationality may be, we all are Sauls.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Saul's fleshly life insulted, offended, the kingship in the divine government and caused him to lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He brought shame upon God's kingship in the divine government.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In a sense, many believers have done the same thing and have lost their kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>David is a contrast to Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whereas Saul's life was fleshly, David's life was godly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word fleshly denotes the fallen man, and the word godly refers to one who is with God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Saul's fleshly life caused him to lose the kingship, but David's godly life secured the kingship in the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, David's indulgence in lust contaminated and damaged the kingship of God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although David did not lose the kingship wholly, he lost a very large part of it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only one tribe, Judah, was left for him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let us now go on to consider several other introductory matters.</S>
