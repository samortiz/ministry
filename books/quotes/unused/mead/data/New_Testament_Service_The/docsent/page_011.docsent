   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR NEW TESTAMENT SERVICE TWELVE YEARS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AFTER THE BIRTH OF JESUS Scripture Reading: Luke 3:23; 2:39b, 42-43, 46, 48-49; John 2:3-4; 19:26-27; 1:45-46; 7:41-42; Matt 13:55-57a; 12:46-50; 2 Cor 5:16; Isa 53:2-3; Num 27:8; 1 Chron 3:5; Jer 22:28-30</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The New Testament service is simply to bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the beginning of the New Testament, there is the wonderful case of Mary and Joseph, showing us that the matter of bringing forth Christ can only be accomplished through coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE GENEALOGY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The genealogy of Christ is a record showing us how Christ is brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The coordination to accomplish the bringing forth of Christ can be seen in the two genealogies of Christ, one in Matthew and the other in Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These two genealogies, however, are different.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How could one person have two different genealogies?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This seems impossible, but our Lord Jesus Christ is a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has two genealogies because one is of Joseph, and the other is of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These two sides coordinate together to bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Concerning these two genealogies, Bible teachers have varying opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, there is no doubt that one of these genealogies is of Joseph, and the other of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because of all the prophecies concerning the birth of Christ, many matters are involved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, genealogies on both sides are required to fulfill all the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>ACCORDING TO LAW</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not easy to understand these two genealogies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do have an expository note written on the first seventeen verses of Matthew 1, published in Chinese in 1936.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a booklet of thirty-four pages on the genealogy in those verses, pointing out that the genealogy in Luke is no doubt that of Mary s father and has something to do with Numbers 27.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This chapter tells us that according to the law, when an Israelite dies without a son, his daughter becomes the heir.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then, after the daughter marries, according to law, her husband becomes the legal heir of her father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is really the son-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Luke 3:23 tells us that Jesus was the son of Joseph, as was supposed KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, the phrase as was supposed is not a proper translation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Greek word here means according to law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Concordant Literal Translation translates Luke 3:23 in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As far as I know, this is the only translation that translates this phrase properly, and it even refers to Numbers 27:8.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even this law given by Moses was a preparation for the birth of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we read the record of the genealogy in Luke, we see that it starts with God and ends with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God eventually becomes incarnated as Jesus through the means of all these people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When God can get through the proper human beings, He becomes incarnated as Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jesus is God incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is Emmanuel, God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the incarnated God, God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Jesus, there is God as well as man, and man as well as God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Matthew s genealogy begins with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Genesis 22:18a God promised that Christ would be the seed of Abraham through whom the earth will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This promise is fulfilled in Galatians 3:16 and 14.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Following Abraham, there are Isaac, Jacob, and Judah, and eventually, Jesse, and David.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is after David in the genealogy that there are many complications.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Matthew s genealogy follows the line of one of David s sons, but Luke follows that of another.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First Chronicles 3:5 tells us that Nathan and Solomon were born of the same parents, David and Bathsheba.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Bathsheba had four sons by David: Nathan was the third, and Solomon was the fourth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The genealogy in Matthew follows the line of Solomon to Christ, whereas the one in Luke follows the line of Nathan to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the line of Nathan, the genealogy in Luke eventually comes to Heli, who was Mary s father and Joseph s father-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Luke 3:23 says that Joseph was the son of Heli, as was supposed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that he was reckoned his son according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It may have been that Heli died without a son, and therefore his daughter s husband, Joseph, became his son according to law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Actually Joseph was a son in life to Jacob who was a descendant of Solomon, as recorded in Matthew 1:16, 7 .</S>
