[1]  The Nature of the New Way and the Universal Priesthood
[2]  THE UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:5; John 3:22-30; Rom 1:9; 15:16; Col 1:27-29 OUTLINE John the Baptist: Rejecting the Old Testament priesthood.
[3]  In the New Testament, we see in 1 Peter 2 that you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession v. 9 . Revelation chapter one also says clearly that He loves us and has loosed us from our sins by His blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father vv.
[4]  The Lord Jesus gave two examples in Luke 14: For which of you, wanting to build a tower, will not first sit down and calculate the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? v. 28 . Or what king, going to engage another king in war, will not first sit down and deliberate...? v. 31 . Both of these examples show that a Christian s life is one that should be planned.
[5]  If everyone would be busy preaching the gospel, and if after the babies are born, everyone would be busy nourishing them, and if after they are nourished, every one of them would be grouped into the small group meetings, and if those who have received light, experience, and revelation from the Lord s word would prophesy in the district meetings to build up the church, I believe in one to two years time, a good foundation will be laid.
[6]  Every mother knows that the first thing a newborn child does is drink milk.
[7]  In the past our way has been to invite people to come to the meeting in the meeting hall on the Lord s Day morning immediately after we baptize them.
[8]  We all know that it is easy to beget a child.
[9]  It is not too difficult to raise him up either.
[10]  God s eternal purpose is to have the Body of Christ, and the steps to arrive at this purpose are the begetting through the preaching of the gospel, our nourishing through the home meetings, our teaching through the small group meetings, and our building up through the church meetings.
[11]  It matches what God wants to accomplish in Himself.
[12]  THE UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD OF THE NEW TESTAMENT Everyone Preaching the Gospel
[13]  The priesthood that God ordained for everyone is one in which all the saved ones are priests.
[14]  Moreover, the foremost offering in the New Testament is the offering of the saved sinners to God.
[15]  For this reason, after the coming of the New Testament age, God revealed to the last priest of the Old Testament, John the Baptist, that he was not to offer up bulls and goats anymore.
[16]  The Lord sent us to all the nations to preach the gospel to every man, baptizing them into Himself, and offering them up as sacrifices to God.
[17]  CHAPTER FOUR THE NEW WAY AND THE SERVICE AND
[18]  Those in the New Testament worshipping the God in Christ who is the God-man Phil 3:3.
[19]  Christ is the seed of woman bruising the serpent s head.
[20]  He is also the seed of Abraham accomplishing God s redemption and bestowing the blessing of God s redemption, the all-inclusive Spirit of the Triune God, to everyone who believes and is saved Gal 3:14 .
[21]  Furthermore, this Spirit, which is the all-inclusive Spirit, is the unique blessing in God s redemption.
[22]  In Luke chapter fifteen, the Lord speaks to us in a parable: What man of you, having a hundred sheep and having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one which is lost until he finds it? v. 4 . When the sheep is found, the angels in heaven rejoice over it v. 7 . This is what is described in Hymns, #1068: While angels in His presence sang until the courts of heaven rang stanza 1 . If a sinner is not a treasure, why do the angels rejoice when he is saved? The writer of this hymn knew the heart of God and wrote accurately.
[23]  WORSHIP IN THE NEW TESTAMENT The Old Testament Worship
[24]  When the Lord Jesus was on earth, one day He intended to go from Jerusalem to Galilee.
[25]  If our meetings and gospel preaching are all by one man speaking while all listen, we are not according to God s New Testament economy, and not all the saints will be able to be priests of the gospel.
[26]  Before we attend a meeting, we are a worshipper of God already.
[27]  Every morning we have a revival, and every day, in our daily living, we are constantly renewed and overcoming and are in constant touch and fellowship with the Lord.
[28]  IN THE NEW TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:8-10, 58 THE NEW WAY REQUIRING
[29]  For this reason, we have to learn to remain in resurrection so that we can speak for God and speak forth God.
[30]  To preach the gospel according to the way ordained in the New Testament, we have to contact and visit people directly in order that they may be saved from their environment and that we may offer them up to God as sacrifices.
[31]  The new way today is not a term that we have invented.
[32]  Through His blood, He has brought us before God that we might become a new creation to take the new way.
[33]  Because the light from the Lord has become stronger recently and because we have seen that gospel preaching in which one speaks and all listen is contrary to the nature of the new creation in the New Testament, we are reluctant to return to the old way.
[34]  The New Testament priesthood is universal; it is not just for a minority of people.
[35]  This means that every saved person is a priest.
[36]  Although in the past we were in one accord to arouse the whole church to preach the gospel, most of the brothers and sisters were not priests of the gospel.
[37]  Our big gospel meetings in the past with their numbers of responses and baptisms were quite impressive.
[38]  But as far as the nature of the New Testament is concerned, they have killed the function of most of the saints.
[39]  In principle, this is an offense to the Lord because it has fully annulled God s New Testament economy.
[40]  We need a thorough repentance, and we need to drop all the ways that are not according to God s New Testament economy.
[41]  They should be priests of God s gospel directly, offering up the gospel sacrifices, which are the saved sinners.
[42]  OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 4:15; Rom 15:16; John 21:15; 1 Thes 2:7; 1 Pet 2:2; Rom 12:1; 1 Thes 2:11; Eph 4:12-13; Col 1:28; 1 Cor 14:23, 3-5 OUTLINE Begetting in Christ Jesus begetting others through the gospel and offering them to God as sacrifices 1 Cor 4:15; Rom 15:16.
[43]  Nourishing feeding the Lord s sheep as a nurse would cherish her own children, causing them to grow through the milk of the word, and helping them to present themselves as living sacrifices to God John 21:15; 1 Thes 2:7; 1 Pet 2:2; Rom 12:1.
[44]  Teaching entreating and consoling them as a father his own children; perfecting them for the building up of the Body of Christ, until they all arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, and presenting as an offering every man full-grown in Christ 1 Thes 2:11; Eph 4:12-13; Col 1:28.
[45]  I would like to begin this way: throughout the last two thousand years, the way Christians should meet, preach the gospel, serve God, and work for God has been a matter of great debate in Christianity.
[46]  THE WRONG WAY BEING OPPOSED TO GOD S ECONOMY
[47]  For this reason, in the light of the revelation of the Bible, we must consider the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the prophesying in the district meetings as practiced among us in the past year.
[48]  We must check to see if they are being carried out according to the sanctified way revealed by God or if they are being done according to man s natural ways.
[49]  In these end times, the Lord must bring His children absolutely back to the Bible in matters such as meeting, gospel preaching, service to God, and working for God.
[50]  The new way that the Lord has shown us is not according to man s natural way because the natural way will not accomplish God s desire but will only annul the function of speaking for the Lord.
[51]  OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Matt 3:1-6; Acts 9:32; 1 Tim 1:16; Rom 15:16; 12:1-2; Col 1:28-29; Rev 1:5b-6; 5:9-10; 1 Pet 2:9, 5; Luke 10:1-6; John 15:16 OUTLINE The turn from the Old Testament priests to the New Testament priests: The turn in John the Baptist: Though he can be considered the last priest of the Old Testament, he rejected that priesthood and turned away from being such a priest Matt 3:1-4.
[52]  He turned to become the first priest of the gospel in the New Testament: He did not offer bulls and goats as offerings.
[53]  With all believers as the components of God s New Testament priesthood of the gospel Rev 1:5b-6; 5:9-10: It being a universal priesthood, and not a priesthood of a few people.
[54]  It being for the preaching of the gospel, the telling out of the virtues of God s salvation, saving people to offer them to God as spiritual sacrifices 1 Pet 2:9, 5.
[55]  The way for the New Testament priests of the gospel to fulfill their duty: As a New Testament priest of the gospel, every believer must personally preach the gospel by visiting people through knocking on doors, saving sinners and offering them up to God as offerings Luke 10:1-6.
[56]  It was not until March of this year, while I fellowshipped with the elders in Taipei, that the Holy Spirit enlightened me to see what Paul said in Romans 15:16 concerning being a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God.
[57]  Revelation 5 says, For You were slain and did purchase to God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and made them to our God a kingdom and priests vv.
[58]  In other words, the sacrifices presented to God by the New Testament priests are the Christ that is offered up, that is, the Christ experienced by us and brought and offered up to God.
[59]  The second step was for Paul to meet in the homes of the newly saved believers.
[60]  Then, in chapter twelve, in verses 4 and 5, he said that as there are many members in one body, and all the members do not have the same function, so also we all are one Body in Christ, and severally members one of another.
[61]  He brought the gospel with him and visited the sinners by knocking on their doors, pleading with them to receive the gospel.
[62]  Once a sinner receives the gospel, angels in God s presence sing until the courts of heaven ring.
[63]  AND SAVING THE SINNERS Scripture Reading: John 21:15; 15:16; 1 Thes 2:7; Heb 10:24-25; 1 Thes 2:11; Acts 20:20, 27, 31; Col 1:28-29; Eph 4:11-12; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 26, 31 OUTLINE Meeting with the new believers in their homes: Feeding them as the Lord s lambs that our fruit may remain John 21:15; 15:16.
[64]  In the New Testament God ordains that every believer should be a priest of the gospel.
[65]  Moreover, the service of the gospel priest is a priesthood.
[66]  Paul said that as a priest of the gospel, he offered up the nations to God as offerings, which are the sinners saved through his gospel.
[67]  There have been over sixty years of history among us.
[68]  When you preach the gospel you beget as a father.
[69]  First, lead the new ones to know the four aspects of the Lord: to know Him as God Rom 9:5 , to know Him as Man 1 Tim 2:5 , to know Him as the Savior, as well as the Redeemer Luke 2:11 , and to know Him as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .
[70]  The small group meeting is different from the home meeting.
[71]  to Do the Work of the New Testament Ministry, Which Is to Build Up the Organic Body of Christ
[72]  All of you have to learn to teach the saints.
[73]  This does not mean teaching them in the meeting, but teaching them one by one in the homes during your visitation.
[74]  The preaching of the gospel by the priests of the gospel to gain sinners for an offering to God, their caring for and nourishing of the new ones, their leading them to grow in life and to present themselves living sacrifices to God, their perfecting of the saints by teaching them in all wisdom, and their presenting them full-grown in Christ to God, are all done for this one goal.
[75]  CHAPTER NINE THE RECOVERY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Col 1:28-29; Rom 12:11; 1 Cor 15:58
[76]  Prayer: Lord, for the accomplishment of Your economy, You need us.
[77]  But for us to fulfill it, we need You all the more.
[78]  IN THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST
[79]  The light which the Lord has shown us concerning the way revealed in the New Testament for believers to meet and serve can be divided into the following four major steps.
[80]  First, you must personally go out to visit people, to preach the gospel to bring them to salvation, and to bring these sinners as offerings to God.
[81]  IN HIS RECOVERY CRUCIAL POINTS CONCERNING THE LIGHT AND REVELATION RECEIVED FROM THE LORD
[82]  IN THE LAST FOUR AND A HALF YEARS REGARDING THE WAY TO MEET
[83]  AND TO SERVE Scripture Reading: Luke 10:1-6; Heb 10:24-25; Eph 4:11-12; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 31, 39; Eph 1:3-14, 19-23; 4:16, 4a, 30, 12; Rev 1:5b-6; 5:9-10; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; Rom 15:16 OUTLINE Preaching the gospel and saving people by visitation Luke 10:1-6.
[84]  Teaching and perfecting the saints through the small group meetings unto the New Testament work of ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ Heb 10:24-25; Eph 4:11-12: In the small group meetings, the believers having mutual fellowship and intercession, mutual care and shepherding, mutual teaching and studying of the truth, and mutual instruction in the pursuit of the growth in the spiritual life, for the promotion of the preaching of the gospel, the care for the new ones, the conducting of the small group meetings, and all other kinds of service in the church life.
[85]  Leading the saints to pursue and desire after prophesying in the church meetings, speaking for the Lord, speaking forth the Lord, supplying the Lord to others, and speaking and listening to one another in mutuality for the building up of the saints and the church 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5: This kind of prophesying being what every believer can and should do 1 Cor 14:31, 24.
[86]  The church is an organism as a mingling of God and man produced by the processed Triune God in His divine Trinity Eph 1:3-14, 19-23: This organism is constituted organically rather than organizationally Eph 1:23.
[87]  The gospel preaching which depends on the speaking of one or two, though able to save sinners, kills the universal priesthood of the gospel which makes all the believers priests of the gospel in preaching the gospel individually, changing the nature of the universal gospel priesthood of all the believers to that of the exclusive gospel priesthood of a few believers, thus opposing God s New Testament economy, and killing the spiritual function of all the believers as priests of the gospel.
[88]  Whether it be in the small group meeting, in the prophesying in the church meetings, in the preaching of the gospel by visiting people, or in the care for the new ones, the principle is the same, we must make all the saints the members of the Body of Christ, with everyone working, everyone functioning according to his measure, for the building up of the organic Body of Christ.
[89]  My burden today is to fellowship with you concerning our experience and the achievements which the Lord has given us during the past four and a half years.
[90]  We know that we began speaking of the new way here in Taipei in October 1984.
[91]  THE FOUR VISIONS WE HAVE SEEN The Church Is an Organism
[92]  In 1984, I went back to Taiwan to introduce the new way.
[93]  The first vision that the Lord has shown us is that the church is an organism produced by the processed Triune God.
[94]  A priest of the New Testament is a priest of the gospel.
[95]  All New Testament believers should be like him, going out to preach the gospel that calls for repentance, baptizing the believing ones, and offering them up in Christ to God.
[96]  Although many famous preachers can conduct gospel campaigns and save sinners, their way is contrary to God s New Testament economy and kills the spiritual function of the believers as priests of the gospel.
[97]  The revelation is open to us today in order to show us that the preaching of the gospel should arrive at God s goal and complete God s economy.
[98]  AND EXPOSING SATAN S EVIL INTENT, DECEPTION, AND CONFUSION Scripture Reading: 1 John 4:15; Phil 2:13; Rom 12:5; Eph 1:23; 3:19b; Rom 15:16; John 21:15; 1 Thes 2:7; 1 Pet 2:2; Rom 12:1; Eph 4:12; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5 OUTLINE Realizing God s desire, plan, and economy: God s desire is to work Himself into man to be man s life and everything 1 John 4:15; Phil 2:13.
[99]  God s plan is for the men who have His life and who are joined to Him organically: To be the organic members of Christ the embodiment of the Triune God Rom 12:5.
[100]  To be the Body of Christ as God s fullness in Christ to express Him Eph 1:23; 3:19b.
[101]  God s economy is an arrangement whereby every one of the many members of Christ is God s priest of the gospel Rom 15:16: Personally preaching the gospel to save sinners and to offer them to God as offerings Rom 15:16.
[102]  Nourishing and cherishing the new believers, helping them to grow in the spiritual life, so that they would offer themselves up to God as living sacrifices John 21:15; 1 Thes 2:7; 1 Pet 2:2; Rom 12:1.
[103]  The perfected saints as prophets speaking for the Lord, supplying Christ, building the church, completing God s New Testament economy, and fulfilling God s eternal plan for the satisfaction of God s desire in eternity 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5.
[104]  In contrast to this, Satan also has an evil intent which is to damage.
[105]  God has a plan, and Satan in contrast has a deception which is to frustrate.
[106]  Hence, on the one hand, we have to realize God s desire, plan, and economy.
[107]  Mostly it tells people that man is sinful, that God is righteous, and that the Lord Jesus has died on our behalf according to the righteousness of God.
[108]  The word economy is an appropriate translation 1 Tim 1:4b .
[109]  Hence, no matter how much you feel you are unable to preach the gospel, God has made such an arrangement.
[110]  Actually, as long as you are a regenerated person, having God s life within, your ability to preach the gospel is there by birth, just as a person s speaking ability is there by birth.
[111]  God desires that we preach the gospel to save sinners, offering them up as sacrifices.
[112]  Paul said in Romans 15:16 that he was a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.
[113]  Verses 5 and 9 of 1 Peter 2 also say that we are built up into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ....But you are...a royal priesthood...so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.
[114]  These few passages show us that we are a holy priesthood and that each one of us is a priest of the gospel for the telling out of the virtues of God s salvation and for the offering up of the nations as acceptable sacrifices to God.
[115]  Satan s deception is to kill the organic function of the members of Christ through religious service, to replace the church as the organism of the Triune God through religious organization, and to counterfeit the Body of Christ as the fullness and expression of the Triune God through religious association.
[116]  The service in Christianity today is almost entirely religious.
[117]  Satan s confusion comes, first, by his using a few specially gifted ones to preach the gospel, thereby despising the function of every believer as a component of God s priesthood of the gospel.
