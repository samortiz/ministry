In this age God is taking the quick way, the way of recovery. The least He can ask of the church is for the entire Body to rise up, migrate, and spread the gospel. Whether or not God can get through depends on us. God's servant has released His speaking and His light, and the brothers and sisters have sensed this inner urge and need within them. But nothing will happen without our cooperation. Hence, the first thing that we have to do is hand ourselves over. Our very person as well as our possessions have to be offered up to answer God's call.</p><p>Handing over is not something that just involves material offerings; it does not refer just to money. It refers to our very person. If every brother and sister hands himself or herself over and coordinates together as a Body, there will be no problem with our training. I was not too clear about this matter of coordination and training back in 1940-43. Today I see this clearly; we need coordination in everything and in every aspect. We need training in everything and in every area. Last night when I arrived, I sat at the back. I realized that there must be coordination not only in the preaching of the gospel and in consecration, but even in the choice of our occupation. To hand ourselves over means that we hand ourselves and our possessions over to meet God's demand on the one hand and that we give ourselves to the church, accept the arrangement of the church, and give ourselves to coordination and training on the other hand.</p><h2 class="head2">Accepting the Arrangements of the Church<br />and Offering Ourselves to Be Trained</h2><p>In the past it seems that we put too much so-called "trust" in the Holy Spirit and not enough trust in the church. In the past we always said that we would leave it to the Holy Spirit to do the work. Today we are not telling the saints to no longer trust in the leading of the Spirit; rather, we are telling the saints to trust in the leading of the Body. During the past ten or more years, we have witnessed so many questionable so-called leadings of the Spirit. Today it is more sure to give ourselves to the Body and to receive the leading of the Body.</p><p>Once we hand ourselves over, we will realize that we need training in everything and in every aspect. We need training even in the way we conduct our prayer meeting. In the beginning we may come together to pray, but in the end, we may find ourselves criticizing each other. One may say that someone is too wordy. Another may say that the first one is too much in the mind. Still a third may say that others are not addressing God in the right way, etc. Once we hand ourselves over, the self has to go. No one whose self is intact can coordinate and serve in the church life. If the self remains, it is hard to have the whole Body rise up to serve. We all have to learn to take the breaking which the Lord applies to the self through the church. Many of us have been seeking and struggling to break the self for many years but have not been successful. The self is still not broken. Once we place ourselves in the church and take the dealings from the Body, we will get through easily; the self will go away effortlessly. We will not only be properly equipped in function, but we will be practically perfected in our spiritual life. We should never recoil from offering or giving ourselves to the training through fear of making mistakes. If we make a mistake it will only be a mistake in our behavior; in our spirit we will still be perfected. I hope we all will give ourselves to be trained, to be dealt with, and to learn the lessons.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 62: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (2) &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
