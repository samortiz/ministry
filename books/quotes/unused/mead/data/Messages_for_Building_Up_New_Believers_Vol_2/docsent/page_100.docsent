   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Helping Children to Have Proper Aspirations</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The biggest thing about a child is his aspirations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every child has an aspiration when he is young.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the government allowed every child to print his business card, I think many children would print President, Chairman, or Queen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Parents must help their children to have proper aspirations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you love the world, your children will probably want to be the president, a millionaire, or a great academic.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How you live affects the aspirations of your child.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Parents must learn to channel the ambitions of their children in the proper direction.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They should aspire to be a lover of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They should not aspire to love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You should cultivate such an ambition within them while they are young.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Show them that it is an honorable thing to die for the Lord, that it is a precious thing to be a martyr for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have to be an example to them, and you have to tell them your ambitions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Tell them what you want to be if you are given the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Tell them what kind of Christian you want to be.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way, you will channel their ambitions in the proper direction.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their goals will change, and they will know what is noble and what is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not Encouraging the Pride of Children</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Children have another problem: They are not only ambitious and aspiring but also proud of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They may boast about their own cleverness, skill, or eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A child can find many things to boast about.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He may think that he is a very special person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Parents should not discourage them, but neither should they cultivate their pride.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many parents cultivate their children s pride and encourage them to go after vainglory by heaping praises upon them in front of other people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should tell them, There are many children who are like you in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not try to encourage their pride.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should enlighten children according to the discipline and admonition of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They should be able to think, to speak, and to learn all the skills.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But you have to tell them that there are many who are like them in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not destroy their self-esteem, but do not allow them to become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You do not need to hurt their self-esteem, but you must point out their pride to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many young people leave home only to find out that they have to spend ten or twenty years in the world in order to learn how to do things properly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By then it is too late.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many young people have a wild temper at home.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are so proud that they cannot work properly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not want our children to become disheartened, but neither do we want them to be proud or to think that they are somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Teaching Children to Accept Defeat</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>and to Learn Humility</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A Christian needs to know how to appreciate others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is easy to be victorious, but it is hard to accept defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can find champions who are humble, but it is rare to find losers who are not bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is not a Christian attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who are good in some areas should learn to be humble and not boastful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the same time, when a person is defeated he should learn to accept his defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Children are very competitive.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is all right for them to be competitive; they want to win at ball games, track meets, and in their school work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You have to show them that it is right for them to study well at school, but they have to learn to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Encourage them to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Tell them that there are many other students who may be better than they are.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When they are defeated, you need to teach them to accept their defeat with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A child s problem often has to do with these attitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After a game the winner is proud, while the loser will complain that the judge was not fair or that he made the wrong judgment because the sun was glaring in his face.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You should help them to develop a humble character.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They should be under Christian admonition and should develop Christian character.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They can win, and when they lose they can also appreciate others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Admitting defeat is a virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Chinese are greatly lacking in this virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Most Chinese blame others when they are defeated instead of conceding with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You must nurture your children in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many children say that their teacher plays favorites when others do well on tests.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When they do not do well themselves, they say their teacher does not like them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Here we see the need for humility.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christians must have the virtue of accepting defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If others are good, we have to say promptly that they are good.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We also have to accept defeat and concede that others are smarter, more hard working, or better than us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is a Christian virtue to accept defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we win, we should not look down upon everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This attitude is unworthy of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When others are better than us, we have to appreciate them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Others may jump higher or be stronger than us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should train our children to acknowledge achievement in others, while they are still living at home with us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This training will help them understand themselves when they grow up as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should know ourselves and appreciate those who are better than us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If our children are this way, it will be easy for them to experience spiritual things.</S>
