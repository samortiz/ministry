   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Isaiah 49:7 says, Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to this verse, the Lord Jesus was despised by man, He was abhorred by the nation, and He was the Slave of rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Hebrew the phrase a servant of rulers means one held in thrall by tyrants.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord was a Slave kept in thrall, in slavery, by tyrants.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Giving His Back to the Smiters</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>and His Cheeks to the Persecutors</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Isaiah 50:6 says of the Lord, I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a very descriptive word telling us how the Lord behaved Himself as a Slave.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He turned His back toward those who wanted to smite Him, He gave His cheeks to the persecutors, and He did not hide His face from shame.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not Crying Nor Lifting Up His Voice</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Isaiah 42:2 indicates that the Lord did not cry or lift up His voice: He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that the Lord did not shout or make noise.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead of crying out to make His voice known in the streets, He was calm and quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not Breaking a Bruised Reed</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>and Not Quenching a Dimly Burning Flax</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Isaiah 42:3 and 4 say, A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to these verses, the Lord would not break a bruised reed or quench a dimly burning flax.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Jews often made flutes of reeds.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a reed was bruised and no longer useful as a musical instrument, they broke it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They also made torches with flax to burn with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The oil ran out, the flax smoked, and they quenched it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some of the Lord s people are like a bruised reed that cannot give a musical sound; others are like smoking flax that cannot give a shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet the Lord would not break the bruised ones who cannot give a musical sound or quench the ones like dimly burning flax that cannot give a shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, the Lord would not break a bruised reed or quench a dimly burning flax.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the other hand, according to these verses, He would not faint as a dimly burning flax, nor would He be crushed as a bruised reed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Given the Tongue of the Instructed</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From Isaiah 50:4 we see that as the Slave of God the Lord was given the tongue of the instructed: The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although as a Slave, the Lord was not a teaching one, He was nonetheless given the tongue of the instructed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was instructed by God to know how to sustain a weary one with a word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because He had been instructed by God, He could sustain a weary one by giving him a single word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such a word is able to minister life more than a long message.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Trusting in God and Setting His Face like a Flint</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Isaiah 50:7 says, For the Lord God will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we see that the Lord trusted in God and set His face like a flint.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the Lord Jesus was walking in God s way to fulfill God s will, His face was like a hard stone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the matter of fulfilling God s will He was very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Having Borne Our Griefs and Carried Our Sorrows</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Isaiah 53:4 and 5 we have this word concerning the Lord Jesus: Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What is described in these verses is related to the Lord s death on the cross.</S>
