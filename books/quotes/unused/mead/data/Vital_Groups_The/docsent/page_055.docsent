   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we want to see the accomplishments of Christ in the stage of His intensification from the degradation of the church to the consummation of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Recently we have seen that John 4:14b shows us that the goal of God's eternal economy is the New Jerusalem: "The water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life."</S>

The New Jerusalem is constituted with transformed precious material: gold as the base, pearls as the gates, and precious stones for the city's wall.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we build up the church with ourselves, with the world, or with earthly things, we are building with wood, grass, and stubble, which are fit only to be burned vv.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if we build the church with the Triune God the Father as the gold, the Son as the pearl or silver, and the Spirit as the precious stone our building work will be a part of the New Jerusalem.</S>
