   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ANTIOCH BEING ANOTHER BEGINNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The beginning in Antioch was initiated by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Please take note that the beginning in Jerusalem was initiated by the Holy Spirit and that the beginning in Antioch was also initiated by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was not that Antioch thought up a method for going out to work but rather that the Holy Spirit initiated another beginning there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Antioch Being the Mortal Wound for Catholicism</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please take note that the beginning at Antioch was very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you know God, you must bow your head and worship Him every time you read Acts 13 and 14 because here is a very important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I will always sincerely thank God for Acts 13.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Acts 13 is the mortal wound for Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without Acts 13 we would have to return to Rome whether or not Rome is right.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jerusalem became a center because the Holy Spirit initiated a beginning there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the Holy Spirit had not initiated a beginning at Antioch, we would have to say that God had only one center on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brothers, you must see the great significance of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you do not have the work on your heart, you will not feel that Acts 13 regarding Antioch is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if you have the work on your heart, you will see that this was a very great step.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was a strategic step by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Until the end of chapter twelve, all that can be seen is the work out of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even the work at Antioch was out of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From chapter eleven we can see that the work in Antioch was done by brothers who came out from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of this we might spontaneously recognize that God s work on the earth had Jerusalem as its one center.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This center might have moved somewhere else, but there would still be only one center.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You would have had to admit that Christianity has a capital.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Just as Roman Catholicism claims that the capital of Christianity is Rome, Jerusalem would have become the capital of Christianity, in the same way that Mecca has become the capital of Islam, and Chufu has become the capital of Confucianism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But thank God, the Holy Spirit initiated another beginning at Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Holy Spirit sent out another group of apostles from Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul and Barnabas Becoming Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How could Paul be so bold as to bear the name of apostle?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Barnabas was a good brother, a common brother in Jerusalem; he was not an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Originally, Paul was also not an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At Antioch the Holy Spirit designated both of them, set them apart, led the church to lay hands on them, and sent them out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After being sent out for a few days, they were both called apostles in Luke s record.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Acts 14:4 says, But the multitude of the city was divided, and some were with the Jews and some with the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here the word apostles is plural.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Holy Spirit did not say, I ordain you, I establish you, to be apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was simply recorded that they were apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 5 says, A hostile attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews with their rulers to treat the apostles outrageously and to stone them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The pronoun here in the original Greek is plural, referring to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The people wanted to treat the apostles outrageously and to stone them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 6 says, They became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This beginning was initiated by God through His Spirit, not by Paul or Barnabas.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If it had been a beginning initiated by Paul or Barnabas, we could deny it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But it was the Holy Spirit who initiated another beginning at Antioch, established another group of apostles, and sent two out to work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, it is clear that on the earth there was not only one but two regions of work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, the thought that the earth has only one center of work is shattered.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christianity does not have a capital.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Where the Holy Spirit works, there the capital of Christianity is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No one can restrict the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord is still the Head of the church; the Holy Spirit is still the Lord s representative.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are not here to be the representatives of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He often uses us, but there are also many times that He works without us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If Jerusalem wanted to be dictatorial about the Lord s work, it would not be able to.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If Jerusalem wanted to monopolize the work of Christianity, it would not be able to.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have seen that God already established Jerusalem as a center, but God can also set up Antioch as a center.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, God can set up Shanghai as a center, and God can also set up Foochow as a center.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Here we can see that there is not one center only.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If there were only one center, then the principle of Rome would be correct.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Possibility of a Third Region Being Set Up</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brothers and sisters, this is most crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Acts 13 is the foundation of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Without Acts 13 we cannot say how many problems would have occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Without Acts 13 the concept of the pope would be entirely correct.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The concept of Rome, the concept that there is a capital of Christianity, would be completely correct.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But now we know that before God there was not only one center but two centers, not only one region but two regions.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, when it pleases the Holy Spirit, He can establish a third region, a tenth region, a hundredth region, a thousandth region, or a ten-thousandth region on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is according to the intention of the Holy Spirit regarding His work on the earth; it is not according to man s intention.</S>
