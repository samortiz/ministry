   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REQUIRING AN ABSOLUTE CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the administration of the church and the ministry of the word we need to know people in order to have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In addition, we must pay attention to the matter of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>CONSECRATIONS THAT ARE NOT THOROUGH</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>GIVING RISE TO PROBLEMS IN THE SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everyone knows about consecration, but not many are clear concerning how consecration affects us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The problems that some serving ones are having may be related to consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are not referring to material offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consecration is a basic need for God to do a building work on the earth through us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, this is not empty doctrine; it is a personal and practical matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The improper conditions manifested among the serving ones indicate that their consecration is not thorough or is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All our problems, difficulties, and sufferings are related to consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more ease and comfort we desire, the less consecrated we need to be.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we do not want any sufferings, there is no need for consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not blame the Lord for giving us sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our sufferings are the result of our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some say that our sufferings are given to us by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In fact, the real sufferings of Christians are brought by Christians upon themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not want any sufferings, we simply should not consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can be zealous, preach the gospel, and even minister the word without being consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Christianity we may be successful without having any sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Natural disasters and man-made calamities are the portion of every person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A person who is not consecrated, however, is exempt from a large amount of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It seems as though the apostles in the early church life sought sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If they had not been absolute and had compromised, they would not have had much suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If they had compromised, they would not have been persecuted by the Jewish religion and the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The sufferings that they experienced were the result of their consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They created sufferings for themselves because of their consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The sufferings the apostle Paul experienced were the result of his consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It would have been possible for him to love and serve the Lord without suffering any hardships if he had not been so absolute in his consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul said, I now rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church Col 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul consecrated himself willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He said, I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you Gal 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul s willingness came from his consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>BEING UNABLE TO DO THE WORK OF BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>IF OUR CONSECRATION IS WEAK</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In contrast, our situation seems to reveal that our consecration is continually getting weaker.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may be excellent Christians and excellent preachers in the eyes of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nevertheless, we cannot do the genuine work of building up the church, because our consecration is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we consecrate ourselves absolutely, the saints sometimes do not approve.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They would rather that we compromise in our service, that is, that we be moderate, neutral, or less than absolute in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we want others to welcome us, we only need to compromise in our service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At least seventy percent of the saints will support us if we serve in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, if we would be absolute in our consecration continually, those who support us will decrease and our suffering will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the apostolic age the apostles were persecuted wherever they went, but today few preachers are persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not because the age has changed or because the world is more favorable toward Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, the consecration of those serving the Lord today does not match that of the early apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The so-called serving ones of the Lord today have lost the consecration of the early apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If all the serving ones today consecrated themselves like the early apostles, they would experience many sufferings and hardships.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many young saints are building up relationships with the view to entering into marriage and establishing a family; this is absolutely necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, what we have observed causes us to wonder whether these relationships strengthen or weaken their consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We cannot condemn the young saints, but they should consider whether their consecration has been strengthened or weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Perhaps they are considering the future of their service, their burden, or their function.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But do these considerations indicate a strengthening or a weakening in their consecration?</S>
