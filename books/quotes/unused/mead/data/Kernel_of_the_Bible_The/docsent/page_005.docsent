   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RETURNING TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Are you an Abel?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I can strongly testify that, as one who has returned to God, I am an Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>More than fifty years ago, I was far away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But one day I turned around and came back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time, I became an Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Are you still walking away from God, or have you returned to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hallelujah, we have returned!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are not Cains; we are Abels.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Are you also an Enosh, one who calls on the name of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Throughout the more than fifty years of my Christian life, I have been calling on the Lord for help.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times I called on the Lord to help me with my temper because I was not able to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At other times I called on Him because I could not bear certain troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Realizing that I was weak and fragile, I said, O Lord Jesus, help me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am sorry to say that some Christians do not agree with this matter of calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In times of peace they do not call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, in times of trouble they spontaneously call, O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is not one Christian who has never called on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why should we wait for trouble to come before we call on the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why not call on His name day by day?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you have never tried this in a daily way, I would ask you to try it now.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no need to pray in the old way, saying, Lord, I need You.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>My temper is uncontrollable, and my wife is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I need Your help, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead of praying this way, say, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some say that this calling is too noisy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although I agree that sometimes we should not be too loud and that we should not disturb others, we can still call upon the Lord in a subdued way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lamentations 3:55 and 56 indicate that to call on the name of the Lord is to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 55 says, I called upon thy Name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The writer here was in a very low state, even in a low dungeon, when he called upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then verse 56 says, Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that our calling on the Lord is our breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no need to call with a loud voice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can call on Him in the way of breathing Him in. This matter of calling on the name of the Lord began with Enosh, the third generation of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Like Enosh, we all need to be those who call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more we call on Him, the more help we shall receive from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>WALKING WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not only be an Abel and an Enosh, but also an Enoch walking with God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although we all are Abels who have returned to God, I wonder if we all are Enochs who walk with Him day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Enoch walked with God by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we would walk with God today, we also need to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As you are about to lose your temper, you should say, Lord, I am walking with You and I am about to lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you say this, you will find it very difficult to lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The more you walk with God, the more difficult it will be to lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>REIGNING FOR GOD</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We also should be a Noah, not only walking with God and preparing salvation for ourselves and others, but also reigning for God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As Noahs, we enjoy God s full salvation, with God s dominion over the earth as the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE EXPERIENCES OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In addition to being Abels, Enoshes, Enochs, and Noahs, we also should be Abrahams, Isaacs, and Jacobs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Certainly, like Abraham, we have been justified.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, like Isaac, we should daily enjoy our inheritance and be under God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Perhaps you may say that you do not want to be a Jacob, for Jacob was a supplanter, a heel-holder, one who deceived nearly everybody.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although you may not desire to be such a person, do not forget that Jacob was eventually transformed into Israel, the prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all shall be transformed Jacobs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many can say that they have called on the name of the Lord, but not many can say that they have been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, we have returned to the Lord, we are calling on Him, we are walking with Him, and we are preparing salvation for ourselves and others that we may reign for God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At the same time, we are in the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>THE ISSUE THE CHURCH AS THE HOUSE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The issue of the process of transformation through which Jacob passed was the twelve tribes that formed the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The house of Israel is a full type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the Old Testament there was the house of Israel, and in the New Testament there is the church as God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thus, the house of Israel was a type of the church as God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The house of Israel came out of Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today we are in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord s recovery is mainly the recovery of Christ as our life and of the church as our living.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, although many Christians talk about the church, they do not have the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They have the doctrine of the church, but they do not have the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One reason for this is that they have not seen that the church is the issue of these significant persons in the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In order to have the proper church life, we need to be an Abel, an Enosh, an Enoch, a Noah, an Abraham, an Isaac, and a Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must not only return to God, but also undergo the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is in this way that we have the twelve tribes, the components of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>THE NEED TO SEE CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We all need to pray to the Lord, Lord, grant me a clear vision of the kernel of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Cause me to see Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I do not want to see Christ in a doctrinal way, but in the way of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>And, Lord, I also need to see the practical church life that I may be a part of the real house of Israel today.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We all need to pray this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we do, the vision will come to us, and we shall see that the Bible is a book of Christ as life and of the church as our living.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then we shall know the kernel of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I look to the Lord that we all may see this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We all should say, I must have the experience of Christ and of the practical church life!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I don t care for theology.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I want to see Christ as my life, and I want to see the church as my daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the kernel of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In the following messages we shall continue with Exodus and other books of the Old Testament and New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In all these books we shall see the kernel of the Bible, Christ and the church.</S>
