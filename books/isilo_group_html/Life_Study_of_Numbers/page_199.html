A FULL TYPE<br>OF THE CHURCH IN THE MYSTICAL UNION<br>WITH THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST,<br>THE VERY EMBODIMENT OF THE PROCESSED<br>AND DISPENSING TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>Apparently the Old Testament has nothing to do with the church. Actually the history of Israel recorded in the Old Testament is a picture of the church life. We need to have this understanding as we read Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. If we have this view, then we will see that in the divine revelation in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers we have a full type of the church in the mystical union with the all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed and dispensing Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A.

In type, this indicates that the church has been chosen by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Redeemed from God's Judgment<br>and Saved from the Bondage of the Fall</H2><P>The typology in Exodus 1, 12, and 14 indicates that the church has been redeemed from God's judgment and saved from the bondage of the fall. As believers today, we know this and have experienced it.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_198.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_200.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Numbers &nbsp; pg 199</div><br></body></html>
