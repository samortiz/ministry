[1]  My burden in all the chapters of this book is to share with you something of God s economy.
[2]  Let us read 1 Timothy chapter 1, verses 3 through 7: That you might charge certain ones not to teach different things nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies, which produce questionings rather than God s economy, which is in faith.
[3]  But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith; from which things some, having misaimed, have turned aside to vain talking, desiring to be teachers of the law.
[4]  If we spend time with the Lord, we will realize that the enemy is persistent in utilizing even the good things of Christianity to distract the Lord s children from the mark of God s economy.
[5]  We have seen God s purpose and what is dispensed by God; now we must realize how God is dispensed through His economy.
[6]  In other words, Spirit is what God dispenses into man, but now we need to see the means by which He does this.
[7]  We know that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are not three different Gods but one God, who is expressed in three persons.
[8]  Likewise, God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit are one God expressed in three persons: God is the source, Christ is the expression of God, and the Holy Spirit is the transmission bringing God in Christ into man.
[9]  According to the first steps of His economy, the Father placed Himself in the Son, and the Son has the seven elements mingled with Himself.
[10]  But we still need another step, a third and final step, for God to dispense Himself into man.
[11]  The first step was that the Father embodied Himself in the Son, and the second step was that the Son became incarnated in humanity to have all the seven wonderful elements mingled with Him.
[12]  All that is in the Father is in the Son, and both the Father and the Son, containing all the elements in Christ, are brought into the Spirit John 16:14-15 .
[13]  The Spirit of God in the Old Testament had only one element the divine nature of God.
[14]  CHAPTER TWO THE ALL-SUFFICIENT SPIRIT THE SPIRIT IS THE TRANSMISSION OF GOD
[15]  In chapter 1 we saw that God s economy is to dispense Himself into us by means of the three persons of the Godhead.
[16]  The Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in us as the very transmission of God, transmitting constantly all that God is and has in Christ.
[17]  Consider how many elements are within this dose: God s divine nature with Christ s human nature, His human living with its earthly sufferings, the wonderful effectiveness of His death, His resurrection, His ascension, and His enthronement.
[18]  John 14:23 says that the Father and the Lord will come to make Their abode with us.
[19]  We might have been a Christian for more than eighty years, but we still need the Christ of God as the life-giving Spirit imparting Himself into us, refreshing us, strengthening us, satisfying us, enlightening us, and filling us.
[20]  In John 3:6 we read, That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
[21]  This verse speaks of two distinct spirits one is indicated by a capitalized word, and the other is indicated by a lowercase word.
[22]  The first occurrence of the word spirit refers to the Holy Spirit of God, and the second, to the human spirit of man.
[23]  Another verse showing these two spirits is John 4:24: God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit.
[24]  Romans 8:16 further confirms the existence of the two spirits: The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.
[25]  In Romans 8:9 and 10 we read, The Spirit of God dwells in you...But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead..., the spirit is life.
[26]  The King James Version capitalizes spirit in verse 10, but the better translations, such as the American Standard Version, render spirit with a small letter s. Why do we point this out? It is because Christians have very little knowledge concerning man s spirit.
[27]  In the first chapter we saw that God the Father is in us Eph 4:6 , Christ is in us 2 Cor 13:5 , and the Holy Spirit is in us Rom 8:11 .
[28]  We are of three parts: our body corresponds to the outer court, our soul to the Holy Place, and our human spirit to the Holy of Holies, which is the very residence of Christ and God s presence.
[29]  For this reason we need to divide our soul from our spirit Heb 4:12 .
[30]  If we are unable to divide our soul from our spirit, we will simply be unable to contact the Lord.
[31]  If the high priest had been unable to locate the Holy of Holies, his efforts to contact God would only have ended in failure.
[32]  In more than twenty translations of the New Testament there is a difference in the way the word spirit is treated.
[33]  In some translations the word is capitalized in certain instances, and in the same instances in other translations it is not.
[34]  In many passages it is difficult for any translator to decide whether spirit refers to the Holy Spirit or the human spirit.
[35]  Therefore, one may assert that this mingled spirit is the human spirit, but another may say that this Spirit is the Holy Spirit.
[36]  Because Christ as the Spirit is living in us, even our mortal bodies, which are dead because of sin, can be enlivened and revived by the divine Spirit, who is dwelling within our spirit.
[37]  It is because our greatest problem is that we do not know the indwelling Spirit or realize that the human spirit is the very dwelling place of the Holy Spirit; neither do we know that these two spirits have been mingled together as one spirit.
[38]  The enemy tries to frustrate us from discerning our spirit, and soon after we are saved, he does this by helping us make a decision to do good.
[39]  Even this morning some have prayed, Lord, I want to do Your will; I want to please You; I will try my best to do the things that satisfy You.
[40]  And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those who are perishing, in whom the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine on them.
[41]  For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus sake.
[42]  Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[43]  But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.
[44]  Let us now turn to ourselves and consider what we are as containers.
[45]  Likewise, in order for us to realize how we can contain God, we must know the different parts of our being.
[46]  Let us now go on to see the details of the vessel of the Lord.
[47]  In the previous chapter we saw that we were created purposely to be God s containers, having God Himself as our content.
[48]  The spirit is the very place where Christ dwells in us 2 Tim 4:22 ; hence, if we would know Christ in an experiential way, we must discern our human spirit from our soul.
[49]  We must discover what the three parts of both the soul and the spirit are.
[50]  First Thessalonians 5:23 indicates that we are a tripartite being spirit, soul, and body but it does not mention the heart.
[51]  It is interesting to note that there are three persons in the Godhead, three parts to man s being, three inward parts to the soul, and also three parts to the spirit.
[52]  The heart is not a separate part in addition to the soul and the spirit; rather, it is a composition of all the parts of the soul and the first part of the spirit.
[53]  Let us continue to see the inward parts and the hidden part of our being.
[54]  The inward parts of our being are the parts of the soul, and the hidden part is our spirit.
[55]  Both our soul and our spirit are composed of three parts, and our heart consists of the three parts of our soul combined with the first part of our spirit, which is our conscience.
[56]  Let us look to the Lord that we may have grace to see all these parts clearly, that we may be sufficiently impressed to learn all the parts of our being, and that we may know how to exercise our spirit and our heart in order to experience the Lord.
[57]  Now that we have seen the function of the heart, we need to consider the function of the spirit.
[58]  First of all, the Bible tells us that we were originally dead, but when we received the Lord Jesus, we were quickened and made alive Eph 2:1-5; Col 2:13 .
[59]  When we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, the Holy Spirit and we must remind ourselves that when the title Holy Spirit is used, it means the all-inclusive Spirit came into our spirit and touched our spirit.
[60]  Similarly, the Holy Spirit came into our spirit to touch our spirit, and by that touch the very life that is the Lord Himself was imparted into us.
[61]  CHAPTER EIGHT DEALING WITH THE HEART AND THE SPIRIT
[62]  We have seen the definition and function of the heart, the spirit, and the soul.
[63]  Our relationship with the Lord is always begun and maintained by our heart.
[64]  Of course, to contact the Lord is a matter of our spirit, but this contact must be initiated and maintained by our heart, for our heart is the gateway of our whole being Prov 4:23 .
[65]  To repeat, the Lord must first attract us by His love.
[66]  He touches our heart with His love in order to open our heart.
[67]  At a certain time we may not have the sense that we are wrong and have made mistakes, but when we deal with our heart and make it pure and single, our conscience will function in a full way.
[68]  In the order of our dealings with the Lord, we must begin with the heart, because it is the entrance and the exit of our whole being Prov 4:23 .
[69]  Second, we must deal with the conscience, and third, with our fellowship with the Lord.
[70]  The sprinkling of the blood deals with the negative things, and the anointing of the Holy Spirit brings in the positive things, applying the very element, essence, and substance of God Himself to us.
[71]  Many times we know something of God in our spirit, but because of a problem in our mind, we may not understand it.
[72]  We have Christ as life within our spirit, but now we need Christ to spread into the inward parts of our soul and saturate them with Himself.
[73]  The mind has found another law, which is more powerful and stronger than the law of sin mentioned in chapter 7 v. 23 . This new law is the law of life of the indwelling Christ in our spirit 8:2 . The mind never again attempts to do things independently but sets itself on the spirit, which is indwelt by the Holy Spirit.
[74]  Suppose our renewed mind understands what we sense by our intuition.
[75]  Then the issue is our willingness to obey what we understand.
[76]  We may understand, but we may also say no to the Lord.
[77]  In this chapter we will learn how to have the flow of the Spirit in our inward parts.
[78]  In Numbers 20 the smitten rock, which typifies Christ as the One who was smitten and riven on the cross, flowed with living water Exo 17:6; 1 Cor 10:4 .
[79]  The rock typifies Christ crucified on the cross, smitten by God so that the living water, which is the Spirit of life, may flow out into us John 19:34; 7:37-39 .
[80]  Christ as the rock has already accomplished His work on the cross, which issued in the water of life flowing into us; but today Christ as the well of living water springing up continuously within us is a different aspect of Christ and has much to do with the present process of digging.
[81]  When someone is digging a deep well, many times he will discover that the earth is of many layers.
[82]  One layer is of soft dirt, the next layer is of hard dirt, and another layer is of stone.
[83]  A soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually.
[84]  A soulish man is a natural man, one who allows his soul to dominate his entire being and who lives by his soul, ignoring and not using his spirit.
[85]  Therefore, the Holy Spirit includes God the Father, God the Son, the divine nature and the human nature, the human life of Christ with the enduring power of His earthly sufferings, the effectiveness of Christ s death, the power of Christ s resurrection, Christ s ascension, and the enthronement of Christ.
[86]  In like manner, Romans 8:34 says that Christ is in heaven at the right hand of God, but the same chapter says that Christ is in us v. 10 . Thus, the Christ who is in heaven is also in us.
[87]  Although the Lord is in our spirit, our spirit is very much stuck to our soul.
[88]  This is why the writer of Hebrews tells us that our spirit must be divided from our soul by the word of God 4:12 .
[89]  Just as marrow is encased within a bone and the bone must be broken before the marrow can be seen, so our spirit, where Christ dwells, is so much sealed within our soul that our soul must be broken before our spirit can be revealed.
[90]  For this reason the Lord told us many times that we need to lose our soul and deny our self.
[91]  The Lord is in our spirit, and His grace is in our spirit, but the way for us to contact Him is by crushing our soul day by day.
[92]  From the first word to the last, with them it is always I...I...I. But the Christian life is no longer I who live, but...Christ who lives in me Gal 2:20 . How can it be no longer I but Christ ? By having the I crucified.
[93]  We were taught many things: that God is the Creator and we are the creatures; that we need to fear God, serve Him, and please Him; that we must try our best to do good; and that we need to do something to glorify His name.
[94]  Whenever we return to our spirit to contact Him, we are in the light, we are in the divine life, we are in the divine power, we are in the heavenlies, we are with the Triune God, and the Triune God is with us.
[95]  At the very beginning of the Scriptures, God is seen creating man as the center of the creation for the purpose of expressing Himself Gen 1:26-27 .
[96]  In His economy God intended that man should express Him as the center of the universe.
[97]  At the beginning of the Word of God we are shown two trees the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil 2:8-9 .
[98]  After God became a man and put that man with Satan within him upon Himself, He brought that man to the cross.
[99]  Satan thought he had succeeded, but he only gave the Lord an easy way to put him to death.
[100]  These chapters deal with the basic things of God s economy and its mark.
[101]  We are not touching here on some unimportant teachings, but on the basic things of God s economy, and we are touching these things not merely in the way of doctrine but in the way of experience.
[102]  It is for this purpose that God created us with three parts spirit, soul, and body.
[103]  After our regeneration, if we cooperate with Him, offering ourselves to Him and giving Him the opportunity, He will spread Himself from our spirit into our soul to renew all the parts of our soul.
[104]  Consequently, sin, personified as a person, is dwelling in the members of our body and rules as an illegal master, forcing us to do things that we dislike.
[105]  At this point we need to consider how we can discern the spirit from the soul.
[106]  To answer this question, we need to look into the Lord s Word.
[107]  He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.
[108]  Many Christians know something concerning the cross, but they are not clear concerning the principle of the cross.
[109]  According to the Scriptures, God has two creations in the universe.
[110]  When God put man upon Himself, He put all the items of the old creation upon Himself.
[111]  For example, the Scripture says that Christ was made sin not plural sins but singular sin by God on our behalf 2 Cor 5:21 .
[112]  God has also caused all our iniquities to fall on Christ Isa 53:6 , who bore up our sins in His body on the tree 1 Pet 2:24 .
[113]  However, we must be careful, for if we say that He became flesh in the same way that we are flesh, that is, with the sinful nature of the flesh, we are wrong.
[114]  In the previous chapter we considered the twelve items of the old creation, the first of which was the angelic life.
[115]  But here we need to point out that those angels who did not fall were not included in the old creation.
[116]  Romans 8:11 says, If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.
[117]  This is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them.
[118]  As for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.
[119]  Hebrews 8:10 says that God s laws are inscribed within us; thus, there is no need for anyone to teach us to know the Lord.
[120]  Is there then any law in the New Testament?
[121]  There is, but it is not the law of letters.
[122]  In resurrection we have the Triune God Himself, we have Him as our life and as our nature, and we also have both the inner law of life and His Spirit as the ointment working within us, continually moving and anointing us with God Himself.
[123]  That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us ; that which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
[124]  And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.
[125]  If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth; but if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.
[126]  The word sense does not occur in this verse, but it is clear that when we set our mind on the flesh, we know death by sensing it, and when we set our mind on the spirit, we know life and peace also by sensing them.
[127]  On the ground of the new creation we can experience resurrection, which includes God as our portion, Christ as our life, the divine nature, the law of life, and the inner anointing.
[128]  How can we know when we are in the presence of God?
[129]  We sense not only the inner flowing but also the inner shining, which comes only through the fellowship of life.
[130]  Allow me to repeat: something within us is moving and flowing, and when we are in the flow, we are simply in the presence of God.
[131]  The fellowship of life helps us to realize the sense of life by bringing us into the presence of God, where we can enjoy the shining of God as light.
[132]  In chapter 17 we saw that the divine life that we have received issues in the fellowship of life, or the current of life, and this current of life produces the inner feeling, the deeper consciousness, of life.
[133]  Now let us consider the difference between the soul and the spirit.
[134]  In other words, we need to discern the spirit from the soul in order to realize in our experience the living Christ, who dwells in our spirit.
[135]  Let us continue to use this brother as an illustration.
[136]  The tabernacle and the temple, as we have seen, were composed of three parts: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies.
[137]  All Bible students agree that the altar is a type of the cross of Christ Heb 13:10 and the laver is a type of the work of the Holy Spirit 1 Cor 6:11 .
[138]  After we have received Christ as our Passover and have been cleansed by the working of the Holy Spirit, and after we know how to feed on Christ as our daily bread of life, we can sense the inner shining.
[139]  We have experienced Christ as our Passover and the washing of the Holy Spirit, and we have experienced Christ as life, as light, and as the sweet savor; now we need to contact Christ Himself.
[140]  We are now clear that the Holy Place represents the wilderness on one hand and the soul on the other hand.
[141]  Yes, they enjoyed Christ as their food and as their light and had many wonderful experiences of Christ, but their enjoyment of Christ was in their soul.
[142]  We were made with three parts: the body outwardly, the spirit inwardly, and the soul in between.
[143]  God s intention is to dispense Himself into the spirit of man and then work Himself into man s soul.
[144]  Before God could fulfill His intention, Satan, the enemy of God, wrought himself into the body of man.
[145]  Satan came into our body as the law of sin, but praise the Lord, when we were saved, the Triune God came to dwell in our spirit as our life.
[146]  Whenever I exercise my mind to do the will of God and keep the law of God, the evil one in my members rises up against me, defeats me and brings me into captivity v. 23 . My mind, representing my self, cannot keep the law of God; if my mind tries to do the will of God by itself, it is always defeated.
[147]  Now we go on from Romans 8 to Romans 12.
[148]  In chapter 7 the mind was independent, but in chapter 8 the mind is dependent dependent on the spirit.
[149]  There are many more important details to consider concerning the spirit and the soul, but now our attention must be focused on the building of God s dwelling place.
[150]  We have put much emphasis on the tabernacle, God s dwelling place.
[151]  In the outer court there was the altar, which typifies the cross of Christ, and the laver, which typifies the cleansing work of the Holy Spirit.
[152]  If we desire to be the building as God s dwelling place, we must experience what Christ has accomplished by His cross and the cleansing of the Holy Spirit.
[153]  Based on this principle, let us see what the main materials of the tabernacle were.
[154]  In order to practice the church life, we need to realize that it is by the Lord s redemption that we are united, and under this redemption we are covered that we may be separated for God s building.
[155]  Although this is good, it is only the experience of the outer court.
[156]  There are a number of good things in the outer court: bronze, silver, and white linen.
[157]  This means that when we are in the outer court, nothing of the divine nature has yet been wrought into us that can be expressed.
[158]  This is the reason that we must enter into our spirit, exercise our spirit, walk according to the spirit, and always be mingled with the Lord in our spirit.
[159]  It comes from the experiences of the golden table, the golden lampstand, the golden incense altar, and the golden Ark. The more we experience Christ as our life, as our light, and as our resurrection savor, and the more we experience Christ Himself in the deepest way, the more the divine nature is wrought into us.
[160]  Now the tabernacle you shall make with ten curtains of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet strands; you shall make them with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman.
[161]  Confessing that we are sinners and that we have been put to an end by Christ s death, we receive Christ as our life.
[162]  The table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, the incense altar, the Ark, all the boards that form the framework of the tabernacle, and even the four layers of the covering reveal and emphasize one thing: Christ as the very embodiment of God has been wrought into us that we may experience Him as life and as everything.
[163]  However, we must realize that even up to this stage the tabernacle is still without a roof to cover it.
[164]  Regardless of the degree to which we have been wrought into Christ and Christ has been wrought into us, we are only the boards none of us can become the covering.
[165]  Only Christ can be the covering, for the church must be the expression of only Christ Himself.
[166]  It is not a matter of a pattern or an organization, nor is it any kind of formation by human hands; rather, the church is Christ wrought into many persons, and these persons uplift Christ and exalt Christ and put on Christ as their expression in order to cover and protect themselves.
[167]  We must lift up and exalt only our wonderful Christ as the covering of God s building a Christ within who is full of divine comeliness, and a Christ without who is simple and humble in the eyes of the world.
[168]  If I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.
[169]  And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.
[170]  When we say that the church is the house of God, we must have a very deep realization that God dwells, lives, and works out His life in this house.
[171]  Christ Himself is the reality John 14:6 , and His Spirit is the Spirit of reality v. 17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:6 . He Himself is the reality, and His Spirit is the Spirit of reality.
[172]  This is the right meaning of the expressions the house of God and the pillar and base of the truth.
[173]  The church is the continuation and the multiplication of God manifested in the flesh.
[174]  When we are the living Body of Christ in a certain place, we are truly the house of God and the pillar and base of the truth.
[175]  We must know how to adjust our heart so that we can open our heart and allow God to come in. Furthermore, we must know how to exercise our spirit in order to contact Him, contain Him, and even digest Him.
[176]  The same principle applies to the matter of gifts.
[177]  Many Christians today think that since they have certain gifts, they are quite spiritual.
[178]  God s intention today is not to give us many teachings and gifts but to minister and impart Christ into us.
[179]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR THE VISION OF THE MARK OF GOD S ECONOMY
[180]  The economy of God with its mark was unveiled at the beginning of this book, but after reading all the foregoing chapters, it is still possible to miss this economy.
[181]  In simple words, God s economy is to work Himself into us, and in order to accomplish this, He must do it in three persons the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[182]  From the beginning of this book we have spent much time on this economy of the Triune God.
[183]  The New Testament deals more with the fact that God in the Spirit has come into us than with the fact of His coming upon us.
[184]  The little word in referring to Christ being in us Rom 8:10; 2 Cor 13:5; Col 1:27 , Christ living in us Gal 2:20 , Christ being formed in us 4:19 , Christ making His home in our hearts Eph 3:17 , Christ abiding in us and we in Him John 15:4 , etc. occurs many times in the New Testament.
[185]  Only the innermost part, the Holy of Holies, was the place where God s shekinah glory dwelt and where the Ark as a type of Christ remained.
[186]  This shows clearly that God and Christ have come to dwell in our spirit Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Tim 4:22 .
[187]  God came into the human nature, brought the human nature into the divine nature, and put an end to all negative things; now the Triune God and all that He has accomplished are in our spirit as our life and everything.
[188]  If we do not experience Christ in such a practical way, it is absolutely impossible to build up the church.
[189]  To build up Christ s Body, we must feed on Christ, eat Christ, and drink Christ so that we will be nourished with Christ.
[190]  If I have any method at all, it is this: first, we must be put on the cross; second, we must feed on Christ in the spirit day by day; and third, when we are nourished and full of Christ, we need to nourish others with Christ.
