   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRESERVATION OF AMERICA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The continent of North America was created by God along with all the other continents.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet it was concealed from the majority of mankind for thousands of years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God preserved it until His time was ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then it was found by a new people, many of whom were God-loving and Bible-loving.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These new, freethinking people founded a new nation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Surely these were not accidental events.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Surely they did not happen without any meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The times have been appointed by God; the boundaries have been drawn by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The location of the United States, between two large oceans and in the temperate zone, is ideal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is rich in natural resources.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are here not by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whether we were born here, or came here because of circumstances, our being here is by God's sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was young, my family had considerable contact with American missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We were quite westernized.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From my youth I loved America.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But I had no thought of ever coming to this country.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nor did Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before 1950 none of us thought that our work would be in the Western World.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We thought China was the field God had appointed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But God thought differently.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He sovereignly brought the recovery to this country.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE DECLINING QUALITY OF CHRISTIAN PUBLICATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some thirty-two years have passed since the recovery first went to Taiwan and then spread to the United States and the rest of the Western World.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have been observing the Christian publications these years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Chinese-speaking world hardly one book of spiritual weight has come out during this period.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How about in Europe and in America?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is difficult to name one book with light and spiritual weight that has come out, like the ones that were published in the previous century.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One day in 1936 we were at a brother's house in Tientsin for lunch.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our work was being opposed, and Brother Nee was the target of their attack.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the dining table Brother Nee turned to me and said, "Witness, these people are opposing us, yet they still use our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am going to stop our publications for a time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let's see what other Christian groups will produce."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And he did.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the years 1936 through 1938 there were nearly no publications by us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And in those few years no spiritual writings by others came out either.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE SPREADING OF THE CENTRAL VISION</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the present development of the world situation, the Lord will further isolate Gog and Magog Russia .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Middle East is still a problem, but I believe in time the situation there also will result in the increased isolation of Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Russia's isolation will help the United States stay on top so that the world will be kept peaceful and free.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For what?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not for the first century's spread of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not for the Sixteenth Century's Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not for the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries' Bible teaching and scriptural meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, it is for the central vision of the Apostle Paul's completing ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is my earnest expectation that many saints will be burdened for this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many, I hope, would be ready for the Lord's leading to go to other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some may go to Athens, others to Jerusalem, others to Vienna and elsewhere, in order to spread the Lord's up-to-date, ultimate move on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE FOUR GOSPELS</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You will notice that the Scripture Reading at the beginning is from all four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Matthew says, "All authority has been given to Me. Go therefore and disciple all the nations " 28:18-19 . Matthew is for the kingdom, to disciple people to be citizens of the heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Mark says, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature" 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The gospel is to be preached to every creature.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Luke says, "That repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations " 24:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here the preaching is of repentance and forgiveness of sins in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Gospel of John does not mention the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It says, "You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit" 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not a matter of preaching, but a matter of living to produce some fruit!</S>
