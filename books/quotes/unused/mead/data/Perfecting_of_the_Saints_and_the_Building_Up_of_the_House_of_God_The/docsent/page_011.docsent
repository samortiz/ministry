   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PERFECTING AND NOT REPLACING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are three steps in the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord first gives gifts to the church, and the gifts perfect the saints in different places.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then the perfected saints are able to function according to their measure because their organic function has been activated through the perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a result, the perfected saints are the ones who build up the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To perfect means to make a person useful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, to perfect a saint is to make him useful in the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Does a worker build up the church in a locality directly, or does he perfect others?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The direct building up of the church should be carried out by the perfected saints, not by the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A worker perfects the saints; he does not build up the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we labor in a locality, but the building of the church stops after we leave, our work is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What kind of work are we doing?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Are we building up the church directly?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, there is a portion of the building up that we do directly according to our function, but our primary work is to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Otherwise, what will happen if we, like Philip, are suddenly caught away Acts 8:26, 39 ?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What will the churches do if we are suddenly raptured?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whether we are raptured will not matter, if the saints are perfected and can build up the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we, the workers, build up the church directly, we are replacing the saints in the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the fact that we perfect the saints to build the church does not mean that we absolutely do not build up the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, it means that we perfect the saints instead of replacing them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some saints do not know how to build up the church, so we teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Other saints are not able to build up the church, so we perfect them and make them able.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not replace the saints, but we perfect them and let them do the building work directly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This needs our consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The ability to accomplish a task by yourself is not necessarily an indication of great capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, a worker who can teach the saints to do something better than he can, truly has great ability.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The workers should perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the saints will be as capable or even more capable than the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not replace the saints in the building up of the church; rather, we should perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should make the saints useful and let them build up the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may think that we are very clear about this principle, but we may be clear only while we listen to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may not be clear when we serve in our localities.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our work proves that we are still not clear concerning this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some workers say that since they are neither an apostle nor a prophet, they cannot perfect anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In their display of humility, they even ask whom they should perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although this sounds right, their words are used to enable them to continue to replace the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Under no circumstance should we replace the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not a matter of whether we are gifted but of whether we can perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE GIFTS PERFECTING</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE SAINTS TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH DIRECTLY</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The elders and the saints responsible for the group meetings must remember this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When they labor, they must perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Otherwise, their work replaces the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, the elders know how to administrate the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When an elder labors, he should have some saints with him in order to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The saints responsible for the meetings must also labor by this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A brother may work in such a way that the more he works, the more responsibility he bears; however, the other saints participate less, and he is unable to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this situation his work is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The apostles, prophets, and even the saints responsible for the meetings must work according to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Initially, the elders bear the responsibilities in a church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The saints who are raised up to share the responsibilities tend to do everything themselves because few saints are perfected to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, after the responsible saints serve for a few months, they should bring other saints into bearing responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This does not mean that the responsible saints lightly relinquish their responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The responsible saints perfect the saints by serving the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They should teach the saints according to the ability of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A saint can be taught to bear responsibility, and if he makes a mistake, he can be corrected.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Soon he will be able to bear responsibility by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then another saint can be taught to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In two or three years all the saints will be able to do what you are able to do.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In addition, when the number of saints in a meeting increases to a hundred saints, the meeting should split into two meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then there will be many saints who can bear responsibility in the new meeting, because they were perfected by the leading of the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the building up of the church it is crucial for the saints who know how to build to perfect the other saints to build.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In principle, the gifts know how to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may say that there is no prophet or apostle in our locality, but we must admit that we can build up the church a little; we do have a little gift.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A brother who has a desire to serve in a locality for five years must have a five-year plan.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What will happen to the saints when he leaves?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Will the church become weak and close its doors, or will it continue to function with a stronger service?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whether a local church will be able to continue after we leave is what matters.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A person who knows how to work will always seek to perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This does not mean that he does less work.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Rather, he works more than the rest of the saints, because most of his work is to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After he has served for three to five years, the saints can do and are doing whatever he can do.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This requires a great deal of consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the way for us to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Leading others to be spiritual does not mean that we are building up the church, because to be spiritual is not the same as to be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We may lead others to be spiritual without leading them to exercise their function according to their measure.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hence, there are many spiritual saints in the church, but there is not much building.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Please forgive me for this frank word.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I serve and work with you, and I am responsible before the Lord to observe the condition of the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Perhaps you feel that I cannot understand your situation because I am not in your locality, and I did not fellowship with you.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, there may not be another person who is as concerned for your situation as I am.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Some of the workers lack spiritual weight in their work, and therefore there is no result.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Some workers render spiritual help to the saints, but they do not perfect the saints to be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The saints whom they serve do not become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A good carpenter can use wood of any quality to make something useful.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, even though some of our workers render the saints spiritual help, the saints are still not useful vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This can be compared to a carpenter who works on different pieces of wood until the pieces are smooth and have nice colors but are not useful.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They are just pieces of wood; nothing useful, like a desk or chair, has been produced.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We need to see our lack and be humbled.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is foolish for us to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If a local church has been in our hands for many years, what is the result?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We should not be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Our condition should humble us.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Many saints have passed through our hands; we contacted and led them.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>How many of these saints did we perfect to become useful?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We should not say that we have poor quality material.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Some of the material may be poor, but not all the material is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The problem is not the quality of the material; it is whether we can make useful vessels out of the material that we have.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It may be a waste to make a chair out of top quality wood, but the chair is useful.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It may be an even greater waste to make a chair out of pure gold or diamond, but the chair can still be used.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Even if we use wood of the poorest quality, the chair will be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Hence, it does not depend on the kind of material that we have but on whether we have perfected the material.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The saints in our locality may be poor quality wood.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>They might not be good material, much less gold or diamond, but we still must make them into something useful.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The building up of the church is not done directly by the gifts but by the gifts perfecting the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The perfected saints then build up the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In principle, the gifts are the saints who know how to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>A believer who receives the Lord s grace is able to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>However, the Lord does not want us to do things by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>He wants other saints to accompany us when we do things so that they can be perfected to do what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We must learn how to perfect the saints; otherwise, the church will not be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This problem is not obvious in smaller churches.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>In the larger churches, however, it is visible.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This problem is the reason that the church in Taipei is not built up.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The saints who met in the six or seven district meetings were not built up.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Even after we formed twenty smaller meetings, the saints were still not built up, because few saints know how to perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>There are many saints who know how to do things, but they do not know how to perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The church needs a group of saints who not only know how to do things but also know how to teach others to do the same things and thereby perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>It is difficult to give examples of spiritual matters because they are abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Business affairs, however, are concrete and clear.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Some saints are very good at doing things in the large meetings, but they do not know how to perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>As a result, there were not enough saints who could handle the church affairs when we formed smaller districts and needed more responsible saints.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Hence, the church affairs suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>This shows that our urgent need is to learn to perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>If there are not enough perfected saints, the church cannot be built up, and our numbers will not increase.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Moreover, when there are not enough perfected saints, any increase makes the meetings chaotic.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>If we have only three or four stones, they do not need to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>But thousands of stones must be built; otherwise, there will be chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Even if the stones are polished and look nice, they are of no use because they are not built; they are a pile of stones.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>For the sake of the building up of the church, we must have a plan to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>The material in the church is for building; it is not for display.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Construction workers build with materials; they do not beautify materials.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>However, some co-workers only beautify the building materials.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>They do not know how to perfect others, which is the real building.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>The saints who know how to perfect others are genuine co-workers of God.</S>
