The Lord&rsquo;s Will&mdash;God is Willing</h2>
<p>It is true that God can do everything, but how do I know that He is willing to heal me? I do not know His will. Perhaps the Lord is not willing to heal me. What should I do? Let us look at another story. Mark 1:41 says, &ldquo;And He was moved with compassion, and stretching out His hand, He touched him and said to him, I am willing; be cleansed!&rdquo; Whether or not God can do something is not the question here; rather, it is a question of whether or not God is willing. No matter how great His power is, what does it matter if He is unwilling to heal? If God does not want to heal us, the greatness of His power will be of no consequence to us. The first question that has to be settled is whether or not God <em>can,</em> but the second question that also has to be settled is whether or not God <em>will.</em> The Lord said to the leper, &ldquo;I am willing.&rdquo; The Old Testament tells us that leprosy is a very filthy disease (Lev. 13&mdash;14). Whoever contacted a leper was defiled. However, the Lord&rsquo;s love was so great that He said, &ldquo;I am willing.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus stretched out His hand and touched and cleansed the leper! The leper entreated the Lord, and the Lord was willing to cleanse him. Can it be that the Lord will not heal our illness? Can it be that the Lord will not answer our prayers? We can all say, &ldquo;God can&rdquo; and &ldquo;God is willing.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Lord&rsquo;s Act&mdash;God Has Done</h2>
<p>It is not enough for us to know that God can and God will. We need to know one more thing&mdash;God has done. We need to go back to Mark 11:24, which we quoted earlier: &ldquo;All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them.&rdquo; This tells us that God has done something already.</p>
<p>What is faith? Faith is not just believing that God can and will do something but also believing that God has done something already. God has accomplished it. If you believe that you have received it, you will have it. If you believe and are confident that God can and will do a certain thing because He has given you a word concerning it, you should thank Him, saying, &ldquo;God has done it!&rdquo; Many people&rsquo;s prayers are not answered because they are not clear about this point; they still hope that they <em>will</em> receive something. However, to hope means to expect something in the future, whereas to believe means to consider something as being done. Genuine faith says, &ldquo;Thank God, He has healed me! Thank God, I have received it! Thank God, I am cleansed! Thank God, I have recovered!&rdquo; When faith is perfect, it will not only say &ldquo;God can&rdquo; and &ldquo;God wills,&rdquo; but also &ldquo;God has done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God has listened to our prayers! God has accomplished everything! If we believe that we have received it, we will receive it. Very often, our faith is a faith that believes in what we will receive. As a result, we never receive anything. We should have the faith that we have already received. Faith is always a matter of &ldquo;having been done&rdquo; rather than of &ldquo;will be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Consider a simple illustration. A person has just heard the gospel. If you ask him, &ldquo;Have you believed in the Lord Jesus?&rdquo;, he may answer, &ldquo;I have.&rdquo; You may then ask, &ldquo;Are you saved?&rdquo; If he says, &ldquo;I will be saved,&rdquo; you know that he is not saved. Suppose you ask him again, &ldquo;Do you really believe that you <em>are</em> saved?&rdquo; If he says, &ldquo;I will surely be saved,&rdquo; you know that he is still not saved. You may want to ask him again, &ldquo;Are you really sure that you <em>will be</em> saved?&rdquo; If he answers, &ldquo;I <em>think</em> I will,&rdquo; his words do not sound like someone who is saved. If one says, &ldquo;I will be saved,&rdquo; &ldquo;I will surely be saved,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I think I will surely be saved,&rdquo; there is no guarantee that he is saved. If the person says, &ldquo;I am saved,&rdquo; he has the right tone. Once a man believes, he is saved. Any faith, if it is faith at all, believes in what has been accomplished. For example, once a person possesses faith at the time of his salvation, he immediately says, &ldquo;Thank God, I have received.&rdquo; Let us lay hold of these three things&mdash;God can, God wills, and God has done.</p>
<p>Faith is not a psychological exercise. <em>Faith is receiving God&rsquo;s word</em> and believing with much assurance that God can, God wills, and God has done. If you have not received His word, <em>do not take the spiritual risk of trying to tempt God.</em> The exercise of psychology is not faith. Take illness as an example: All who are healed through genuine faith are not afraid of a medical checkup (Mark 1:44). The result of a medical checkup for those who have experienced a genuine divine healing will prove that it was a genuine healing rather than something psychological.</p>
<p>When new believers learn to pray, they should pray in two stages. In the first stage they should pray until they receive a promise. They should pray until they receive God&rsquo;s word. All prayers begin by asking God for something. Such prayers can continue for a period of time, sometimes lasting for three to five years. One needs to keep asking. Some prayers are answered quickly, while other prayers continue to go unanswered for years. This is the period of time when one needs to continue to ask. The second stage begins from the time one receives a promise and extends to the time the promise is realized. It begins from the time one receives God&rsquo;s word and extends to the time His word is fulfilled. This stage is not for praying, but for praising. In the first stage one prays, but in the second stage one praises. In the first stage he prays until he receives a word. In the second stage he praises the Lord continuously until the word is fulfilled. This is the secret to prayer.</p>
<p>Some people only know two points about prayer: First, they pray on their knees for what they do not have, and second, they have it; God has given it to them. Suppose I ask for a watch from the Lord, and after a few days the Lord gives me a watch. There are only two events: being without something and having something. Some do not realize that there is another event in between these two&mdash;the event of faith. Suppose I pray for a watch and one day say, &ldquo;Thank God, He has already heard my prayer.&rdquo; Although my hands are still empty, I am clear within that I already have the watch. Indeed, after a few days the watch arrives. We cannot be concerned with just two events: not having and then having. We must be concerned with a third event&mdash;an additional event between not having and having, in which God gives us a promise, and then we believe and rejoice over it. Perhaps we have to wait three days before we actually receive the watch. But in our spirit, we received it three days ago already. A Christian should experience this kind of <em>receiving in the spirit.</em> If a person never experiences this kind of receiving in the spirit, he does not have faith.</p>
<p>We hope that new believers will know what faith is, and we hope that they will learn to pray. Perhaps, you have prayed continually for three or five days, a month, or even a year, and still your hands are empty. But deep in your heart, you have a little assurance that the matter will eventually be accomplished. At that time you should begin to praise God. You should continue praising Him until you have received the thing in your hand. Simply put, the first stage is to pray from nothing to having faith, and the second stage is to praise from having faith to actually receiving.</p>
<p>Why should we divide our prayers into these two stages? Suppose a person prays from having nothing to having faith. If he continues to pray, he may lose his faith. Once a person has acquired faith, he should begin praising. If he continues to pray, he may pray away his faith and not receive anything in the end. &ldquo;You will have it&rdquo; is an actual having in the hands, while &ldquo;you have received it&rdquo; is a having in the spirit. If the faith is already there, but the things have not materialized, one has to remind God with praise; he should not try to remind Him with prayer. If God has said that He will give us something, what else do we need to say? If we have the inward assurance that &ldquo;we have received it,&rdquo; what more do we need to pray for? Many Christians have the experience that as soon as their prayer strikes faith, they can no longer continue to pray. They can only say, &ldquo;Lord! I praise You.&rdquo; They have to keep their faith and praise, &ldquo;Lord! I praise You. You have heard my prayer. I praise You because You answered my prayer a month ago.&rdquo; If you do this, you will receive. Unfortunately, some people do not have the knowledge. God has already promised them something, yet they still pray. In the end their prayer drives away their faith. This is a great loss.</p>
<p>The word in Mark 11:24 is too precious. In the whole New Testament, we cannot find another passage that explains faith as clearly as this one. &ldquo;All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them.&rdquo; If a person sees this, he will know what prayer really is, and prayer will be a powerful tool in his hands.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages for Building Up New Believers, Vol. 1 &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
