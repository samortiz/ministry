   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE LIVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we must go on to consider the three lives.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As with the four laws, each of these three lives is related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God created us to be human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, because we are humans, we have the human life, which is the created life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On God s side, He has the uncreated, eternal, divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because we have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit of God, we now have the divine, eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The third life is that of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This life is also very much related to us, for through the fall, the devil himself has become related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot say that just because we are creatures of God, we do not have anything to do with the life of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the contrary, we must admit that because of the fall, the life of Satan is related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because we are regenerated believers, three tremendous things have happened to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, we have been created.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, we have fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Third, we have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because these three things have happened to us, there are three lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we were created by God, we received the created life, the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then when we fell, we received the life of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whether we realize this or not, it is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we partook of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, something of Satan came into our being; it was not Adam alone who ate of that tree we were included in Adam Rom 5:12; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Heb 7:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Adam ate of that tree, he not only committed an act of sin; he also received the life of Satan into his being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can see this in a simple illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us say that there is a bottle of poison, which a mother warns her child not to touch.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One day when the mother goes out, the little child takes the bottle and drinks the poison.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In doing so, he disobeys his mother s command.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, disobedience is a small concern compared to a much greater problem which has arisen the deadly poison is now inside the child.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the mother discovers that her child has drunk the poison, she is concerned not mainly with his disobedience but with getting the poison out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the day that Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he did not merely do something that was contrary to God s command; something of Satan came into his being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From that day onward there has been something evil in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First John 3:10 says that we are children of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the very same way that we are the children of Adam because we have Adam s life, the human life, we are the children of the devil because we have Satan s life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, we have not only been created and have not only become fallen; we have also been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Praise the Lord that when we received the Lord Jesus as our life, the Holy Spirit came into our spirit, bringing the divine life into us!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At that point, we became the children of God possessing the life of God 5:12; John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must realize that as created, fallen, and regenerated men, we have three fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our first father is the first man, Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our second father is the devil, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our third father is God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus told the Pharisees, who represent us, that they were the children of their father, the devil 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This verse clearly tells us that Satan is our evil father.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But praise the Lord, we have been regenerated by God!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have become His children, and He has become our Father 20:17; 1 John 3:1; 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our being the children of Satan is a thing of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are now the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must realize that these three lives the human life, the satanic life, and the divine life are all related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>EVERY KIND OF LIFE HAVING A CERTAIN KIND OF LAW</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must see the principle that with every kind of life there is a corresponding law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may illustrate this with the example of a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Inherent in the bird life is the law of flight.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As long as a bird is a bird, it will naturally fly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although we can confine a bird to a cage and thereby keep it from flying, the moment we set the bird free, it will fly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That birds fly is a law of the bird life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Similarly, the law of the fish life says that in order for a fish to live, it must remain in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because the bird life and the fish life have certain laws, if we were to put a bird under water or take a fish out of the water, both the bird and the fish would die.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even the vegetable life has a law.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, we can see that with every kind of life there is certain kind of law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is also true related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>With the human life there is a law, with the satanic life there is a law, and with the divine life there is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The law of the created human life, since that life is good, is the law of good.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This law of good is in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The law of the satanic life, since that life is evil, is the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This law of sin is in the members of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The law of the Spirit of life is the life of God, and it is in our spirit.</S>
