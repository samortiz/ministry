   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The general subject of this book is the satanic chaos in the old creation and the divine economy for the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Such a subject may seem quite peculiar, strange, and extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The burden of the messages in this book can be expressed in two sets of four statements.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first set concerns the divine economy and the satanic chaos:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1 Christ is the centrality and universality of the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2 Satan, the devil, is the source and element of the evil chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>3 The believers must condemn the earthly chaos and exalt the heavenly economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>4 The overcomers conquer all the destructive chaos and triumph in the unique constructive economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The second set of statements concerns the overcomer:</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1 To the overcomer, Christ will give to eat of the tree of life in the Paradise of God Rev 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2 To the overcomer, Christ will give of the hidden manna with a white stone for God's building Rev 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3 The overcomer, Christ will make a pillar in God's temple, the New Jerusalem Rev 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>4 The overcomer will dine with Christ, and to him Christ will give to sit with Him on His throne Rev 3:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this message I would like first to give an introductory word and then consider the divine economy and the satanic chaos in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I hope that this opening word will give us a governing and controlling vision, a vision that will help us to understand all the matters that we will cover in these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before we were saved, we all, old and young, male and female, were in a condition of chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every year, every day, and even every moment we were in a chaotic situation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But one day something else came into us, and this thing is the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We repented to God, confessed our sins, failures, mistakes, and wrongdoings, and received the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Upon our receiving of the Lord Jesus, something wonderful, heavenly, and divine came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may say that Christ came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may also say that the Holy Spirit or the Divine Trinity came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yes, the One who came into us is Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we need to see that this One is the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that God is our economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You have heard that Jesus Christ is our Savior, Lord, and Master and that He is our life, nature, and person, but probably you have never heard that Jesus Christ is also the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, we need to realize that when we were saved, the divine economy came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the New Testament the word economy, an anglicized form of the Greek word oikonomia, is strongly used.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For instance, this word is used in Ephesians 3, a chapter which reveals that the riches of Christ are preached to the nations so that the church can come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 9 speaks of "the economy of the mystery."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Oikonomia is composed of two Greek words: oikos, meaning house, and nomos, meaning law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, an oikonomia is a house law, a family administration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some versions translate oikonomia as "administration," and others as "arrangement" or "plan."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's economy is His plan, His administration, His arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The situation into which we were born was altogether messy and chaotic.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There was no administration or arrangement or plan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We did not know what to do, where to go, or what kind of person we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was my situation before I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But one day, while I was in such a chaotic condition, the gospel, the glad tidings, came to me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I attended a gospel meeting where I heard about God, the Lord Jesus, and Satan typified by Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I was caught by the Lord and I prayed to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Immediately after I prayed, something bright and shining, something of splendor, came into me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As I was walking home after the meeting, I stopped on the street and said, "God, from today I would like to be Your preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I do not want to be anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I just want to preach Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Triune God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the divine life had come into me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Also, the divine economy had come into me as a kind of administration, arrangement, and plan that put everything in order.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I was joyful, and I was in an orderly situation.</S>
