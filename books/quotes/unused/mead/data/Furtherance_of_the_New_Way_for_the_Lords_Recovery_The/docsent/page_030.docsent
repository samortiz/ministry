   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Learning to Become the Right Kind of Person</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Fourth, when we go to lead the home meetings, we ourselves first must be the kind of person that we want them to be.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that if we lead the new ones to read the Bible and pray, yet we ourselves do not have the habit of reading the Bible and praying, then that is not acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We cannot lead others to read the Bible and pray unless we ourselves do so.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the same way, how can we lead and exhort others to forsake the world if we ourselves love the world?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we tell new ones that the Lord today is the life-giving Spirit within them and that they should follow Him the Spirit in their spirit, then we ourselves must be such people those who live in the spirit every day and walk according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not just a matter of practicing what we preach or of being a pattern; instead, it is that we ourselves are such people in our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We love the Lord, fellowship with Him, long for His Word, enjoy praying, obey the Spirit, walk according to the Spirit, forsake the world as if it were dung, and live wholly for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are such people when we go to lead and care for a home meeting, then after a short while, we will produce a great effect on the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>New believers, especially young people, really like to imitate spiritual people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I was first saved, I saw an old pastor whom I really admired in my heart, so I imitated his every move and action.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My sister studied theology in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When she returned, she told me that at the seminary she met many spiritual people who pursued the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They all spoke gently and elegantly, walked slowly with a Bible in their hands, and after walking a few steps they would look up to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By nature I am a quick, impatient, and impulsive person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After hearing my sister's fellowship, I wanted to learn to speak cautiously and walk slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This illustrates how every saved one wants to imitate the good pattern of spiritual people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as we are proper people, when we go to visit two households for forty to fifty minutes every week, we will have a great influence on them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They might not say anything, but unconsciously they will be affected and will even pay attention to and imitate our way of dressing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The most important thing in leading a meeting is our person; people bear children who are just like themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We learn Chinese ethical education from the time we are small, not according to how much our parents teach us but mainly according to what kind of pattern they show us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They live altogether according to the Chinese ethical teachings, so they unconsciously plant those things into us until it even becomes very hard for us to change ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, I exhort the brothers and sisters that since they have picked up the burden to lead the home meetings, they must pray earnestly before the Lord for the new ones and also consider their own condition to see whether they are the right people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not merely have a heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must also, more importantly, be right, and we must be the kind of person we want the new ones to be.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Taking the Lead but Not Being the Head</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Fifth, when we take the lead, we must definitely not take it upon ourselves to be the head and do everything by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may do this in the big meetings but definitely not in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The home meetings do not have a specific person as the head.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, although we go to lead the meetings, we must take a firm stand and let the new ones know that we are just meeting and participating together with them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is just as if we were playing ball; we play together with them instead of just being a coach to teach them how to play without playing ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of course, we are more experienced, so sometimes when they do not know how to go on, we must "coach" them at the right time by asking them to sing, read the Bible, pray, or testify.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must always remember, however, to give the meeting to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way, they will learn how to meet after just a few meetings and will be able to function in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I repeat, when you lead the home meetings, you absolutely must not have the attitude that you have the approval from the church to go to the home meetings as a teacher, coach, or head.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you go with such an attitude, the home meetings will be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You certainly must learn to meet with them and to bring them on as you meet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the same time you must be careful not to bring the atmosphere of the big meetings into the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Big meetings should be carried out in an orderly manner.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In contrast, home meetings are characterized by their disorderliness, and it does not matter even if the meetings drag on a little.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We really must learn to meet with the new ones just like a family and talk about things together, leading and helping them as the need arises but without replacing them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course, we certainly must pay attention to the time and avoid meeting for too long.</S>
