   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING THE PRACTICE Finding the Ones to Submit To</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we have such a realization, we come to the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first step has to do with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second step has to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, we must have God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then this word must be applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Body the first thing we have to learn is to find those whom we have to submit ourselves to.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must know those who are ahead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the authorities in the Bible are deputy authorities and not direct authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What we have to learn is not to have others submit to us, but to submit ourselves to others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I go to work, I do not first ask who my subordinates are.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, I must first ask who my superior is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you go to another person's house to be the maid, you do not first ask who the children are, but who the lady of the house is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we allow the inner life to operate freely, we will find the ones whom we have to submit to.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may think that submission will make us unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually, the opposite is true; submission makes a happy person, and insubordination makes an unhappy person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only when we submit to one another will there be coordination one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This kind of coordination is most pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The real submission is not one that is imposed from without, but one that comes as a result of the operation of the life within.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is wrong to submit to anyone because of his high position or material riches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To do so would make us no different from today's political organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our submission is not brought about by any outward factors, but by the demand of the life within.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of submission may bring us tears.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet, at the same time it brings us joy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may feel that we are suffering, but at the same time, we are rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes the ones whom you submit to may give you a hard time, but you can still say "amen.''</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is true submission.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>True submission neither makes a person suffer nor causes him to feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, it draws an "amen'' from his spirit and gives him peace in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Fellowshipping and Coordinating Together</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we see the Body of Christ, we will see the matter of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The life that we received from the Lord makes us pliable and enables us to coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this coordination there is no friction and there is no murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To have such things in the Body would make us no different from the political organizations in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Bible the Lord often did not speak to men directly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, the New Testament says that a man can know God from within.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the other hand, we have to see that after the Lord met Saul, He did not speak to him directly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead, He asked Ananias to go to speak to Saul Acts 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the one hand, the life that is seen in the New Testament is a very personal one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the other hand, the Epistle of John says that "you also may have fellowship with us'' 1 John 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This fellowship is mutual.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, we come to God individually by the blood and through the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the other hand, we work together, walk together, coordinate together, and serve together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are those who serve, and there are those who are served.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the records concerning Paul, Luke, Timothy, and others, we see that among them there was coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whatever Paul suggested, the others would agree and carry it out right away.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Timothy was a good brother.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He could have written a letter to Paul, saying, "Brother Paul, I have believed in the Lord for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I can pray, and I can seek after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please give me some liberty!''</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But Timothy did not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, every person comes to God independently and is individually responsible to God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the other hand, no one can be independent, and no one can be free.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you are not coordinated with others, you do not have to tell others; within you, you know it yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Being Delivered from the Self</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A man's mouth may be very clever, but his mouth does not necessarily represent his person.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Sometimes, a person may say "yes'' with his mouth, yet disagree within.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some brothers and sisters only bring their mouths to the meetings; they themselves are not in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One sister once came to me to discuss the question of submission in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Her mouth was saying that she wanted me to handle the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But I knew clearly within me that her mouth and her ears had come, but that her being had not come.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once a person has given up his personal opinions, even though he may not readily consent with his mouth, he will acknowledge within that this is the right thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have to learn to be persons who are delivered from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If fifty radios are receiving the same signal from a station, and my radio receives a different signal from the same station, my radio is definitely not functioning properly.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although we live under the New Testament and although we have the Lord within us, we are at the same time living in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, there is the need for us to be joined to the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the coordination of the Body, we have to learn to care for the feeling of the other members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only then can we have good coordination.</S>
