   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Caring for the Students</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Schooling is a very important matter to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to learn to take care of their education.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the reason God could reveal to him "the pattern on the mountain" Acts 7:20-22; Exo 25:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, had he not been taught by his mother from his youth, he would not have known that he was one of God's people, a people of promise Exo 2:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have assigned six deacons to specifically take care of this matter, and we have asked two sisters to head up this work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If possible, try not to study in a Catholic school.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's commandment is to come out of her and to be separated from her.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not think that we can be broad in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even if it means delaying a school term, we have to help such ones to change schools.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No brother or sister should study in a school alone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There should at least be two.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is better to have more than five or six.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Putting a person in a school is like putting his head in the mouth of a lion; it is hard to tell a lion not to close its mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not presume that every brother and sister is a Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not want to fall into a well, it is best to stay away and not loiter around it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The deacons must also care for the young people and perfect them in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They have to be like Miss Groves, checking with them about their gospel work on the campus and their persistence in the study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to train them to do things properly and nurture them in their consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way they will gospelize their school.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What does it matter if they delay their graduation for half a year for the sake of the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are going to school for the sake of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What difference does it make if they graduate half a year sooner or later?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to put this goal before them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The young ones have to go to school faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If they do not study well, their parents will be critical.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They should do everything for the gospel's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is true not only with their schools but with their friends as well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They should make friends for the sake of the gospel, putting down the names of their friends and classmates in a prayer list and praying for them every day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They have to work on a few at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, they may concentrate on two persons for two months, praying for them every day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever the opportunity arises, they should bring them to a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they are faithful, I believe they will gain school after school in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They have to spend time to pray and to seek the Lord, not being loose in any of these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The brothers who serve as the elders have to supervise the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church is full of activities, but we must not neglect the care and perfection of men just because of busy activities.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to pray and consider everything carefully before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I hope that from now on the church in Hong Kong will preach the gospel in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>CONCERNING THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>WHO ARE IN BUSINESS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many brothers and sisters have handed over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the future when they have needs, we have to remember them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The items that they have handed over are very useful to the migration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It costs a great deal of money to move a group of people to Yi-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some items are worth little here because there is no demand for them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But in Yi-Yang they cost a great deal of money.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not "kill the chicken to get the egg."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The brothers and sisters should still manage their business properly, but they have to be touched to such an extent that "the money disappears while the person remains."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that the person is captured by the Lord while the money is released.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Statistics all over the world prove that the amount of money spent on the gospel determines the number of souls saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I hope that the brothers and sisters will manage their business well so that they can offer up the money they earn to gain more people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Presently, we have eleven brothers who are quite successful in their business.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I hope that they will continue to manage their business.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What they earn above their needs should be offered up as much as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the future when we have more migrations, the money will be useful to help the migrating ones.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some from Tsingtao are ready to migrate, but there is not enough money to support their move.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I sincerely hope that their lack can be made up from here.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to make proper arrangements for all the brothers who are in business and who have handed themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our occupation is for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The goal of a business is to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once we have money we can send it out for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The brothers who have incomes and who are holding jobs should no longer seek to earn money for themselves; they should be for the gospel, and they should seek to open up more opportunities for spreading the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the same way, the students should go to school for the gospel's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The purpose of our job is to sustain our living; but it is also to propagate the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whatever kind of business we do, we need to pray much and look to the Lord to make provisions beyond our plans.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The motive of our taking up an occupation should be for the gospel.</S>
