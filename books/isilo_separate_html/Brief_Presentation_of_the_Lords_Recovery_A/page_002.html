I do not believe that many could answer adequately. Some might answer that the Lord's recovery has recovered matters such as baptism by immersion, the presbytery (that is, the managing and administrating of the church by a group of presbyters, or elders), head covering, and the Lord's table. Although items such as these may be included in the Lord's recovery, all of these are minor things. None of them directly touches God's New Testament economy; none of them involves the divine dispensing or the divine mingling. In contrast, matters such as God's New Testament economy, the dispensing of the divine Trinity into the tripartite being of the believers, the mingling of divinity with humanity, and the building up of the organic Body of Christ are great matters.</P><P>The divine things of God have been with His New Testament people for almost twenty centuries. However, it seems that during this period there has been little improvement in Christian theology. When I speak of improvement, I do not mean that we can change the truth. To illustrate: no one can change the earth. The earth was created by God, and no human hand can change it. But transportation, the means of traveling on the earth, has been improving steadily for nearly six thousand years. History tells us that in order to travel on the earth, the human race first learned to use the wheel. The wheel is a basic element in nearly all forms of transportation. Wagons, bicycles, automobiles, and even jet airplanes utilize the wheel. From the wagon, to the bicycle, to the motor vehicle, to the jet airplane, there has been a great improvement in the means by which man travels on the earth. Many people have studied diligently in the fields of transportation and computer technology, and great improvements have been realized in these fields. But few Christians have devoted their time and energy to study the divine things; consequently, there has been little improvement over the centuries in this field.</P><P>If we are faithful and mean business with the Lord, we must learn something. Matters such as God's New Testament economy and the dispensing of the divine Trinity are not my inventions; all these things can be found in the Bible. For example, by reading Romans 8:2-11 again and again, we will see the dispensing of the divine Trinity. This dispensing takes place first in our spirit (v. 10); then, from our spirit it spreads into our mind (v. 6) to saturate our soul; and eventually, it will permeate our body (v. 11). First, this dispensing makes our spirit life, then it makes our soul life, and finally, it makes our body life. By this dispensing all three parts of our human being will be saturated and permeated with the divine Trinity. Out of this kind of dispensing, a mingling takes place. When one element saturates and permeates another, the two elements become mingled. Such a dispensing and such a mingling are for the building up of the organic Body of Christ, which is composed of all the churches.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
