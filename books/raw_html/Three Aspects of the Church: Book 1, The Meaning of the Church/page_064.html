	 <h2 class="head4">The Desolation of the Temple</h2>
<p>The peak in the history of the temple was the day that Solomon dedicated the temple to God. Not long afterward, the temple began to have problems. However, the temple itself, as a symbol, did not have problems; rather, the children of Israel, as the reality of the temple, had problems before God. There were three reasons for their problems. First, they did not allow God to rule among them; second, they did not fellowship with God but instead worshipped idols; and third, they went to Egypt to seek help. Initially, God gained them and set them apart from Egypt; nevertheless, they forsook God and returned to their former place of captivity. In addition, their priests worshipped idols and did not fellowship with God or allow God to rule in them. At this point, the reality of the temple was gone; hence, there was no need to keep the symbol. Thus, God allowed the Gentiles to come and completely destroy the temple (2 Chron. 36:17-19). Since there was no one whom God had gained, who fellowshipped with God, or who was ruled by God, there was no need for the temple to exist. This is the course of the temple.</p>
<p>The situation of the church is the same today. If there are some whom God is able gain, who are willing to learn to fellowship with God, and who are ruled by God, then on earth God will have the church. If the believers, instead of being gained by God, put the authority of God aside, pursue things other than God as the Israelite priests who worshipped idols, and go back to the world as the children of Israel did in going down to Egypt, the church will be desolated. What is the church? The church is a group of people on the earth whom God gains so that they might fellowship with Him and let Him reign. When these three factors are present, so is the church. If any of the three are missing, there may be a meeting hall but not the church.</p>
<p>We may wonder why God would spend so many years to build the temple through man and then send Gentile armies to destroy it shortly after it was built. This was not merely God&rsquo;s chastisement of the children of Israel; it reflects the deeper significance that God does not want anything empty and without reality. Since the reality of the temple was gone, the symbol could be demolished. Since the three factors related to the origin of the temple were absent, there was no need for the temple to exist on the earth. Hence, the temple was not only destroyed, but the vessels in the temple used for God&rsquo;s service were also carried away to Babylon and put in the house of the idols (Ezra 1:7). This captivity was worse than the desolation that occurred at the time of Eli.</p>
<p>In order to obtain His dwelling, God called the father of the Israelites to come out of Babel, that is, Babylon. However, the children of Israel were eventually taken captive and returned to the original place from which they had been called. God had no intention for the children of Israel to return to Babylon, but their heart was there. Even before they physically returned to Babylon, their inward condition indicated that they had already returned to Babylon. God never desires that His people think one way inwardly and behave another way outwardly. Therefore, God sent people to carry them away as captives to Babylon. Since they were in Babylon inwardly, God sent them there outwardly (2 Chron. 36:17-20).</p>
<p>Both Babylon and Egypt refer to the world. Babylon represents the world associated with idolatry, and Egypt represents the world associated with earning a livelihood. When the children of Israel went down to Egypt, it signified that they were returning to Babylon. Likewise, when the children of Israel were called out of Egypt, it was similar to Abraham being called out of Babylon. The children of Israel were called by God to be the sanctuary of God. Yet because they returned to Babylon in their inward condition, God caused them, together with the vessels in the temple, to be carried away to Babylon outwardly. Since they had their heart set on idols, God brought them to the land of idols. This typifies the course of the church.</p>
<p>The church was originally composed of people separated from the world, who had been gained by God, had fellowship with God, and were ruled by God. The Israelites&rsquo; going down to Egypt and their returning to Babylon typify that God allows the church to return to the world. The desolation of the church is typified by the devastation of the temple.</p>
