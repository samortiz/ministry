   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEEDING TO BE CONSTITUTED AS PRECIOUS STONES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Furthermore, the wall of the city is altogether built with precious stones Rev 21:18a .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is also a matter with great spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A precious stone is not created originally by God; rather, it is formed from something created that has passed through years of constitution by being pressed underneath the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we want to be truly built up, we not only need to be broken by God, but we also need to allow God to do a constituting work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to be under God's constituting work for many years before we can become precious stones to shine forth God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every descendant of Adam is originally a piece of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God created Adam, using a piece of clay taken from the earth as material.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, all of us today who have been born of Adam are also clay.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, since we have been saved with God's life, in God's eyes we are no longer clay but stones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Immediately after Simon Peter confessed that the Lord was the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said to him, "You are Peter" Matt 16:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Peter is a translated word which means "a stone."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, every saved person is a "Peter," a stone, used by God for the building of this city.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, in the New Jerusalem the materials used by God for building are not merely ordinary stones but precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, it is not enough that we were saved and became stones; we still need to become precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This requires us to put ourselves in the hands of God so that He can do the work of constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the brothers and sisters should consider whether they are an ordinary stone or a precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I believe that many of us can say, "Formerly, as a piece of clay I was really vile.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But praise and thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because He has cleansed and regenerated me, now I am a piece of stone."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I believe that we all can say this by faith, but I still would like to ask, what kind of stone are you?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not all stones are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Are you a precious stone, or are you an ordinary stone?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This time on my return trip from abroad I went to Jerusalem and its surrounding regions for a visit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The deepest impression I received is that there are stones throughout the land.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are big stones as well as small stones; everywhere there are stones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One day the driver of our car said to me, "If all the stones here could be changed into bread, we would be rich."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, mere stones are not precious.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Are you merely a stone, or are you a precious stone?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a big question.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The precious stones on the wall of the city are not only precious but also transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes when you meet a brother, you can sense that he is not only a stone but that he is also truly a precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is transparent within.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the contrary, there are times when you meet someone, and not only do you sense that he is not a precious stone, but you feel that he is not even like a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You feel that he is a lump of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His living is muddled, he does things loosely, he speaks freely, and nothing is solid in him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who know about precious stones know that a piece of precious stone is formed through much pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This pressure causes a precious stone to become very solid in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A lump of earth is loose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you shake it in your hand, it falls apart right away.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, it is not so with a precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It will not break even if you dash it on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some brothers and sisters are really solid and strong like precious stones, but there are also some brothers and sisters who are loose like a lump of earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When you meet them, their words flow out of them very easily.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is as if it is easier for them to speak than to do anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They do not know what it means to be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are not precious stones even in the smallest amount.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It should be no wonder to us that they cannot participate in the building.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Experts tell us that precious stones are formed not only by pressure, but that during the process of formation they also need to be burned by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Pressure, burning, and constitution are necessary for the transformation into precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the New Jerusalem there is nothing loose; rather, it is all precious stones, and it is all pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everything has been pressed, constituted, and burned; hence, it is solid and transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Likewise, for the building up of the church every brother and sister must experience the work of pressure and the work of heat.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Often brothers and sisters ask me, "Brother Lee, we heard that you are going to such and such a place next week, is it true?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I tell them, "I do not know!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even I myself do not yet know when I am going, how do you know?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You can tell how loose many people are by the loose situation of the spreading of rumors among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the face of this you can only sigh and say, "In the church few people are solid; few have been pressed, burned, and constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, few have been built up!"</S>
