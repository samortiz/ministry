<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Taking the Wife of the Dead Uriah<br>as His Wife Right after Her Lamentation<br>for Her Husband, Murdered by David</H2><P>When the wife of Uriah heard that her husband was dead, she made lamentation for him. As soon as her mourning was over, David took her as his wife (11:26-27a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Displeasing Jehovah to the Uttermost</H2><P>The thing that David did displeased Jehovah to the uttermost (v. 27b). David's sin is referred to elsewhere in the Bible. First Kings 15:5 says, "David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite." Even in the genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1 there is a word regarding this: "David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah" (v. 6b). This genealogy does not say "of Bath-sheba" but "of her who had been the wife of Uriah," to emphasize this great sin of David's.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. GOD'S PUNISHING CONDEMNATION</H2><P>Second Samuel 12:1-15a speaks of God's punishing condemnation of David's sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Through Nathan the Prophet</H2><P>God's punishing condemnation came to David through Nathan the prophet (v. 1a). In chapter seven Nathan had helped David realize that the need in the universe is for God to work Himself into human beings and to build Himself into them. In chapter twelve Nathan came to David to remind him of what he had done and to rebuke him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By a Parable Leading David<br>to Condemn Himself for What He Did<br>in Murdering Uriah and Robbing Him of His Wife</H2><P>Because David the king had power and because he could have misused this power to kill Nathan the prophet, Nathan was careful in speaking to David. Instead of directly condemning David, Nathan told him a parable which led him to condemn himself for what he had done in murdering Uriah and robbing him of his wife (vv. 1b-7a). When David heard about the rich man who took the poor man's ewe lamb, David's "anger was greatly kindled against the man. And he said to Nathan, As Jehovah lives, the man who has done this is worthy of death; and he shall restore the ewe lamb fourfold because he has done this thing and because he had no pity" (vv. 5-6). Then Nathan said to David, "You are the man" (v. 7a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Referring Him to All the Things<br>That God Had Done for Him</H2><P>Nathan went on to refer David to all the things that God had done for him (vv. 7b-8). Especially Nathan referred David to the fact that God had given him the house of Israel and of Judah. Then Nathan said that, if what had been given was too little, God would have added to David even more things.</P>
