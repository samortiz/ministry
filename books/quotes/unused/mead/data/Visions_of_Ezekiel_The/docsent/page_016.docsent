   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Shining as Burnished Brass</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The calf's hoofs are shining like burnished brass.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The shining of the brass comes from the heat of the furnace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more the brass is burned and tested, the more it shines.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This proves that we need a walk that has been tested and burned by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then our walk will be like shining brass, giving people light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our walk will enlighten people and become a kind of shining to people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have been tested by the Lord and examined by the Lord, then our walk will shine like burnished brass.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It will give people light; it will test them, and cause them to realize whether or not their walk is right.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If in the church life we have been tested and examined by the Lord, our walk will be like shining brass giving light to others, shining on others, enlightening others, and testing others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are careless and sloppy, lacking discernment, everything is about the same to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The black, the white, and the gray will all be about the same.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means we are unable to exercise any discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If this is our case, our walk will be like a black stone, a darkened stone, with no light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If our walk is a walk of discernment, we will discern all the things in our Christian walk, and eventually our hoofs will be like shining brass wherever we go.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our walk will shine upon others, giving them light and testing them to see whether they are right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Skipping in Life</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible says that the calf is something that skips and jumps Psa 29:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that the calf is alive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our Christian walk must not be a dead walk.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It must be a skipping, jumping walk a walk which is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A calf is young and vigorous, full of energy, always skipping.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all must be like a young calf full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to come to the meetings like skipping calves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>May the Lord make us to skip like calves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What about your walk?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes the young people behave like older people, not knowing how to skip in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In some of the meetings they are glued to their chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They must learn how to skip.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All these are points concerning the Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a walk that is not crooked, but straight and strict.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is also a walk with discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is a walk that shines and gives light to others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It tests others and is always skipping and full of life and energy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we talk of feet as shining brass, we must remember Revelation 1:15, where it tells us that the Lord Jesus' feet are like shining brass.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means we all must have a walk like the Lord's walk.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a later chapter we will see that all four living creatures are coordinated together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They could only be coordinated by this kind of life and this kind of walk.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The life is a life with eagle's wings and human hands, and the walk is a walk of the calf's hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By having this kind of life and this kind of walk, we as the living creatures can be coordinated into one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Coordination is the central point in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But that coordination depends upon all the foregoing items: the wind, the cloud, the fire, the electrum, and the four living creatures with the four faces having the eagle's wings, having human hands, and having a walk with the calf's hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The proper coordination depends upon all these items.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must have such a Christian life and such a Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need a life that has the wings of an eagle and the hands of a man, and we must have a walk that has the straight hoofs of a calf.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May the Lord impress us with all these aspects so that we may have the proper church life in coordination.</S>
