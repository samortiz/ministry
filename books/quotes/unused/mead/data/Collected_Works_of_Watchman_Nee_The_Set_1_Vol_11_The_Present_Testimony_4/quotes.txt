[2]  God has only one center, which is Christ Christ and Him crucified.
[3]  THE MEEKEST MAN Record of a Special Conference in October 1931 Issue No. 32 Scripture Reading: Acts 7:22; Exo 2:10; 4:24
[4]  We will now pay attention to the meaning of God's wisdom and man's wisdom.
[5]  We will not only see how God judges and rejects man's wisdom in his living, but also how a man can please God in his work.
[6]  The first thing we should notice is that there are three crucial items in the flesh that oppose God.
[7]  If we have not dealt with these three items, we can never expect to do a good work for God.
[8]  The condition for us to work for God is not to attend a seminary, have an orthodox faith, run zealously, or love men's souls.
[9]  The condition is that we must be fully gained by God.
[10]  God needs men and women who have been crucified and who will preach the cross of His Son.
[11]  In 1 Corinthians 1 and 2, Paul said that he knew only Christ and Him crucified.
[12]  He wanted to help God save the people of Israel, but God did not need man to help Him.
[13]  There are many people that God will not use, not because they lack wisdom and power, but because they have too much wisdom and too much power.
[14]  In verse 13, Moses again asked, "When I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is His name? what shall I say unto them?"
[15]  Nevertheless, it is of no benefit to merely realize that we are incapable in ourselves.
[16]  The most important thing is to know the power of God.
[17]  While it is important to not have any self-confidence and self-trust God treasures this attitude and leads us to this attitude , we will still not please God if we stop at this and refuse to trust in Him further.
[18]  If God has promised us the gift of speaking, and we still hesitate, we offend God.
[19]  We have to watch out for a withdrawal that goes beyond humility and a timidity that goes beyond carefulness; we have to be careful or in the process of giving up our trust in ourselves, we will also give up our trust in God.
[20]  Have you given up your natural power and wisdom?
[21]  If you have not, you cannot do the work of God.
[22]  We thank God that He has given us another opportunity to serve our brothers.
[23]  However, our goal and our center are not our brothers.
[24]  We are here to testify for the Son of God, and our heart is set on His gaining the preeminence in all things.
[25]  Since God has led us in the past, we believe that He will lead us on in the future.
[26]  WATCH AND PRAY Issue No. 33 Scripture Reading: Eph 6:10-20
[27]  We are very familiar with this passage of Scripture.
[28]  This afternoon we will not consider the whole passage.
[29]  For the sake of time, we will not even consider the first and last parts of this verse; we will only consider the few words in the middle: "praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance."
[30]  But even if we have prayed and petitioned at every time, it is still not enough; we have to have one thing: to watch unto this in all perseverance.
[31]  Therefore, we should not only be watchful and on the alert concerning the time to pray and not only sustain this attitude until the time we pray, but we should also sustain it when we are praying so that we might have a proper prayer.
[32]  Therefore, before you engage yourself in the work of prayer, you must first pray that God will enable you to pray and deliver you from everything that hinders you from praying so that you will not become weak and sleepy.
[33]  If we want to serve the Lord properly in the matter of prayer, we must be very watchful and observing in the matter of time, energy, and everything that we pray about, and we must do this until all the things that we pray for have come to pass.
[34]  This is why Satan specifically tries to disrupt our prayer life, so that we will not have the time or the energy to pray, so that we will use many useless words in our prayer, so that we will miss many items in our prayer, and so that we will become negligent after we pray and fail to note the changes that happen afterward.
[35]  The word "live" in this verse can be translated two ways according to Greek.
[36]  It can be translated "have life," or "live."
[37]  Sometimes it lasts for one or two weeks; sometimes it goes away in three to five days.
[38]  Once the dryness goes away, the joy comes back.
[39]  Formerly, their reading of the Bible and praying were such an effort and drag that it felt like trying to recite a forgotten passage.
[40]  Now it seems that the fellowship with God is resumed.
[41]  When we read the Bible during a period of excitement and joy, we have a great interest in reading.
[42]  But are we reading the Bible because of our interest or because the Bible is the Word of God?
[43]  Is the purpose of our prayer to seek God in His presence, or is the goal the joy we feel in our prayer?
[44]  At the height of our excitement, we do not realize that we are doing these things for ourselves; we think that we are doing these things for God.
[45]  We have to realize that the times we are most excited, when we seem to be living on the mountaintop, perhaps are the times when we are in our flesh the most!
[46]  Under these conditions, God is teaching us a lesson; He makes us realize that our peak spiritual experiences are just something of ourselves.
[47]  This cycle will continue until God arrives at His purpose when we realize that our desire for joy is for ourselves and not for God.
[48]  During the times when we are happy, when we feel that God is so near us that we can almost touch the Lord Jesus and God, we would rather lock ourselves in a room and not see anybody.
[49]  If you can overcome the feeling of dryness, you can overcome your environment.
[50]  The feeling of dryness is the most difficult to overcome.
[51]  If you exercise your will to say, "I will read the Bible, I will pray, and I will testify," even though you are living a dry and parched life, you will find that you can overcome all kinds of environments, no matter how great they may be.
[52]  Two weeks ago I read many verses concerning living by faith.
[53]  They are unreliable because the God we trust has not changed, the work of the Lord has not changed, and the work of the Holy Spirit has not changed.
[54]  For example, we may have lost all taste for reading the Bible, we may not pray well, and we may feel that we do not have power in our work.
[55]  He went to Mr. Taylor and asked him, "Did you consecrate yourself to God when you left England to come to China?" Mr. Taylor said, "Yes, of course I consecrated myself to God." Mr. Frost then asked, "Have you ever taken anything that you consecrated back, during the past years?" He answered, "No." "Has your love for souls diminished?" He answered again, "No." "Has your love for the Lord changed?" The answer was again "No." "Have you become worldly?" "No." "Have you decreased your work in saving souls?" "No." Mr. Frost then said, "If you have all these things, why should you care about your feelings? What can the feelings do?" This apparent failure of Mr. Taylor taught Mr. Frost a lesson that we should not care about our feelings as long as the intention of the heart is right.
[56]  Suppose one first hears a truth, such as how to overcome his temper or his rashness, or the truth of Romans 6:6, about the crucifixion of the old man by the Lord's death for the annulling of the body of sin, so that one will no longer be a slave to sin.
[57]  As a result of hearing this, he becomes happy.
[58]  He goes home and tells others that from now on, he will no longer lose his temper, for he has received an overcoming truth.
[59]  Many believers think that great joy and excitement mean power.
[60]  But I have to tell you that excitement in one's feelings is actually a hindrance to a life of faith.
[61]  God has to strip you of everything you have received through your feeling, until only God and His Word remain.
[62]  He causes you to believe in a calm way; there is no feeling, no excitement.
[63]  This time God causes you to experience the real victory, not like the previous idealistic victory, because you have passed through the tunnel experience.
[64]  The second conference was held in October 1931 on the subject: "The Covenant of God and the Wisdom of God."
[65]  The second part of this issue contains the notes of the messages of our Third Overcomer Conference.
[66]  Publishing the full text of these messages will not only be time-consuming as far as the editing work is concerned, but it will also take up too much room.
[67]  We roughly estimate that there would be over two hundred thousand words.
[68]  OF THE THIRD OVERCOMER CONFERENCE Outlines of Four Messages
[69]  Given on January 22 and 23, 1934 Issue No. 34 1 THE PURSUIT OF THOSE WHO SERVE THE LORD Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[70]  44:9-26, 28, 31 "minister" in verse 11 can be translated "serve" ; Luke 17:7-10 The Difference between Working for the Lord
[71]  The Lord wants us to serve Him more than He wants us to work for Him.
[72]  OF THE THIRD OVERCOMER CONFERENCE 2 THE HIDDEN LIFE Scripture Reading: S.S. 4:12; Hosea 14:5-7; Mark 4:5-6, 16-17 A Shallow Life
[73]  Mark 4 speaks of the condition of man's heart and how it receives the word.
[74]  It does not apply only to sinners hearing the gospel, but also to believers receiving the word of edification.
[75]  What is the kind of life that pleases the Lord and lasts long?
[76]  If you have never been dealt with by the Lord or have not fully consecrated yourself, the day will come when the Lord will take you to a place where you do not want to go, and you will reject His choice.
[77]  OF THE THIRD OVERCOMER CONFERENCE 3 THE CONDITIONS FOR SPIRITUAL GROWTH Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 4:1-6; Matt 5:6; Luke 1:53 The Reason for Not Growing
[78]  The only reasons for the believers' failures and lack of growth before God are 1 not knowing themselves and 2 not knowing the fullness of the Lord.
[79]  At a Keswick Convention, one anonymous Christian said that all the failures of believers are from these two reasons.
[80]  OF THE THIRD OVERCOMER CONFERENCE 4 THE PRAYER THAT COOPERATES WITH GOD Scripture Reading: Isa 62:6; Ezek.
[81]  God works along certain lines and according to certain principles.
[82]  Therefore, the more thorough our prayers are, the more the will of God will be accomplished, and Satan's deceptions will not be able to come in. We should cast a net of prayer "by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time" Eph 6:18 , so that God's will can prevail in all areas, and Satan will not find one crack through which to come in. In our prayer we should pay attention to three things: 1 to whom we are praying, 2 for whom we are praying, and 3 against whom we are praying.

[84]  Why did God choose man, commission the prophets, send the Savior, give us the Holy Spirit, set up the church, and establish the kingdom?
[85]  Scripture Reading: The First Group: Concerning God's Plan: Eph 3:9-11 "purpose" can be translated as "plan" ; 1:8-11 "will" can be translated as "plan" ; Rev 4:11 "will" can be translated as "pleasure" ; 1 Cor 8:6; Rom 11:36 The Second Group: Concerning God's Plan to Hand Over All Things to Christ: Eph 4:10; John 3:35; 13:3; 16:15; 17:7; Heb 1:2 The Third Group: Concerning Christ Creating All Things: Heb 1:2b, 3b; John 1:1-3, 10; Col 1:16-17; 1 Cor 8:6b The Fourth Group: Concerning Christ Creating Man: 1 Cor 11:3; Gal 4:4-7; Rom 8:28b-30 "purpose" can be translated as "plan" ; 1 Pet 1:2a; 1 Cor 1:9; Heb 2:5-10; 1 Cor 3:21-23 The Fifth Group: Concerning the Condition in Eternity after Redemption: Phil 2:9-11; Rev 4:11; 5:12-14; 1 John 3:2 The Sixth Group: Concerning God's Ordination before the Foundation of the World: John 17:24; Eph 1:4-5; Titus 1:2; 2 Tim 1:9-10; 1 Pet 1:20 The Seventh Group: Concerning God's Ordination since the Foundation of the World: Matt 25:34; Heb 4:3; 9:26; Rev 13:8; 17:8 I. CHRIST BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD Christ Having the First Place in God's Plan
[86]  This plan was to head up all things in heaven and on earth, under Christ and in Christ.
[87]  In eternity past, God ordained that there be a house and that the second person of the Godhead, the Son, rule over this house.
[88]  God predestinated man to be conformed to the image of His Son.
[89]  God wants us to be conformed to the image of His Son, which means that He uses His Son as the mold.
[90]  God wants us not only to have His Son's life, but His Son's glory as well Rom 8:29-30 .
[91]  God wants to dispense His Son's life to many people, making them God's many sons so that His Son may become the Firstborn among many sons, having the first place in all things.
[92]  After the Lord's death and resurrection, "God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father" Phil 2:9-11 .
[93]  CHRIST IN REDEMPTION Christ Having the First Place in Redemption
[94]  A few days ago we saw that "Christ is all and in all."
[95]  What God planned before the foundation of the world is "that He Himself might have the first place in all things."
[96]  God's plan has one goal with two aspects: 1 to have all things expressing Christ's glory, so that Christ may have the first place in all things, and 2 to have man conformed to Christ, having His life and His glory.
[97]  Colossians 1 tells us these two things: 1 Christ has the first place in all things, and 2 Christ is the Head of the church.
[98]  Let us go on to see how Christ's redemption solves God's two problems.
[99]  The goals of Christ's redemption are that we be His particular people Titus 2:14 and living sacrifice Rom 12:1 , that we would live to Him and die to Him Rom 14:7-9 , that we would be the temple of the Holy Spirit glorifying God 1 Cor 6:19-20 , that we would live to Him 2 Cor 5:15 , and that whether through life or through death, Christ would be magnified in our body, so that for us to live is Christ Phil 1:20-21 .
[100]  God works through the cross, which in turn works through the environment to dig into us deeply, causing us to know Christ and be filled with Him, so that Christ may have the first place in us.
[101]  V. CHRIST IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE AND EXPERIENCE Christ Having the First Place
[102]  in the Life and Experience of the Christians Christ Having the First Place
[103]  in the Christian Life Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 5:14-15; Gal 2:20
[104]  Christ being our life and Christ being our power are two different things.
[105]  If God were to cause us to have power, it would only make us powerful persons; Christ would not have the first place in us.
[106]  I live because of the life of Christ and also because of "the faith in the Son of God" v. 20b . When we believed and received the Son of God, not only did His life enter into us, but His faith also entered into us.
[107]  The experience of a Christian has two sides: one is sweet, the other, painful.
[108]  God causes us to experience a sweet and suffering life in order that Christ may have the first place in all things.
[109]  Seek first God's kingdom and God's righteousness, then God will add to us all that we need.
[110]  God will listen both to the prayers that we utter the prayers we pray that are for God's business as well as the prayers that we do not utter the prayers we pray that are for our own affairs .
[111]  It is not how much biblical knowledge we have, but how much consecration we have, how much we have put in God's hand, and how much we have allowed Christ to have the first place.
[112]  God allows sickness and weakness to come to our body in order that we may learn to 1 pray at night, 2 be watchful as sparrows on the rooftop, 3 know that the Lord makes our bed for us, 4 deal with sin, 5 wait quietly, 6 touch the hem of the Lord's garment, 7 know that the Lord sent His word to heal us, 8 know that through sickness God causes us to become useful persons, 9 know that holiness is healing, and 10 know that the Lord's resurrection power removes our weakness, sickness, and death.
[113]  God deprives us of our possessions, relatives, health, and goodness in order that we would take Christ as our satisfaction, be filled with Christ, and allow Him to have the first place in all things.
[114]  CHRIST IN CHRISTIAN WORK AND MESSAGES Christ Having the First Place
[115]  in Christian Work and Messages Scripture Reading: Eph 2:10; 1 Cor 2:2; 2 Cor 4:5
[116]  Whether it be inward matters or outward matters, we should allow Christ to have the first place in all things.
[117]  We ourselves must be the first to be broken by God and allow Christ to have the first place in us, before we can lead others to receive Christ as Lord and allow Christ to have the first place in them.
[118]  THE OVERCOMER OF GOD Outlines of Eight Messages Issue No. 34 I. GOD'S ETERNAL PLAN AND THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23 God's Eternal Plan
[119]  God had an eternal plan before the foundation of the world.
[120]  The first is to make all things express Christ, and the second is to make man like Christ, that man would have His life and glory.
[121]  While God desires to accomplish these two goals, He encounters two problems: Satan's rebellion and man's fall.
[122]  God created man in order that first he would have the life and glory of Christ, and He intended to put all things under man's subjection so that man would bring everything back to God.
[123]  All victories should take the victory of Christ as a pattern: "As I also overcame."
[124]  The Bible tells us that we have three different enemies: 1 the flesh, within us, 2 the world, outside of us, and 3 Satan, above and below us.
[125]  WHO ARE GOD'S OVERCOMERS Scripture Reading: Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21 The Failure of the Church
[126]  The reason that the church is on the earth is to maintain the victory of Christ on the cross and bind Satan in each locality as the Lord bound him on Calvary.
[127]  On the cross the Lord has condemned Satan according to the law.
[128]  Now God desires that the church execute this judgment on the earth.
[129]  After the failure of the church, God searched for a small number of people in the church to become His overcomers, those who would bear the responsibility which the church should have picked up but did not.
[130]  Scripture Reading: Josh 3:6, 8, 13, 15-17; 4:10-11, 15-18; 2 Cor 4:10-12 The Work of the Overcomer
[131]  In considering the overcomers, we need to pay attention to two things: 1 God chose a few persons to take the place of all the people who failed.
[132]  2 God made the few carry out God's command first, and then He worked the same thing into the majority.
[133]  God chose the Israelites to be a kingdom of priests among all people Exo 19:5-6 , but they failed because they worshipped the golden calf at Mount Sinai.
[134]  God then chose the sons of Levi, who had done His command, to be His overcomers to replace the Israelites as the priests Exo 32:15-29 .
[135]  God had to deal with Moses and David to the extent that they would no longer try to fulfill God's will by their flesh or exercise their flesh to render God the help.
[136]  The overcomers are the ones who allow their "self" to remain in the place of death in order that others might have the life.
[137]  These ones are like the priests who bore the ark through the Jordan, who themselves stood in the place of death in order that the people of God could pass through.
[138]  Therefore, God must first deal with you through matters; you first must be dealt with in the matter of faith and allow God's faith to be constituted in you before you can convey to others what is constituted in you.
[139]  6:1-6, 11-35; 7:1-8, 19-25; 8:1-4
[140]  Now we come to the matter of selecting the overcomers, of how to separate the overcomers from the non-overcomers.
[141]  Numbers says that every male of the Israelites from twenty years old and upward had to be a soldier to go forth to war for the Lord.
[142]  In order for God to deliver them all, He had to select three hundred men who would fight the battle which the others should but did not fight.
[143]  THE OVERCOMER'S PRAYER Scripture Reading: Matt 18:18; Eph 6:12-13; 1:20-22; 2:6; Mark 11:23-24 Authoritative Prayer Praying with Authority
[144]  To be God's overcomer, one has to learn to pray with authority by exercising Christ's authority.
[145]  In the Bible prayer is not merely a petition but a representation of authority.
[146]  We should first allow God to defeat us by the cross, that is we should allow ourselves to be defeated before God.
[147]  AT THE END OF THIS AGE Scripture reading: Gen 3:14-15; Rev 12:1-11
[148]  The two passages we read today correspond with each other.
[149]  One is in the beginning of the Bible while the other is at the end. In Genesis 3 we have 1 the serpent, 2 the woman, and 3 the seed.
[150]  These two portions of the Word show us two different attitudes that are displayed before God.
[151]  Before we look into these matters using the Word with the shining of God's light, I want the brothers and sisters to know what are our responsibilities and what is God's continual focus in the church in this age.
[152]  Ezekiel 44:11, 15-16 says, "Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them....But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord God: they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge."
[153]  We must see clearly that outwardly there may not be much difference between ministering to the house and ministering to the Lord.
[154]  You may try your best to render help to the brothers, to diligently save the sinners, and to labor much in the service to manage the church.
[155]  On top of these, you may do your best to admonish others to read the Bible and pray.
[156]  I can tell you frankly that he is not doing this for the Lord because many times he is not able to do the things he does not like, even though the Lord really wants him to.
[157]  For this reason, we must pray to God to grace us that we may know what it is to minister to God and to the house.
[158]  Many like to exercise their muscles outside because by killing cattle and sheep, they can exercise their strength and fleshly energy.
[159]  However, if you ask them to go to a quiet, solitary place where no one can see them, they are not able to do this.
[160]  Brothers, we cannot find a genuine servant of God or true minister to the Lord who does not minister in this way.
[161]  No doubt, such a thing may be very good.
[162]  Standing means to not walk or move; it means to remain in a place, to stand still and wait for the Lord's order.
[163]  We will only do what the Lord directs us to do; otherwise, we will not do anything.
[164]  If we want to minister to the Lord in the Holy of Holies, we must spend time before the Lord and pray more.
[165]  We know that God is holy and righteous in the Holy Place and that God is glorious in the Holy of Holies.
[166]  Every time we come before God, we must first realize how we are able to stand before God.
[167]  We have only two positions here: one is that we are dead and have dropped everything of the old creation; the other is that we are resurrected and are serving God, learning to stand before Him, listening to His order, and waiting in His presence to minister to Him.
[168]  Those who ministered to God before Him had to be clothed with linen garments, linen bonnets on their heads, and linen breeches on their loins.
[169]  I can only say that I very much enjoy reading Acts 13: "Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers....And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them" vv.
[170]  HAVING BEEN MADE DEAD TO THE LAW Issue No. 35 Scripture Reading: Rom 7:4, 15-19
[171]  Romans 7 is a very familiar chapter to us.
[172]  Not only is it familiar to us in our reading, it is also familiar to us in our experience.
[173]  What the Lord wants me to speak on today is the way to be delivered from the demand of the law, that is, the way to be delivered from ourselves.
[174]  The problem is absolutely not with God but with man, because man does not want to be delivered and has not paid the price for deliverance.
[175]  Romans 7 is a great chapter, and we cannot cover all of it today.
[176]  In this verse, the first thing mentioned is: "So then, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law."
[177]  Brothers, have we realized that we need to be delivered from the law?
[178]  If I say that we should be delivered from sin, everybody understands because sin is loathsome, and it is right to be delivered from it.
[179]  If I say that we should be delivered from the world, everyone also understands because the world has crucified our Lord and is indeed evil.
[180]  But when he says that we have been delivered from the law or that we are dead to the law, we do not know how to respond.
[181]  Brothers and sisters, if we desire to experience deliverance, it is very important that we realize that God has no more hope in us.
[182]  In brief, the law is all the demands that God places on those who are in Adam and all the commands that God gives to those who are in Adam, commands that tell them what they should or should not do.
[183]  Not only can God put us under the law, but we, who are in Adam, can also put ourselves under the law, hoping that we can please God.
[184]  We have seen that, first, we need to be delivered from the law.
[185]  But how can we be delivered from the law?
[186]  Death can deliver us from the law because as long as we live, the law will have a demand on us.
[187]  We make resolutions to overcome when we are very defiled, when we struggle day and night with sin, when we are in the turbulent current of the world, and when we feel that our life is very wrong.
[188]  Rather, when we see Christ's accomplished fact on the cross and realize that God has included us in this death of Christ, we are led to the inevitable conclusion that we have died.
[189]  We see what God has ordained for us, we see how we have become one with Christ, and we see how, in Him, we can receive all that He has accomplished.
[190]  What we have seen thus far is that God has crucified us with Christ.
[191]  This alone, however, is not enough; there needs to be something more.
[192]  It is that we "might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God."
[193]  Not only do we need a deliverance on the negative side, we also need a joining on the positive side.
[194]  For this reason, God has not only crucified us on the negative side but has also joined us, who have been delivered from the law, to the resurrected Christ.
[195]  A SHALLOW LIFE Issue No. 36 Scripture Reading: S.S. 4:12; Hosea 14:5-7; Mark 4:5-6; 16-17
[196]  Mark 4 has many important things to say concerning the Christian life.
[197]  Concerning this passage, the first thing that brothers and sisters often ask is whether this passage refers to saved ones or unsaved ones.
[198]  But we should not ask whether the seeds refer to saved ones or unsaved ones.
[199]  Please remember that the principle and teaching covered here have to do absolutely with the condition of the one who is receiving the word; they do not have anything to do with whether or not a person is saved.
[200]  I know that all of us desire before the Lord that we become believers who please God.
[201]  The Lord Himself gave an explanation: "And likewise, these are the ones being sown on the rocky places, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy.
[202]  Yet they have no root in themselves, but last only for a time; then when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word, immediately they are stumbled" vv.
[203]  According to the Lord, they have met with affliction and persecution and have fallen back.
[204]  I know that many of you have argued with God this way.
[205]  I also know that many of you are still in the midst of arguments and have not settled them yet.
[206]  You continue to complain about the way God has dealt with you.
[207]  Brothers, let me tell you that the outcome of such arguments will determine how you live from this point forward.
[208]  If you win, God will fail, and there will be no other result but dryness.
[209]  All spiritual dryness comes when you begin to argue with God, when He has failed and you have won.
[210]  Brothers and sisters, if you are in the middle of a dispute with God and the matter is not yet settled, if there is an unresolved problem between you and God, and if you are still not clear concerning the will of God, I can frankly say that this is very dangerous.
[211]  Therefore, if you have not counted the cost and are not ready to be broken by Him, you will find yourselves dissatisfied with God, and God will be dissatisfied with you.
[212]  But if you realize that it is right to obey the Lord and do not want your life to dry up, wanting instead to have a strong and vigorous life, you will have to allow God to test the reality of the word you received with affliction and persecution.
[213]  He said that the first reason is that there is not enough earth.
[214]  This means that the earth is not deep; there is not much depth to the earth.
[215]  A person in this condition has just a small amount; everything about him is shallow.
[216]  If you do not have a secret or hidden life before God and if you do not have any secret prayer, reading, or obedience, I can say very frankly that you do not have any roots.
[217]  Those with shallow earth may still have a desire for deep roots, but there are rocks that block the way.
[218]  If we allow God to break our hardened heart, if we do not live by our feelings or the environment, and if we ask God to give us more of a hidden life, we will see forward progress.
[219]  The following is a message released by Brother Watchman Nee in Shanghai in January 1934, during the third Overcomer Conference.
[220]  Today we will look at one question: what are we?
[221]  Following this we come to the period from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century.
[222]  A talk given at Hardoon Road, Shanghai on January 3, 1934; translated from notes taken by Brother K.H. Weigh.
[223]  The first thing we want to see is how the workers are raised up.
[224]  If some brothers in a locality where meetings have started are burdened to go to another locality to work, they must be responsible before the Lord and also have the approval of all the brothers and sisters in the locality where they meet.
[225]  How do we recognize whether or not a person is a worker?
[226]  All of the workers must have the common faith concerning the Lord's work and His person.
[227]  These basic truths must be kept in common by us.
[228]  First, workers should not make others feel that they are poor.
