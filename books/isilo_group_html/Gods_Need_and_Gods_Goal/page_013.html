<h1 class="title">FAILURES ENABLING MAN<br />
TO EXPERIENCE MORE OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 51:16-17; Luke 15:23-24; 2 Cor. 12:8-9</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that God does not lead us on a straight path; it is a path that has ups and downs. In this chapter we will see that failures enable us to experience more of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FAILURES BEING PRECIOUS</h2>
<p>As humans, we appreciate victory more than failure, and as children of God, we would be very satisfied if we experienced no failures in our daily living. From our experience, however, we should realize that failure is more precious than victory. When I say this, I have no intention of encouraging us to fail. It is useless to encourage someone to experience failure, and it is useless to encourage someone to seek victory. Whether a person stands or falls is unrelated to the encouragement he receives. We may think that we are able to stand because we are strong or that we will fail because we are weak, but those who have sufficient experience know that it is not up to us whether we stand or fall.</p>
<p>Romans 14:4 says, &ldquo;Who are you who judge another&rsquo;s household servant? To his own master he stands or falls.&rdquo; This word shows that our standing and our falling depend on the Lord. We were created by the Lord. Our life and our breath do not depend upon ourselves but upon the Lord. Likewise, our ability to stand and overcome does not depend on ourselves but on the Lord. On the one hand, the Lord encourages us to stand and not to fall, to go forward and not to shrink back, to be victorious and not to be defeated. On the other hand, none of these matters&mdash;standing or falling, going forward or shrinking back, and being victorious or defeated&mdash;depends on ourselves. All these matters are in the Lord&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE RICHES OF GOD</h2>
<p>We all are familiar with the Lord&rsquo;s story in Luke 15 concerning a certain man having two sons (vv. 11-32). This story illustrates a great principle that is difficult for many people to understand when they first begin to follow the Lord. Only those who have followed the Lord for a considerable period of time understand the principle that God&rsquo;s riches can be experienced only by those who have been defeated. Those who have never been defeated cannot experience the riches of God. The older son in Luke 15 apparently had no experience of failure, but he also had no enjoyment of his father&rsquo;s riches. Instead, it was the younger son who enjoyed the father&rsquo;s riches (vv. 23-24).</p>
<p>It is very difficult for someone who has never experienced failure to be saved. A person with no experience of failure is hindered from receiving salvation, because in his own eyes, he is perfect, strong, and able to stand. I knew a person who was very highly regarded by others, but he was also boastful. On one hand, he seemingly had a humble disposition, but on the other hand, he was boastful of the fact that he had never been in trouble and had never failed. He often said that many believers in Jesus and even preachers were inferior to him, even though he was an unbeliever. From his perspective, he truly was an excellent man.</p>
<p>One day, when I was sitting with a senior co-worker, I asked, &ldquo;How can we help such a person?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Brother, your friend is like the older son in Luke 15, who kept his father&rsquo;s orders and never disobeyed his father. Just like this older son, your friend has never fallen and has never been in trouble.&rdquo; Then the senior co-worker asked me, &ldquo;Why do you think that your friend needs salvation?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;He needs salvation because he is still a sinner.&rdquo; The co-worker said, &ldquo;Yes, he is a sinner in Adam, but he is not a sinner in his own eyes.&rdquo; Then I asked, &ldquo;What should we do? How can he be saved?&rdquo; The senior co-worker replied with a very interesting word. He said, &ldquo;It is not enough for him to recognize that he is a sinner in Adam. In order for him to be saved, he must also see that he is a sinner in himself. He has to pass through a great fall and suffer a great defeat in order for him to be willing to be saved.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;But it is dangerous to experience such a great fall.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Are you more concerned for your friend than God is? Look at the younger son. God allowed him to fall so far that he eventually was in a distant place dwelling with hogs. God allowed him to be in such a situation because only those who fall can enjoy the riches of God. Your friend needs to fall; without falling, he cannot be saved.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I do not like to hear that a person cannot be saved unless he falls.&rdquo; The co-worker said, &ldquo;I understand, but it is not easy for an &lsquo;older&rsquo; son to be saved. It is the &lsquo;younger&rsquo; sons who are saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What does it mean to be an &ldquo;older&rdquo; son? Anyone who stands and does not fall is an &ldquo;older&rdquo; son. Upon hearing such a word, some will probably say, &ldquo;Okay, let us all fall,&rdquo; but it is not up to us whether we stand or fall. Just as obeying God&rsquo;s commands is not up to us, being indifferent to God&rsquo;s commandments, like the younger son who fell to the point of living with hogs, is also not up to us.</p>
<p>The senior co-worker finally asked me, &ldquo;Brother, do you know God&rsquo;s salvation or not?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Of course, I know. The Lord Jesus died for us by shedding His precious blood. When we believe in Him, we are saved. This is God&rsquo;s salvation.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;What you have said is just doctrine; it is useless. According to experience, the younger son knew salvation, and the older son did not. If you have never fallen or been defeated, you are an older son, and you do not know what salvation is.&rdquo; Then the co-worker asked me, &ldquo;Have you ever fallen? Have you ever failed? Have you ever lived like a prodigal son?&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I have lived like a prodigal son more than the younger son in Luke 15.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Praise the Lord, you know God&rsquo;s salvation.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>God's Need and God's Goal &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
