 <h2 class="head1">SAVED TO BE IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the past we received the help to be saved, and afterwards we were taught to improve our behavior. All this is good, and I do not find fault with it. But is this all? Some Christians are known as &ldquo;deeper life&rdquo; Christians. I do not know whether they are actually deep or not, but they at least try to help others to know the deeper life. However, there are different applications of the term &ldquo;deeper life.&rdquo; The holiness people consider their holiness as the deeper life, and the tongues-speaking people consider their speaking in tongues as the deeper life. Others refer to the deeper life as the &ldquo;second blessing.&rdquo; Still others understand the deeper life as something mysterious and mystical. However, I have never heard anyone apply the term &ldquo;deeper life&rdquo; to the church life. Although there are many schools of doctrine in Christianity, there is no school called &ldquo;church life.&rdquo; Today&rsquo;s Christians have missed the mark and are still missing it. God&rsquo;s goal is not simply to save sinners and then to improve their behavior and deepen their life. God&rsquo;s goal is to have the church. If, after you have been saved, you have only improved your behavior and become deep in life, you are just useful for some kind of exhibition. But God does not want such an exhibition. He does not desire individual Christians&mdash;He wants the church. When we built our meeting hall in Anaheim, we purchased a vast quantity of materials. Our intention was not to have a huge pile of materials&mdash;it was to build a meeting hall. Likewise, the desire of God&rsquo;s heart is to have the church. Oh, we all must see this! We have been saved for the church, not for any other purpose. We were not only saved for the church, but saved to be the church.</p>
<p>I am concerned that many of you are still not clear concerning the purpose of your salvation. You must clearly see that you have been saved for the church. This vision must direct, control, and guide your whole life. You have been saved to be part of the church. Now let me ask you this question: Do you daily live as a part of the church? Doctrinally you recognize that you are a part of the church and that you have been saved to be in the church, but practically do you live as a part of the church? When you go shopping, do you shop as a part of the church? In our daily living we may not live as a part of the church. Doctrine is one thing, and practicality is another.</p>
<p>How pitiful is the situation among Christians today! Since the Lord has brought His recovery to this country, Christians have been talking about the church. Many say, &ldquo;Why do you say that you are the church and that we are not the church?&rdquo; Perhaps after discussing the church, some pastors may go out to play tennis. On the one hand, they argue that we teach wrong doctrine with respect to the church, and, on the other hand, they forget about it all and go to play golf or tennis. Today, who cares for the reality and practicality of the church? Practically speaking, who are the ones in the local churches? We need to apply this question to ourselves. In your home life do you live as a part of the church? Once again I say that we have been saved to be the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE PRACTICAL CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Years ago I was taught that we were saved that we might be holy, and I read a number of books about holiness and about how to be holy. However, I never read a book on how to be the church. I ask you to read your New Testament again. If you do so, you will see what a strong emphasis there is in God&rsquo;s divine revelation on this matter of the church.</p>
<p>Although many Bible teachers say that the book of Ephesians is on the church, to them this is merely theology. If you examine their practical living, you will see that they do not care for the church at all. But how about us? We must be impressed that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today is ultimately the recovery of the church life. What Christianity has missed, the Lord is recovering. This is not a doctrine. Today the Lord is recovering the church life. As long as there is no practical church life, the Lord does not yet have His recovery. Although so many positive things are holy, scriptural, and spiritual, none of them is the goal. Again I declare that the goal is the church.</p>
<p>In Acts chapter two we have the record of the first local church, the church at Jerusalem. Verses 41 through 47 reveal that those Christians were the church. Although they did not have the doctrine of the church and perhaps did not even have the word &ldquo;church,&rdquo; they were the church in their living. Day and night they lived the church life. They may not have talked about the church or taught about it&mdash;they simply were the church. During the time of Acts 2, the Lord had gained what He had been seeking. But not too long afterwards this goal was gradually blurred and lost. Now, at the end of this age, the Lord has come to recover this lost goal. Thus, we are not here for holiness, spirituality, evangelical work, or for any kind of movement. We are here for the church. This is God&rsquo;s desire. God wants a real, actual, and practical church, not a group of people talking about the doctrine of the church. Since I have been enlightened concerning this, no one has been able to deceive me.</p>
<p>If you have ever seen the church in a transparent, crystal-clear vision, no one will be able to cheat you. Young people, as you go to the campuses, you must go with the vision of the real and practical church. Then, no matter what others say to you, you will be clear. You will have x-ray vision; you will be able to see through things, and no one will be able to rob you. But if you do not have this clear vision, you may be influenced by the enticing words of certain Christians. However, once you have seen the vision of the church, no one will be able to seduce you. The more they talk, the clearer you will become, and you will say, &ldquo;Oh, I see the little serpent under this person&rsquo;s tongue!&rdquo; Only by seeing the vision of the church can we overcome this enticing, serpentine talk.</p>
