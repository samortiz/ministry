   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FIFTH STAGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TRYING TO DO GOOD IN THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although the fourth stage of the Christian life, seen in Romans 6, is a glorious one, the fifth stage, seen in chapter 7, is sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter 6 we declare, Hallelujah! but in chapter 7 we must cry out, Wretched man that I am! v. 24 . In this fifth stage we see a man who strives and struggles to do good, to keep the law of God, and to please God by himself vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>18-19, 21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He does this because he now knows that he is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a sense, he says to himself, I am in Christ; therefore, I have to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because I am now in Christ, I must keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because I am in Christ, I have to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although it is true that he is in Christ, his thought that he must now do good is false.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is absolutely right to be in Christ, but to do good by oneself is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you realize the fact that you are in Christ, you will rejoice unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If, however, you make the decision to do good by yourself, you will be sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The reason for your sorrow will be that when you are trying to do good, you will in effect be running away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, it is impossible to actually run away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in experience, if you try to do good by yourself, you run away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you try to do good by yourself, you will find that there is nothing good within you v. 18 . You must realize that you are nothing but flesh, which can never do anything to please God cf.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>8:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If therefore you try to do good by yourself, you will actually be living and walking in yourself, which means that you will be living and walking in the flesh and apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is for this reason that I ask you to give up any thought of doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Herein lies a great temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we rejoice that we are in Christ, the enemy often comes and subtly asks us whether or not we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we answer that we are indeed in Christ, he often challenges us, asking, But do you do good?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you are in Christ, you must do your best to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You must make up your mind and make a decision to please God and keep His law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although we may often think that such a thought is from the Holy Spirit, we must realize that it is nothing less than a temptation and a challenge from Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This temptation comes especially when we are in the midst of praising and thanking Christ that we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we have learned this lesson well, we will tell Satan, Get away from me, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I will not go along with you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is impossible for me to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am flesh, and in my flesh nothing good dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because there is nothing good in me, I cannot do any good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Satan, I have been fooled by you long enough; do not try to tempt me anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Get away from me!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE SIXTH STAGE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we address the enemy in this way and reject trying to do good in the flesh, we will be persons who live and walk according to the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the stage that we see in Romans 8:1-17.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here we see a person who does not know good or evil and who has been released from doing good and evil; he simply knows to follow the Holy Spirit, who indwells his human spirit v. 4; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the garden of Eden, there were two trees the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The second tree is not only a tree of the knowledge of evil; it is also a tree of the knowledge of good.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever you are trying to do good, you have to realize you are contacting the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are clear that evil opposes life, but we must be equally clear that good also opposes life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The tree of life is opposed by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Perhaps this thought has never occurred to you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Both good and evil are the enemies of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Evil is against Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The same is true for good.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Good is not Christ; good is against Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord has no intention that we do good by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What the Lord asks us to do is not to do good but to follow Him, that is, to walk according to the Spirit, who is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Romans 7 we see a picture of a man who is trying to do good in his flesh, whereas in Romans 8 we see one who walks according to the Spirit in his human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, many Christians do not know the difference between doing good and walking according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Doing good is one thing; walking in the Spirit is entirely another.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet many Christians think that doing good is synonymous with following the Holy Spirit and walking according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must be delivered from doing good to walking according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For a number of years after I was saved, I prayed to the Lord every morning and made the decision to please Him by doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet despite my prayer and decisions, I simply could not make it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By the time evening came, I would have to go to the Lord to confess my failure and ask Him to cleanse me with His precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When I experienced forgiveness and the cleansing of the precious blood, I would have peace in my conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The next morning, I would go to the Lord again and pray, Lord, I praise You for this new day.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I wish to have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Lord, help me to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In other words, every day I made up my mind to do good, yet every day I would fail.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Year after year I was in such a state the state described in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then one day the Lord opened my eyes to show me that there was no need for me to try to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He caused me to realize that I was in Christ, that the Holy Spirit was within me, and that consequently all I had to do was simply follow the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I realized that I did not have to make any more decisions to be good; I only had to go along with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After I saw this, my morning prayer changed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I began to pray, Praise You, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Not only am I in You, but Your Spirit is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is nothing for me to do or to try to do.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All I must do is simply enjoy and experience You.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We need to praise the Lord by saying Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Sometimes the young people ask me what I do after I say Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When Satan comes to tempt me, there is nothing for me to do but praise.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I do not know anything except to say Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We were not saved to do good; we were saved to praise, glorify, and thank the Lord 1 Thes 5:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must remember that we are in Christ and that the Spirit of Christ is within us Rom 8:2, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Once we have such a realization, we must simply praise the Lord and say Hallelujah all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There is nothing left for us to do except praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>One day, when I spoke concerning this matter in a meeting, a sister came to me afterwards and said, Brother Lee, I am very glad to have heard the message tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I realize what you mean when you tell us that we should say Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But when I go back to my home, I will be met by my husband, who is a very hard man.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>What you say is very good, but what shall I do in my difficult situation?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I responded to her, Sister, the harder your husband is, the more you have to say Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Do not make up your mind to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Do not try to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The more you try to be patient, the more impatient you will be.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Simply remember that whenever your husband is hard toward you, you must just say, Praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is all we must do.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>For eternity we will say Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>A Christian is not someone who tries to do something; a Christian is a person who always enjoys and experiences Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We are not called by the Lord to do things to please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We are called to enjoy, experience, and participate in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Never try to do good by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Just remember that you are in Christ and that the Spirit of Christ is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If you need electricity, there is no need for you to do anything but turn the switch on.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Saying Hallelujah is the way to switch on to enjoy and experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If you try to be good by yourself, the switch will be turned off.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Always remember to praise the Lord, for this is the way to switch on.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This is the way to be a victorious person who is in Christ and who walks according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We are set free from sin, death, and bondage simply by saying Hallelujah and walking according to the Spirit.</S>
