<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In the Mystical Union<br>with the All-inclusive Christ,<br>the Very Embodiment of the Processed<br>and Dispensing Triune God</H2><P>The full type of the church in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers is a type of the church in the mystical union with the all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed and dispensing Triune God. This mystical union is our destiny and our destination. In different kinds of circumstances and in dealing with different persons, we may say, "O Lord Jesus, I need You!" What does it mean to tell the Lord that we need Him? It actually means that we enjoy Him. Day by day, we may enjoy the all-inclusive Christ, the embodiment of the processed and dispensing Triune God, as our good land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. As the Passover and the Unleavened Bread</H2><P>According to the type in Exodus, we first enjoy Christ as the Passover and the unleavened bread (1 Cor. 5:7-8). The Passover is for us to be saved, and the unleavened bread is for us to live a life without sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. As the Heavenly Manna<br>and the Rock That Flows Out the Living Water</H2><P>After experiencing Christ as the Passover and after beginning to enjoy Him as the unleavened bread, we go on to enjoy Him as the heavenly manna and the rock that flows out the living water (1 Cor. 10:3-4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. As the Divine Law for God's Expression,<br>Bearing God's Image That Man May Know God</H2><P>Even the law is a type of Christ, for it typifies Christ as God's expression, bearing God's image that man may know God (John 1:18; Heb. 1:3a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. As the Tabernacle of God,<br>with the Ark as the Center of God's Testimony</H2><P>John 1:14 reveals that Christ tabernacled among us. He is the tabernacle of God, with the ark as the center of God's testimony.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. As the Propitiation Place<br>for God to Meet with Man in His Righteousness</H2><P>According to Romans 3:25, Christ is the propitiation place&#151;the cover, or lid, of the ark&#151;for God to meet with man in His righteousness. Christ is thus the place where God meets with His people.</P>
