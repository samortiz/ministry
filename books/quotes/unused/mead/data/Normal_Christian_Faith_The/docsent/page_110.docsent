   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APPENDICES APPENDIX ONE TOWARDS THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some people think that as long as one is a Christian, it is good enough; there is no need to be part of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Putting it another way, they want Christ but they do not want the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is fine to have individual prayers and Bible studies, but it is too troublesome for them to be related to other people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this reason many Christians refuse to join any church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is an unhealthy as well as erroneous concept among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a person has believed in Christ, not only does he have to negatively reject the world, but he has to positively be part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>PART OF A WHOLE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the Word of God, there is a corporate aspect to the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, we are born into the family of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are children in this family.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's family is a big one, and we have to be children with many others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second, all the redeemed ones are corporately a house for God's dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God makes His abode here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Third, together we constitute the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Individually we are members of this one Body and are related to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, no matter from what angle you look, individual Christians are only parts of a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is improper for us to be Christians individually without relating to others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such an attitude cannot last for long and is damaging to growth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A Christian who takes such a stand will never be able to touch the riches of God or manifest the glory of the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BORN INTO THE BIGGEST FAMILY</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With this view in mind, we have to realize that we are not the only begotten son in this family.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If my father has only begotten me, then I do not have to care about anyone else, because I have no brother.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if I have five other brothers and sisters in my family, then I cannot say, "I just want to be my father's son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I want nothing to do with the other five brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are not my concern."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now that we are regenerated and have become Christians, we have to realize that we are born into the biggest family of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this big family we have hundreds and thousands of brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The life we possess demands that we have fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there is no desire within you to visit other brothers and sisters or to shake their hands, I doubt that your regeneration is a genuine one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The desire to regard the children of God as one's own brothers and sisters is something that comes from the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is something sweet and full of love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The nature of the life of God forbids us to be individual Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot merely seek our own gain.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to fellowship with all the children of God and live in this family of love, which is the church of God.</S>
