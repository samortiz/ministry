<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE RECOVERY OF THE DIVINE REVELATION<br>CONCERNING THE CHURCH</H2><P>The sixth item of the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Church Being the Church of God,<br>Chosen and Predestinated by God the Father,<br>Redeemed by God the Son,<br>and Sealed by God the Spirit</H2><P>The church is the church of God (1 Cor. 10:32), chosen and predestinated by God the Father (Eph. 1:3-6), redeemed by God the Son (Eph. 1:7-12), and sealed by God the Spirit (Eph. 1:13-14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Church Being the Body of Christ,<br>the Fullness of the One Who Fills All in All,<br>as His Expression, United Organically to the<br>Resurrected, Ascended, and Transmitting Head</H2><P>The church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23), as His expression, united organically to the resurrected, ascended, and transmitting Head (Eph. 1:19-22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C.
