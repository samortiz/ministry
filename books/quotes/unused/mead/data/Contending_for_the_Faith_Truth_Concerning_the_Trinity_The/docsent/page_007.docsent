   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 1:1 says, "The Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By the clause, "the Word was with God," we understand that the Word and God are two, for the Word was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But "the Word was God" indicates that the Word and God are one, for the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Are They one or two?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are both.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says that "the Lord is the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here the Lord and the Spirit are one, for the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then, in the same verse, it speaks of "the Spirit of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that They are two.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Are the Lord and the Spirit one or two?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Notice how, in Hebrews 1:8-9, the Son is addressed as God, then God is referred to as His God: "But of the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. therefore God, Your God, has anointed You.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>'" How can you explain this?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Can you say, "O God, Your God"?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is also a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Finally, in Revelation 1:4, 4:5, and 5:6 we read that the one Spirit Eph 4:4 of God is called "the seven Spirits."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here again is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, dear brothers and sisters, we must learn to simply take the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know what the Bible says concerning our Triune God, and we believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We pray for those who oppose us that God may grant them to see the truth according to the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I say, once again, that the arguments and disputations concerning this matter of the Trinity are endless, for the Trinity is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is impossible for anyone to explain it thoroughly or adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Triune God cannot be fully comprehended as a doctrinal matter by our limited mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Triune God is for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God as a Trinity is for His economy, that is, for the dispensing of Himself into us to be our life and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why we have spent so much time to point out that the Father is in the Son and that the Son is now the life-giving Spirit, indwelling our spirit to be our life and our everything for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If it were not for the matter of experience, we would not care to talk about it very much.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, since the attacks have come, we have had to make what we experience clear to people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>J. Oswald Sanders in his book Spiritual Maturity published by Moody Press , page 144, says, "William Barclay comments: Paul seems to identify the Risen Lord and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must remember that Paul was not writing theology; he was setting down experience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And it is the experience of the Christian life that the work of the Spirit and the work of the Risen Lord are one and the same.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The strength, the light, the guidance we receive come alike from the Spirit and from the Risen Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It does not matter how we express it so long as we experience it."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, the Triune God is not for terminology or for teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Triune God is for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>by Witness Lee</S>
