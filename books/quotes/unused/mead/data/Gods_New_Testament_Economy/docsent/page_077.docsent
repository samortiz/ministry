   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As Another Angel</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As another Angel He cares for God s chosen people, the Israelites, executes the prayer of the saints concerning God s economy, possesses the earth in the future, and appears in glory to make the whole earth the kingdom of God 7:2-8; 8:3-5; 10:1-5; 18:1; 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The all-inclusive One has another title another Angel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The book of Revelation mentions this Angel four times.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Revelation 7:2-8 indicates that this Angel takes care of God s chosen people, Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On this earth God has two peoples the chosen people of Israel and the redeemed people, the saints, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Revelation 8:3-5 Christ is mentioned again as another Angel to present the prayers of the church to God and to carry out the answers to these prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is taking care of His two peoples, Israel and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Israel has been and still is under persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The entire world has been trying to diminish Israel, so Israel needs special care in order to be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The little nation of Israel is surrounded by many Arab countries, yet it still survives.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is because another Angel is taking care of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God also has another people, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church s function mainly is to pray, call on the Lord s name, and cry out to the throne; then the other Angel offers all the church s prayer to God and brings down the answer to these prayers Rev 8:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His way to bring down the answer is to scatter the answer upon the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ offers the prayer to God, He adds Himself as the incense, then He receives the answer and pours the answer out upon the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today the entire earth is under the answers of the saints prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The third time the book of Revelation mentions Christ as another Angel is in 10:1-5.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the strong Angel coming down out of heaven, Christ, the universal Person, places His right foot on the sea and His left foot on the land.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To place His feet on the sea and upon the land is to tread upon them, and to tread upon them is to take possession of them Deut 11:24; Josh 1:3; Psa 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that Christ is coming down to take possession of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only He is worthy to open the scroll of God s economy, and only He is qualified to possess the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, all the peoples of the earth who are fighting in order to claim more territory will discover that they have done this in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The earth is the Lord s Psa 24:1 and by the time of Revelation 10 He will come to take possession of it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the waters and the lands will be under the feet of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He will be the universal One coming to tread on the sea and the land.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The land and the sea are His, not the rulers of this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the nations who are seeking to possess and dominate other countries are working in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Finally, Revelation 18:1 shows us that as another Angel of God He appears in glory to make the whole earth the kingdom of God 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He comes to take over the entire earth and make it His kingdom and God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The kingdom of the world becomes the kingdom of Christ at His coming back after His judgment upon the nations Dan 7:13-14; 2:44-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the wonderful One to be the Executor of God s administration to take care of His people, to present His people s prayer to God, and to possess the earth to make the earth His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the Lamb of God and as the Word of God</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Also, the redeeming Lamb as the Executor of God s New Testament economy marries the Bride 19:7-9 , and as the Word of God judges and wars against Antichrist and his armies 19:11-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church eventually will be the Bride for the Lamb to marry, and the worldly people will consummate in Antichrist with his army against God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This wonderful Executor as the Lamb of God will marry the positive people, the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then as the Word of God He will slay the negative ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To us He is the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To the worldly people who are in rebellion against Him He is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible tells us that God judges, condemns, and puts people to death by His Word 2 Thes 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The totality of God s Word is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Christ in John 1:1 and 14 is the Word for incarnation and redeeming, but in Revelation 19 Christ as the Word is for judging.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Both the Lamb and the Word are aspects of this wonderful Executor.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As the Executor of God s New Testament economy He is another Angel, the Lamb of God, and the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE SEVEN EYES OF THE LAMB AS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE SEVEN SHINING LAMPS</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The seven eyes of the Lamb as the Executor of God s New Testament economy are the seven lamps upheld by the seven lampstands, the seven churches, shining and enlightening as the testimony of Jesus Rev 1:9b, 11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This burning, judging, purifying, refining, and producing Spirit is the lamps upheld by the lampstands, the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means the churches shine through the lamps and these lamps are the Spirit, the real testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have stressed very much that the seven Spirits today are judging, purifying, refining, and bringing forth the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must realize, though, that the extent to which the seven Spirits refine is the extent to which they shine.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we do not allow the seven Spirits to refine us, the seven Spirits have no way to shine and there is no testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The shining of the seven Spirits is the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more we let the Spirit purify us and refine us, the more He shines through us and this shining is the testimony of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is why we have to open ourselves every day to welcome Him to enter into our being to refine, to judge, to purge, and to purify us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then He will shine through us and this shining is the very testimony of the church, the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The testimony of Jesus is the shining of the seven Spirits from within all the believers in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>THE SEVEN SPIRITS AS THE SEVEN LAMPS OF FIRE</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>BECOMING THE RIVER OF WATER</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The seven Spirits who are the lamps of fire in this age, executing God s New Testament economy 4:5 , will become the river of water, saturating the holy city of God, the New Jerusalem 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>First, the seven Spirits are the lamps of fire and eventually the seven Spirits will be the river of water.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Fire and water both refer to the same Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Fire is to purge, refine, and produce, and water is to saturate and to supply.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Spirit is the refining fire in this age, and the Spirit is also the saturating, supplying water, first in this age and then in the coming age and eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The refining fire produces the lampstands, the churches, in this age with the saturating water, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Both the lampstand and the New Jerusalem are the full expression of God and the testimony of Jesus, in this age and in eternity.</S>
