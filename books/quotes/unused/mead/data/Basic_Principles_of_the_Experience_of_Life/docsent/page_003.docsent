   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REAL LIFE BEING CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Moreover, have you realized that all the lives in God's creation are not real lives?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All these lives are figures, types, and shadows; they are not the real life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we desire to understand the Scriptures and the spiritual matters, we must remember well that all the items in God's creation are not the real items.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are simply figures, symbols, types, and shadows of the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is the real thing?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The real thing is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The heavens are a type of Christ, and the earth is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everything good, everything on the positive side, is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do not sit on a real chair; we are seated in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is the Lord who upholds us; He is the real seat to us, on whom we rest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The only real item is the Lord Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The vegetable life, animal life, and human life are figures of the one real life, that is, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With all lives there is a beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The most beautiful things are the things with life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Look at the flowers, the birds, the fishes, and all the animals.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we go to the ocean, we can see how beautiful the lives in the water are.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the beauties of the different lives are types of the beauty of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With Christ as life there is the real beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In addition, have you realized how many different kinds of life there are?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These are the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Simply with trees alone, we can never exhaust naming the different kinds.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I was very young, I thought that I had seen every kind of tree, but when I left my home, I saw many more different trees in the north and in the south of China.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With life there are the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How many kinds of animals, beasts, birds, and fishes there are!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot exhaust telling the names of all the varieties.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are the riches of life, which are a type of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, there is the power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we bury a tiny seed under the earth, after a few weeks it will break through the earth, grow up, and bring forth many beautiful items.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With Christ as life there is power, which is the resurrection power, the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nothing can hold or restrict it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more we restrict it, the more it becomes stronger and more powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Remember well that with life there is beauty, riches, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What do we mean by the term life?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is hard to give a definition of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Life is something mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we go to the scientists, they cannot tell us, and if we go to the medical doctors, they cannot give an adequate definition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have had a number of good talks with medical doctors about the physical life, and I asked them what the difference is between a dead person and a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From the medical point of view there is little difference with respect to the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A dead body and a living body are nearly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To me, however, there is a great difference.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When a person is dead, he is dead, and when he is living, he is living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How then can we define life, and in the whole universe, what is life?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As Christians we must know what life is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is a verse in the Scriptures which says, "He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life" 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we have the Son of God, we have life, and if we do not have the Son of God, we do not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What then is life?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ, the Son of God, is life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we have seen, all the different lives in God's creation are not the real lives; they are types and shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The real life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As humans, we have a life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Why then do the Scriptures say that if we do not have the Son of God, we do not have life?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must answer by saying that we have a life in figure, a life in shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yes, we received a life from our parents, but that life is not the real life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>That is a life in figure, a shadow of the real life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The real life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we do not have Christ, we do not have life, and we are still in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now we may realize what life is.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Life is Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must know the verses which support this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Besides 1 John 5:12 there is Colossians 3:4, which speaks of "Christ our life."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Moreover, in John 11:25 the Lord says, "I am the resurrection and the life," and in 14:6 He says, "I am the way and the reality and the life."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In addition, John 1:4 says, "In Him was life," and 10:10 says, "I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>John 3:16 and 36 also support the divine thought that life is simply Christ Himself, the Son of God, as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>With Christ as life there is beauty, there are riches, and there is the power of resurrection.</S>
