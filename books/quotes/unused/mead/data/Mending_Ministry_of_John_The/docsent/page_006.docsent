   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST MEETING EVERY NEED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In these first twelve chapters of John there are nine cases presented to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These cases demonstrate that Christ is able to meet the need of anyone, from whatever segment of society he may come and however hopeless he seems.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nicodemus</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first case was of an upright, God-seeking man named Nicodemus John 3:1-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To such a good person the dear Lord said, "You must be born anew."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If such a refined person nonetheless needed regeneration, how much more do the evil ones!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is born of the divine Spirit is the human spirit v. 6 . By believing in this dear Christ, we are regenerated; this second birth, in our spirit, makes us children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nicodemus, however good he was, was still a child of man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The same is true of us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do not need to check whether we are good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even if we are the best, we still do not have God's life until we are reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How marvelous it is that we have two fathers!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have an earthly father, to whom we owe our physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But we have also a spiritual father, who is God!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are God's children!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What a status we have because of regeneration!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Samaritan Woman</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The second case was of an immoral, despised woman John 4:6-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This woman of Samaria came to Jacob's well to draw water.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She had had five husbands and was now living with a sixth, who was not her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No doubt all who knew her looked down upon her.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To such a one the Lord came.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He understood her and met her need.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why had she tried so many husbands?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was because of a thirst within her which none of them had been able to satisfy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every time she changed husbands, she had hope that her thirst would be quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After five futile attempts to satisfy her longing, she was now trying for the sixth time to get the satisfaction she craved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Are we not the same?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We try one thing after another, seeking satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After a little time we are disappointed and turn elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When our new effort is unrewarded, we "change husbands" again!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whatever we try of this world's water, it leaves us empty and thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then the Lord Jesus comes to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because we are thirsty, He is thirsty too.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Give Me a drink," He says.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are the water He needs for His thirst to be quenched!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What the Lord Jesus gave to the Samaritan woman was living water, a spring welling up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With this water she was satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Royal Official's Son</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The third case was of a boy who was about to die John 4:46-54 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His father, a royal official, went to see the Lord and asked Him to come and heal his son, who was at the point of death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do you realize that you are dying?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even if you are still young and feel very much alive, you are dying.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The longer you live, the closer you are to dying.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus comes into the situation of death to deliver us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By His word, "Go, your son is living," He healed the dying one.</S>
