 <h2 class="head1">THE BURNING OF THE SEVEN SPIRITS<br />
DIRECTING THE WORLD SITUATION</h2>
<p>Christ and the Spirit are revealed in Revelation to carry out God&rsquo;s economy. First, this carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy involves administrating the entire situation in this universe and mainly administrating the world situation. All the international affairs are neither in the hands of the diplomats nor in the hands of the United Nations. The deciding place is on the throne. Everything in today&rsquo;s situation is decided on the throne. By my reading and studying of the world situation over the past sixty years, I fully realize that the throne of God in the heavens is the deciding factor of the world situation. Neither Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, nor any of the world governments were the deciding factors of the world situation. They all failed. The deciding factor is the throne of God. All of the world leaders are under the flaming of the seven Spirits. The seven Spirits are burning on this earth today for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration. Christ carries out His mission as the Ruler of the kings of the earth by the seven burning Spirits. We must realize that today the seven Spirits of God are burning not only concerning the churches but also concerning the world situation for the churches. The entire world situation is under the flame of the burning of the seven Spirits. The seven Spirits today are carrying out God&rsquo;s administration on this earth. The world situation, the international affairs, are all under the direction of this flame. I have seen the flame of the seven burning Spirits before the throne of God sovereignly controlling the world situation. When Hitler took over Belgium in World War II, it would have been possible for him to go straight into England. England was unprepared to face that situation and was ready to be taken over by Hitler, but Hitler made the decision to turn to attack Russia. The flame of the seven Spirits turned him away from England at that time. History tells us that this was a great mistake made by Hitler, and this was under the sovereign control of the seven burning Spirits before the throne of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Bringing Forth the Golden Lampstands</h2>
<p>The purpose of the burning flame in carrying out God&rsquo;s economy is to bring forth the golden lampstands, the churches. Burning implies judging, purifying, refining, and producing. Never be disappointed by the rottenness, corruption, and immorality of today&rsquo;s human society. Do not be disappointed or so concerned for the world situation. Also, do not be disappointed by the weakness of the local churches. I do not believe in the seemingly disappointing condition in the world or in the churches. I believe in the flame of the burning seven Spirits which control and direct the world and which also judge, purify, and refine the church to produce a pure golden lampstand. We are here endeavoring to afford the Lord a chance and an entrance to judge us, purify us, and refine us to produce a pure golden lampstand. We are open wide to the flaming of the seven Spirits of God. We all need to pray, &ldquo;Dear divine Flame, come! Come and judge! Come and purify! Come and refine that You may produce the golden lampstand.&rdquo; Nearly all the doors are closed to Christ in today&rsquo;s situation. By His mercy, though, we are open to Him. Every day, every morning, and every evening, we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, come; we are open to You! We open every avenue of our being to You.&rdquo; I do not know how much you pray or how you pray, but I can testify that nearly every day I pray, &ldquo;Lord, enlighten me; search me within and expose me, Lord. I like to be enlightened by You and exposed in Your light.&rdquo; Are you like this or do you shut yourself up and hide something from Him? We all need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, we are open. Come and shine upon us and shine from within us and enlighten every avenue and every corner of our being. I like to be exposed, purged, and purified.&rdquo; Then the Lord has a way to produce a pure golden lampstand. The burning is going on not only in the entire world situation, but also in the churches. The more I read the newspapers, the more I get confirmed that the flaming Spirits direct the world situation, and also this flaming purifies the church to produce the golden lampstands.</p>
<p>The seven Spirits, who are out from the eternal One and of the redeeming One, are the seven lamps of fire burning before God&rsquo;s throne, executing God&rsquo;s economy in the universe, and the seven eyes of the slain Lamb, searching and infusing the churches (4:5; 5:6b). The twofold mission of the seven Spirits is to carry out God&rsquo;s administration and to search and infuse the churches. The seven Spirits search out our sinfulness and infuse us with the riches of Christ. While a person is speaking to you, his two eyes are also infusing you with his burden. In like manner, the seven Spirits of God as the eyes of the Lamb infuse us with this wonderful One&rsquo;s burden and essence.</p>
