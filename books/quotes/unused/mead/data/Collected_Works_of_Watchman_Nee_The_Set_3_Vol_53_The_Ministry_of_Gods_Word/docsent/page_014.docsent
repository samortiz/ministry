   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This is the "human element" which we discussed earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is an outstanding and stark example of man's elements being employed in God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here was a man who was disciplined, restricted, and broken by the Lord to the extent that he could speak even when he was very clear that the Lord had not said anything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Yet in the end, his word became the word of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul was giving others his own opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet in the end his opinion was the opinion of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul said that it was his thought and his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet in the end it was the intention of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here was a man under the Lord's Spirit and His operation so much that when he spoke, the Holy Spirit was speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What a great difference this is from the donkey of Balaam!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Balaam's donkey could speak God's word only when the word was put into its mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When God's word was taken away, only the donkey was left.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In contrast, here was a man who had followed the Lord, received mercy from Him, and been faithful for years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the end his speaking became the Spirit's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul made it clear that it was his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in the end it was the Lord's opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God had worked in him to such an extent that he could almost speak God's word without having God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With many servants of the Lord, God's word can be found in them only when a word is put into their mouth, and when it is not placed in their mouth, they do not have any word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet Paul had reached the stage where he had God's word whether or not it was put into his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here was a man so trained that he could earn the Lord's trust.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here was a man so trained and trusted by God that his speaking became God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot do anything about this except to plead for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers, we cannot be just a donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot be satisfied with God's word just being placed in our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If this is our condition, it means that we ourselves have nothing to do with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul was a man who had much to do with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even his own opinions became God's opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The little thoughts that he had became the thoughts of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was so one with the Spirit of God!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His very speaking represented God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He indeed reached the highest peak.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A minister of the word is not merely one who transmits God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He must be a person who has a certain relationship with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He has God's thoughts and opinions, and he has reached the stage where his desires become God's desires.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He does not act in a certain way because he comes to a separate realization of God's desire in a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, he is restricted by God to such an extent that God trusts his thoughts and ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God can acknowledge his thoughts and ideas as His own.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is what we have been saying for years; it is what we call the constituting work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God constitutes Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He works and wroughts Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The golden lampstand was made of beaten work Exo 25:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must remember that something is given to us by the Lord on the one hand, while God is beating the same thing into us on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are like an unshaped piece of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God is beating us blow by blow until we are formed into the shape of a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Holy Spirit not only puts the divine word in our mouth but also beats such a word into our being until we are conformed to God's defined shape.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is not a matter of whether or not we have God's word in our mouth but a matter of whether we have been beaten to the point where God can entrust His word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul was constituted by the Lord to such an extent that his opinion was considered trustworthy; the Lord worked in him to such an extent that his thoughts were trustworthy enough to convey God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When God's word is placed in such a man and he is called to be a minister of the word, there is no danger of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A minister of the word is a person in whom God can confide His trust and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Ministry of the word means that there is not only the word but the man, the very person who serves as the minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Such a person has been so perfected that God's word will not suffer damage or misunderstanding through him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is a person whom God can use, one who can serve as a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A minister of the word is one who is so constituted by God that God can entrust him with His very opinions, thoughts, and desires.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His own human elements can be involved in the speaking; they will not cause any problem to the divine word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brothers and sisters, do not think that we are contradicting what we have preached in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the past we pointed out that human ingredients are forbidden in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why then do we now say that God's word contains human elements?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are not admitting every kind of human element; we are saying that only certain kinds of human elements can be involved in God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who have such elements will find God's word flowing out of them freely.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God can freely trust them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should spend a little more time to consider Paul's word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He said that he had obtained mercy to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Mercy is of God, and the result of mercy is faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means that God did some constituting work in Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He worked in Paul to such an extent that Paul's very being resembled God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because of this, Paul could release God's word wherever he went.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Paul could say "I wish," "I say," or "I direct in all the churches" because he was a person who had met God; he knew God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When he spoke his word, it was God's word that came out.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have to remember that God's word is not released in a supernatural way; it is released through man and with human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If the person is not right, God's word cannot be released, and such a person cannot be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Never think that a man can preach a message just by memorizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God's word has to make a turn within man before it can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you are not the proper person, God's word will be damaged as soon as it goes through you.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As soon as man's frivolity and carnality come in, God's word is defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A man must reach the point where God's constituting work is well formed in him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then the Lord's word can pass through him without suffering loss on account of his person.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In 1 Corinthians 7 God's word did not suffer any loss in Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Here was a man who was mature.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If he spoke according to his own opinion, we are assured that this opinion was right.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If he said something, we have the confidence that what he said was right.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When he directed all the churches to do certain things, we have the assurance that this direction was right.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Here was a man who was directing others, yet God's word was coming through him; he was not acting independently.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Here was a man whom God could trust.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He had reached the pinnacle.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>A minister of the word must attain such a height before God's word can be released through him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The measure of discipline and restriction one receives from the Lord determines the degree of purity of God's word that is released through him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The degree of brokenness before the Lord determines the degree of purity of one's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The less one receives and learns from the Lord, the more likely God's word is defiled and contaminated when it is released through him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The more restriction, discipline, blows, and breakings one receives, the purer God's word is when it is released through him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The ministry of the word is based on the ministry a person possesses before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If our ministry before the Lord is a failure, our speaking is a failure as well.</S>
