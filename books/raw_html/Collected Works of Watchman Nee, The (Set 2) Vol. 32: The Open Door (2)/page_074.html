<h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE CHURCHES</h2><h2 class="head2">Hankow, Hupeh Province</h2><p>The Lord has His good will in leaving me in Hankow. I am completely safe. God has arranged for Brother Hu and I to serve the refugees in the refugee district beginning in November. The work is very busy. My wife is well after giving birth to the baby, and the child is safe. Please continue to pray for us. (God is already giving us some orphans.) Peace to you in the Lord! My regards to all the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Brother in the Lord, Lan Tsi-yi</p><p>P.S. Brothers and sisters who are still in Hankow are [omitted]. Since October 26 we have all been preserved by the Lord and are safe.</p><h2 class="head2">Yi-Yang, Hunan Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Brother Kuo was in Ch'ang-sha and was the last one to leave. He has been shuttling between Ch'ang-Teh and Yi-Yang, and he knows the condition in that area firsthand. He and I have been seeking the Lord's guidance in oneness concerning the way to distribute the money you sent. I was filled with thanksgiving to the Lord when Brother Kuo related how the saints from Ch'ang-sha escaped from danger. Sister Chao Shi-chi intended to stay in Ch'ang-sha but eventually left with Brother Yen Wen-shiang's family. We heard that the bombing in Ch'ang-Teh was quite devastating. Nothing has happened where I am. In particular, the neighborhoods around the homes of Brothers Shang, Liu, Yang, and Shen have been burned because of the bombing, but the burning stopped at their doorstep. The Lord is truly the refuge to the saints.</p><p>Brother Yang Dai, December 14</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I intended to send money through Brothers Liu Ai-Wu, Yang Dai, and Zhang Gun-jih to be distributed to saints in difficulty throughout Hunan. However, Brother Liu has gone to Ch'ang-Teh, and Brother Zhang has gone to Dong-Ping in An-Hwa. Brother Yang moved into the countryside sixty miles from the city of Yi-Yang. Thank the Lord, I met a Mr. Lung Rong-hwa of the Lutheran Church on my way from Ch'ang-Teh to Ch'ang-sha, and he was willing to send the money to his home. By the time I reached his home, I was able to cash it back. I had not intended to involve myself in this matter. As I walked back to Ch'ang-sha the next day, there was a storm on the way, and it was difficult to go on. I returned to Lung's house and left my belongings there, choosing instead to walk to Brother Yang's place which was sixty miles from Yi-Yang. I was happy to see him and his wife. When we talked about the money, Brother Yang suggested sending it to Ch'ang-Teh to let Brother Liu decide on its use. I felt that this was not the right thing to do, and I advised Brother Yang against it. The instability of the political situation has caused mail correspondence to become extremely unreliable. A letter from Ch'ang-Teh to Tao-Yuen, which is only sixty miles away by road, takes a week to get there. If the brothers did not see each other, the mailing back and forth could take more than a month, not to mention the loss in postal fees. Even if the money arrived in Yi-Yang, I was not certain that there would be anyone who could distribute it to the countryside. This is why I persuaded Brother Yang to distribute the money immediately.</p><p>When Yueh-Yang capitulated, all the brothers who had jobs before the city capitulated were given two or three months' salary in advance before they dispersed. Some brothers are still drawing a salary even now. Therefore, they do not have much need. After the great fire in Ch'ang-sha, most of the brothers and sisters left. Only four sisters who worked at an orphanage of a Westerner remained. Although the orphanage was burned, the livelihood of the four sisters was taken care of by the Westerner. The ones who are finding it difficult to make ends meet are the saints who have escaped to Yi-Yang, An-Hwa, Ch'ang-Teh, and Yuan-Ling (with a few poor local ones). Their suffering is untold. In the past they have always been distributors of money to others, taking care of others rather than meeting their own needs. When I found out their true condition and after much prayer, I had to give the money to them, according to their practical needs.</p><p>Yueh-Yang capitulated, and Ch'ang-sha was burned, but the Lord's children left in time. No one was stuck. The Lord has been gracious to His children.</p><p>Brother Kuo Jen-yung, December 14</p><p>(Brother Kuo, we thank the Lord for the way the money was distributed. From this matter we see that our God never delays!&mdash;Editor.)</p>
