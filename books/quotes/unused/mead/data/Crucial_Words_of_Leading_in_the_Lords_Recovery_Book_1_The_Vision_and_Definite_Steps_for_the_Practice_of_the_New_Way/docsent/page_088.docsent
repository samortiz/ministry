   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECOND CRUCIAL ELEMENT IN THE CHANGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TEACHING TRUTH LESSONS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the new leading of the Lord, we first build up everything related to the church in the homes and not in the meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should depend on knocking on people s doors and visiting them one by one and not on the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, we feel that God s desire is to raise up a group of people who are full of life and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They should be rich in life and clear in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul said that God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth 1 Tim 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason, we published Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We anticipate that these lessons will comprise four levels, with four volumes in each level.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These are systematic lessons drawn from the light that the Lord has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are put together in a proper way and according to the proper light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are paying much attention to this work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Besides the home meetings, we must pay close attention to the meeting for teaching the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every class should not have too many people, preferably fewer than fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the classes within the same hall should conduct the same lessons at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We believe that as the new ones are saved in the home meetings, and as they receive edification from the new believer s lessons, they should subsequently be taught in small classes in the truth meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way they are equipped with the truth and are perfected by it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, in our changing the system, the home meetings and the truth-teaching meetings are the two most basic and crucial meetings in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE THIRD CRUCIAL ELEMENT IN THE CHANGE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>HAVING THE LORD S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>AS THE CENTER OF THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Besides these things, the most important thing is to read the Lord s word every day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through this we enjoy Him and keep His word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We also need to break bread to remember Him on the day of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This renders Him the true remembrance and affords us the solid feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In addition, every week we should gather together to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through such prayer we cooperate with God s move.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These two kinds of meetings can be carried out in the districts, in the small groups, or when the whole church comes together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first Lord s Day of every month, all the saints in a particular hall should gather together for the Lord s table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For the other Lord s Days they can meet in districts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The same principle applies to the prayer meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In all our meetings we should emphasize the Lord s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>During the bread-breaking meeting we can choose some practical, concise, and meaty portions for everyone to pray-read and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can then share and testify concerning these portions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This will satisfy the Lord and minister to our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For the prayer meeting we can choose some messages on service that open up the basic spiritual principles of service.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the home meetings there should be some short messages for edification besides the fellowship, prayer, hymns, and greetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This will help to raise up the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not like to see people come to our meetings without learning something of God s Word or without God s Word being ministered to them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We hope that in every meeting some word from the Lord is released and ministered to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we nourish the saints with these three kinds of messages in the bread-breaking meetings, the prayer meetings, and the home meetings, and if we teach Truth Lessons in a systematic, solid, and educational way, the saints will be helped and perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such arrangements will adequately meet the various needs of the saints and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moreover, they will bring in an increase that is built on the basis of the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such increase will be unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a believer opens up his home to have a meeting once a week, all his relatives and friends will identify his household as a believer s household.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They will know that such a home preaches the gospel, reads the Bible, and teaches the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Most people today concur that Christianity is the highest and noblest religion in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible is a well recognized and well honored book.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We believe that even the weakest home can gain one person per month.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If there are four thousand such open homes in Taipei, every month they will bring in four thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The prospect of such a work is more than we can ask or think.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>DELIVERING THE GOSPEL, THE TRUTH,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>AND THE MEETINGS TO THE HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this reason, we cannot remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We cannot drag people to come to listen to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead, we need to go to them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to send the truth of the gospel to their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, do not think that the gospel is merely a matter of saying, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the basic element of the gospel, but this is not the entire gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must learn to adjust ourselves to accommodate others and speak according to man s needs.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For example, if we see an upright person who loves famous quotes, we can read a few verses from Proverbs to give him a good impression of the Bible and to stir up his appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After this, we can give him the basic truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At times we can use some prophecies to show people the value and power of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This will stir up people s interest as well as command their respect.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In particular, the Chinese people love Psalm 1; nothing in Confucius s teaching has the sweetness that this psalm has.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We can also quote this psalm in a wise way in our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Since we are delivering the gospel to people s homes, our person must match the goods that we deliver.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we go to people, we must dress properly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>First Timothy 2 teaches us that we should dress soberly, not adorning ourselves with braided hair, gold, pearls, or costly clothing vv.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When others see us dressed in this way, they will open the door and welcome us, and it will be easy for them to receive what we have to say.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All our books are nutritious food.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whether they are on life, truth, or the gospel, they all are what every man needs.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must believe in the sovereign arrangement of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What He has done in Taiwan is to prepare the way for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Most of the people in the communities are very friendly.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even if they do not accept the gospel, seldom do they rail against us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Once some saints visited a community and met a woman who had just come back from the market.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When she met the saints and observed how proper they were, she invited them in. After she heard the gospel, she received it with joy and was baptized in her home.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Afterward she told the saints that her husband worked in Tainan and asked how the gospel could be preached to him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The saints told her that Tainan has a church with many believers and that they could take his name and deliver the gospel to him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This shows that when the gospel reaches one person, it can bring salvation to the entire family.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord has indeed rendered unprecedented provisions for the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He has prepared man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The minute we send the gospel to the homes, many doors are opened, and people invite us to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I hope that we will deliver the truth as well as the gospel to people s homes.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In this way the new believers will be educated in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We can use short twenty-minute videotapes to help the new ones, or we can take advantage of the telephone and teach them over the phone.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In this way we deliver the gospel, the truth, and the meeting to people s homes.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is the best way to build the church locally in the Lord s recovery and to bring in the spread and increase universally.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We have clearly and adequately covered the above points in the past training meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I hope that we will change our concept from the big meetings in the halls to building up the home meetings in every believer s home.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is the foundation of the building up of the church, and this is the life pulse for the spread of the church.</S>
