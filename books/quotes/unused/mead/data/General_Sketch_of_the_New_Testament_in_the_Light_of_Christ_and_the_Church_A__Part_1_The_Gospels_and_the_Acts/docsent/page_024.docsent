   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Coming as "Another Comforter"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 14:16 the Lord said that the Father would give the disciples another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some Christian teachers say that this word was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost Acts 2:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a wrong interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Acts 2 refers to the baptism in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the day of resurrection the Lord breathed the Spirit into the disciples for their life, while on the day of Pentecost the Spirit as the rushing, violent wind blew upon the disciples for power.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These are two different aspects of the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the apostle John wrote his Gospel, he did not do so with Acts 2 in view.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the contrary, the Gospel of John is a complete book showing us that the Triune God was incarnated to be a man, bringing Himself into man, mingling Himself with man, and living on this earth as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He went into death, and in resurrection He imparted Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then through His resurrection and ascension, He brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From this point on, God is in man and man is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He and man are one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 14:17 tells us that the Comforter was first with the disciples and then in them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By reading the following verses again and again, we can understand that the Spirit as "another Comforter" is none other than Christ Himself in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must pay close attention to these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verses 17-18 the Lord spoke of the Spirit of reality, saying, "He abides with you and shall be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From verse 17 to verse 18, the pronoun quickly changes from "He" to "I."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The very He who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17, becomes the very I who is the Lord Himself in verse 18.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is a matter of form; at that time the Lord was in the form of the flesh, but after His death and resurrection He was transfigured into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may illustrate this by water and vapor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although water becomes vapor, the essence of the water is still the same; it is different only in form.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before the Lord's death and resurrection He was a man in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the form of flesh He could not enter into His disciples, so He had to be transformed, transfigured, into another form.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After His death and resurrection, He could enter into His disciples in a mysterious way, a way which we cannot understand in full.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He came into the room with the doors closed, yet with a physical body; this is wonderful and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now He was able to breathe Himself into His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From that time forth the disciples had the Holy Spirit within them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the disciples did not have this wonderful Spirit within them, how could the one hundred twenty pray for ten days together in one accord Acts 1:14 ?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moreover, at that time in Jerusalem there was a strong threatening by the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whoever followed Jesus was persecuted, but these Galilean fishermen were not afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They gave up their homes and families in order to remain in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then they stayed together and prayed for ten days in one accord, and Peter could even understand the prophecies of the Psalms v. 20 . Who gave them this boldness and ability? It was the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the time of John 20, however, they had the indwelling Spirit, but they lacked the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They enjoyed the inward aspect but lacked the outward aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They drank of the Spirit within, yet they had no outward clothing, no uniform without.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They needed the Spirit of power as the uniform in order to exercise authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this, they had to wait until the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the second aspect of the Spirit; it is not the aspect that the Gospel of John reveals.</S>
