   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Milk and Honey</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Milk and honey are produced out of the mingling of two lives, the vegetable life and the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Deuteronomy 8:8 honey is put together with the plants: first wheat, barley, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree, and then honey.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And in Deuteronomy 32:14, milk is put together with the animals: the cattle, the flock, the milk, and the fat.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is because, for the most part, honey has to do with the plant life, and the greater part of milk is related to the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Honey is derived mainly from the plant life the flowers and the trees and it involves a part of the animal life the bees.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When these two lives are mingled together, honey is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But honey, for the most part, belongs to the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Milk is also the product of both the animal life and the vegetable life, but it belongs mainly to the animal life: it is produced from the grazing in the pasture vegetable life by the cattle and the flock animal life .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, milk and honey speak forth the goodness and sweetness of the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such experience is produced from the two aspects of the life of Christ, the generating life the vegetable life and the redeeming life the animal life .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we experience Christ as wheat, barley, and so forth, and at the same time as the cattle and the flock, the more we will enjoy Christ as milk and honey.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The final aspect of the riches in the good land is minerals, including stones, mountains, iron, and copper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These are for the building, for the kingdom, for fighting, and for security, indicating that some elements in the life of Christ are both materials for God s building and weapons for spiritual warfare.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This clearly indicates that Christ is the stone for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we experience Him as the stone living in us, He will make us, who were people of clay, living stones, transformed by His stone nature, that we may be built together with others as a spiritual house upon Him as both the foundation stone and the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Stones are always related to mountains and hills.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we want rocks, we must have mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Mountains and hills in the Scriptures always signify resurrection and ascension.</S>
