   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRODUCING THE CHURCHES THE KINGDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Propagation is a matter of production.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To propagate, therefore, is to produce.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The propagation of the resurrected Christ in His ascension produces the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The churches are the produce of the resurrected Christ in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, the churches are the produce of Christ s propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first mention of the word church in Acts is in 5:11.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thereafter, this book speaks of the church many times 8:1, 3; 9:31; 11:22, 26; 12:1, 5; 13:1; 14:23, 27; 15:3, 4, 22, 41; 16:5; 18:22; 20:17, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The churches produced by the resurrected Christ in His ascension are the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning the kingdom, we should not follow the teachings of those who claim that the kingdom of God is not present today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to such teachings, the kingdom has been suspended and will come after the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the book of Acts we see that the churches and the kingdom of God go together.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In fact, the churches actually are the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Acts the kingdom of God is first mentioned in 1:3, and then in a number of other verses 8:12; 14:22; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By now we should be impressed with the subject of the book of Acts, a book that stands as the backbone of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Acts unveils Christ in His ascension propagating Himself to produce the churches, which are the kingdom of God on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Following the book of Acts, we have the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Epistles, as the continuation of Acts, edify the saints so that the churches may be fully built up as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The consummation of this edifying and building up will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we see the place occupied by the book of Acts in the New Testament, we shall realize that this book, the backbone of the New Testament, stands in a crucial position.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A WORK IN ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have emphasized the fact that the subject of Acts is the propagation of the resurrected Christ in His ascension, by the Spirit, through the disciples, for the producing of the churches the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have seen something concerning the propagation of the resurrected Christ 2:24; 3:15; 5:30; 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we need to see that this propagation is carried out by the Lord from the throne in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that His work of propagation is in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, much of today s so-called Christian work is not a work in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We hope that the work in the Lord s recovery will be in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The ascension is the nature and the sphere of the Lord s work on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the work of the Lord today should have a heavenly nature and should be in a heavenly sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is in His ascension that Christ is propagating Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We know that His ascension came after His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ s work in His ascension takes place in the nature of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, this work is not natural; it does not have anything of the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, it is of the divine life in resurrection, and it is carried out in the atmosphere and condition of His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Where are we working today?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all should be able to say that we are working in Christ s ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The propagation of the resurrected Christ in His ascension is by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His propagation is not by any gimmick or human technique.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But consider the situation among Christians today concerning the propagation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Where is the propagation by the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In many instances, there is very little of the Spirit but much use of human methods and techniques.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, some even use rock music in their preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to realize that the propagation of the resurrected Christ is by the Spirit, in particular, the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the book of Acts we see the economical Spirit for the carrying out of Christ s propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THROUGH THE DISCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ s propagation is through the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Who are the disciples?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As we shall see, the disciples are not merely preachers, and in Acts they are not called preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, the disciples are witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord s disciples in Acts are witnesses of a wonderful Person, the One who was conceived of God the Spirit, who was born of a human virgin, who lived on earth and ministered, who entered into death and conquered it, and who came out of the tomb in resurrection, becoming the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This resurrected One has ascended into the heavens, where He is sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As He is sitting there, He is very active and aggressive in doing the work of propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The disciples are witnesses of such a One.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This was the reason the Lord said concerning them, You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth 1:8 .</S>
