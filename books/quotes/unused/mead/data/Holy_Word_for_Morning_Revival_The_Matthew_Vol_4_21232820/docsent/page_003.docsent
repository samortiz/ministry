   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 16 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 21:33-35, 37-38, 40-44</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>33 Hear another parable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There was a man, a 1 householder, who planted a 1 vineyard and put a hedge around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower; and he leased it out to 1 vinedressers and went abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>34 And when the time to harvest the fruit drew near, he sent his slaves to the vinedressers to get his fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>35 And the vinedressers took his slaves and 1 beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>37 Then later he sent to them his 1 son, saying, They will respect my son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>38 But the vinedressers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, 1 This is the heir.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Come, let us kill him and take possession of his inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>40 Therefore when the master of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>41 They said to Him, He will miserably 1 destroy those evil men and will lease the vineyard to 2 other vinedressers, who will give the fruit to him in their seasons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>42 Jesus said to them, Have you never read in the Scriptures, "The 1 stone which the 1 builders rejected, this has become the 2 head of the corner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes"?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>43 Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a 1 nation producing its fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>44 And 1 he who falls on this stone shall be broken to pieces; but on 2 whomever it falls, it shall crush him to powder and scatter him like chaff.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>33 1 The householder is God, the vineyard is the city of Jerusalem Isa 5:1 , and the vinedressers are the leaders of the Israelites v. 45 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>35 1 This was the persecution suffered by the Old Testament prophets Jer 37:15; Neh 9:26; 2 Chron 24:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>37 1 This is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>38 1 This statement indicates that the Jewish leaders, wanting to maintain their false position, envied Christ because of His rights.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>41 1 This was fulfilled when the Roman prince Titus and his army destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>41 2 These were the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>42 1 The stone is Christ, who is for God's building Isa 28:16; Zech 3:9; 1 Pet 2:4 , and the builders are the Jewish leaders, who should have been working on God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>42 2 Christ is not only the foundation stone Isa 28:16 and the topstone Zech 4:7 but also the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>43 1 This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>44 1 This is a person who stumbles on Christ; referring in particular to the unbelieving Israelites Isa 8:15; Rom 9:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>44 2 These are the nations, the Gentiles, that Christ will smite and break into pieces at His coming back Dan 2:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To the believers Christ is the foundation stone, the One in whom they trust Isa 28:16 ; to the unbelieving Jews He is the stone of stumbling Isa 8:14; Rom 9:33 ; and to the nations He will be the smiting stone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the end of this parable, the Lord Jesus not only indicated that the kingdom would be taken from Israel and given to the church; He also referred to God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church is the life-pulse of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that just as the body dies when the pulse stops, so the kingdom is wholly dependent upon the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church, in turn, is completely dependent upon the building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If there is no building, there is no practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church life is not simply a matter of meeting together or of having a little fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In whatever locality we are, we need to be builded.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this, we must enjoy and experience our Christ as the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Him and through Him we are built together.</S>
