   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE SIX PAUL S FAITHFULNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND PETER S UNFAITHFULNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Gal 2:1-14</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the foregoing messages we have pointed out that Paul was a pattern for the believers, especially for Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In particular, the formation of Paul s apostleship is a pattern for the formation of our apostleship today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we come to 2:1-14.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In these verses not only do we have a record of how Paul kept the truth; we have a pattern by which we may learn of Paul how we also may keep the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us firstly consider Paul s faithfulness to the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we shall consider Peter s unfaithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I. PAUL S FAITHFULNESS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Galatians we see that Paul was faithful, honest, frank, and bold.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the same time, he also displayed a spirit of meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He refers to such a spirit in 6:1, where he says that those who are spiritual should restore the one overtaken in an offense in a spirit of meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In writing this Epistle, Paul was endeavoring to restore the Galatian believers who had been overtaken by their weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No doubt, in their subtlety the Judaizers had taken advantage of the weakness of the Galatian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, Paul exercised a spirit of meekness in order to restore the ones who had been overtaken.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, he was bold; on the other hand, he was meek in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Regarding this, we all need to learn of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Throughout the years, both in the Far East and in the West, I have learned that much that passes for meekness is actually the playing of politics.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul certainly was not meek in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, in 2:4 he speaks of false brothers, brought in secretly, who stole in to spy out our freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In making such a statement, Paul surely was not political.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In his choice of terms he was bold and frank.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who take the lead in the churches must learn to be honest, faithful, frank, and bold, yet all of this with meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should never play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, if we are short of grace and lack the wisdom to handle a particular situation, we may need to be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But we must never be political.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In dealing with the problem in Galatia, Paul faced a situation which was serious and very touchy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 4:20 he said that he was perplexed about the Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was puzzled, not knowing how to deal with these distracted believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But even though Paul was puzzled, he did not play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the contrary, he was still frank, honest, and bold.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Playing politics is a form of lying.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the eyes of God, politics is more evil than an outright lie.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the reason that the international political situation is so evil, so deplorable, in God s sight.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many diplomats and ambassadors are experts at lying in a subtle way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some have even been trained to behave in such a manner.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church is altogether another realm, another kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this realm, the realm of the kingdom of the heavens, there should not be any lying; neither should there be any playing of politics.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In John 8:44 the Lord Jesus said that the Devil, Satan, is the father of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since playing politics is even worse than lying, it must also issue from the devilish father of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because the playing of politics is so evil and devilish, negotiations can never bring peace among the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How can there be peace among nations when the representatives of those nations lie and play politics?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the church, the earthly embassy of the heavenly kingdom, there should be no playing of politics.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul, a good example of a heavenly ambassador, was not political in dealing with the Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He spoke the truth in a frank way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You may feel that Paul was extreme in his frankness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Who else would use such a term as false brothers ?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Would you dare to call someone a false brother?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Would you write a letter in which you speak of false brothers who have stolen in to spy out our freedom?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Probably none of us would dare to be as frank as Paul was.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, in 3:1 he addressed the believers as foolish Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How bold, honest, and genuine Paul was!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Galatian believers certainly were foolish to turn from Christ to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They surely were foolish in following the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, Paul addressed them in a bold and frank manner.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us learn from him to be faithful and bold and not to play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we lack grace or the wisdom, we may be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But if we speak regarding a particular situation, we should not be political.</S>
