THE GARMENT ON WHICH THE BLOOD OF THE SIN OFFERING WAS SPATTERED BEING WASHED IN A HOLY PLACE</h2><p>&#8220;When any of its blood is spattered on a garment, you shall wash what it was spattered on in a holy place&#8221; (6:27b). This signifies that the daily walk of the one who has received redemption through the blood of Christ as the sin offering should be dealt with (cf. Eph. 4:22-24). Our daily walk, signified by the garment, should be dealt with continually.<p>The garment on which the blood of the sin offering was spattered was washed in a holy place. This signifies that the daily life of one who has received redemption through the blood of Christ as the sin offering should be dealt with in a separated, sanctified realm. From this we see that we should have regard for the blood of Christ and never consider it common.<h2 class=head1>VI. THE EARTHEN VESSEL, IN WHICH THE SIN OFFERING IS BOILED, BEING BROKEN</h2><p>&#8220;An earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken&#8221; (6:28a). This signifies that the one who, as an earthen vessel, has a relationship with Christ as the sin offering should be broken. To preach Christ to others as the sin offering, we as the earthen vessels need to be broken. If we are not broken and yet preach the gospel in our natural life, we will not see much result. We need to be broken vessels.<h2 class=head1>VII. A BRONZE VESSEL, IN WHICH THE SIN OFFERING IS BOILED. BEING SCOURED AND RINSED WITH WATER</h2><p>&#8220;If it is boiled in a bronze vessel, then it shall be scoured and rinsed with water&#8221; (6:28b). This signifies that the one who has been enlightened and judged by the Spirit (likened to a bronze mirror) to be regenerated needs not to be broken but dealt with by being scoured and rinsed.<p>If we would go to preach Christ as the sin offering to others, we must be dealt with, either by being broken or by being scoured and rinsed. We cannot go in a natural way.<h2 class=head1>VIII. EVERY MALE OF THE PRIESTS EATING OF THE SIN OFFERING, WHICH IS MOST HOLY</h2><p>&#8220;Every male among the priests may eat of it; it is most holy&#8221; (6:29). This signifies that all the stronger ones can enjoy Christ as the most holy offering in ministering Christ as the sin offering to sinners.<p>We should not think that preaching the gospel is a small thing. It requires us to be strong in the life of Christ.<h2 class=head1>IX. THE SIN OFFERING, THE BLOOD OF WHICH IS BROUGHT INTO THE TENT OF MEETING TO MAKE PROPITIATION IN THE HOLY PLACE, IN THE HOLY OF HOLIES, NOT BEING EATEN BUT BURNED WITH FIRE</h2><p>&#8220;No sin offering shall be eaten from which any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make propitiation in the holy place; it shall be burned with fire&#8221; (6:30). The propitiation mentioned here was made in the Holy of Holies (16:27). This verse signifies that Christ as the sin offering dealing with our sin and with our sinful nature on the cross to accomplish God&#8217;s redemption for us is wholly for God&#8217;s enjoyment, and we should not share it. But in our ministering Christ as the sin offering to sinners, we can share Him.<p>Concerning Christ as the sin offering, there is a portion that is only for God, and there is a portion for us to share. The top portion is for God&#8217;s enjoyment. God made Christ a propitiation for sinners, and we have no share in this. This is absolutely for God. However, when we preach Christ to others, ministering Him as the sin offering, we can share Him. Thus, God has His part, and we have our part.<p>These regulations concerning the sin offering are called &#8220;the law of the sin offering.&#8221; This indicates that even in the enjoyment of Christ, we must go along with all the regulations in life. We should not have our own choice in the way to enjoy Christ. We must enjoy Christ in the way chosen by God.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_090.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_092.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Leviticus &nbsp; pg 91</div><br></body></html>
