   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God the Spirit Entering into the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>That They May Be Mingled with the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>for Their Transformation</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to realize that every day and all the time, the three divine persons as the Divine Trinity are right within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why we Christians are very different from all the people of the world: we have the Triune God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Outwardly speaking, we are the same as they are, but inwardly, we have the Triune God, and they do not.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This Triune God is working within us to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Transformation is not merely a change in form.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is to impart some element into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This divine element changes us metabolically.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not like putting cosmetics on our faces, which adds no element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, it is a work in which some element is added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every day and every hour, God is adding Himself as an element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This element is transforming us metabolically; something old is being discharged, and something new is being imparted.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not just an outward change, but a transformation from within.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The dispensing of the Triune God has only one goal, which is to transform us, to change us metabolically with His divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way we have not only the human element, but the divine element as well.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are now a God-man, a person with both humanity and divinity, both the human nature and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are divinely human.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A turtle can never become one with a human being; neither can the angels become one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But God has become one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hallelujah, we are not "turtlely human" or "angelically human"; we are divinely human!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to be bold to tell every creature that we are divinely human.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>IN TRANSFORMING THE BELIEVERS INTO</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>PRECIOUS MATERIALS FOR THE DIVINE BUILDING Through the Growth in Life of the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>as the Materials for the Divine Building</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through the growth in life, the believers become the materials for the divine building 1 Cor 3:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Corinthians 3 tells us that we are God's plants.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has planted us on His farm v. 9 . Every plant needs growth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Within us, God is giving us the growth in life every day.</S>
