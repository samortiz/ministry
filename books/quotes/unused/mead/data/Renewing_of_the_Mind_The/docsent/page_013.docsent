   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Concerning Listening to Others</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you want to know whether or not a person's heart is proper and his mind is right, you need only talk to him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whoever can listen well has a good mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some Christians' minds are like a wheel; they rotate all day long and cannot listen to what others say to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Just as the wheel splashes dirt as it rotates, these Christians only raise questions and do not take in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These conditions indicate that a person's mind is improper.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The mind is improper because the heart is improper.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a person likes to interrupt the conversation of others, it is also a sign of sickness in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In listening to others, we can sometimes add a few remarks to indicate whether or not we agree, but constant interruption is a sign that there is sickness in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the thoughts that go through your mind swirl around and around all day long, your nous must be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this condition, a person cannot listen to others; he cannot even listen to God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The root of the sickness is in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A self-righteous, self-confident heart, a heart that believes in its own cleverness, or some prejudice in the heart makes it impossible for one to listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not being able to listen to others is a sickness of the nous.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the root of this sickness is an improper heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No matter what we hear, we have to transfer what we hear to our inner being before we can understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This work of transferring is somewhat like the work of language translation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For people who do not understand English, words must first be translated into Chinese before they can be understood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This work of "translation" within us goes on quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a man cannot understand what others say, it means that his nous cannot translate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a man misunderstands what others say, it means that the nous mistranslates.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once I was preaching in a certain place, and I told the people that man is saved not according to work, but according to what Christ has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There were two Taoists in the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After hearing my words, they told others, "He was only exhorting others to do good!"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many people are filled up inside; they cannot receive God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do not empty out what is inside of us, we will never be able to understand the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our heart should be as meek as a child's, ready to be taught before God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must tell Him, "God, I do not know if what this person says is good or bad, right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I pray that You grant me judgment, so that I will know what is right and what is wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By this, we will understand and see what God wants us to see.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many people think that the inability to understand the truth is due to the sickness of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, the basic cause is the sickness of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Concerning the Thoughts</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some people think too much with their head; others are too empty in their head and do not think at all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes people are inwardly lazy; they do not want to think too much.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sometimes people feel dull in their head and cannot think properly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A Christian's mental condition mainly falls within these two categories: either it continues to think without stopping, or it is idle and not thinking at all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some believers have a very bad memory and can only rely on their diary.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I personally do not object to a diary.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if a believer only relies on his diary to remember things, his head must be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Mrs. Penn-Lewis said that believers should not be the slaves of their diaries.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course, we all have times that we forget.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some things have not formed a deep impression in our mind and are forgotten.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is natural.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if the impression is deep enough, and we still cannot remember, something must be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Being an amnesiac or forgetting things too easily is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we cannot direct our thoughts, it is the symptom of a sick mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The only time our limbs cannot be used is when they are paralyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the same way, the only reason that the mind cannot be exercised is because it is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once a man cannot think for himself and can only act according to the thoughts given by others, he becomes a mentally passive person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A mind which cannot think is sick, while a believer's mind which thinks constantly is also sick.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thinking constantly speaks of the mind's inability to stop, while failing to think speaks of the mind's inability to move.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Both are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some people's minds are dull and seemingly bound; they cannot think at all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This condition is as sick as not being able to stop the thoughts.</S>
