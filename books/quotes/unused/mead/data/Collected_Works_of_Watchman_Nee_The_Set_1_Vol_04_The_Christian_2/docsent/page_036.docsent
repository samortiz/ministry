   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At the time Paul wrote his Epistle to the Ephesians, the latter's spiritual progress was unmatched by any other churches of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, the epistle we are about to read was written by the Lord Jesus thirty years later.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By then the signs of desolation had appeared!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A generation of saints had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although they still kept their predecessors' tradition of zealous service for the Lord, they had lost the impetus of the zeal of their predecessors.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The name of the place where this church was, Ephesus, also shows the laxity in love which would eventually come in. We would not be surprised if the church in Corinth were considered the foremost of all churches and were to lose its first love, but it is quite incomprehensible that a church as spiritual as this one would degrade into such a condition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first sentence of this letter also displays a kind of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now it is no longer a letter written "to the saints who are in Ephesus and are faithful in Christ Jesus" Eph 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, it is "to the messenger of the church in Ephesus."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How different is the first book to the Ephesians from the second book!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why would the Lord no longer send a letter to all the saints?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why would He only write to the messengers?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All of our Lord's works are full of grace, but at the same time He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church had degraded and had become a fallen one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, He could no longer write with the same loving tone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because the church had left Him, He had to order John to write to the messenger of the church, that is, to its representative.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord was writing to him and not to his church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It seems that the church was separated from Him by a long distance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church had fallen into a very dark position.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord could no longer speak to it directly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord could write to the Corinthians directly because although they had sinned, they had never loved Him so much and then afterwards left Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To leave the first love is something most displeasing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What a pity that from that day until now the church has not yet been recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now God's house is fully desolated on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our initial responsibility is to admit the fact concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But then, His love has not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What has changed is His people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This detached form of address came from the Lord from whom the church had detached itself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is because man has alienated himself from God that God is unable to draw close to man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This can be confirmed by the daily experience of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some may ask, "Will the Lord then reject His church?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Will the Lord forsake His saints?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Who were these messengers?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why were they able to converse with God face to face?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Were they officers in the church by whom the Lord conveyed His intention to the church, or were they specially capable ones through whom the Lord pronounced His judgment?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No. No. All those who know the Lord have to answer, "No." The messengers are not the capable ones.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Much less are they officers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord was not speaking to the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Neither was He speaking to the capable ones, much less the officers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we put together the phrase "to the messengers" with the expression "he who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches," we will see that the messengers are those who draw close to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are the ones who have an ear to hear the Lord, eyes to behold the Lord, and a heart to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord is still speaking to those who would listen to Him!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He has not changed!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now all those overcomers who love the Lord must not only be saved from the world but must overcome in the church as well.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is because the darkness in the church has become as thick as it is in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, God's stars must shine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But then, how many are there that will listen to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the words of the Lord were spoken to those with ears to hear, for only he who has an ear can hear.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Word says, "Let him hear."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This shows what great responsibility there is for those who have heard the Lord's words.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We often wonder why it is that the Lord held the messengers who have merely heard the voice of Christ responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Why would the Lord rebuke them when it was only the church they belonged to that had sinned?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How could the Lord impute the sin of the majority on the minority who have heard His speaking?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we understand this, we will have a clearer path before us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Ordinarily, we would admit that those who are in a certain office bear a certain responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is true that a believer who loves the Lord cannot change his environment no matter how spiritual he may be.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We can never alter the general situation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The degradation of the church is not something that we can stop with our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It seems that our weakness may give us the excuse to shirk from our responsibilities, but this is not the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The condition of our companions is actually a reflection of our own spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We ought to depart from sin and not bear the same yoke with unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We ought to purify ourselves from all filth and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are responsible if we take company with the filthy and the rebellious ones!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some may consider that if we go this way, our pathway will be too narrow and our work too small.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whether this is the case or not, however, we do not have a right to choose our own future.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord should be the One to chart our way for us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Not only should we be separated in spirit from the denominations and their sins, we should be different even in the outward name.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry" 1 Sam 15:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Rebellion is such a fearsome word!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Although many times we are rebellious, we wish God would use a lighter word to describe our sin!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Nevertheless, in this one thing the true self of Saul was exposed!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Through that one sin, he lost his kingdom forever!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>How numerous are Saul's disciples!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They obey God in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Their disobedience happens in only one in a hundred cases.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even when they spare the sheep and the oxen, they do it for a sacrifice to God!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When men rebel, they have all kinds of excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Even in rebellion they are contemplating sacrifices!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When things are going our way, we can obey the Lord much, for it does not involve much price.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But when we come face to face with the sheep, the oxen, and Agag, we are stuck.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>True obedience involves the denial of our opinion, wisdom, and love and the single-hearted practice of God's commandment in the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Even if we are despised by relatives and friends and are rejected by our companions, we should go on alone for God's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Let us wait for eternity when others will envy and acclaim our present action.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>For now, the smile from the throne is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Here the Lord revealed Himself as "He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, He who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands" Rev 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>At the beginning of every epistle, the Lord spoke something concerning Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The way He revealed Himself has something to do with the condition of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Here He spoke of the relationship between Himself, the representative of the church, and the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He spoke of His full authority to rule over the symbol of the heavenly light and His searching among the vessels of His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>How easy it is for the church that has left its first love to forget this fact!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Although the epistle was sent to the "star," the "lampstand" bore equal responsibility and will receive equal judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Lord will soon judge the world.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>That is why He is beginning from the house of God, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>These "stars" are the messengers of the churches; they are those who can represent the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They bear the spiritual responsibility of the churches before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>They are like the stars in the sky, who give light and set the time.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The faithful lovers of the Lord are the luminaries in the morally dark night of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>These gifts and power belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Although man can organize the church, institute laws and constitutions for it, and ordain teachers and pastors, in reality these works usurp the place and authority of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The seven stars are in His hand; they are not "in man's pocket."</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Only when the stars are in His hand can they bear the responsibility of their churches.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Those who desire to bear the responsibility of the churches should first fall at the feet of the Lord as dead and should then personally experience the great holding and preserving power of His "right hand."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If all the faithful servants of God, that is, those who have no offices in the denominations, would have John's experience in chapter one, the church would not have been as degraded as it is now.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>All those who desire to take up responsibility according to the Father's arrangement and for Christ's sake must have the preserving power of Christ's right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When the Lord wrote the letter to the church in Sardis, He called Himself, "He who has..the seven stars" 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>They are no longer in the Lord's right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The Lord merely "has" them.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The Lord wants them to be responsible, but they have departed from the position which enables them to be responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>However, here in Ephesus, they were still in the proper position, that is, in the right hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Only the Lord's right hand can make the stars shine according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Many were the stars in the Lord's right hand, but through their mingling with the worldly organizations and sins and through their failure to draw a distinction between these things and them, they have lost their position in the Lord's right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>On the one hand, the Lord rebukes.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>On the other hand, they have lost their right to be responsible for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>What a doubly difficult situation they have put themselves into!</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>But why do we have to fall into such a state?</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>May the Lord be merciful to us!</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>As He searched the messengers, in the same way He searched the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>He was not only "in the midst of the lampstands" 1:13 , but was now the One who "walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands."</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Not only was He managing all the lampstands, but He was also examining their conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Those believers who have left their first love often forget that the Lord knows not only our speech and conduct but our thoughts as well.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>He searches our outward failure and judges our inward shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Those who have ears will hear the voice of the Lord, and those who have eyes will see the way the Lord is taking in the midst of His churches.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>But then, how few are those who have eyes!</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Although everything in the world is under the Lord's hand, the Lord is not walking in the midst of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>If we knew the Lord's way in the churches, how much we would then willingly follow Him!</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Yet this way cannot be seen by the physical eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Because it requires faith for one to follow, there are few who have become the Lord's companions.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>However, if those saints who are in the present-day church in Laodicea knew that the Lord is kept outside the door, there would not be that many who would take company with the lukewarm ones inside the door!</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>May the Lord guide us!</S>
