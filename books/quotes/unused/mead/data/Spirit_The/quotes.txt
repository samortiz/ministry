[1]  6:34; Isa 61:1; Luke 4:18; Acts 5:9; 8:39; 2 Cor 3:17; Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18,20; Luke 4:1; Matt 3:16; Acts 10:38; Matt 12:28
[2]  We need to enter into the significance of all the different aspects of the Spirit.
[3]  We need a vision of all these different aspects which will give us a clear view of the Spirit.
[4]  The Spirit is the simplest divine title of the Spirit of God in the Bible.
[5]  The Spirit of God was brooding, stretching out His wings, over the death situation for the purpose of producing life.
[6]  This Spirit the moving Spirit, the indwelling Spirit, the revealing Spirit has been consummated to be the third in the divine person of the processed and consummated Triune God.
[7]  The Spirit of Jehovah, the Spirit of the Lord, is the reaching of God Judg.
[8]  When this verse is quoted in Luke 4:18, it says, The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me. These two verses show that the Spirit of the Lord in the New Testament is the same as the Spirit of Jehovah in the Old Testament.
[9]  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Question: I do not understand how the Triune God is three in substance and one in essence.
[10]  This note says that Spirit denotes the nature of God s Person, while John 4:24 reveals that Spirit is the essence of God.
[11]  CHAPTER TWO THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE SPIRIT 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45; Rom 8:2; John 14:16-17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:6; Acts 16:7; Rom 8:9; Phil 1:19; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Exo 30:22-31; 1 John 2:20, 27; 2 Cor 1:21; Rom 8:4-6, 16; 1 Cor 6:17; Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; Exo 25:31, 37; Zech 4:2, 10; 3:9; John 7:39; 1 Pet 1:2; Rev 22:17a
[12]  In the previous message, we saw five aspects of the Spirit.
[13]  Whenever we speak concerning the Spirit, this involves the study of the divine Trinity.
[14]  The Spirit of life is the pneumatic Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of the divine life to His believers.
[15]  Acts 16:7 says, When they had come down to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.
[16]  This indicates that in the Spirit of Jesus there is not only the divine element of God but also the human element and the elements of His human living and His suffering of death.
[17]  The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of the resurrected and life-giving Christ.
[18]  Because the Spirit of Jesus has particular reference to the Lord s suffering, and the Spirit of Christ to His resurrection, the Spirit of Jesus Christ is related to both suffering and resurrection.
[19]  The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of the Jesus who lived a life of suffering on earth and of the Christ who is now in resurrection.
[20]  In the old edition of the Newberry Bible, there is a note in Exodus 30 that says the anointing oil refers to the Holy Spirit.
[21]  The Lord went on to show us that the Spirit, typified by the ointment, is a compound Spirit.
[22]  The Brethren saw that the anointing ointment in Exodus 30 is the Holy Spirit, but they did not see that this Holy Spirit, as typified in Exodus 30, is a compound Spirit.
[23]  The four spices plus the oil are five elements.
[24]  CHAPTER THREE THE SYMBOLS OF THE SPIRIT 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 1:2 ASV note ; Deut 32:11; Isa 31:5; Matt 3:16b; John 1:32; Psa 45:7; Heb 1:9; Isa 61:1; Zech 4:6,11,14 Darby ; Exo 30:25-26; 1 John 2:20,27; 2 Cor 1:21; Ezek.
[25]  The Spirit is also symbolized by the anointing ointment, which is the compound Spirit for anointing Exo 30:25-26; 1 John 2:20, 27; 2 Cor 1:21 .
[26]  According to Ezekiel 37 the wind brings in the breath vv.
[27]  In John 20:22 the Spirit as the breath was breathed as life into the disciples for their life.
[28]  The living water is a symbol of the Spirit Exo 17:6; John 4:10, 14; 7:38-39 .
[29]  Therefore, as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, the Spirit as the river of water of life is the flow of the processed Triune God with Himself as the water of life to satisfy His chosen people that He may have an eternal manifestation to express Himself for eternity.
[30]  We Christians also need to experience the Spirit as the wind John 3:8; Acts 2:2 .
[31]  36:27; 37:14; Zech 4:6; 12:10 IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
[32]  In this message we want to fellowship concerning the functions of the Spirit in the Old Testament.
[33]  God carries out and accomplishes things as the Spirit.
[34]  Another function of the Spirit is for prophesying Num 11:25, 29; 24:2-4; 1 Sam 10:6, 10; 19:20, 23; 2 Sam 23:2; 2 Chron 15:1; 20:14; 24:20; Ezek.
[35]  The warring Spirit is the Spirit who fights against God s enemy.
[36]  Many people are working for themselves, not for God s will.
[37]  Giving Man a Right Spirit and a Willing Spirit
[38]  Isaiah 63:10 and 14 unveil that the Spirit who works in so many ways is also the grieving Spirit and the rest-giving Spirit.
[39]  Eventually, once we confess our failure to the Lord and repent, the grieving Spirit becomes the rest-giving Spirit.
[40]  CHAPTER SIX THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SPIRIT 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 1:18b, 20b; 3:11c; 28:19; Mark 1:8; Luke 3:16; John 1:33; Matt 3:16b; Luke 3:22; John 1:32; Matt 4:1; Luke 4:1b; Matt 10:20; Mark 13:11; Luke 12:12; Matt 12:18, 28a; 25:4, 8-9; Mark 1:12; Luke 1:15b, 41b, 67, 35; 2:27-29, 25-26; 4:1a, 14a; 11:20; 24:19; 4:18a; 11:11-13; 15:8; John 3:5-6, 8, 34; 6:63; 7:38-39; 14:16; 15:26a; 16:7; 14:17a; 15:26b; 16:13a; 14:17b, 26; 15:26c; 16:8, 13-15; 20:22 IN THE NEW TESTAMENT THE FOUR GOSPELS
[41]  The leading of the Spirit in the Gospels is in reference to Jesus.
[42]  First, the Spirit broods over Jesus for His ministry of producing life.
[43]  Then the same Spirit, the brooding Spirit, became the leading Spirit.
[44]  The Spirit has the function of infilling as the oil in the vessel Matt 25:4, 8-9 .
[45]  This shows that when the Lord Jesus was begotten in Mary, Mary had the Spirit within as the essential Spirit to beget, and she had the Spirit without as the economical Spirit to overshadow her, to cover her.
[46]  If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall the Father who is from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?
[47]  This indicates that the Lord s speaking gives us the Spirit, that is, the Lord gives us the Spirit by speaking the words of God.
[48]  The second Comforter is the Spirit of truth, the Spirit of reality.
[49]  The Spirit makes God real, makes Christ real, and makes all the divine things concerning God and Christ real.
[50]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SPIRIT 3 Scripture Reading: Acts 1:5; 8:15-19; 10:44, 47; 11:15-16; 19:2, 6; 2:4a; 4:8, 31; 9:17c; 13:9; 6:3, 5a; 7:55; 11:24; 13:52 IN THE NEW TESTAMENT THE ACTS
[51]  In the previous messages, we have covered the functions of the Spirit in the Old Testament and in the four Gospels.
[52]  The functions of the Spirit are what the Spirit did, what the Spirit does, and what the Spirit is going to do.
[53]  The Spirit also has the function of filling outwardly Acts 2:4a; 4:8, 31; 9:17c; 13:9 .
[54]  The Spirit lives as God with the church Acts 5:3-4, 9 .
[55]  In Acts 5, Ananias and Sapphira lied both to Peter and to the church, but Peter told them that they lied to the Holy Spirit.
[56]  To lie to the Spirit is to lie to God.
[57]  The cloud was God s presence, typifying the Spirit as the presence of God.
[58]  Acts 15 tells us that the Spirit co-decided with the apostles and the elders with the whole church vv.
[59]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SPIRIT 4 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 5b, 9, 11, 13b, 14, 16, 23, 26-27; 1 Cor 2:4, 9-15 IN THE NEW TESTAMENT THE EPISTLES
[60]  In message seven we saw the functions of the Spirit in the book of Acts.
[61]  As the flesh in verse 3 refers to the human essence of Christ, so the Spirit of holiness in verse 4 does not refer to the person of the Holy Spirit of God, but to the essence of Christ s divinity.
[62]  Romans 8:5 says, For those who are according to flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to spirit, the things of the Spirit.
[63]  We need to ask what the things of the Spirit are.
[64]  The Triune God is realized as the Spirit and applied to us as the Spirit.
[65]  Romans 8:26 and 27 say, And in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness; for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered; but He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because He intercedes for the saints according to God.
[66]  In 1 Corinthians 2:4, Paul said, And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.
[67]  The apostle s speech and preaching were not from his mind with words of speculation, but from his spirit with the release and exhibition of the Spirit, hence, of power.
[68]  God reveals the deep and hidden things to us through the Spirit, for these things have not been seen by man s eyes, heard by man s ears, nor have they come up in man s heart.
[69]  According to 1 Corinthians 6:17, the Spirit joins the believers to the Lord, making them one spirit with the Lord.
[70]  Then he said, But I think I also have the Spirit of God v. 40 . Paul s speaking was the Spirit s speaking.
[71]  CHAPTER NINE THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SPIRIT 5 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:21-22; 3:3, 6, 8, 17, 18b; 13:14; Gal 3:14; 5:16, 18, 22, 25; Eph 2:18; 3:16; Phil 1:19
[72]  Paul told the Corinthians in 2 Corinthians 3:3 that they were a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God.
[73]  The Spirit is the ink with which the servants of God are inscribing us.
[74]  When we receive the Spirit as the ink, all the things compounded in the Spirit Christ s divinity, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension are added into our being.
[75]  The Spirit has the function of fellowshipping, which implies communication.
[76]  Second Corinthians 13:14 says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
[77]  While the Spirit is walking with us and fighting for us, He is leading us Gal 5:18 .
[78]  We get to the meetings by the leading of the Spirit.
[79]  CHAPTER TEN THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SPIRIT 6 Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:19-20; 1 Tim 3:16; 2 Tim 1:14; Titus 3:5b; Heb 6:4b; 9:14; 10:29c; James 4:4-5; 1 Pet 1:10-12a; 4:14; 1 John 3:24; 4:13, 6; 5:6-9; Rev 2:7; 14:12-13; 22:17
[80]  In this message we want to continue to see the functions of the Spirit in the Epistles of the New Testament.
[81]  The Spirit has the function of preaching in the gospel.
[82]  First Timothy 4:1 says, The Spirit says expressly that in later times some will depart from the faith.
[83]  This verse does not mean that the Spirit speaks directly without some human instrument or vessel.
[84]  The Holy Spirit is the divine person, washing and renewing us in the divine element to make us a new creation with the divine nature to be heirs of God in His eternal life, inheriting all the riches of the Triune God.
[85]  In 1 Peter 1:10-12a we see the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ witnessing beforehand the death and glorification of Christ as a revelation to the Old Testament prophets.
[86]  When the Old Testament prophets were prophesying concerning Christ, the Spirit of Christ was in them, witnessing to them how and when Christ would die and how and when Christ would be glorified, first in His resurrection and then in His ascension.
[87]  The Spirit s witnessing means that the Spirit within them was saying, What you are speaking now concerning the coming Christ is right.
[88]  This very Spirit of glory, being the Spirit of God Himself, rests upon the suffering believers in their persecution for the glorification of the resurrected and exalted Christ, who is now in glory.
[89]  First John 4:6 says that the Spirit is the Spirit of truth.
[90]  But we have the Spirit within us, and the indwelling Spirit makes everything taught concerning Christ in the New Testament so real to us.
[91]  Chapters two and three of Revelation say seven times that the Spirit speaks to all the churches 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .
[92]  The Spirit as the sevenfold intensified Spirit is now speaking to all the churches.
[93]  In previous messages we have seen the functions of the Spirit in the New Testament.
[94]  If we are going to experience God and Christ, we must know what the Spirit is to God and what the Spirit is to Christ.
[95]  The Spirit is the essence of Christ s divine being.
[96]  In Romans 1:3-4 Paul said that Christ came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, and was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.
[97]  The Lord s word here covers the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in a way to help us see that the Spirit of reality is the realization of Christ.
[98]  The Spirit and the cross are both the consummation of Christ s redemptive work.
[99]  Christ has completed His redemptive work, and the result of this work is the Spirit and the cross.
[100]  The Spirit after Christ s redemptive work with His death and resurrection is not the same as He was before Christ s death and resurrection.
[101]  Before His death and resurrection, the Spirit was merely the Spirit of God.
[102]  After Christ s redemption, the Spirit is called the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 , the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , and the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .
[103]  The interchangeable use of the Spirit of Jesus with the Holy Spirit reveals that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit.
[104]  The Holy Spirit is a general title of the Spirit of God in the New Testament; the Spirit of Jesus is a particular expression concerning the Spirit of God and refers to the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in His humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross.
[105]  The Holy Spirit says no to sanctify us, and the Spirit of Jesus says go to send us out to accomplish the will of God under the cross.
[106]  The Spirit is the realization of Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God John 14:16-20 .
[107]  Furthermore, the consummated Spirit is the positive consummation of the work of Christ John 19:34 .
[108]  In 1 Corinthians Paul said that Jews asked for signs and Greeks sought wisdom 1:22 , but he preached Christ crucified v. 23 . Then he said that he determined to know only Jesus Christ and this One crucified 2:2 . The Spirit of Christ always leads us to live a crucified life, conforming us to the death of Christ.
