   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Dissension Existing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>among the Philippian Believers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even though the Philippian believers participated with Paul in the furtherance of the gospel, there was still at least some amount of dissension among them 1:27; 2:1-4; 4:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we shall see, the reason for this dissension lay in the fact that they were not one in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They had been regenerated in the spirit, but they had not yet been transformed in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They had no problem in the spirit, but there were at least some problems in the soul, particularly in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some among them had different concepts, and these different concepts were causing dissension.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE SUBJECT THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we have already indicated, the subject of Philippians is the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Concerning the experience of Christ, each chapter of Philippians covers a major point.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First in chapter one we have the magnification of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No matter what the circumstances are in which we find ourselves, we need to express Christ in such a way that we magnify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In chapter two Paul presents Christ as our pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In everything we do, we need a pattern, a model, an example.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even in the experience of Christ and the enjoyment of Christ, we need a pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This pattern is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Chapter three indicates that Christ should be our goal, our aim.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We who love the Lord and seek Him are not aimless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our aim is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is the goal toward which we press.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Finally, in chapter four, Christ is our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 4:13 Paul says, I can do all things in Him who empowers me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is not only the pattern and the goal; He is also the strength, the power, the dynamo.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the dynamo within us, He empowers us to live Him, to magnify Him, and to press on toward Him as the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the four chapters of Philippians we see Christ as the One lived out and magnified, Christ as the pattern, Christ as the goal, and Christ as our inward strength.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This book on the experience of Christ covers four major points: the expression, the pattern, the goal, and the strength.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all need to experience Christ in this fourfold way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A. For the Overcoming</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>of the Influence of the Judaizers</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was necessary for the Philippians to experience Christ in order to overcome the influence of the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also need to experience Christ if we would overcome the opposition we face today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot overcome the barking of religious dogs by anything we have in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The opposition is too severe to be overcome by our own efforts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this, we need the adequate experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to experience Christ in such a way that we live Him, and take Him as our pattern, goal and power.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such an experience of Christ will enable us to overcome all opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more we are opposed, the more we should live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should be like a ball full of air: the more we are suppressed, the higher we rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In a sense, we should be thankful for all the opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because of it, we are being stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, it is not sufficient merely to be awakened and stirred up to stand against the opposition; we must go on to live Christ and to magnify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As we experience Christ, we shall overcome the negative influence of today s religionists.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>B. For the Discernment</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>of the Preaching of Christ in Rivalry</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through the experience of Christ, we shall also acquire discernment concerning the different ways of preaching Christ, in particular concerning the preaching of Christ in rivalry 1:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more we experience Christ, the more discernment we shall have.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In fact, Christ Himself will become our discernment, our sensitive perception, our moral tact.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By experiencing Christ we become sensitive and tactful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such tact is neither natural nor that gained by education.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It comes only through the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As we experience Christ, He becomes our perception and tact, the discernment by which we see through the intentions of others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>With Christ as our x-ray, no one can hide from our perception.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We all need such discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>C. For the Participation</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>in the Furtherance of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We also need to experience Christ so that we may participate in the furtherance of the gospel 1:27-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Through the experience of Christ, we are able to share in God s move in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>D. For the Abolishing of Dissension</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Finally, the experience of Christ is for the abolishing of dissension 2:5, 12-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Dissension can be abolished only through the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The more experience of Christ we have, the less dissension there will be.</S>
