We do not even know ourselves. We must simply believe that God created us with a human spirit. Moreover, God is Spirit, and He became incarnated, putting on flesh and blood. Then He died, was buried, and in His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. When we believed in Him, He entered into our spirit as the life-giving Spirit. Now the Spirit works together with our spirit, and the two spirits have become one to such an extent that it is difficult to discern which is which. If we do not know our spirit, we cannot live a proper Christian life. The Christian life is altogether a life in our mingled spirit.</P><P>We must not analyze, convince ourselves, or try to convince others that we have these two spirits. We must exercise our faith based upon what is written in the holy Bible. In expressing his opinion concerning marriage, Paul said, "But I think that I also have the Spirit of God" (1 Cor. 7:40). He may not have felt the Spirit, and he had no way to prove that he had the Spirit, but he thought he had the Spirit of God. We must not be influenced by the teaching that we must pray and do many things before we can receive the Spirit. We should simply take the Word and exercise our spirit to believe what the Word says. We must forget about whether or not we have a certain feeling that we have the Spirit.</P><P>We must have the assurance that we are acting, behaving, and even having our being in our spirit, but it is hard to tell if we are in the spirit. It is easier to know when we are not in the spirit. If we lose our temper, we know that is in the flesh. If we are so logical and philosophical, we know that is in the soul. When we are not in the spirit, we know it, but when we are in the spirit, we do not know it. This may be illustrated by the organs of our body. When there is no problem with our stomach, we are not aware of it, but when our stomach has a problem, we are aware of it. Not to know is a great blessing. If we are certain that we know something in our spirit, this may indicate that we are not in the spirit. To say of a certainty that we are in the spirit is not a good sign. The apostle John did say, "I was in spirit on the Lord's day" (Rev. 1:10), but he said it by faith, not by feeling. When John was in exile on the island of Patmos, his entire being was concentrated on the Lord. Surely he was in the spirit, but this does not mean that he had the feeling that he was in spirit. He had the fact, and he told us the fact. We also can say that we are in our spirit, not because we feel it, but because we believe it.</P><P>We must learn not to trust in our feelings. Rather, it is better to believe more. Paul said, "That Christ may make His home in your heart through faith" (Eph. 3:17). We know that Christ is making His home in our hearts not by feeling but through faith. It is altogether a matter of faith. As believers in Christ, we must believe that we have a human spirit and that it has been regenerated. We also have the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit, and the two spirits are one. For this reason, in many verses in the New Testament, we cannot discern whether "spirit" denotes the divine Spirit or the human spirit. It simply denotes the wonderful mingled spirit in us. This wonderful spirit consists of our spirit and the divine Spirit. In experience we must be blind and simply exercise our faith. The Bible says it is so, so we say it is so. Hallelujah! We have a spirit, and the divine Spirit mingles with our human spirit and is one spirit with our human spirit. We cannot analyze this; we can only believe it. We simply must do our duty to live, act, move, do things, and have our being in our spirit.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages to the Trainees in Fall 1990 &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
