<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Jehovah Whistling for Them<br>and Gathering Them</H2><P>Verses 8 through 12 reveal further aspects of the Lord's loving visitation to Israel. Verse 8 says, "I will whistle for them and gather them, for I have redeemed them; / And they will multiply as they have multiplied." The Lord's whistling is not shrill but mild and gentle, somewhat like the singing of a bird. Often during our time of morning revival, the Lord whistles to us, calling us and gathering us to Him.</P><P>Verses 9 and 10 continue, "I will sow them among the peoples; and in distant lands they will remember Me; / And they will live with their children and return. / I will also bring them back from the land of Egypt / And gather them out of Assyria; / And to the land of Gilead and Lebanon I will bring them; / And there will not be enough room found for them." The Lord's people will surely multiply. I believe that we will see many new ones in the local churches. That will be the real multiplication in the new way.</P><P>Verse 11 goes on to say, "He will pass through the sea of distress / And strike the waves in the sea, / And all the depths of the Nile will dry up; / And the pride of Assyria will be brought down." The sea mentioned here is the Red Sea which, along with the Nile, protects Egypt and keeps it separate. However, God will strike the waves in the Red Sea and dry up the Nile.</P><P>Verse 12 concludes, "I will strengthen them in Jehovah, / And they will walk about in His name, / Declares Jehovah." The I here is Jehovah, indicating that Jehovah will strengthen His people in Himself. They will then walk about in His name. To be in someone's name is to be one with the person who is the reality of that name. To be in God's name is to be one with God in our daily walk, living, walking, and having our being in God's name.</P><P>All of chapter ten talks about God's loving visitation. We need to realize and remember that this visitation is actually Christ's coming. I can testify from my experience that when we enjoy the Lord's loving visitation, our situation is exactly like that of God's people described in this chapter. Often after we enjoy such a loving visitation, our situation changes. In His visitation He encourages us to seek more blessings. We are little lambs, but after His loving visitation, we become horses. We are not that bold or strong, but after the Lord's visitation with His dear touch, we are strengthened to become horses of majesty in battle. Eventually, the Lord strengthens us in Himself so that we may walk about in His name.</P>
