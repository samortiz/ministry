   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AS THE GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS Scripture Reading: Rev 1:1-5, 9-13; 12:17; 19:10; 3:14; Exo 25:31-32, 37 THE BOOK OF REVELATION BEING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>OF THE DIVINE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the last book of the Bible, Revelation is the ultimate consummation of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even in human writing and speaking, the last word is important.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible is a long story with sixty-six books, but without the final book we would miss very much.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we read only Genesis through Jude, we would be lost, knowing neither the goal, destination, nor completion of the Bible, nor the ultimate revelation of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must all see that this book is crucial to our Christian life, especially in the end times.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Unveiling God s Eternal Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>to Have a Building</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s eternal purpose is to have a building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible opens with creation, but it closes with a city.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This tells us that God s work began with creation and will consummate with a building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Genesis 1:1 says, In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, but at the end of the Bible what we see is not merely a new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the entire universe were only the heavens and the earth, it would be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may prefer the heavens, but if God s goal is not accomplished there, they are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is on earth that there will be something that attains to God s goal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, at the end of the Bible there are three new items: the new heaven, the new earth, and the New Jerusalem Rev 21:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we were to enter into the new heaven and new earth without the New Jerusalem, we would need to weep.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without the New Jerusalem we would have no home in the new heaven and new earth, no city or building where we can meet with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Strictly speaking, God will eventually be neither in the heavens nor on the earth but in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Jerusalem is His final goal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This demonstrates that in order to know God, we need to know the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Presenting the Revelation of Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To some extent, Revelation contains teachings and prophecies, but it is not merely a book of teachings and prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first two verses of this book tell us that it is the revelation of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Among Christian teachers and Bible students there is much dispute about the small phrase the revelation of Jesus Christ in 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some say that it refers to the revelation given by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, this phrase means that this book is the revelation concerning Christ; it is the unveiling of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The word revelation refers to the opening of a curtain or veil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a person has a veil over him, we will not be able to see him, and the more we try to study him, the more we will not accurately know him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This illustrates the situation in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The book of Revelation is meant to be an unveiling, but the more people read it, the more they are veiled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Up until this day, many among us may still not see what is in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some may say that this book tells us about the beasts and how one has ten horns and seven heads 13:1-2, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Others may see that the seven lampstands are the seven churches, but they do not know why the churches are signified by lampstands 1:12, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the book of Revelation we should see only one figure, Jesus Christ, because this book is the revelation and unveiling of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we have said before, we may compare this book to a painting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may have a painting of a lion, but in order to bring out the figure of the lion, we need a background and an environment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The best paintings always have a good background and environment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The main figure in the book of Revelation is Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah 5:5 , but in order to present this wonderful Lion, Revelation has a certain background and environment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the first vision of this book, the Lion is walking in the midst of the seven lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At this point, though, He is not in the form of a lion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As He is walking in the midst of the lampstands, He is the High Priest 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Later, many other characters come into the picture.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In chapter 12 there is a wonderful woman vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is difficult to tell where she is, because she is clothed with the sun, the moon is underneath her feet, and a crown of stars is on her head.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After this, a serpent creeps in v. 9 , and then there are two beasts 13:1-2, 11 . All these characters are a wonderful environment for the painting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eventually, after traveling through a long journey, the Lion is enthroned in the center of the New Jerusalem as the King of kings and Lord of lords.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the painting of the divine Lion in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we have seen this painting, then we will know what we are and where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are not the creeping snake or one of the beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are the golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Knowing Christ Not Only As the Redeeming Lamb but Also As the Overcoming Lion</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some Christians focus on the serpent, the beasts, and the woman and miss Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They study the background but miss the main figure of the painting.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to see the unveiling of Christ in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every Christian knows the Christ in the four Gospels, but very few see Him in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Christ in the book of Revelation is different from the Christ in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Gospel of John says that He is the Lamb 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Revelation also says that He is the Lamb, but it tells us something further.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is no longer only the Lamb; He is now the Lion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lion is not the same as the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Is our Christ today the Lamb or the Lion?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We may say that He is the Lion, but in our experience He is still the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In Revelation 5 the angel introduced Him as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, but when John turned to see Him, he saw a Lamb vv.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Today He is no longer only the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the four Gospels He is the Lamb, but in Revelation He is the Lamb-Lion.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we love the Lord, He is the Lamb to us, but to those who do not love Him He is the Lion.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He is the Lamb to us and the Lion to the enemy, the world, and the sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Since we do love Him and He is the Lamb to us, why must He also be a Lion?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is because there are still many negative things in us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He died on the cross as the Lamb of God to redeem us, but even after being redeemed, we are still mixed with many negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, He must also be the Lion to deal with these things.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the Gospels, John could recline on Jesus bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>John was close to Him, and He was nice, dear, gentle, kind, and loving to John.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, when John saw Him again in Revelation, he was frightened and fell at His feet as dead John 13:23; Rev 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Out of His mouth proceeded not words of grace but a two-edged sword Luke 4:22; Rev 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In John, Jesus looked at people and wept; He truly captured people by His loving look.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In Revelation, though, His eyes are like a flame of fire, burning and shining John 11:35; Luke 22:61; Rev 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, we have the full freedom to say that the Christ in Revelation is different from the Christ in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We all need to see this different Christ.</S>
