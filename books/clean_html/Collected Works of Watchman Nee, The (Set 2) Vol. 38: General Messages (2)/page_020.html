<h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>There are many ways of reading the Bible. Reading it through sequentially from beginning to end is only one way of reading it. There is another way of reading, which a Christian should practice as soon as he begins his Christian life. This is reading early in the morning. There is one condition for this kind of reading of the Word&mdash;one has to rise up early every morning. It is another matter if you are sick and you are told by a doctor to rest. But every normal, healthy person should rise up early. When the sun comes out, the manna is gone. Many people read the Bible too late; therefore, they cannot read it well. You must catch the early morning hour to read God's Word.</p><p>However, no one can rise up early if he goes to bed late. It is another matter if some are required to stay up late by their work. But many people have no special reason to go to bed late; they have built up the habit of putting things off until the evening. When they go to bed late, they cannot rise early. Some people are not busy at all; they just like to waste their time at night. They like to stay a little longer in the sitting room and chat a little longer, and before they know it, half an hour has passed. Whoever wastes or ill-manages his time this way will find it hard to rise up early; it will be hard for him to do anything in a systematic way. We have to develop the habit of retiring to bed on time and rising on time. Many people are very weak when it comes to the matter of rising. They cannot control themselves and cannot rise up early to touch the Lord. As soon as possible, young Christians should develop the habit of rising early. They may find it hard the first day; however, by the second or third day, they will not find it as hard. After a period of time, it will become natural to them.</p><p>One brother was determined to rise up between half-past four and five o'clock in the morning. When he woke up the first morning, it was six o'clock. When he woke up the second morning, it was six o'clock again. He was determined to get up at five. The next night he constantly looked at the clock and did not sleep well from two until five in the morning. He realized that this was not right, because when he did not sleep well at night, it was harder for him to rise up in the morning. He realized that the only thing he could do was look to the Lord. On the third night, he prayed, "God, I am going to sleep now. I commit myself to Your hand. Please wake me up at five tomorrow morning." Then he went to sleep soundly. The next morning when he woke up, he was afraid that it was six o'clock again. But thank the Lord, it was exactly five o'clock; it was not a minute late or early. From that day on and for many years, he woke up at the right time. We believe that when we truly commit ourselves to God, He will wake us up.</p><p>I am not saying that everyone should rise up at five o'clock. If you can rise up earlier, it is good. But if you have some hardship, you may need to rise up later. We do not suggest going to an extreme. We all have to judge ourselves according to our physical strength. We have to learn how many hours of sleep we need and when we need to go to bed. Then we will know when we can get up in the morning, whether it is five o'clock, half-past five, or six o'clock. We have to plan well before the Lord. Once we make our plan, we can rise up every morning according to our plan to read God's Word.</p><p>We can testify that reading the Word early in the morning is the best nourishment for our spiritual life. We can read the Bible at other times, but reading it in the morning has a different flavor to it, and it reaps special benefits for us. If we have not experienced the benefit of reading the Word early in the morning, I hope that we will start practicing it and will not miss out on this blessing.</p>
