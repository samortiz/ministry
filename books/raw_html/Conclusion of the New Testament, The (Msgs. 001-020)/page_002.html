<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEW TESTAMENT AND GOD’S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:7b; Matt. 1:22; Luke 24:25-27, 44-46; Rom. 1:2; 1 Cor. 15:3-4; Col. 1:25-27; Eph. 1:9-10; 3:9-11; Rom. 14:17; Rev. 21:2, 10-11</h1><p>In this series of messages we shall cover the conclusion of the New Testament. Because the New Testament contains twenty-seven books, it is difficult to speak on the conclusion of the New Testament. In this message we shall consider the New Testament and God’s New Testament economy.<h2 class=head1>THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><h2 class=head2>Related to the Old Testament</h2><p>The New Testament is related to the Old Testament. This relationship is indicated by a portion of Hebrews 10:7: “In the roll of the book it is written concerning Me.” This refers to the Old Testament, which gives us a full record of Christ, either by plain words or by types (Luke 24:27, 44, 46; John 5:39, 46).<p>Augustine once said that the New Testament is contained in the Old and that the Old Testament is explained in the New. We may put the matter this way: The New Testament is in the Old contained, and the Old Testament is in the New explained. This means that the New Testament is in the Old Testament and that the Old Testament is explained by the New Testament.<h2 class=head3>The Central Line concerning Christ</h2><p>What does it mean to say that the New Testament is contained in the Old Testament? What are the contents of the New Testament that are contained in the Old Testament? Some might say that in the Old Testament we have many promises, prophecies, types, and shadows concerning Christ. This, of course, is correct. The focal point of all the promises, prophecies, types, and shadows in the Old Testament is Christ. However, we must go further to ask this question: What kind of Christ has been promised, prophesied, typified, and shadowed in the Old Testament? Are you able to give a brief description of such a Christ?<p>It is easy to see, even without revelation, that the Old Testament presents Christ as the King. According to Genesis 3:15, Christ is the One who crushes the head of the serpent. This verse, however, does not speak of the central matters concerning what Christ is. The central line concerning Christ in the Old Testament is that Christ is the eternal God incarnated to be a man who lived on earth, died on the cross, resurrected, ascended, and descended. These seven major points are the central line regarding Christ as promised, prophesied, typified, and shadowed in the Old Testament. Concerning Christ’s being the eternal God, Micah 5:2 says that His origin is from eternity. Furthermore, Isaiah 9:6 speaks of Him as the mighty God.<p>For what purpose did Christ, the eternal God, become incarnate, live on earth, die on the cross, resurrect from among the dead, ascend to the heavens, and descend? Those with a superficial knowledge of the Scriptures might say, “Christ became a man, lived on earth, was crucified, resurrected, ascended, and descended in order to rescue me from hell and bring me to heaven.” In the light of the New Testament, we can strongly say that Christ, the eternal God, was incarnated, lived on earth, died on the cross, resurrected from among the dead, ascended to the heavens, and descended for the dispensing of the Triune God into His chosen people for the producing of the church. Although the word “church” cannot be found in the Old Testament, certain persons typify the church. For example, both Eve and Rebekah typify the church. Hence, both Christ and the church are contained in the Old Testament.
