<p>The trouble with some people is that they turn the order of Christ and the Bible around. They want to know the Bible first and then know Christ. But it is possible for a man to know the Bible yet at the same time to not know Christ. Matthew and Peter received mercy from God to have Christ first revealed in them. When they read the Scripture afterwards, every sentence was clear to them. We are not Jews and may not realize the significance of this. Suppose we were Jews and lived as Old Testament men in the land of Judea. When we studied the Old Testament according to the outward letter, the whole book would be a mystery to us. Today, the Old Testament is still a mystery to many unbelievers and so-called theologians. But Peter, Matthew, John, and James met Jesus of Nazareth, and God revealed His Son in them. The more they read the Old Testament, the more it was opened to them. When they came to a passage, they could say, "This is a fulfillment of what was written." Throughout this book, from Genesis 1 to Malachi 4, they found that this Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God, the very Christ. They did not know the Scripture through the Scripture itself, but through Christ. Those who know Christ know the Bible spontaneously. Many so-called Christians, nominal Christians, have read the Bible for years but know nothing about it. However, once they see that Jesus is the Savior, they have a different feeling altogether when they read the Bible. It is a new book to them.</p><p>Hence, when one knows the Lord, he knows the Bible. Revelation comes from Christ. Once a person has a revelation of Christ, he has a revelation of the Bible. Those who think that they know the Lord just from the book do not necessarily have revelation. The experiences of many who know the Lord tell us that it is useless to study the Bible by itself. We must remember that a man must first know Christ before he can know the Bible. This was the case with the twelve disciples. It was the same with Paul. He was a Pharisee, that is, one who knew the Scripture very well. The Pharisees were very familiar with the Scripture, yet they did not know the Lord. Although Paul was a good and pious Pharisee, and although he knew the Scripture very well, he persecuted those who were of the Way (Acts 9:2; 22:4). It is possible for a man to know and be familiar with the Bible and yet still persecute the Lord Jesus. Paul was such a man. Paul did not study the Scripture and then suddenly realize one day through his study that Jesus is the Son of God. Rather, God shone on him one day, which brought him the realization that this One was the Lord. Here was a man who hated and persecuted the Lord. He sought out believers, both male and female, in order to bring them bound to Jerusalem. He was a stern persecutor of the church. What a wicked person he was! Yet as soon as God flashed His light on him, he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?" Immediately he answered, "Who are You, Lord?" and went on to inquire of the Lord what he should do (Acts 9:1-6; 22:10). The prostration was genuine. The fall was real. Paul's body fell, his self fell, and his whole being fell. Paul was humbled in his outward man, and he was humbled in his inward man. After he received this revelation, what do we learn of Paul in the rest of the book of Acts and in the Epistles? He was able to interpret the Old Testament. He was able to tell us that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, the Son of the living God. The Old Testament became an open book, a living book, to him.</p><p>You can read the Bible. But if you set aside the knowledge of Christ, your Bible becomes a closed book to you. This is why many educated and intelligent people find the Bible confusing and mysterious. You can tell them about all the merits of this book, but they will only shake their heads. To you this book is very clear, but to them it is very confusing. They do not know Christ. If a man knows Christ, he will know God's word. This does not mean that no one can find God by reading the Bible. Some do find God from reading the Bible. But this is a case of God's mercy; He chooses to enlighten such a person this way. While he is reading the Bible, God takes pleasure in revealing His Son to him and saving him. The way to know the Bible is by knowing Christ. Paul was led by God to the point where he could explain to others in his many Epistles who this Jesus was. When we read Romans, Galatians, and Ephesians, we find a man who was crystal clear about the Old Testament. Where did Paul's knowledge come from? He first knew Christ, and through that knowledge, he knew the Scripture.</p>
