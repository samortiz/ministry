<h2 class="head2">Si-Tou</h2><p>Since my return home, I stayed with the co-workers in Ping-Yang for a few months learning to preach the gospel. Last year I was in Brother Wu Siu-liang's house in Tung-Cheng teaching a few children and helping to preach the gospel. God has affirmed the gospel with miracles and wonders, and many people have come to listen, among whom many have believed. It is a blessing for my eyes to be able to behold His work. Thank Him. There was only one household in Tung-Cheng in the beginning, plus a few brothers from out of town. But now there are over a hundred people meeting every Lord's Day. Thank the Lord and glory to Him! The Lord has indeed opened the door of the gospel for His church. I answered the call of the brothers in Si-Tou, which is a few dozen miles from Tung-Cheng, to take a part-time teaching job and to learn to serve the Lord part-time. The Lord's table has been raised up with over ten brothers and sisters. On the Lord's Day there are over thirty people in the meeting. There are two more desolate areas in Fu-Ting that now have churches of God. All the work is the result of the pioneering effort of co-workers from Ping-Yang. I tell you this as an aid to your prayer. The Lord has led Brothers Hwa Shi-bin, David Hsu, and Chang Kwang-rong to work in Ping-Yang, Tai-Shun, and Fu-Ting for a while. Thank the Lord.</p><p>Lin Wei-jung, October 14</p><h2 class="head2">Yu-Si, Fu-Ching, Fukien Province</h2><p>Thank the Lord that He has given us peace so that we can testify to His salvation.
