   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KINGLINESS COMING OUT OF HOLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The human nature must be holy in order to be mingled with the divine nature, which is kingly.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As long as we have the divine nature, we have the kingship, for anything divine is kingly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is easy for us to be kingly if we are holy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are willing to be utterly separated unto God without any reservation, we will be kingly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more we are separated unto God, the more we are holy and kingly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After staying in the presence of the Lord for a certain time as holy, separated priests, we come out from the Lord s presence with something divine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We went to the Lord with something human, but we come out of the Lord s presence with something divine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We come out as the kingly priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must be holy in order to be kingly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we come to others, after staying in the presence of the Lord, they sense something divine and kingly in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the kingly priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We now have something of Christ to impart to them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is typified by the bread and wine, which show the One who died for us and gave His body and blood for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The bread and wine typify the redeeming Christ who gave Himself for us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before we reach the unbelievers, we must be holy priests in order to be kingly priests.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must first go into the presence of the Lord with all the names of our unbelieving friends and tell the Lord all about their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In doing this, we are ministering in the presence of the Lord as holy priests.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But many times when we go to the Lord with such a need, the Lord will first point out something in us which has to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are not willing to meet the Lord s requirements, we are finished and are discharged from the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if we are willing to be dealt with, we will be able to stay in the presence of the Lord as holy priests for our unbelieving friends.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After staying in the Lord s presence again and again for some time, the Lord will guide us to go out of His presence to our friends.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we will go with the divine nature and the divine kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not go simply as a human being, but also as a divine being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We go to them as kingly priests, imparting something of God into them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That impartation into them will be the redeeming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means we bring the bread and wine to our unbelieving friends.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whatever we minister to them will be something of the bread and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then eventually, some of our friends will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the ten days before Pentecost, Peter with the hundred and twenty prayed and prayed in the upper room.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time they were the holy priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For ten days they were fully and absolutely separated unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They brought all the needs of man into the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After ten days, on the day of Pentecost, they came out of the presence of the Lord declaring unto the people what the Lord Jesus had done.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then they were the kingly priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even the people looked upon them as kings, not as fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As Peter stood there speaking, the people sensed something weighty, something divine, and something heavenly and kingly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was a kingly priest, imparting Christ as bread and wine to those in need.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Melchisedec came to meet Abraham, he came out of the presence of God and ministered something of God as the bread and wine to strengthen Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Abraham had been fighting the battle for a long time and was very tired and needy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He needed the bread and wine to sustain him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, Melchisedec came from God and came with God to minister the bread and wine unto him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the kingly priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We as priests must realize that whenever we go into the presence of the Lord with our needs and the needs of others we are holy priests.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why we must be separated from so many common things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we get right with the Lord and are saturated with His glory, we will come out of His presence as royal, kingly priests unto the people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then we will minister unto them Christ Himself as the redeeming One, typified by the bread and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are separated from the world, and we are saturated with His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is both the holy and royal priesthood.</S>
