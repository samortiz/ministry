   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, those who constitute the bride of Christ are the guests invited to the wedding feast.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The marriage dinner of the Lamb here is the wedding feast in Matthew 22:2.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It will be a reward to the overcoming believers.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, after being dealt with by the Lord in the kingdom age, they will participate in the New Jerusalem for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, to be invited to the wedding feast of Christ, which will usher the overcoming believers into the enjoyment of the millennium, is to be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The overcoming believers invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb will also be the bride of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The blessing referred to in Revelation 19:9 is the blessing of participating in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be invited to attend the wedding feast is to have the privilege of sharing the millennial kingdom as co-kings with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Matthew 22:14 says, Many are called but few are chosen, and Revelation 17:14 says, They who are with Him, the called and chosen and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To be called is one thing, but to be chosen is another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who will follow the Lord to fight against Antichrist will not only be called but also chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although we have the assurance that we have been called, we do not yet have the assurance that we will be chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This will be decided at the judgment seat of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are not rewarded but are disapproved by the Lord, we will not perish; however, we will suffer a loss like that described in 1 Corinthians 3:15, which says, If anyone s work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The saved ones who suffer loss will certainly miss the wedding feast.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The judgment at the judgment seat of Christ will not determine whether we will be saved or perish; it will decide whether we will receive a reward from the Lord or suffer a loss.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the wedding day there is the bridegroom and the bride; on the following day there is the husband and the wife.</S>
