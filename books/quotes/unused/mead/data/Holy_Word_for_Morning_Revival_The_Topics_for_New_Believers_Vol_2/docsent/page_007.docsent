   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 8 DAY 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Heb 12:10 ...That we might partake of His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Phil 2:13 For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Holiness</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Holiness is one of the main attributes of our God....The mentioning of holy three times, as in Isaiah 6:3, implies the thought of God being triune....The emphasis here is that the Triune God is holy and is triply holy, referring to the quality of God s nature God s being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What God is, is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To partake of God s holiness Heb 12:10 is to partake of the quality of His nature, of what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Holiness is neither sinlessness nor perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Holy not only means sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything that is common....For us, God s chosen ones, to be holy is to partake of His nature 2 Pet 1:4 and to have our whole being permeated and saturated with God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>36</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another attribute of God is righteousness....Whereas holiness is related to God s inward nature, righteousness is related to God s outward acts, ways, actions, and activities.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everything God does is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the righteousness of God?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The righteousness of God is what God is in His action with respect to justice and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is just and right.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whatever God is in His justice and righteousness constitutes His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever our conscience condemns us because of our failures, we need to remember to stand upon the foundation of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may be fervent for the Lord today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in the future you may fail Him and become very disappointed with yourself, unable to believe that God could ever forgive you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At such a time you need to praise God for His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Tell Him that no matter how much you have failed, Christ is still at His right hand as the receipt for payment for all your debts Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our experience may fluctuate, but God remains righteous forever.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever we confess our sins, claim the blood of Jesus, and appeal to God s righteousness, God has no choice except to forgive us 1 John 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our experience of Christ rests on the foundation of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The foundation is not our fervency or victory; it is God s righteousness, the unshakable foundation of God s throne Psa 89:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has shown forth His righteousness by forgiving us of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way God has proved that He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now such righteousness of God is our solid foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>37</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Divine Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Triune God refers to God the person, while the Divine Trinity refers to the main attribute of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, saying that someone is a faithful person is different from saying that he is faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A faithful person refers to the man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His faithfulness refers to his being faithful, his virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In a general way God is dispensing Himself into us, but in a particular, actual, and practical way God is dispensing His Trinity into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should never forget Philippians 2:13.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is not only in us, but He is also operating, or working, in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is in us as the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit....We are not only experiencing God, but we are also experiencing God as the Triune.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are experiencing the Trinity of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Father is in us Eph 4:6 , the Son is in us 2 Cor 13:5 , and the Spirit is in us Rom 8:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These are not three persons, but these are the Trinity of the one God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In other words, this Divine Trinity is the strongest attribute of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His faithfulness, His love, His kindness, and other attributes are not above this attribute.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The top attribute of the divine person is His Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His Trinity is constituted solely with His person, and His person is in the Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>38</S>
