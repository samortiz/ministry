   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Toward the Persecutor and Enemy</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must also live a normal life in relation to our persecutors and enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Blessing and Not Cursing</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should bless those who persecute us and not curse them v. 14 . Regardless of how bad people may be toward us, our mouth should only express blessing, not cursing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How the Lord blessed us when we were His enemies!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should bless our enemies and persecutors in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This also is an aspect of the life that follows the Lord s steps.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Repaying No Evil for Evil</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should repay no one evil for evil v. 17 . Under the law it was eye for eye and tooth for tooth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today we are not under law but under grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must not repay evil for evil, but rather repay good for evil, as the Lord has done to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not Avenging Ourselves</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, we should not avenge ourselves, but give place to the wrath of God; for vengeance belongs to the Lord v. 19 . While we are practicing the church life with a normal human life, we should not avenge ourselves in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should be willing to suffer people s wrongdoing and the loss of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should leave the whole situation in the sovereign hand of the Lord and give Him the place to do whatever He likes according to His sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Heaping Coals of Fire on Them</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>by Feeding Them and Giving Them Drink</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 20 Paul says, But if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is actually loving our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our love to them will be coals of fire heaped upon their heads to turn them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The best way to calm our enemies is to give them something to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, Paul commands us, Do not be conquered by the evil, but conquer the evil with the good v. 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Living in Peace with All Men</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Finally, we need to live in peace with all men, as far as it depends upon us to do so v. 18 . Sometimes it is not possible to live in peace with all men because the other parties are not willing to have a life of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In such a situation, there is nothing that we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, Paul says that we should live in peace with all men if possible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>E. In General:</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Taking Forethought for Things Honorable</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>in the Sight of All Men</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In general, we must take forethought for things honorable in the sight of all men v. 17 . We must be very thoughtful before all men about honorable things, and we must be thoughtful beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to keep from offending people we should not oppose anything that is honorable.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, we should not care for these honorable things in a blind way lest we be distracted from the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since we are not only living before God but also before men, we need to take forethought for things honorable in the sight of men.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second Corinthians 8:21 says, We take forethought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men Gk.</S>
