   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE THIRTY JOURNEYING 15 Scripture Reading: Num 20:2-13, 24; 27:12-14; 1 Cor 10:4, 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter twenty of Numbers there are two lines: the line of life and the line of the types.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message I would like to give a word concerning the types.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Significance of the Types</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the typology in this portion of the Word, water signifies the Spirit of life, or the life in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since the divine life and the divine Spirit are one, the water here signifies both life and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The problem in Numbers 20 was due to the lack of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that whenever God's people are short of the Spirit of life, they will have trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Most of the problems in the church life are caused by the shortage of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we have such a shortage, we will either blame others or contend with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Numbers 20 we are shown the way to receive the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 8 God said to Moses, "Take the rod, and gather the assembly, you and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes that it may yield its water."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's word to Moses indicates that we need to apply the death of Christ to our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To "take the rod" is to apply the death of Christ to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Exodus 17 the rod was used to smite, to strike, the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There, the rod was in the hand of Moses, who represented the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ was smitten by the law; He was cleft in order that the Spirit of life might flow out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since the rock had already been smitten in Exodus 17, there was no need for it to be smitten again in Numbers 20.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ, typified by the rock, should be crucified only once.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In striking the rock a second time, Moses made a serious mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This act was against God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In God's economy Christ should not be crucified more than once.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1 Corinthians 10:4 Paul, speaking of the children of Israel, says, "They drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This reveals that Christ has been crucified to become the rock which follows His people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may say that He is the "following rock."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that He is the life-giving Spirit, who is always with us to supply us with the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ was crucified under the rod of the law, and now He is the following rock, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to meet our need for the Spirit of life, we should not ask Christ to be crucified again for us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should simply take up the rod; that is, we should apply Christ's death to our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we do this, we will experience the crucified Christ, the Christ who is emphatically presented by Paul in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For instance, in this epistle Paul says, "I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified" 1 Cor 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul's word indicates that he took the rod, the death of Christ, and applied it to the Corinthians so that through Christ's death they could receive the Spirit.</S>
