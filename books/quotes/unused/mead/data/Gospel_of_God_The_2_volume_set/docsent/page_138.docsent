   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Second, man thinks that he must pray and plead before he can be saved because he simply does not realize that the Lord Jesus has come; He has died and resurrected, all of sin's problems are solved, and all obstacles to salvation are removed.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only has the Lord Jesus come, but the Holy Spirit has also come.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He came to make manifest in man what God and the Lord Jesus have accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many sinners pray for their salvation as if they were asking the Lord Jesus to die for them again.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They do not realize that He has completely finished the work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since He has finished His work, there is absolutely no reason for us to plead with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today is the time for thanksgivings and praises; it is not the time for filing requests and petitions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose your parents have brought you something that you asked for.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may perhaps, out of sincerity, bow to thank them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Certainly you would not kneel down and beg to have that item, saying, "Please give this to me because I need it."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is simply pointless and senseless for you to continue to beg after your parents have already given the item to you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today God is not speaking about the severity of your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If He were, then there may be a reason for you to plead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, God is now saying that He has freely given you His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It would be a strange thing indeed if someone gave you something and you were still begging instead of thanking!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you know God's heart, and if you are clear about the Lord Jesus' work, you would never attempt to be saved through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Prayer has no place in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is better for you to kneel to thank God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once after I had shared the gospel with a man, I asked if he would believe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He replied that he would.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I said, "Let us kneel down," he asked if we were going to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I told him, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He asked, "For what purpose then?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I answered, "Simply to inform the Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no need to ask Jesus to die again or to ask God to love, to be gracious, or to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord has already borne our sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now our only need is to notify Him by saying, "I have believed the Son of God, and I have received the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>O God, I thank You."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Is this not easy?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yes, to receive salvation is an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was, of course, not an easy thing for God to accomplish salvation; it took God four thousand years to accomplish it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After man fell, it took God four thousand years to cause man to realize his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He then caused His Son to be born of a woman and to hang on the cross to be judged for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the end He also sent the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is only after God has done so much work and expended so much effort that we can receive salvation in such an easy way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He has paid the greatest price to accomplish everything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now if you have believed and received, all you need to do is to say, "Thank You."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no place for prayer here.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why then does Romans 10 bring up the matter of prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Romans 10:5 through 7 reads, "For Moses writes concerning the righteousness which is out of the law: 'The man who does them shall live by them.'</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, 'Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?' that is, to bring Christ down; or, 'Who will descend into the abyss?' that is, to bring Christ up from the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Two kinds of righteousness are mentioned here.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One is the righteousness which is out of the law, and the other, righteousness which is out of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The righteousness out of the law results from one's works before God, and the righteousness out of faith is accomplished in us through our believing in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The former has everything to do with us, and the latter, everything to do with Christ.</S>
