I desired very much to know the Bible and wanted to know what the Bible was all about. Although I was still a poor student, I tried my best to secure spiritual books and books on Bible exposition. Not long after that, I obtained some books by Brother Watchman Nee. His books opened my understanding of the Bible. He pointed out again and again that those who have believed in Christ have been crucified with Christ. The cross of Christ has terminated us. God has no intention for us to sin; neither does God have any intention for us to do good. Based on the Bible, he said that both good and evil belong to the same tree, the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The tree of knowledge of good and evil bears four kinds of fruit: knowledge, good, evil, and death. But there is another tree that is in opposition to this tree&#151;the tree of life. This tree, being of life, has nothing to do with knowledge, good, evil, or death. Brother Nee also pointed out that today man seeks only after knowledge. When he has knowledge, he tries his best to do good and to be moral. But in the end, the result is evil and death.</P><P>After this, Brother Nee pointed out that in the New Testament, the Lord Jesus came. The Lord did not ask man to labor for Him. Instead He placed Himself before man as man's food. He said, "I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly" (John 10:10). Not only is the Lord Jesus life, but He came that man may have life and have it abundantly. He is also the bread of life to be man's food. He said, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes in Me shall by no means ever thirst" (John 6:35). Furthermore, He said, "I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever....As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me" (John 6:51, 57). Brother Nee told us that this is what God is after. God does not want us to sin and to commit evil; neither does He want us to do good and be moral. God wants to be man's life, to satisfy man's hunger and quench his thirst. These words of Brother Nee's rendered me great help in my spiritual life and in the knowledge of the Bible.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
