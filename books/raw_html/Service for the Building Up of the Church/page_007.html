        <h2 class="head1">TOUCHING THE LOVE OF GOD</h2>
<p>In our service for building up the church, we also need to touch God&rsquo;s heart, which is love. On the one hand, we must be under the rule, the restriction, and the dealing of the throne; on the other hand, we must be full of love when interacting with others. When a person, who has been disciplined by the Lord, is harsh with himself, he may also be harsh with others. This is an unbalanced situation. We need to touch the throne, and we also need to touch love. We must touch the authority of Christ, and we must touch the love of God. Even if we are being severely disciplined by the Lord, we still need to be filled with the love of Christ. Only then will our service in the church be genuine. Our service for building up the church is not focused on how much we do but on how much we love.</p>
<p>Love is able to bear the faults of others. Those who like to focus on the shortcomings of others are short of love. Focusing on the shortcomings of others and not being able to bear their faults are indications of a shortage of love. The explanation of love in 1 Corinthians 13 is based on two points: not focusing on the faults of others and bearing the mistakes of others. The beginning of verse 4 says, &ldquo;Love suffers long.&rdquo; This suffering is not suffering related to afflictions but to suffering the mistakes of others. We do not need love when we suffer afflictions, but we need love when others mistreat us. This kind of love is long-suffering. To not focus on the faults of others is to &ldquo;not take account of evil&rdquo; (v. 5). It is not that we do not know of the faults of others but that we do not let their faults create problems within us.</p>
<p>Chapter 13 gives mainly a negative definition of love. &ldquo;Love...is not jealous. Love does not brag and is not puffed up; it does not behave unbecomingly and does not seek its own things; it is not provoked and does not take account of evil; it does not rejoice because of unrighteousness&rdquo; (vv. 4-6). Verse 7 says, &ldquo;It covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.&rdquo; These verses contain words that speak of negative conditions, such as <em>covers,</em> which is related to shortcomings and faults, and <em>believes</em> and <em>endures.</em> Hence, love is contrary to many negative things.</p>
<p>Our greatest problem is a lack of love among the saints; hence, it is easy for us to notice the faults of others and to criticize one another. Without love we cannot help the saints. In our present condition we cannot tolerate those who offend us. This shows that we do not have love. If we are short of love, our service will not build up the church. The practical exercise of the gifts depends on love. Many saints are involved in the visitation service, but their service is useless without love. Our visitation will be ineffective, and we will not be able to build up the saints if we focus on their faults and cannot let go of their mistakes.</p>
<p>This applies not only to visitation but also to many other matters. In order for the gifts, the work, and our activities to manifest their function, they must be carried out in love. A brother may make a mistake or offend us, but we must still love him. Our functions will be manifested in the church when we have such a love.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING LOVE</h2>
<p>We will now consider the practice of love. Although the Bible does not say to practice love but to pursue love (14:1), practice is included in the pursuit of love. For example, in order to pursue an education, we must practice studying. Similarly, in order to pursue love, we must practice love. Without practice, it is futile to pursue love through prayer. If we want to have love, we must pursue love through prayer and also through practice.</p>
<p>I will use some examples to talk about the practice of love. I once stayed in a meeting hall for several weeks. Every Saturday at three o&rsquo;clock I would hear saints singing and praying while they cleaned the meeting hall. Cleaning is a service, but this service is not merely to wipe the benches or to clean the hall. This service is for the building up of the Body of Christ. Hence, the brothers and sisters cannot be neglected; they must be helped. If we want to serve the Lord, we must bear responsibility for the saints; that is, we should find the saints whom we should care for and bear them, and then we should be responsible for them.</p>
<p>For example, my hand has five fingers, which are the responsibility of my hand. Those who are serving should ask themselves, &ldquo;Which brothers or sisters am I caring for in my service?&rdquo; If there are two thousand saints and three hundred responsible ones in a local church, then seventeen hundred saints need care. Who will bear these saints?</p>
<p>Many groups in organized Christianity have pastors and preachers. Most denominations have one or two pastors and sometimes several associate pastors, who are responsible for the care of their congregation. The largest denomination in China in the past century had less than five hundred believers. Most have only two to three hundred believers because the pastors and preachers can take care of only so many believers.</p>
<p>Our service must not be like the denominations. We must return to the Bible, and all the saints must practice serving in the church as revealed in the New Testament. We cannot rely on so-called pastors or preachers. We must give all the saints the responsibility and the opportunity to serve. Who should be responsible to care for the seventeen to eighteen hundred saints in a church that has only a few elders and a few full-time serving ones? There is a need for many serving ones to pick up this burden. In a normal situation every serving one should bear a group of believers. In order for their service to build up, the serving ones should be more experienced and should care for a few believers. I am afraid that the serving ones are short in their care for others. They may be able to say that they are serving and that they visit when there is a need, but this is not sufficient.</p>
<p>Every serving one needs to follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading according to His arrangement and find saints to serve. If saints are weak, sick, or do not come to the meetings, we should be responsible and know their situation. We should be responsible for their spiritual problems and for the lessons that they need to learn before the Lord. In other words, the saints are our lambs, and we are their shepherds. If we practice according to this principle, each serving one will be caring for seven or eight saints. Responsibility for the saints is not too much when it is shared.</p>
<p>Sharing the responsibility is a practice of love. We cannot speak of love without speaking of practice, for love is not merely a matter of feelings. Every mother knows that she cannot love a child merely with her emotions. A child grows not by his mother&rsquo;s feelings but by her practical care. Whether or not a mother is happy, she must daily do many things for her child. She cannot say, &ldquo;I will not give my child anything to eat today, because I am not happy. I will give him twice as much tomorrow when I feel better.&rdquo; This is not practical love. Genuine love is very practical. For example, if by the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement there are seven or eight brothers under my care, I should care for them whether or not I am happy at any given time. I must bear them constantly. When there is such practical care out of love, the saints will grow in the Lord.</p>
<p>It is possible for the church to arrange for certain ones to bear responsibility, but we all must follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading and bear a few saints. We often hear the saints sigh concerning the desolate and cold condition of the church. But sighing cannot do anything; we must have a practical love by following the Lord&rsquo;s leading to take up the burden of bearing other saints. If everyone would do this, the church will be in a normal condition. Such a condition does not come from excitement or exhortation; it is an issue of practical love filling the church and making the saints one.</p>
<p>In order to serve in the church, we must not only touch God&rsquo;s throne but also touch His heart. Once we touch His heart, we will love the saints by bearing them and caring for them, and we will know assuredly which saints are under our care. I am not teaching you a method. I am only pointing out a way. This does not mean that the elders should assign the saints to the serving ones. This would not be effective. The serving ones must first have a heart to serve the Lord and a heart of love. Then the responsibility that they bear out of such a love will be effective.</p>
<p>The greatest need of the church is to practice love. Many believers feel that the church needs to preach the gospel, but saving many people has not increased the number of believers in the church meetings. People are baptized, but they leave soon afterward because we are not responsible for them. How can a large church receive thorough care from a few elders and full-time serving ones? The newly baptized believers are like newborn babes; they depend on the care of the older believers. Instead of caring for the new believers, we let them come to the meetings when they want to and fall when they stumble. Not many new believers are able to endure such neglect.</p>
<p>If the serving ones are willing to practice love and bear seven to eight new believers, sooner or later we will see significant results. As more people are saved over time, the new believers who have been under our care will spontaneously learn to care for others. This is the principle of bearing fruit after one&rsquo;s kind. If we bear our next generation in this way, it will not be difficult for new believers to be taken care of, and they will remain in the church. I hope that we will all exercise to practice love.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
