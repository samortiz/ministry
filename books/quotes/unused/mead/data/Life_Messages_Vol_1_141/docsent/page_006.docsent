   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT UNIFYING THE SAINTS OR THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is true not only among the saints, but also among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because all the churches are in different stages, we should not expect them to be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In a certain church there may be many young ones playing with toys.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead of troubling them, we need to say amen to their toys.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today is not a day of unification.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We simply cannot unify the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we attempt to unify them today, new ones will come tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The same is true with the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may have the ability to unify the churches today, but after a period of time some new churches will be raised up that are childish and even babyish.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we attempt to unify them, we shall kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead of unifying the saints or the churches, we should minister life to them and help them to eat well and grow normally.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to help them to continue on in the unique oneness no matter what is their stage of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do this, we shall keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We maintain this oneness by allowing the differences to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we practice this, the problems among the churches will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The problems are all caused by our attempts to unify the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We want every age to be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But this is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are a very large family, and we are all on the way toward arriving at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we continue on in this process, we should be thankful for all the differences.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, if in a certain locality you find something childish and babyish, do not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, you should praise the Lord for the new ones in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes we may visit a church that is full of experience, filled with grandfathers and grandmothers who are all very qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After visiting such a church, we may be convinced that it is the best because everything is excellent and there are no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, a church without problems is a poor church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But a church with many problems is a rich church, perhaps even the best church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose my wife and I, two elderly people, have no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you visit our home, you find everything quiet, neat, and in good order.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After staying with us a few days, you may think that this is the best home.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are no arguments, but mutual love, sympathy, and serving of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But is such a family really the best family?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The best family is one in which there are many children of various ages.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, you may find it difficult to tolerate such a family and prefer a family composed of two elderly people where everything is quiet and neat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After visiting the home of such an orderly family, you may be influenced to say that your home is poor because it is so noisy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Attempting to make your home like the home of the elderly ones, you kill it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes, however, the situation is the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Certain ones may think that my home is too quiet and encourage us to adopt some young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The point of this illustration is that we need to make allowances for all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not go to a place either to change it or to be influenced to change your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let every church be the way it is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Wherever you go, simply minister life to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not change them, correct them, or attempt to improve them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This shows our faith in life; we trust in life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because we believe in life, we can leave the saints and the churches to life, praying for them and ministering the life supply to them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Leave their condition entirely to life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we do this, we shall keep the oneness of the Spirit and we shall grow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE TEST OF OUR GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The extent to which we keep the oneness of the Spirit in this way tests how much growth in life we have.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The more we grow in life, the more we shall be able to bear various kinds of differences.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, if you cannot go along with differences, you are still very young.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if you can go along with all kinds of differences, this indicates that you are quite mature.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more we grow in life, the more differences we shall be able to take.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We shall not want to reduce the differences, change things, or correct the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, we shall minister life to the saints and let them grow.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If they give us some difficulty, we shall bear them in love.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a sign of our health, of our growth, and of our maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But if we like to unify, to change, to correct, and to adjust, this is a sign that we are still immature.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For the keeping of the genuine oneness, we all need to grow.</S>
