<p class="bold">WEEK 1 — DAY 2</p><h2 class="uhead1">Scripture Reading</h2><p class="bold">Matt.1:1 &nbsp;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:</p><p>2 &nbsp;Abraham begot Isaac, and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers,</p> <p>3 &nbsp;And Judah begot Pharez and Zarah of Tamar…</p><p>5 &nbsp;And Salmon begot Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begot Obed of Ruth, and Obed begot Jesse,</p><p>6 &nbsp;And Jesse begot David the king. And David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah.</p><p>11 &nbsp;And Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon.</p><p>12 &nbsp;And after the deportation to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Salathiel, and Salathiel begot Zerubbabel.</p><p class="bold">16 &nbsp;And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</p><p class="bold">Gal. 3:14 &nbsp;In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Now we come to the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew.…Jesus is the mingling of God with man.</p><p>The generation of Christ is composed of [first,]…the fathers…the forefathers, the great persons; [second,]…the kings, the royalty…[and, third,] the civilians (the captured ones and the recovered ones). [His] generation not only includes the high-ranking people, but also the civilians, the insignificant ones, like Mary and Joseph. The poor people, the little people, are also included in the generation of Christ.…This generation includes both the called ones, like Abraham, and the ones carried away to captivity.…This generation includes Jeconiah, a king who was dethroned and deported to Babylon as a captive. Have you ever been dethroned? Do not think you have not. In your Christian life you sometimes have been dethroned. Once you were a king, but you lost your kingship and became a backslider.</p><p>After captivity there was the recovery. Hence, we have another name, Zerubbabel, the name of recovery.…You were an Abraham, you became a Jeconiah, but today you are a Zerubbabel. We are all Zerubbabels. We are the called ones, the fallen ones, and the recovered ones.</p><p>According to Jewish custom, a writer of a genealogy would never include a female name; he would include only the names of males. But in this brief genealogy five women are mentioned: [Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, her who had been the wife of Uriah, and Mary].…Four of these five women were remarried, and one of the four was a harlot.…Why does this brief record mention all these women? It is because they are our representatives. Do not think you are…more pure than these women.…We are worse. But the worst ones are included in the generation of Christ! Praise the Lord! He is truly the Savior of sinners.…If we were to write a biography of Christ…we would hide all these impure grandmothers and give the names of the good grandmothers, such as Sarah and Rebekah. But the Holy Spirit did not mention…all the good ones; however, He purposely included these impure ones.…Besides the four remarried women, a virgin stands out: Mary, the mother of Jesus. Mary was good, pure, and clean. This indicates that everyone mentioned in this book of generation is a sinner except Jesus.</p><p>This book of generation says…that Christ is the son of David and the son of Abraham.…As the son of David, He is for the Jews; as the son of Abraham, He is for us all.…All nations are blessed in Abraham’s seed, which is Christ. This blessing is the participation in the Triune God. The blessing which God promised to Abraham was the Spirit (Gal. 3:14), and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the Triune God. By Christ as the son of Abraham, we have the Spirit, and we share in the Triune God. Hallelujah!
