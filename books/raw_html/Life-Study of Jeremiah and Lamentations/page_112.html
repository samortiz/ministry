<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. CONCERNING THE BRINGING BACK<br>OF THE VESSELS OF THE HOUSE OF JEHOVAH</H2><P>Jeremiah 27:16-22 is concerned with the bringing back of the vessels of the house of Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Others' False Prophecy</H2><P>Nebuchadnezzar had taken some of the vessels of the house of Jehovah and had brought them to Babylon and put them in the house of his god (Dan. 1:1-2). In their false prophecy, the false prophets told Israel that in a short time these vessels would be brought back from Babylon (Jer. 27:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jeremiah's Genuine Prophecy</H2><P>In verses 17 through 22 we have Jeremiah's genuine prophecy concerning the bringing back of the vessels of the house of Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Telling the People<br>to Serve the King of Babylon and Live</H2><P>In his genuine prophecy, Jeremiah told the people to serve the king of Babylon and live, and the city of Jerusalem would not become a desolation (v. 17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Vessels Left in the House of Jehovah<br>Being Carried to Babylon and<br>Remaining There until the Day<br>When Jehovah Visits Israel</H2><P>The vessels which were left in the house of Jehovah, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem would be carried to Babylon and remain there until the day when Jehovah visited Israel. Then Jehovah would bring the vessels up and restore them to the holy land (vv. 18-22).</P><P>Concerning the vessels of the house of Jehovah, there were two different kinds of prophecies. These different prophecies confused the people, and it was hard for them to discern which were genuine and which were false.</P>
