The secret to understanding the Word is like a master key that opens the door of a large house. If you have the key, you can use the key to open every door in the house. I did not get such a key until I began to have direct personal contact with Brother Watchman Nee.</P><P>I began to correspond with Brother Nee in 1925, the first year of my salvation. Then in 1932 the Lord brought the two of us together. After I had begun to serve the Lord full time, I went to see Brother Nee, and he asked me to remain there with him. During that time with him I received the key to understanding the Bible. The more I stayed with Brother Nee, the more of the secret to understanding the Word I received. Before being with Brother Nee, I did not know the crucial things of the church, the Spirit, life, and identification with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension. But from 1933 I began to know these crucial things, and my entire being began to be occupied with them. I found out that the church, the Spirit, life, and identification with Christ are bottomless mines. The more I have dug into these things, the deeper they have become. I have discovered that the spiritual, heavenly, and divine significances of these things in the Bible can never be exhausted.</P>
