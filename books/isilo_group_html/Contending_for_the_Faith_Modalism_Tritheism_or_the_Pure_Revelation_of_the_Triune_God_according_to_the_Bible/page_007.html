Proverbs 30:5a and 6 say, &#8220;Every word of God is tied....Do not add to His words, lest He reprove you and you be found a liar.&#8221; Adding to the Word of God is most serious and is strictly forbidden in Deuteronomy 4:2; 12:32; and Revelation 22:18.<p>Practically, what does it mean to add to the Word of God? The word of the Lord Jesus provides a clear answer. In Matthew 16:6, the Lord told His disciples, &#8220;Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.&#8221; Leaven is something added to dough to produce fermentation (cf. Matt. 13:33). When the disciples were unable to understand the Lord&#8217;s word, He asked them, &#8220;How is it that you do not understand that it was not about bread that I spoke to you? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees&#8221; (Matt. 16:11). The Lord&#8217;s further word must have made them clear, for the next verse reads, &#8220;Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.&#8221; The Lord Jesus Himself likens the teachings of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, the ancient fundamentalists and modernists, to leaven. In Matthew 15:6 the Lord said to the scribes and Pharisees, &#8220;You have deprived the word of God of its authority because of your tradition.&#8221; Therefore, quoting Isaiah, the Lord could say, &#8220;In vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men&#8221; (Matt. 15:9). When we put all these verses together, we see that the leaven of the Pharisees is the traditional teachings and the commandments of men. When these are added to the Word of God, or held equal to it, God&#8217;s Word is nullified, made of none effect. As those who would obey His word and follow Him, we must be faithful to reject the leaven of human opinion, concept, and tradition, or, at least, to distinguish between it and the pure Word of the Lord.<p>As we consider the revelation of the Triune God in the Bible, we wish to hold to the pure Word of God and not to any traditional terms or concepts. Although, due to the poverty of our language, we may need to use certain terms, we must be on guard not to equate them with, much less to let them replace, the word of the Bible. Our intention here is not to engage in abstract speculations or interpretations, but simply to say, &#8220;Amen,&#8221; to whatever God says in His Word regarding the revelation of Himself. It is sufficient simply to point out what God Himself has spoken. Martin Luther said:<p>Those who neglect the Scriptures and approach such questions [such as the Trinity] with confidence in their own mental power are the teachers of God, not His pupils....If reason disturbs you here and questions arise like...Are there, then, two gods? answer: There is only one God, and still there is the Father and the Son. How is this possible? Respond with humility: I do not know.<sup>66</sup><p>It is well to also heed the words of the Puritan writer, Hermann Witsius, who said that we should stop at the precise point beyond which divine revelation does not conduct us,<sup>67</sup> and the words of E. W. Bullinger, author of The Companion Bible, who said:<p>We do not, therefore, now propose to discuss doctrines, or to use any non-scriptural expressions....These are the things which divide the members of the One Body, instead of uniting them. These introduce the seeds of strife and contention...But, if we confine ourselves to the Word of God, and that alone, both writer and readers may, and will, all learn together what God has revealed concerning Himself. We shall not seek to draw any conclusion, or to discuss or revise any creeds. We shall give only the evidence of Scripture in the words of Scripture; and use only Scriptural terminology....It is not a question of our understanding what God may mean, but of believing what He has said.<sup>68</sup><p>Let us therefore turn to the pure Word of God and listen to what it says concerning the revelation of the Triune God.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Contending for the Faith: Modalism, Tritheism, or the Pure Revelation of the Triune God according to the Bible &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
