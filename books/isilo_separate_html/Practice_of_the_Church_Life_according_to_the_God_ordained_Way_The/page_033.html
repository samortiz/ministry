Frustrating and Even Tearing Down<br>the Building Up of the Body of Christ<br>with the Believers</H2><P>The building up of the Body of Christ is with the believers. If all the believers do not speak, it is the same as tearing down the building. Not speaking frustrates and tears down the building up of the Body of Christ with the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Leaving the Believers Unattached<br>in Individualism</H2><P>Not practicing to prophesy leaves the believers unattached in individualism. When I see certain brothers, I have a deep concern for them because they remain unattached in their individualism. They come to the meetings week after week, but they keep themselves in their individualism. The elders dare not touch these unattached brothers because they realize that they are very fragile, like thin glass, and are easily broken. As a result, they remain in their untouched individualism. They may have been kept in their untouched individualism for their entire life. If you remain in your untouched individualism, you will remain unattached to the Body. The only way to be rescued from this sickness is to speak.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Repeating the Story of Degraded Christianity to Annul the Function of the Members of Christ and to Build Up Hierarchy instead of<br>the Body of Christ</H2><P>If we do not speak, we repeat the story of degraded Christianity to annul the function of the members of Christ and to build up hierarchy instead of the Body of Christ. The silence of the saints may promote some ambitious ones to build themselves up as a clerical class, a hierarchy. Hierarchy is just the clergy.</P><P>If we speak, there are benefits; if we do not speak, there are losses. Our speaking for the Lord is a great thing. Therefore, we all must learn to speak.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
