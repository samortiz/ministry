   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD'S WORKING HIMSELF INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A Christian should not think that as long as something is good, he can do it, and that as long as something is not good, he should not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God does not care for right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What He cares for is to work Himself into us through the things that we encounter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can consider the experience of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He passed through many experiences from his youth to his old age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He did many evil things; he deceived his father, his father-in-law, his brother, and his wives.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After so much experience and so many dealings from the Lord, we can say that there were not many things in his life that he had done right.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nearly everything he did was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the one precious thing is that God had worked Himself into Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why in his old age his name was changed to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By that time, he was no longer a man only, but a man filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He became the prince of God, God's Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Maturity is not to change from being an evil man to being a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is to be filled with God through His many and prolonged dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today the material, the method, the goal, and the power of our work is simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a carpenter makes a table and it is short of a leg, he would not use his own leg to be the material.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But when God created man, He used Himself as the material.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When God gives you power, He is actually giving you Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Power is simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The material with which God works is simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose you do not have love, and you ask God for love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He does not give you a bag of love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, He gives you Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many people pray to God like beggars begging money from a rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When they have the money, they turn away from the giver.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many people think that once they have the love and the power, they can put God aside.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to realize that love, humility, patience, and holiness are all God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Anyone who does not allow God to work in him will not have lasting humility.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps he has a temporal humility, but it is not an eternal humility.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the spiritual virtues, such as faith, love, and holiness, are simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The same is true with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only when a man allows God to work Himself into him will he have real prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the virtues, love, and goodness are not individual items of things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When God comes in and comes out of a man, that is love, that is goodness, and that is virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some say that faith is just to believe in God's word and His promises.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But I have to tell you that faith is simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When God comes in and out of you, that is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is patience?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When God comes in and out of you, that is patience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What is prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people say that prayer is to talk to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the real prayer is for God to come in and out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our real prayer is one that allows God to pass through us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All those who do not allow God to pass through them do not have genuine, worthwhile prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What then is real prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Real prayer is simply God praying to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Andrew Murray said that real prayer is the Christ in us praying to the Christ on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that the God in you prays to the God in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Real spiritual power is a matter of God passing through us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His passing through is the power.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The wife's submission, the husband's love, and all other virtues are a matter of God passing through us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This passing through will fill us with God's fullness, and in the end God will become our content.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brothers and sisters, I can tell you that there are many people who know the Bible and who understand its teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But there are few people who have God's fullness in their mind, their character, and their nature.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The way many people understand the teachings of the Bible is like wearing gold rings on their fingers without having gold in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You may be serving God, building up churches, helping the brothers and sisters, and bearing some responsibilities in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But the key to all these works is to allow God to work Himself into you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When a man builds a chapel, he needs to use many kinds of materials, such as bricks, stone, and iron.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today, we are building the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As such, the material must be God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many times we hear people say, "So-and-so is a good brother.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He loves his wife, and he is never angry with her."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I would say, "Oh, no!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am afraid that this brother has never allowed God to pass through his love toward his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He may never have lost his temper with his wife, but God's element has not increased in him either."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After a brother has been saved for five years, if he grows spiritually, it would be like building a wall two feet high.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If he continues to allow God to pass through him, the wall will become four feet high.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But if he only exercises himself to be a good man, it would be like adding more mud beside the two-foot wall.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The wall will become thicker, but it will not become higher.</S>
