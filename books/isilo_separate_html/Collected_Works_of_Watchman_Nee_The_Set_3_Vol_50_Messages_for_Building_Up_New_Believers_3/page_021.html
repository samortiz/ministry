Not Attracting Attention</h2><p>However, we should take note of one thing: No one should wear anything that draws attention to his clothes rather than to his person. No Christian should do this. If our clothing always draws others' attention to us, there is something wrong with it. What we wear should express our being. If I put a bouquet of flowers into a vase and others only pay attention to the vase, something is wrong with the vase. Clothing is meant to express the person. Our clothing should not usurp who we are. The worst thing would be for us to wear clothing that draws attention away from our person to our appearance. This is a great mistake.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Clothing Needing to Match One's Status</h2><p>Another matter needs special attention: A person's clothes should match his status. Do not dress too poorly and do not dress too well. Please bear in mind that poor clothing attracts attention in the same way that fancy clothing does. We should not pay that much attention to our clothing, neither should we draw the attention of others to it. It is wrong to give others the impression that we are particularly well dressed. However, it is also wrong to be so poorly dressed that others begin to feel uneasy about us. Our clothing must match our status. Others should not feel that we are too much or too poor in our attire. Our clothing must glorify the Lord.</p><h2 class="head4">d. Clothing Not Arousing Self-consciousness</h2><p>Furthermore, our clothing should not arouse our own consciousness. Some people are always conscious of what they wear. This means that something is wrong with their attire. They have become a coat hanger to their clothes, and their clothes have become more important than they are. They are not wearing their clothes. Instead, their clothes are wearing them. They are always conscious of what they are wearing. They pay too much attention to their appearance. This means that their dress is either too good or too poor. When a person is poorly dressed, he becomes conscious of his clothes in the company of others. When he wears fancy attire, he becomes conscious of his clothes as well. Both are wrong.</p><p>It is best to wear something which does not arouse your attention or the attention of others. Your clothes should be very ordinary. At the same time, it should match your status and should be worthy of Christ. Anything that goes beyond this limit is improper. It is a great thing to present a Christian testimony in our attire today. This means that others can identify us as Christians by our appearance.</p><h2 class="head1">II. FOOD</h2><p>Let us come next to the matter of food.</p><p>In Genesis 2 God gave man food to sustain his life. This happened before man sinned. The matter of food is found as early as Genesis 2. Clothing began in Genesis 3, but food began prior to man's fall. God ordained that man should partake of fruits of every kind. Before man sinned, the God-ordained food for man was fruit.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Need for Meat after the Fall</h2><p>In Genesis 3, after man fell, God gave man herbs for food and ordained that man would eat bread in the sweat of his face. This was God's food for man in Genesis 3. When we come to Genesis 4, God put His seal of approval upon Abel but not Cain, even though no ordinance of any kind had yet been instituted. Cain was a farmer, and Abel was a keeper of sheep. Abel shepherded sheep, and God's seal of approval was upon him. He offered sacrifices to God, and God accepted him. Cain was a tiller of the ground. He brought the produce of the land to God, but God did not accept his sacrifice. Genesis 4 does not say anything about God's will. But when we come to Genesis 9, God gave the animals to man for food (v. 3), just as He had given fruit to man for food in the beginning.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
