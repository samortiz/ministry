   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTY-FIVE ORDINANCES AND THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: Eph 2:11-18; Gal 6:15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Ephesians reveals that God s economy is to work Christ into His chosen people to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This book also exposes certain negative things that damage the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to our natural concept, we may expect Ephesians to emphasize such negative things as sin and worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although these are dealt with, they are not the main factors revealed in Ephesians as causes of damage to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all easily recognize that sin is damaging.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without even reading the Bible, we have the knowledge that sin is a cause of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, when we read about sin in the Scriptures, we readily understand, for the concept of sin is already in our natural mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, it is contrary to our natural concept to say that ordinances are more damaging to the church life than sin is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The verses which speak of ordinances may make little impression on us because they do not correspond to anything already in our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>FOUR CATEGORIES OF NEGATIVE THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What are the basic factors that damage the church life according to the revelation in the book of Ephesians?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have indicated that sin and worldliness, although certainly causes of damage, are not the basic negative factors in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Ephesians there are four categories of negative things that damage the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first of these is the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 2:14 and 15 Paul says that Christ has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The law of commandments contained in ordinances is a cause of enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With the ordinances there are regulations, and these regulations are the law of commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This gives rise to enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today there is enmity even among good, spiritual Christians, enmity caused by ordinances regarding certain practices.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For instance, there may be enmity between those who practice baptism by immersion and those who practice baptism by sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Related to these practices there are ordinances with their law of commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These ordinances are the first basic category of negative things that damage the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The second category is doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 4:14 Paul says that we should be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word teaching here refers to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although Christians may regard doctrine as a positive thing, this verse clearly indicates that it can be used to carry us away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Any doctrine, even a scriptural one, that distracts the believers from Christ is a wind of teaching that carries them away from God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Doctrine, therefore, can be used to destroy the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we intend to have the proper church life, we must recognize the damage doctrine has caused to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In chapter four Paul goes on to speak of the old man v. 22 , the third category of negative things that damage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The old man is of Adam, created by God, but fallen through sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because the old man causes so much damage to the church life, we must put off the old man in order to have the proper practice of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 5:27 we see the fourth negative category: the spots and wrinkles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Spots are related to the natural life, and the wrinkles are related to oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both spots and wrinkles are capable of causing serious damage to the church life in a very subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The glorious church that Christ will present to Himself will not have spot or wrinkle or any such things, but will be holy and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps you have read the book of Ephesians a number of times without realizing that these four categories of things can cause great damage to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You may have read this book without paying attention to the matters of ordinances, doctrines, the old man, and spots and wrinkles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I myself read Ephesians for years before I began to see the seriousness of these four things with respect to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this message we shall deal in particular with the ordinances.</S>
