   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jehovah is willing to be inquired of by those who did not ask for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He has stretched out His hands all day long to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts, who provoke Him to anger, and who are smoke in His nose, a fire that burns all day 65:1-7, 11-12; 66:1-6, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>IV.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, instead of working or laboring, Israel will eat, drink, and rejoice.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>BOTH TO ISRAEL AND TO ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Isaiah 65:18-25 reveals that a restoration will be brought in both to Israel and to all things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 18 says, "Rejoice and exult forever, / In what I create, / For I am now creating Jerusalem as an exultation / And her people as a rejoicing."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jerusalem will be a joy and an exultation, and her people will rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even God Himself will exult in Jerusalem and rejoice in His people, and there will no longer be heard in her the voice of weeping and of crying v. 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 20 continues, "There will no longer be in her / An infant who reaches the age of only a few days / Nor an old man who does not fill up his days; / For the lad will die at a hundred years of age, / And the sinner, being a hundred years of age, will be cursed."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the restoration, an infant will not die before reaching maturity, and one who dies at the age of a hundred will be regarded as a youth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verses 21 and 22 go on to say, "They will build houses and inhabit them, / And they will plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>/ They will not build and another inhabit; / They will not plant and another eat; / For like the days of a tree are the days of My people, / And My chosen ones will enjoy the work of their hands to the full."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is the work mentioned here?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The unique work carried out by God's people in the restoration will be to sing, praise, worship, and rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"They will not labor in vain, / Nor bear children unto turmoil; / For they are the seed of those blessed of Jehovah, / And their offspring with them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>/ And it will be that before they call, I will answer; / Even while they are speaking, I will hear" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Calling on the Lord will be their occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even before they call, He will answer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 25 concludes, "The wolf and the lamb will feed as one, / And the lion will eat straw like the ox, / And dust will be the serpent's food; / They will not harm nor destroy / In all My holy mountain, says Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The expressions here are very similar to those in 11:6-9, which also speaks of the restoration brought in through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this restoration death will be limited, and there will be abundant life and much praise and rejoicing.</S>
