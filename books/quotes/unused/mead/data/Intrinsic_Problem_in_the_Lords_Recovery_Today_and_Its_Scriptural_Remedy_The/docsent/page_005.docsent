   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first kind of oneness revealed in the New Testament is the oneness of the Lord s aspiration and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The model for the genuine oneness was there at the time of the Lord s prayer, but the actual oneness had not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the day of Pentecost, the actual oneness came.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time the oneness of the Lord s aspiration and prayer became the oneness of the Spirit Eph 4:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This matter touches the depths of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit is the very consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we have the Spirit, we have the totality of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and this consummation is now one with the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the enlarged oneness in actuality, but still not in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To have something in actuality means that it exists, that it is a fact; whereas to have something in practicality means that such a thing has become our practice, our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, in the second kind of oneness, the oneness of the Spirit, we have only the actuality of the oneness; we do not yet have the practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, this oneness was in Christ s aspiration, and it became His prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then this oneness became the oneness of the Spirit, which is the oneness in actuality, the oneness in fact.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the day of Pentecost, the Triune God mingled Himself with His redeemed people, and this mingling became the actuality of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In John 17 this oneness was there among the Divine Trinity only as a model; it had not yet been enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But on the day of Pentecost, the Triune God, after being processed and consummated, was poured out as the Spirit; that is, the processed and consummated Triune God mingled Himself with His chosen and redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This mingling is the actual oneness, and this actual oneness is the enlargement of the model of the oneness of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In John 17 the oneness was an aspiration in Christ which Christ uttered into a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the day of Pentecost, the oneness that had been in Christ s aspiration and prayer came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the oneness of the Spirit, which is fully defined by the Apostle Paul in Ephesians chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 3 Paul said that we all must be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then, in the subsequent verses he gave a definition of the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This Oneness in Actuality</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Being Composed of Four Factors</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>by Two Means with One Goal Composed of Four Factors</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This oneness is composed of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God as its four factors vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These four factors are four persons the Body, the Spirit, the Lord, and God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Body as the object is mingled with the Divine Trinity as the elements to be the factors of the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The three factors the Spirit, the Lord the Son , and the one God the Father are the elements of the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These three elements are mingled with the Body, producing a fourth factor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The mingling of these four factors is the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By One Faith and One Baptism</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>as the Two Means</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The one faith and the one baptism mentioned in verse 5 are the two means to accomplish this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Faith is the means for the Body to be joined to Christ the Head, and baptism is the means for the Body to be separated from Adam, the old head.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Baptism separates us from Adam, and faith joins us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With One Hope as the One Goal</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The oneness of the Spirit has the one hope of our calling, mentioned in verse 4, as the one goal.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This goal is for the Body to be brought into the divine glory of the processed Triune God, who is mingled with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, in the oneness of the Spirit, there are four factors, two means, and one goal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The genuine oneness is the Spirit, the Son, and the Father mingled with the Body through baptism and faith, with a hope of something to come.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Anything besides these seven items is a foreign article that divides the Body.</S>
