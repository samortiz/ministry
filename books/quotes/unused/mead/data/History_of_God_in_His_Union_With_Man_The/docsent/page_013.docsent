   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Based upon this principle, the story about Jacob is even more interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>His name means one who grasps the heel, and he was surely a grasper.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When his uncle charged him to shepherd the flock, he took the opportunity to grasp his uncle's cattle Gen 30:25-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here you can see that although one of God's chosen people was so cunning, God was working on him to change him from being a grasper into being a prince.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Formerly, he was Jacob, but eventually his God made him Israel, which means a prince 32:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In his youth this Jacob seemingly robbed everybody in his contact with them his father Isaac 27:1-29 , his brother Esau 25:29-34 , and his uncle Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when he was old and matured, he blessed others everywhere he went.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What seemed to be stealing hands became blessing hands.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When he met Pharaoh, the top king on the earth, he blessed him 47:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Bible there is the principle that the one who blesses is greater than the one who is blessed Heb 7:7 ; hence, Jacob was greater than Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Genesis 5:22 says that Enoch walked with God for three hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This also means that God walked with Enoch, a man, for three hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These two friends never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After three hundred years God took His very intimate friend from the earth and away from death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Is this the story of Enoch or the history of God?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Genesis 3 we read that after man fell, Adam and Eve were afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then God came and called out to Adam, asking, Where are you? v. 9 . This seems very human.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The righteous God talked to a sinner in a very intimate, friendly way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without such a story, how could you know God?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Is this the record of Adam and Eve?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Apparently it is, but actually it is even more a record of God's history.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It shows us more about God than about Adam and Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you pick up this principle and apply it to the entire Bible, you can see God on every page.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible is not mainly a record of men but a record of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, it is not a record of God in creation; rather, it is a history of God in His dealing with man, who is on His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In His dealings with man we can know Him, and we can see what kind of God He is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You need to read Genesis again according to this principle to see what kind of God is there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Genesis is the first book of God's history.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By reading Genesis in this way, you can see this God manifested and shown to us through all the stories of Him with man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you add all these stories together, you see His history.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without Genesis you cannot know God very well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some people say that the New Testament is more important than the Old, and some would even say that we do not need the Old Testament today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But I must tell you that without the Old Testament, you cannot know God so well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without the story in Genesis 32 could you believe that God wrestled with the man Jacob and that He was not able to prevail against a man v. 25 ? In His wrestling He had no way to put Jacob down, but He exercised His almighty, divine, omnipotent strength and touched his thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then Jacob was crippled, and from then on he limped when he walked.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without such a story how could you know that God would even wrestle with His people?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps you think that this is just the story of God with Jacob and that today He would not wrestle with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He may have even tried to wrestle with you this morning, but perhaps you were not ready.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Jacob was ready that night because he was desperate, because his brother, whom he had cheated, was coming.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was afraid, so he sent his wife and his children ahead while he remained there.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then he began to wrestle with God, and he would not let God go, for he had one thing to solve with God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is this kind of God, but without the Bible we cannot know God in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have heard all the terms about God, that He is righteous, faithful, kind, loving, merciful, and so much more.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we do not know how He is all these.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you would pick up this principle when you read the Bible, I believe that from today the Bible would be a different book to you.</S>
