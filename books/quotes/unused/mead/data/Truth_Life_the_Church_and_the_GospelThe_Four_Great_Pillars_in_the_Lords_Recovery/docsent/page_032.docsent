   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BLESSING IN THE CHURCH God Crushing Satan under the Feet</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Built Up Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible pays much attention to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 16 tells us that there was a deaconess of the church in Cenchrea, Phoebe, who loved the church very much and served the church absolutely v. 1 . Then it also mentions a couple, Prisca and Aquila, who knew nothing but the church v. 3 . Wherever they were, they operated a church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When they were in Rome, they operated the church there, and when they went to Ephesus, they also operated the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why do we say that they were operating the church?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is because wherever they went, the church in that locality would meet in their home.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because of their love toward the church, Paul said that he and all the churches of the Gentiles gave them thanks vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>4-5a .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many readers of the book of Romans have not seen that it concludes with the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The last chapter of Romans is focused on the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only the local churches can fulfill God s purpose and deal with God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, if we had been in Cenchrea, we would have had to meet with the church in Cenchrea.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we had been in Rome, we would have had to meet with the church in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we had been in Ephesus, we would have had to meet with the church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only in the local churches can we allow God to have the ground to crush Satan under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, only when we are in the church can we overcome Satan and crush him under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the revelation we see in the book of Romans v. 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having the Supply of</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>the Sevenfold Intensified Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Revelation the Lord Jesus showed John that he had to write to the seven churches that grace and peace would come to them from the seven Spirits who are before His throne 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The majority of Christians see only the one Spirit, but at the end of the Bible it speaks of the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These seven Spirits are entirely for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, if we are not in a local church and do not remain in a church in a definite way, we will lose the supply of the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the local church there are the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified Spirit, supplying the church in a sevenfold intensified way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this reason we must see that wherever we are, what we need the most is the church in our place and that this church is the best church for us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should never make our own choice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE SPECIFIC PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE FEEDING THE LORD S LAMBS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How then should we practice the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, every saint has to nourish, take care of, and lead the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the church there are always those who are younger than we are whom we should take care of.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have baptized many people, but usually less than ten out of a hundred remain in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, we give birth to a hundred babies, but over ninety of them disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the reason for this?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is because no one takes care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The saints have a wrong concept that the elders should bear the responsibility of taking care of people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, there are only a few elders.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How can they take care of so many saints?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since the church is the house of the believers, everyone in the church has to bear the responsibility of taking care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before His departure from the world, the Lord charged us to go forth and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once we bear fruit, the fruit will become lambs that need our care.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, at the end of the Gospel of John, the Lord said to Peter, Feed My lambs 21:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not think that the Lord s word was only for Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Peter is our representative; we all have to take care of the lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we preach the gospel to others, lead them to be saved, and bring them to the church to be baptized, we should not leave them alone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A mother, after giving birth to a baby, would not leave him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, she would feed him and take care of him in a detailed way for at least eighteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When some people hear this word, they may feel that this is too troublesome and would dare not preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, please remember that before the Lord charged Peter to feed His sheep, He first asked him, Do you love Me?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today the Lord is asking us the same question.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do we love the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do we love His church?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is a hymn that says, We are for the Lord s, / We are for the Lord s, / We are for the Lord s recovery!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hymns, #1255 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all love the Lord, the church, and the Lord s recovery, yet we may not love the lambs, because feeding the lambs is a very troublesome matter.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, many people say, It is fine to ask us to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a person is willing to believe in the Lord, we will bring him here to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If he is not willing, we will not force him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, to feed him and make him a remaining fruit after his salvation will not be that easy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is why, although everyone sings, We are for the Lord s recovery, there is still very little multiplication and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This proves that in the matter of feeding the lambs, the churches are altogether unable to follow the Lord s steps and meet the Lord s standard.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We cannot continue to sing, We are for the Lord s, / We are for the Lord s recovery if the number of saints who have stopped meeting keeps increasing year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must go out to recover these saints and bring them back to the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the past there were thirteen to fifteen thousand saints on the name list in the church in Taipei, but only five thousand were meeting regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There were still eight to ten thousand who were not meeting regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are busy preaching the gospel and baptizing people the whole year, but after we have baptized one hundred people, ninety of them disappear in three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do not say that the elders should feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There are only a few elders in a church; they cannot do that much.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Neither should you say that all the other brothers and sisters should pick up such a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Each one of us has to say, I am the one who should bear the responsibility of feeding others.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>First, we have to review the information that we have gathered concerning all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then we should form every twelve people into a group, incorporating everyone into a group.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should not form the saints into groups according to their spiritual condition, nor should we assign a leading or responsible one for each group.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We want every saint in each group to be responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Since they are in the same group, they should meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They can decide when and where they will meet.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, perhaps the majority of the saints in the groups may not meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It may even be the case that all the saints in the group do not meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is the one thing that we should pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If this is the case, then we will need some full-timers to rise up and serve in coordination to take care of the saints in those groups.</S>
