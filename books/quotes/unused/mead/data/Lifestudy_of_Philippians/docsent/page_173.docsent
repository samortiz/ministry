   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-EIGHT A LIFE FULL OF FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUT WITHOUT ANXIETY 3 Scripture Reading: Phil 4:1-2, 4-7, 11-13; 3:15-16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Greek word for forbearance is composed of two words.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first is the preposition epi which, when added to another word, can have the meaning of extensive or full.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This word is a component of the Greek word for full knowledge used in 2 Timothy 2:25.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second Greek word has various meanings: reasonable, considerate, and suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the meaning of the Greek is extensively reasonable or fully reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>AN ALL-INCLUSIVE VIRTUE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Based on the analysis of the Greek word, our spiritual experience, God s activities in His economy, and the Lord s living on earth, we can realize that to have adequate forbearance requires that we also have many other virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Forbearance is an all-inclusive virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of the many human virtues, Paul chose to speak of forbearance in 4:5.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we shall see, this particular virtue is related to other important matters in Philippians 3 and 4.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, it is related to being able to do all things in Christ and also to learning the secret of contentment in all circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, in order to have forbearance we must be qualified according to what is mentioned in 3:15 and 16.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Forbearance means to be fully reasonable, considerate, and suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This requires a genuine understanding of the situation at hand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose two students are arguing about a problem in mathematics.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Unable to settle their argument, they bring the problem to you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if you are ignorant of mathematics, it will not be possible for you to give them a fair and reasonable judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even if you have the necessary understanding, you may lack wisdom to deal with the people involved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE NEED OF FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>IN OUR FAMILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a great need of forbearance in our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A good family life is the product of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a husband and wife show forbearance toward each other and toward their children, they will have an excellent married life and family life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, if they do not exercise forbearance, they will seriously damage their life together as a family.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In dealing with their children, parents should be neither too strict nor too tolerant.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both excessive strictness and excessive tolerance are damaging to children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then what is the right way for parents to care for their children?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The right way is the way which is full of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suppose a child does something wrong, and the matter is made known to his father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He should not rebuke his child in a hasty way or spank him in anger.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Ephesians 6 Paul tells us not to provoke our children.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Usually parents provoke their children by dealing with them in anger.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you are angry with your child, you first need to ask the Lord to take away your anger.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once your anger has been dealt with by the Lord, you need to exercise your understanding to realize why the child made that particular mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No doubt, the child was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nevertheless, you still must understand his situation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Perhaps he was wrong because you were careless.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you had not been careless in that particular way, the child would not have made that mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because your carelessness afforded him the opportunity to do something wrong, you should not put the full blame on him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, first you must blame yourself and then discipline the child.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All this is included in exercising forbearance toward our children.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Parents need to exercise wisdom in speaking to their children.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A child may need correction, but the parents need to sense when is the right time to speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A father should ask himself whether or not he should rebuke his child in front of other children or even in front of the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes it is not wise to discipline a child in the presence of others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How much wisdom we must exercise in caring for our children!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we do not have forbearance, we shall not exercise wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the other hand, if we do not have adequate wisdom, we shall not be able to exercise forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we would show forbearance, we also need patience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Most parents find it difficult to be patient when they are disciplining their children.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose a brother is about to rebuke one of his children.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It would be much better if he waited a few hours before saying anything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, it is extremely difficult to wait even a few minutes, much less a few hours.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The natural tendency is to deal with the children in haste.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Such impatience is damaging.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Impatience is also damaging in our married life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suppose a brother feels it is necessary to speak to his wife about a certain matter that is not pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If he is truly forbearing, he will wait for the right time to speak, a time when the conversation will be constructive.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the same principle, a wife needs to be patient with her husband and wait for the proper time to express her feelings about certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, to be patient and forbearing in such a way is very difficult for us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As an all-inclusive virtue, forbearance implies not only understanding, wisdom, and patience, but also mercy, kindness, love, and sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The list of virtues is almost endless.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As we have pointed out, the Greek word rendered forbearance implies considerateness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To be forbearing is to consider the situation of others.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we would exercise forbearance in our married life and family life, we would have a pleasant married life and an excellent family life.</S>
