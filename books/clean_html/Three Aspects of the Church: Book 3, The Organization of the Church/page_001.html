 <h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
 <p>This book is composed of messages concerning the organization of the church given by Brother Witness Lee during a training on service in Taipei, Taiwan in 1956. The general subject of the training was &ldquo;Three Aspects of the Church.&rdquo; The first aspect is the meaning of the church; the second, the course of the church; and the third, the organization of the church. The messages given in this training were compiled into three books, according to the three aforementioned aspects; these books are subtitled: <em>The Meaning of the Church, The Course of the Church,</em> and <em>The Organization of the Church.</em></p>
