   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen that the arrangement of the Psalms was under God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Psalm 1 is apparently an excellent initiation, but actually it is a very negative initiation.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This psalm is David's inspired praise of the excellency of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After Psalm 8, Psalms 9 15 go down again to the human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then the revelation goes up to Psalm 16, where we see Christ as the God-man in His human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone else has broken the law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have seen that David exalted the law so highly, but by his failure regarding Uriah, he broke the last five commandments Exo 20:13-17 .</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The last five commandments prohibiting killing, fornication, stealing, lying, and coveting were given by God with the requirement that man would have the human virtues to express the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If there were no killing, fornication, stealing, lying, or coveting in the human race, the kingdom of the heavens would really be on this earth.</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His son Absalom became the leading adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Psalms 10 14 David speaks of man's condition before God.</S>
