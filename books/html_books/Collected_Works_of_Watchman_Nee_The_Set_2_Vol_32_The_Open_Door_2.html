O. Box 84, Hankow, July 1938</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">From Tibet to Sikang,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>At present Brother Hsu and I are still conducting evangelistic work around Yeh-Ji. Since January of this year, both rain and snow have been heavy. Even birds have disappeared from the mountains. The route through which we will travel into Sikang and Tibet is blocked, and trade caravans have been halted due to the rebellion of the Yi tribesmen in Deh-Chin County. (Deh-Chin is also called Ah-Dun-Chi; it is a five-day journey from Yeh-Ji in the northernmost county of Yunnan province, with a population consisting entirely of Sikang natives.) We dare not advance now because preparations are not fully ready. The upper tributary of the Nu River goes through the west side of Yeh-Ji, climbing over the mountain to Gung-Shan County. This was an area where I did some evangelistic work last year, with over a thousand people saved. If one travels upstream along the Nu River for five or six days, he will come to Cha-Wa-Rung, which is under Tibetan jurisdiction. I estimate that we will not be able to cross the snowy mountain ranges until the fifth month of the Chinese calendar. Brother Hsu and I intend to take this route to enter Tibet first. From there, we will travel to Sikang. Our departure is getting nearer. Presently, my family is at peace through the Lord's grace. The construction of the house will soon be complete. If other brothers come and visit us, we will have a place to lodge them.</p><p>A brother in the Lord,<br />Hu Yi-min and wife, Yang Shu-jen<br />May 9 in Yeh-Ji</p><h2 class="head2">Letter from Brother Hsu Jung-jieh,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>It would be wonderful if Brother Chang Tze-jieh could come and work together with us here. I hope that he can come soon. I have written him a letter but have not received his reply. I am making some progress in learning the Tibetan language. By the time I go with Brother Hu to preach the gospel in Sikang, I believe this labor will reap a reward. My wife and two children are often sick because of maladjustment to the environment. They may have to go to K'un-ming, or they may go with me. I look to the Lord for His arrangement. If I go with Brother Hu on our evangelistic travel, it will take at least two or three months, or even half a year, before we can come back to see our family. Hence, it will be more or less the same for them if they stay here or move to K'un-ming.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Hsu Jung-jieh and wife, Sien-yun<br />May 9</p><h2 class="head2">Some Experience of Pioneering<br />in the Border Regions, Yunnan Province</h2><p>Brother Chen Hsi-wen and I left Shi-Ping on May 2, arriving in Mong-Tze on the third. We conducted outdoor evangelistic work for half a day on the fourth. A shopkeeper, coolie, and railway worker were particularly touched to receive the Lord. On the afternoon of the fourth, we traveled from Mong-Tze to Bi-Se-Zhai (north of Mong-Tze at the junction of the Yunnan-Vietnam Route and the Ku-Bi-Shi Road). We unexpectedly met Brother Yin and his family. Brother Chou Hung-bao and Brother Lin Yau-huei's mother also arrived from Ho-Kou. We took the train together and arrived in K'un-ming in the afternoon. In our travels, we found many difficulties in the pioneering work in the remote border regions. Except for the Lord's special grace, we would have had no way to start any work. Some of the difficulties included:</p><p>(1) Traveling: There is the danger of robbers and bandits. (The train along Ku-Bi-Shi Road was raided not long ago, and quite a number of people died or were wounded.) Entering into the inland regions is not only difficult but also time consuming. Most of the brothers and sisters living in the villages are poor, and it is advisable to bring more cash when traveling. There is a constant threat of robbers. Hence, there is the need for faith in the Lord.</p><p>(2) Preaching: Other than outdoor evangelistic preaching, it is difficult to gather a congregation because the folks here do not have the habit of meeting. Most of the audience are farmers and illiterate people. They do not understand Mandarin easily. As soon as we use more sophisticated terms, they become lost. The meetings of the local church are not conducted on a punctual basis because most of the believers do not have watches or clocks. There are delays from one to two hours. It is difficult to explain the deeper truths unless we find suitable, simple words or parables from the Lord. (Some think that it does not take any great gift to work in the villages or the inland regions. Actually, it takes as much gift and power to preach to illiterate sinners as it does to preach to believers.) According to my experience, working in the villages is more difficult than working in the cities. The co-workers who have been working in the cities should come to the rural areas to learn about rural life and to make friends with the rural folks. Otherwise, it will be very difficult to see any result. (This, of course, refers to the practical aspects of human affairs.)</p><p>(3) The church: Most people are illiterate, and it is difficult for them to read the Bible. Most of the residents in the inland regions are also prejudiced against outsiders. They often disrupt us using a variety of means.</p><p>(4) Outdoor evangelistic meetings: When we pioneered in different places, the Lord gave us the strength to have the boldness to engage ourselves in outdoor evangelistic preaching in the markets and populous places. According to our natural constitution, we are shy. Many people thought that we were native medicine men or street magicians. Whenever we went out, we prayed for the Lord to give us the strength to speak His gospel boldly. We saw evidence of the Lord's grace every time, proving that the gospel has the power to save all those who believe. We witnessed some immediately receiving the Lord every time.</p><p>The following are the advantages of outdoor preaching: (1) It enables sinners to hear the gospel who otherwise could not come or would not have the opportunity to come to the meeting place. It affords them a chance to hear and receive the gospel. (2) Those who are moved can be quickly introduced to the meetings of the local church. (3) It is economical. Any vacant land under the sky can serve as our preaching ground. There is no need for rent or seating. According to our experience, most people can stand for an hour without walking away. We can conduct these meetings any time and in any place; there is no limitation of time and space. This time we prepared many gospel charts and short choruses. As soon as we hung up the charts and sang the choruses, many sinners were attracted to us and listened to us. (Trumpets, accordions, or bells are also good for attracting the crowds.) Usually two or three of us take turns speaking, and the audience also rotates. We have started this kind of work in K'un-ming already. The co-workers here had the first co-workers' meeting in my house on the eleventh of last month. We encouraged and edified each other in the Lord, discussed matters related to the work, considered the problems, and gave ourselves to prayer. We have set aside every Wednesday afternoon at two o'clock for this kind of meeting.</p><p>K. H. Weigh<br />June 6 in K'un-ming</p><h2 class="head2">Ku-Jiu and Mong-Tze, Yunnan Province</h2><p>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>Since Brother Weigh and Brother Chen returned to K'un-ming, I have conducted a few Bible studies with the brothers and sisters in Shi-Ping concerning the subject "Standing Fast in the Lord." The church in Shi-Ping has been suffering some disturbance lately. Thank the Lord that the disturbance taught His children some lessons. On May 13 I went to Ku-Jiu for the second time and conducted a seven-day Bible study. Because of the rain, we could not engage in any outdoor evangelistic work. During the day, we did some personal visitations. The railway company here has a Mr. Wong and Mr. Fung, who have become desirous of the truth as a result of Brother Kung's testimony. A group of brothers who are materially poor have been dealt with in the matter of life. Now they are reading the Bible and praying in the house of Brother Ruan. On the twenty-third of this month, I went by train to Mong-Tze, and I will spend a week for the work here. In the daytime I preach outdoors, and in the evening I have Bible study meetings in a Gospel Chapel. (This chapel was rented by a few believers who have invited me to use their place.) Greetings in the Lord.</p><p>A weak brother in the Lord,<br />Lin Kwang-tsao<br />May 25 at 28 Da-Jing Street, Mong-Tze</p><h2 class="head2">Returning from Jien-Shui to Shi-Ping,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>On May 30, after returning from Mong-Tze to Shi-Ping, I conducted a few more days of Bible studies. Later, because of my burden for Jien-Shui, I left Shi-Ping and went there. Prior to my arrival, Brother Kung in Ku-Jiu asked the midwife of the Jien-Shui Health Clinic, Miss Kuo Chia-ai, to recommend a place for me to stay. After my arrival, it was recommended that I stay in the guard house of a mansion. I felt an unspeakable pressure upon me as if I were sick. The guards were talking about bandits who had raided the city the previous day at a location not far from where I lodged. I wanted to go home. Suddenly, I felt that I should pray, and I rejected all these thoughts in the name of the Lord. Thank the Lord that He released me. Later, I visited Miss Kuo (a member of a Methodist church) and met with the director of the clinic, Mr. Chou Je-min (a native of Anhwei province and an Episcopalian). He was willing to give me an opportunity to conduct a Bible study in his clinic. The first night I preached the gospel at the guard house. The second night we moved to the department building. We had a Bible study every evening until the thirteenth. As soon as we awakened some to seek after the Lord, people came from Mong-Tze and spoke to Director Chou for the purpose of chasing us away. Thank the Lord that Chou was not affected, and we conducted another Bible study on the fifteenth. On the sixteenth we returned to Shi-Ping. I really hope that the Lord will send you to work together with me in Yi-Nan. Please pray for us.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Lin Kwang-tsao<br />May 17 in Shi-Ping</p><h2 class="head2">In Luh-Liang, About to Go to Chu-Jing,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>Brother Chou Hung-bao was led by God last month to work in a place in Yi-Dung called Luh-Liang (bringing along his family). Sister Chen Hwei-sien went along also. While they were on their way late one night, God miraculously led them through the dark night by the illumination of lightning. Brother Chou said that he had never in his life felt the lightning to be as precious as on that night. They arrived at a little inn a little past nine, and rain began to pour down heavily after supper. In Luh-Liang God prepared a nice house for them with eight rooms upstairs and downstairs. The monthly rent was only three dollars. We are told that the people here are very desirous of the Lord's Word. Recently the postmaster and his wife received the Lord. Thank the Lord that He has opened the door for preaching.</p><p>Brother Chou Kang-yao and his wife will soon work in Chu-Jing. Recently there was a Mr. Chou in K'un-ming who was an instructor in the Air Force. He hurt his leg and was hospitalized in Hwi-Dian Hospital. Through Brother Chou Kang-yao's preaching, God saved him during his three months of suffering. On September 16 he was baptized into Christ. His testimony moved many. He said that if God wanted him to be a preacher, he was willing to do so. May the Lord personally lead him on in the way ahead.</p><p>Hwang Tsung<br />June 18, Customs Department, K'un-ming, Yunnan</p><h2 class="head2">Letter from Sister Rachel Lee, Yunnan Province</h2><p>Sister Yu and I went to Tang-Chi and preached the gospel for three days (twice a day). This town is ninety Chinese miles from K'un-ming. Most of the people are Buddhists. Previously, they were very antagonistic towards Christianity. One preacher was driven out of the town by them. At the beginning of March, while we were preaching the gospel in K'un-ming, an older lady received the Lord. She had been a Buddhist for over thirty years. After she received the Lord, she dropped her vegetarian diet as well as her opium. She begged Sister Yu and I to visit her hometown of Tang-Chi to preach the gospel there. We knew that God wanted us to go, and we went. Originally, we intended to go only for a day. But after we arrived, the Lord had sovereignly arranged everything. Her oldest son was the district chief of the town, and her third son was the principal of the elementary school. They prepared a classroom in the school (which could hold over three hundred people) for us to preach the gospel. Thank the Lord, most of the people in the town eventually heard the gospel. (The whole town has about five hundred households.) Many received the Lord. Sister Yu and I are very busy, and the work is hectic. We have gospel meetings in the sisters' homes. Every Monday we have a Bible study and prayer meeting in one sister's house, and every Saturday we preach to some young believers in another sister's house to help them know the Lord more and to pray. Thank and praise the Lord, He has granted us an open door even in this place. The Lord willing, Sister Yu and I will go to Tang-Chi again soon. Perhaps we will also go to Luh-Liang. After we become clear in our prayer, we will proceed. (We heard that Brother Chou Hung-bao has arrived in Luh-Liang and has started open air evangelistic meetings.)</p><p>A sister in the Lord,<br />Rachel Lee<br />June 4, in K'un-ming, Yunnan</p><h2 class="head2">Letter from Sister Liu Hwei-fen, Tientsin</h2><p>As to my future, I realize before the Lord that I have to stay in Tientsin for a longer period of time. I do not know whether I have understood God's will correctly. The Lord has been leading me to see that His humility and submission are beyond understanding. If there is anything wrong, I pray that God would be merciful and correct me, and I ask also that you instruct me. As for the sisters, I have concentrated on their spiritual condition and have not stopped them from their former activities. I do this so that they may develop something by themselves. Once a week I pray with a few sisters. During the week I also study the Bible with some sisters and unbelievers. In addition, I have been making some personal contacts. Brother Lee Bih has returned to Tientsin. I heard that Brother Witness Lee will come to Tientsin soon. We are waiting for him to come and help us. A few sisters from the Evangelistic Band have come to join us in the Lord's table at No. 82.</p><p>Sister Liu Hwei-fen<br />May 10, in Tientsin</p><h2 class="head2">Northern Kiangsu</h2><p>Before the turmoil, my father, Brothers Chi and Chiu, and I went to Dah-Chiao, Ma-Bao, Chu-Jia-Kou, Ke-Jia-Juang, Ma-Chang, Lian-Shui, Chang-Jia-Wah, etc., to visit the churches and to relate to them the principles of the work and also some of the news concerning the churches in northern Kiangsu. In particular we thank the Lord that the church in Dah-Chiao was revived and that the men He uses were also revived. That meeting is held in a remote village with over thirty people meeting. The Lord is the Savior and worthy to be exalted. Presently, seven people have been baptized. The meeting in Chien-Ji in north Lian-Shui has also seen the Lord's blessings. There are over twenty new believers at present.</p><p>Wu Ming-hui</p><h2 class="head2">Letter from Brother Tang Shou-ling, Shanghai</h2><p>After I arrived in Shanghai, I intended to rest, but the work before me forced me to put myself to work. Thank the Lord that He has given me the necessary strength. The meeting here is under God's grace. The sisters are living and fresh, and the brothers are improving. A few brothers who were cold are now warmed up, and a few who were hardened are now softened by the Lord's love. We are waiting for a great revival. Brother Yu Cheng-hwa is burdened to finish the translation of the autobiography of Madam Guyon so that it can be printed. Brother Chang Kwang-rong is in Shanghai. He loves the Lord very much. The Lord willing, he and I will leave Shanghai in the near future to visit brothers and sisters elsewhere.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Tang Shou-ling<br />June 1</p><h2 class="head2">Compilation of Calendar with Daily Bible Reading</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Since I returned to Shanghai, my health has not been good; I have had two episodes of malaria attacks. The doctor examined my lungs and said that I have chronic pleurisy. Because there was no suitable place to rest at home, I stayed in the hospital for eight days. The doctor only gave me some tonic food supplements for my pleurisy and something to help me sleep. Humanly speaking, this is a chronic illness. I do not know what God's will is. May the Lord be gracious to me so that I do not become loose or lazy and so that I know what to do on my bed. Please pray for me. For a few months I have been burdened in my heart to compile a daily reading that contains a verse from the Scriptures and some words of exposition, which can be attached to a calendar. I have made some preparations, but I realize that this is not an easy task. I hope that some brothers and sisters will have the burden to write something, and I will compile them together. There is no limit to the number of words; it can be three or four hundred words. After we have decided on the content, we will do the editing. If the writings are too long, we can print only the verses on the calendar and put the exposition in another book. Do you think that this is a good idea? May the Lord grant the brothers and sisters the burden, and please put the matter in your prayer.</p><p>Brother Chou Shing-yi<br />May 26</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>A calendar with daily readings would surely be beneficial to the believers, but I do not know what Brother Chou's emphasis is. I will only say a few things for his consideration.</p><p>(1) Rather than saying that you have a verse and an exposition, it is probably better to say that you have a verse and a little portion. The little portion can be a testimony, a story, a parable, or some words of comfort, encouragement, exhortation, and remembrance for the purpose of stirring up zeal or love or for the building up of faith or godliness. Even if it is some kind of exposition, it should be for the nourishment of life and should be something that can be put into practice. Even if it does mention a subject like the rapture or the kingdom, its emphasis should not be on knowledge but on preparing others to meet the Lord and to seek after our kingship with Him. Mere intellectual exposition, even if clear, logical, and accurate, will not create in the readers a hunger after righteousness or an urge to beseech Him on their knees.</p><p>(2) There should not be too many words for each portion. If a daily portion is too long, it will not only confuse the simple ones but also be a headache for typesetting. The suggestion of putting the exposition in a book if it is too long misses the goal of the daily reading. The intention of such a calendar is to provide something that catches people's eyes, without them having to spend much time in reading it. Therefore, the ideal length would be one page per day. If there are too many words, we can use smaller type, and if the words are few, we can change to larger type. In either case we should cover each day with only one page.</p><p>(3) The style should be simple and sincere. The worst kind of writing is that which does not say anything, that "moans without sickness," that plays with words or expressions. For example, if the text is 2 Corinthians 12:9, we can use the story of the brother who applied the truth of this verse. Or if the text is John 3:16 and the emphasis is receiving eternal life through faith, we can put in the salvation story of Mr. Chapman. If the text is "Do not be slothful in zeal," we can say something like, "Just as a lazy man cannot be saved, so also a lazy believer cannot grow." However, in quoting stories or sayings of famous men, we must be accurate. Anything we quote from memory is likely to contain mistakes. If someone has passed through a crisis with the assistance of a verse, he can write a short testimony based on that verse. Of course, the words simple and sincere are easy to say but hard to pen. The only thing we can do is pray and carefully consider as we work, but not be careless and slovenly.</p><p>(4) We also need to make some decisions as to the format of the layout. If the topics are to be cyclical, we should lay out the subjects, assign certain days to them, and put them out in cycles of days. If there is to be a special line, such as an emphasis on the overcoming life, we need to put out related verses consecutively for a number of days and arrange them according to some kind of order. The format also can be completely random. The most important thing is to be living and fresh and not legal. The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. We have to pray while we work. Anything that is not produced from the Spirit is not spiritual and will not affect the spirits of others. Anything that is not from heaven will not receive blessings from heaven and will not lay up fruit in heaven. May the One who started this work in your heart also accomplish it.</p><p>Ruth Lee<br />June 29, in Wan County</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Chang Yu-zhi, Chungking</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>We have completed five evenings (June 13-17) of meetings here (at 4-3 Chang's Garden). There was much blessing from the Lord. Some sisters have truly advanced in prayer. Soon we may have a gospel meeting in Chang's Garden.</p><p>Brother Chang Yu-zhi<br />June 18</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>If the Lord so leads, I will go to Ch'eng-tu for a rest. Presently, I have been providing hospitality for the brothers and sisters and also taking care of some literature work. Perhaps I will still help to translate the The Dynamics of Service. Therefore, I am afraid to travel in the next three weeks. A few days ago I spoke with Brother Ke. On his way home, he stayed in a hotel in Shiaoshing where he was interrogated by military police. The letter of recommendation which he carried gave him some trouble. The military police did not understand terms such as "the meetings in various places" or "the Lord's table"; they thought that our brother was in some kind of secret society. Fortunately, God sent a nephew of his, whom he had not seen for seven years and who happened to be working there, and the matter was settled in peace. I feel that we should consider how we write the letter of recommendation in the future.</p><p>Brother Chang Yu-zhi<br />June 22</p><p>(Perhaps in the future in writing letters of recommendation, we should add the words in Christ after the word brother so that others will know that we are Christians. It is also not too proper to put "those meeting in the Lord's name" in the signatory. It is better to explicitly say, "the church in such and such a place." In principle we should make it as plain as possible&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Lan Tsi-yi, Hankow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>During the past two months, God has granted us grace in the churches in Wu-ch'ang and Hankow. First, He has perfected many believers in quietness to grow in life. Second, He has been saving sinners apart from our scheduled works. Third, He has opened many doors for the work. The more we see that we are useless and powerless, the more we see His work. He teaches us that hidden prayers are more important than quick-paced work. Gradually I have come to know Him as the Lord of the work and the working Lord! May glory be to His name!</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi<br />May 23</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>We see God's grace in the work in Bai-Sha-Jou. The chief nurse of the hospital (a brother) has found a house. Brother Chen Yuen-sin has moved in with another brother. Some of the wounded soldiers have received the Lord, and even some officers have asked for gospel booklets and Bibles. God has shown me day by day that nothing is greater or more important than prayer.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi<br />June 3</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Brother Suen Chi-sien wrote me twice from Ch'ang-sha. I can tell from the letters that he has a deeper contact with the Lord. He often goes with Brother Kuo Bu-yueh and Paul Tsao to visit the sick soldiers in the hospital in Ch'ang-sha, and the Lord has used them.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi<br />June 24</p><h2 class="head2">A Few Places in Southeast Asia</h2><p>Malaysia is a vast land. Although there are meetings in Sitiawan, Penang, and Singapore, so far they have been very conservative and have not done much outreach. Not only is there no preaching of the gospel in the various provinces, but the footsteps of the gospel messengers have not even touched these thousands of villages. Last year when Mr. Nee (Watchman) came and inspected all these places, he saw the need of the work in Southeast Asia. When Mr. Faithful Luk came, he concentrated mainly on Singapore and the few places around Singapore. Now God has begun His work in the meeting in Singapore, and the number of saved ones has drastically increased. Malacca and Yung-Ping Harbor had some seeds sown through men coming from Chuanchow and Singapore. When Mr. Luk went there for his pioneering work, a meeting was started in Malacca. Yung-Ping Harbor also began to have a meeting. The door to Ma-Po has also opened. Mr. Wilson Wong went to Sitiawan and started a Bible study two weeks ago this past month. There are still many places without any work yet. Please pray to the Lord to send men to work in all these places.</p><p>A weak brother,<br />Chang Nai-tsung, April 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Letter from Faithful Luk, Singapore</h2><p>I heard that Surabaya started the Lord's table on May 22 to remember the Lord. Yung-Ping Harbor rented a place for meeting, and some were baptized. It so happened that Brother Leland Wang was on his way there for his work. On that Lord's Day, these ones were baptized and they began to break bread. Last week Brother Wang Tsi came to Singapore to conduct a few meetings, and the opportunities were great. This week we are having our meetings in the Gospel Hall, and every night the seats are filled. Praise the Lord for His grace! This Thursday I intend to go to Penang because the brothers have been inviting me for a long time. May the Lord preserve the work there. Please pray for me.</p><p>Faithful Luk<br />May 25</p><h2 class="head1">THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE CO-WORKERS</h2><p>(1) Brother Watchman Nee arrived safely in London in May.

Their whereabouts are not listed in this column&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE CHURCHES</h2><h2 class="head2">Si-Feng County of Fen-Tien</h2><p>Brothers taking pilgrimage in Hankow:</p><p>Recently I read from The Open Door (which I borrowed from others) about the work and the situations in various places. I could not help but thank and praise the Lord! We began to meet in 1935. At that time we only acted according to what we saw to be His commandment. Actually, we did not have the leading of the Holy Spirit, and everything was legal and dead. Yet we were still satisfied in ourselves and thought that we were doing the right thing. But today we have to say how poor and pitiful we were! Thank the Lord that He loves us. Just as He delivered us from death, He is able to deliver us from the letter into the Spirit. From the light in the book Rethinking Our Work (The Normal Christian Church Life), we clearly saw how much we had restricted and limited Him. Therefore, we sing a song of thanksgiving on the one hand, and say, in sorrow, "Lord, there is no goodness within us" on the other hand. We can only say, "Lord, You have graced us and granted mercy to us. You are truly man's perfect Savior!" Greetings in the Lord.</p><p>Your small brothers,<br />Hau Jan-ge, Fu Chung-tsou, Kwan Yu-nong<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Kai-Yuan County of Feng-Tien</h2><p>Dear workers at the Gospel Book Room:</p><p>Peace from the Lord! Through His grace I have read in The Open Door of the work in various places and the situation of the various local churches. I cannot help but prostrate myself before God and exalt His greatness, rejoicing for our brothers and sisters who have received grace. I ask God and beseech Him earnestly with tears that in these quickly passing days He would reveal His Son more deeply in our hearts so that we would realize the cross's way of loss, suffering, and loneliness. This is the God-ordained way for us on earth. After we have suffered these temporary sufferings, we will receive the unfading inheritance that is reserved for us in heaven. Please send us The Open Door according to our subscribed number of copies so that our burden may be increased by knowing of the needs of the co-workers and brothers and sisters in the various places and so that we may enjoy more of the glorious privilege before God's mercy seat. May God bless everything recorded in this magazine, and may the readers receive its help. Peace to you in the Lord. Greet the church of God in Hankow.</p><p>Yours who have received<br />the same heavenly calling in Christ,<br />Wu Tsia-teh,<br />April 21<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tientsin</h2><p>I attended a prayer meeting at 82 Yau-Hwa Lane. I have also met with Brother Hsia and talked with him briefly. He is doing very well. This Lord's Day I will break bread at Yau-Hwa Lane and fellowship with the Lord's children there. I was delayed in going to Peking because of the excellent chance of preaching the gospel, but the most important reason is that I wanted very much to see Brother Witness Lee. He is not in Tientsin, but he will come soon. I have to ask and learn from Brother Witness concerning many principles in the work.</p><p>Yu-shu,<br />May 12, Tientsin</p><p>(This brother is a co-worker of Brother Wang Ming-dao&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Ying County, Shansi Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Bu-yueh:</p><p>Since the coup last year, we have been under God's protection and care. Even though the situation was extremely tense, we felt God's messengers pitching tents around us and protecting us. We did not leave our dwelling and did not stop our meeting. When you see this letter, you should praise the Lord for us.</p><p>This year I was led by the Lord to go to Si-Tang, Dah-Tung, for a month and to Tso-Yun for more than ten days. I have the intention to go to Dong-Tang, Dah-Tung, and perhaps to regions around Tien-Tsen and Yang-Gao. It will be up to the Lord's leading. Please pray much for me.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Suen Rong, April 30<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Sian, Shensi Province</h2><p>Thank and praise the Lord! My wife and two children arrived safely three weeks ago from Hwai-Yuen, Anhwei, via Hsi-Chow. (We requested your prayer in Issue No. 5 of this magazine). While passing Hsi-Chow, a few dozen planes were conducting air raids. Many residents were killed or wounded. The sight was quite ghastly, but my wife and family were preserved. This has to be the special deliverance of the Lord! Along the way they witnessed the wonderful grace of the Lord, which was beyond what pen and ink can describe. We can only sing hallelujah and thanks to praise Him. A meeting was conducted here a month ago at the house of Sister Lee Kwei-rong in Dung-Kwan. The meeting stopped when Sister Lee moved to Tien-Shui. My family is temporarily sharing a room in Missionary Song's house (a Britain). I am asking friends to look for a place that can be used for our meeting as well as for my family's dwelling. Daily I commit this matter to prayer, and I ask that you pray for this matter also. Greetings in the Lord.</p><p>A weak brother,<br />Liu Jih-wu, June 2<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Fu-Ping, Shensi Province</h2><p>On May 29 six brothers felt to be baptized, and we baptized them in the name of the Lord in a hot spring outside the city. The meeting that day was full of rejoicing. I know that our God in heaven, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the angels rejoiced even more. I intended to go to Hankow at the beginning of June, but circumstances hindered me. It appears that I will be delayed. I cannot say for sure when I will arrive in Hankow. I await the Lord's provision in everything. I am forwarding X dollars to cover the expense of publishing The Open Door.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Tang Jing-hwa, June 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Wu-Yang, Honan Province</h2><p>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>I have received the various issues of The Open Door on time and have learned the recent news of the work. It has rendered great help to me. May glory be to the One who sits on the throne and to the Lamb! Since the political change last winter, when Hung Dao School in Lu-Teng was disbanded, I returned to Shu County in Anhwei. Half a month later, I was led by the Lord to work with Mr. John Sung in Honan. I have been here for six months. (Mr. Sung has returned to Shanghai.) Although the churches have a few decades of history, they are still very immature. Please remember them much in your prayer.</p><p>Recently my spirit felt the need for evangelistic work in the remote border regions. I have had this desire for a long time but have never received God's clear light. I am hesitant to move presumptuously. May the Lord accomplish His will in this matter! Miss Peng Mei-fang and Missionary Song Bu-kwang have temporarily moved to the China Inland Mission in Yeh County and do not intend to go anywhere during the summer. Brother Peng Shao-shen has left Fang- Cheng to work with the China Inland Mission in Fu-Gou. Sister Lan Shou-lien is presently in Ji-Gung-Shan. Sister Lan Shou-pu has gone to Szechuan. Mr. and Mrs Kao Yu-shen are still working in Yeh County. They intend to return to England this winter. Brother Adeney has gone to work in Fang-Cheng. The few of us in the Evangelistic Crusade are still in Wu-Yang; we will not go anywhere during the summer. We also have Miss Riffel and Miss Miller with us, who have rendered us much help spiritually. I am enclosing a check of X dollars from the China Inland Mission, of which X dollars are from Mr. and Mrs. Kao Yu-shen. We want to give this small sum for use in evangelistic work in Yunnan province. It expresses our sympathy for the evangelistic work in remote border regions. Please remember my whole family in Shu County, Anhwei. I wanted to return home to take care of them, but the war has blocked our travel. Thank the Lord that He has comforted me. May the Lord strengthen the work in your hands, and may God establish them. Amen!</p><p>The least of all brothers in the Lord,<br />Hwai-an, May 19<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Yeh County, Honan Province</h2><p>Dear friends:</p><p>I am very grateful to you for sending me The Open Door issue by issue. Thank the Lord that He has shown you so many pathways. We were very glad to hear of the Lord's grace in Yunnan, and we pray to see greater works being done. While the gospel is gaining victory in China, we can prove that the Lord is real! We have also discovered that hungry hearts are ready to receive His salvation. We pray for you, and may you pray for us also. Enclosed please find X dollars for use in the work, and may the lines of your tents be extended and the stakes of all the work and life of all the workers be strengthened. Peace be to you!</p><p>Nancy B. Gaursen<br />May 27</p><h2 class="head2">Tsingtao</h2><p>When the political situation was tense late last August, most of the residents were dispersed. Before my colleagues from my company left, they asked what I was going to do. I told them that I had not received a letter yet, meaning a letter from heaven. One morning in my morning watch, the Lord laid before me the story of Abraham praying for Sodom, and I immediately prayed for Tsingtao. After my prayer I felt very peaceful and believed that God had heard His child's prayer. By the end of November, the political situation changed, and my colleagues again asked me for my opinion. My answer was, "I will see after I have prayed." I was afraid to move presumptuously and lose my testimony. I laid the matter before the Lord and inquired of Him earnestly. Thank the Lord, He gave me a word: "Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee" (Gen. 26:3). Hallelujah! Since the Lord made such a promise, I did not leave Tsingtao. Brother Witness Lee is in Kao-Mi to work for a few days at the invitation of the brothers there; he will also pass by Tsingtao. We hope that we can have a few days of meeting with him. Please pray for us.</p><p>A small brother in the Lord,<br />Lee She-sin, June 10<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Ji-An, Kiangsi Province</h2><p>As far as money is concerned, what God has given us is indeed rich. The question is whether or not we have managed it well. According to Brother Lou Chuan-en's letter, some at Sha-Di in Si-Shin are eating wheat husks, and the news was recorded in the Southeast Daily News. Comparatively, I am really well off among the brothers.</p><p>In Ji-An there are the China Inland Mission, the True Jesus Church, and the Seventh-day Adventists. I have visited them all. Four brothers have moved here, plus three others who have recently been baptized in Ji-An. There are seven sisters, and we meet once a week. I intend to have a Bible study while I am here. Prayer in one accord is very important. As long as there is one accord, two or three can stand.</p><p>A small brother in the Lord,<br />Si Meng-yu, June 1<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Letter from Brother Han Fu-shen, Ch'ang-Teh</h2><p>Although no medicine or doctor can do my sickness any good, my heart is filled with hope and peace. The doctor dares not operate on me, which is the Lord's answer to my prayer. In order to operate on me and remove the pus in my lung, the doctor would have to remove two ribs. I prayed about this for a few days, and then the Lord gave me Psalm 34:19-20: "Many are the misfortunes of the righteous man,/But Jehovah delivers him from all of them./He keeps all his bones; /Not one of them is broken." Hallelujah! All His promises are yes in Christ. When I was discharged from the hospital, the fever went away. Although the swelling on the left side is a few times larger than before, faith does not see this, and it does not look to feelings. It has been ten days since I left the hospital, and my energy and strength are getting better. I do not know how to thank the Lord enough! This is an answer to the prayers of all the brothers and sisters everywhere. I have to thank them indeed. I do not intend to stay for a long time, but will go to Yi-Yang for a few months rest.</p><p>Han Fu-shen<br />Ch'ang-Teh, June 15</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'ang-sha, Hunan Province</h2><p>Brother Ji Dun-wu is temporarily staying at the Bible school. We are presently looking for a house for him. In the near future the matter will be settled. Since the twelfth, Brother Kuo has had eight days of conference meetings. Thank the Lord that the brothers and sisters were all edified, and the Lord's name was glorified. Sisters Liu Yi-ying and Hwang Shu-hsien are trying to get a ticket to go to Kuei-yang. Brother Chao Yung-chuen's family has come here and is staying at the meeting hall. We have found a house for him through the Church of Christ in China, and he will be moving there tomorrow. Han Ji-shin and Mrs. Shen left for Hong Kong on the seventeenth by car. Brother Ren, who came with Mrs. Weigh, is still weak; it is probably a case of fluid in the lungs, requiring a long period of rest. Suen and Chen are living in the meeting hall. Since the third floor of the meeting hall is so hot, we have rented two rooms behind Mrs. Chiang's house for the sisters to live in. Brother James Tien and his children are also living there. Yesterday, my wife and children left for Yi-Yang by steamer, and Brother Kuo Jen-yung and Mrs. Yang Dai are escorting them and caring for them. Thank the Lord that He cares for us even in the smallest things!</p><p>A few days ago I received a letter from Brother Tang Shou-ling saying that he will be able to visit us, although the soonest he can leave is the beginning of July. As far as hospitality is concerned, the leading we have received from the Lord is not to charge anything for any stay of less than a week. For those who stay more than a week, we will charge X cents per day and X dollars per month. We will receive it from those who are able to pay it and not charge those who cannot afford to pay it. Thank the rich and glorious Lord! He has provided us in the way that He has led us.</p><p>Through the Lord's protection, my health has been sustained. I am still learning the lesson of allowing God to do His own work. Although things are busy, the Lord is responsible for everything.</p><p>Brother Ai-wu,<br />June 22,<br />Ch'ang-sha</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'eng-tu, Szechuan Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Thank and praise the grace of God for sending you to Ch'eng-tu. I do not know how your visit has affected others, but it has affected me very much. Since your coming, I feel all the more weak in myself. I have become fearful of what I was hitherto not fearful of, and I can no longer do what I thought I was able to do. Thank the Lord that whenever I am weak, He becomes strong. I boast in my weakness so that His power can overshadow me. On the morning of May 15, in a little river outside the village off from Dung-Men, nine sisters were baptized. Their testimonies were wonderful; the Lord alone has done this work. May He gain all the glory. My future has been announced by the Institute. The Lord has His will and His work in sending me here to Szechuan. I no longer dare to follow my own choice. I will go wherever He leads me, and I will take His way whatever the cost may be. I need your prayer so that I can render Him some joy in this end time. Vacation for the Institute begins in June, and at the latest in the middle of July, I will leave Ch'eng-tu to go to Chung-Ching-Jou. I will stay for a month and see how the Lord leads. My classmates, Lo Chung-sien, Dai Tsi-shun, Liu Ah-shu, Wang Tsi-gui, Hu Li-zhun, etc., send their greetings to you.</p><p>A small sister in the Lord,<br />Lu Tsi-tsien, May 21</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Recently I have been busy with the work in the Bureau. Most of my time is spent carrying out inspections outside the county. But thank the Lord that everything has been under His blessing. From July 1-10 there will be a Summer Bible School with Rev. Chen Chung-kwei, Rev. Tsia Yu-ming, Rev. Lin Jing-kang, and Rev. Tien Jing-hwa conducting the meetings. The location will be the Fang-Jeng Road High School. Please pray for this meeting.</p><p>Brother in the Lord, Chao Rue-tze, June 6<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Among all of God's children we have received more grace than others. Yet in His house, our response has been the opposite. How unfaithful we have been! May God deliver us from all slothfulness, vanity, and lack of care for others. We have four meetings a week. On Tuesday evening we preach the gospel at Brother Tien Bi-shen's house, which is mostly attended by men from the Anti-smoking Bureau. On Thursday evening we have a prayer meeting. For the sake of convenience, this meeting is held at Mrs. Shen's house in Nan-Tai and at Brother Tsao's house in Che-Ji-Shi. On Saturday evening a Bible study is held in Nan-Tai, while the bread-breaking meeting on the Lord's Day is held in Tze-Ji-Shi. Brother Chang Man-shih has passed through on his way to Jia-Ding to assume his post with the Anti-smoking Bureau. God has used our brothers who are employed by the Anti-smoking Bureau to do some work.</p><p>Brothers Wang Yung-gui and Ji Tsung-yu</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>On the Lord's Day, the sisters from West China University had a fellowship meeting at five o'clock in the morning. They studied the Word, sang, and prayed together. It was a sweet time.</p><p>Sister Chao Shu-yueh, June 6</p><h2 class="head3">Five</h2><p>Since your departure from Ch'eng-tu, I have been thinking much of you. Even though we are separated in the body, thank the Lord that we meet daily before the Lord's throne of grace. Last week Sisters Bi Yung-chin, Liao En-rong, and Liu Su-chin came back from Mien-Yang and related the wonderful work that is going on there. God's power has done this work. Praise the Lord that the busier we are, the more we see that only God is working; man is absolutely useless. Is Mrs. Yuen still in Chungking? I have sent her two letters but have not received any reply. How is the health of Brother Chang Yu-zhi? Please give him my greetings. May the Lord remind us to pray for one another.</p><p>A little sister in the Lord,<br />Chang Yin-hwei, June 6</p><h2 class="head3">Six</h2><p>Thank our God because He bestows grace to His own at all times and in all places! Recently, I received a letter from Lin-Yi. It was from my brother and sister. Although their houses were burned, they were unharmed. My brother retreated with the staff of the post office to the rural countryside a few hours before the surrender of the city. My sister moved into the Lin-Yi Hospital, while my mother stayed in the church building. Except for a small part, the whole city of Lin-Yi was leveled. However, the church building was preserved. I see God's grace upon them! Since the Lord has preserved them on this earth, He will surely provide for their need. Today I received a postcard from Sister Chang Pei-ling. She is presently in Han-Tsung.</p><p>Sister Chiao Yu-yin, June 7<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Seven</h2><p>Sisters Luh Tsi-tsien and Chang Chiang-sien are safe in Ch'eng-tu. After Sisters Bi, Liao, and Liu returned from Mien-Yang, they left for Mien-Tsu. Their health is not too good, but God has granted them enough grace, and their work has been blessed. Mrs. Gu has been doing very well recently. Since your departure, my health has not been good, and I have felt weak often. After Sister Chang Jiang-ngo finished her test, she examined me and moved in to care for me. This has been going on for more than a week already. This is the Lord's grace, and I thank the Lord for this!</p><p>Sister in the Lord,<br />Shen Ma Min-shiu, June 16<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Shanghai</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of last week, the brothers and sisters gathered together to pray in one accord. Praise the Lord, He has heard our call and has been with us. We truly have to praise Him! As a result we had three evenings of special conferences. Brother Yu was responsible for releasing some messages concerning the house of God. They covered how God loves His children, how believers should consecrate themselves, how we live as members of the Body, etc. We see the Lord beginning to work among us. God has indeed blessed us through these few meetings. Please remember us in your prayer so that the church can experience a great revival and every believer can have an excellent testimony to glorify the Lord!</p><p>Wu Yeu-an, Du Tsong-chen, Lin Kwang-biao, Yu Cheng-hwa<br />May 22<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>The work among the sisters in Shanghai is being carried on as before. The brothers are also stirred up to preach the gospel once a week. The bread-breaking meeting has been divided into three locations: (1) Dr. Stearns' house; (2) Brother Luh Chien-ti's house; and (3) Wen-teh Lane. My future is not altogether decided. Peking, Amoy, and Hwang-Yen have all sent letters inviting me to stay with them for a while. The Lord willing, and if circumstances permit and no accident frustrates the way, I hope to go first to the north when the work here is completed by the beginning of July and then to go to the south by October. However, I do not have the approval of my aged mother yet.</p><p>Miao Yun-chun, Shanghai, June 9</p><h2 class="head2">From Yi-Shing to Shanghai</h2><p>Thank the Lord that He has delivered me from peril and has led me safely to Shanghai. I am very thankful for your prayer and that of the other brothers and sisters in the Lord. After Yi-Shing fell into the hand of the enemy, our whole family moved into the mountains. During the past half year, we have had no peace day and night. Many times we had to escape from one place to another. During the most dangerous period, we stayed for two nights in a valley, and one night we traveled several dozen Chinese miles. It was impossible to read the Bible. All we could do was pray. Thank the Lord that He brought His word to my memory: He will not forsake those who put their trust in Him, and He can do what is impossible for man to do. My heart was comforted, and I overcame the outward exile and suffering, fully believing that God would bring us out of our peril. Later, when the crisis was over, we returned to our homes only to find that parts of our homes were burned. We left the mountain homeland and migrated to another town called Jou Tieh-Chiao. On April 17 I hired a boat and went to Ch'ang-Yin-Sha with my sister Teh-jia. I boarded an American merchant steamer and arrived in Shanghai safely on the nineteenth. Teh-jia is employed in a hospital. I have not found a job, and I am staying at Shen's house, where Sister Wang Yi-ying was tutoring. I have tasted God's amazing grace this time and can only thank and praise Him. I am very happy because I have the opportunity once again to go to meetings.</p><p>Di Hwei-jia, May 3<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">From Nan-ch'ang to Shanghai</h2><p>I left Nan-ch'ang on the thirteenth and arrived at Jin-Hwa on the evening of the fourteenth. On the sixteenth I arrived in Wenchow. Although there were many delays and difficulties during this portion of the journey, the Lord's grace has been sufficient for us, and we have been safe. We stayed in Wenchow for a few days because we had to wait for the boat. Through the Lord's care and arrangement, we stayed at a Brother Hwang's house. Brothers Ma Lung-rue, Chang Tsao-tung, Shiao Wen-bing, and my father were with me. Mrs. Hwang was very hospitable and demonstrated the love of Christ. I went to see Brother Pan Huo-ling. He is very weak and needs much prayer. May the Lord heal him. I also met Brother Chang and a few sisters. On the twentieth we boarded the boat in Wenchow, and on the morning of the twenty-second, we arrived safely in Shanghai. God has been gracious to us. Thank and praise Him! The brothers and sisters here are under God's protection, and every Thursday we have the brothers' and sisters' meetings.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Yu Nan-geng, Shanghai, May 29</p><h2 class="head2">The Northern Part of Kiangsu Province</h2><p>Since the capitulation of Tung-Ru, the churches in northern Kiangsu have been quite affected. The brothers and sisters in Tai County moved to the rural areas or neighboring villages for awhile. Thank the Lord that we have been under His blessing. Most of them have moved back recently, but a small number still remain in Yi-Lin. The biggest difficulty is unemployment among the brothers. Most of the brothers are blue-collar workers who have been laid off. Although some brothers have started businesses of their own, they are only loaves in the hands of the disciples. There is not enough for distribution. Please pray for us.</p><p>We have no news from the church in Dung-Tai. Both mail and sea communication have been cut off, and we do not know how the brothers and sisters are doing. The brothers and sisters in Yien-Chen are dispersed in the countryside. Brother Wang Hsueh-yu's home is now in Ma-Chang, and Brother You Shan-fu has moved his whole family to Si-You-Tsuang. Brother You Chan-ting has moved his whole family to Shiao-Kwan, Fu-Ning. Brother Jie's family has moved to East Village in Yien-Chen. We have no news as to whether or not Brother Fei and Brother Lee have moved. Brother Wang is still in Yi-Lin, but he is planning on going elsewhere to preach the gospel. Fu-Ning capitulated on the sixth of this month, and the saints there have moved to East Village in Fu-Ning. According to one brother, they had one Lord's table meeting on the fourth. We have heard nothing from them since. Presently, we have not received any letter from Brother Pei Dah-shen.</p><p>During the most dangerous period, the church in Yi-Lin only met in the morning. The Lord's table was suspended once. Presently, the battle is still raging about thirty Chinese miles from Yi-Lin, and we can frequently hear the sound of cannons and bombs. A few of the brothers and sisters in Yi-Lin who could move went to the nearby villages. About forty to fifty who could not move are now living with my father (Wu Wei) in a walled community. At one time there were over ten brothers from out of town; there are still four who have no place to go. Brother Suen Deh-ming from Shanghai is still in Yi-Lin. Neighboring churches like Dong-Gou, Ban-Hu, and Soo-Jia-Tsui are quite shaken. However, one brother told me that the brothers and sisters have not suffered any harm. The Lord is worthy to be praised! My father is now in Yi-Lin. I will go to Tai County soon. We are not able to receive any news about the other co-workers because of the war. In North Village in Fu-Ning, Brothers You Tien, Chang Kwai, and Hu Siao-lan are meeting with the brothers and sisters. We have no further news from them and are quite concerned about them.</p><p>Brother Wu Ming-hui</p><p> (This letter was probably written after May 18.)</p><h2 class="head2">North Village, Ning-Hai, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear honorable brothers and sisters:</p><p>Since receiving Issue Nos. 2, 3, and 6 of The Open Door, we know that you have received special grace from the Father and are in peace. We also rejoice at hearing about the work in all these places. The Lord has brought us through the past four years according to His grace. There are four orphans and a heartbroken sister staying in Sister Yun-sien's house. Another sister from Ning-Po also sought refuge there. Her husband died when he was fleeing from the war, and she is now tragically left with three children. Please pray for us. Every afternoon we pray together at four-thirty. On Thursday we have a Bible study meeting, using the book Bible Studies for Beginners. We have received the enclosed sum of money from the offering box in Ding's household, which is designated for brothers and sisters who have suffered because of the war. Greetings to you.</p><p>Sisters in the Lord,<br />Tu Yun-sien, Ge Shi-lien, Chiang Jin-chiu<br />May 10<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(On June 26, we received a postcard from Tu's family in Ning-Hai saying that Sister Tu suffered a bullet wound and has been hospitalized for over a month. Please pray for them.)</p><h2 class="head2">From Fu-Yang to Lan-Si, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear brothers and sisters:</p><p>Since the capitulation of Fu-Yang on December 25, the houses and belongings of the brothers and sisters and the meeting hall were destroyed! Over forty of us escaped that morning to the mountains. Soon the thatched hut we squatted in was burned, and we had to move to a higher mountain. Two weeks later our lives were endangered again. The brothers and about twenty neighboring families, sixty-seven in all, began sojourning in more than twenty different places. We passed six counties: Lin-An, Fen-Shui, Sin-Deng, Tung-Lu, Jien-Deh, and arrived at Lan-Si. We wandered for one hundred thirty-eight days. Although we suffered all kinds of hardships, we did not lack in food, clothing, or shelter for a single day! (Either brothers in the Lord or outsiders supplied us.) We cannot help but thank the Lord for His great power and grace! Brother Wang Fu-tang was hit by a bullet in the heart. He was able to crawl along for seven Chinese miles and was later moved by his family to Shan-Si-Kou in Sin-Deng. At that time he gave a wonderful testimony for the Lord, saying, "When I was hit, I looked around and could find no friend or relative beside me. My vision blacked out, and I fell on the ground several times. As I crawled for a mile, blood was streaming out of me. I only said, `Lord Jesus, save me. I am satisfied to see Your face.' Then the blood stopped." He has since died, leaving behind his wife and six children. What a tragedy! My nephew Yu Deh-hwa is twenty years old. Since he was taken captive, we do not know whether he is still alive or dead. Please pray for them so that the parents, wife, and orphans of these two families may be comforted. Praise the Lord that He has brought me through this journey to teach me many lessons. I was once short in faith but have now learned something. I was once lacking in endurance, but now I know a little of what endurance means. I thank the Lord the most that, during this national tragedy, I was able to preach the gospel of His grace and was able to go to places where messengers of the gospel had not gone before. I am a most wicked, disobedient, and weak member. God has been gracious to me even though I have doubted Him and slighted Him. When I became helpless, I had to give up myself and trust in Him solely. Hallelujah! The Lord's grace is made perfect in our weaknesses. Peace to you in the Lord!</p><p>An uncomely member in the Lord,<br />Yu Yien-chuan, May 22<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(We published the situation of Brother Yu Yien-chuan and others in Issue No. 2.

Brother Tsi-cheng and his family are also going to Tung-An and Kulangsu. Together with their families there is a total of twelve people with twenty to thirty pieces of luggage. Cars are few and overcrowded; therefore, the journey is impossible for man. It is difficult enough for two to travel. With twelve persons and twenty to thirty pieces of luggage, it is impossible. When I went with them to the station at seven this morning, however, the Lord miraculously arranged for a truck to take them to Tung-An. From there they will be transferred to Ji-Mei. What a wonderful, sovereign arrangement of the Lord! We can truly say that He is our God. No one is responsible in the church in Chuanchow. Please be exercised about our condition, and pray for us. Greetings in the Lord.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Yang Shi-chao, April 19<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tung-An, Fukien Province</h2><p>War broke out in Amoy on May 10. Places like Tung-An and others have all been bombed. The believers in the cities are all safe. Praise the Lord! Presently, most believers and their families have moved to Chai-Lin (where there is a meeting hall). They are considering the situation and waiting for the Lord's leading. My family may move to Chuan-Shan; we are praying about it. Some believers in An-Hai, Shui-Tou, and Chuanchow have also moved, but the number is not great. Greetings in the Lord.</p><p>Wang Deng-ming, June 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Kulangsu, Fukien Province</h2><p>Brother Luan:</p><p>I received your letter dated June 3 and am very grateful for the concern of all the brothers and sisters in these places. The war in Amoy erupted suddenly, but through the Lord's care and protection, the brothers and sisters from Amoy and Ho-San arrived safely in Kulangsu. Except for a few who have moved to Hong Kong, most of the local brothers are safe in Kulangsu. Nothing has changed much. Most of the out-of-town brothers and sisters have returned to their homes; some have moved to Southeast Asia. Not many are left. Our meeting hall has been assigned as a relief center. As a consequence, all meetings have been stopped. But we are still carrying on the bread-breaking meeting temporarily in a sister's home. I believe that you are very busy in Hong Kong taking care of hospitality for the refugees. May the Lord be with you. Greetings to you.</p><p>Sister in the Lord,<br />Chen Wan-ching, June 11</p><h2 class="head2">Pu-Tien, Fukien Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Sir:</p><p>Enclosed please find a postal order in the amount of X dollars, of which X dollars are an offering made by brothers and sisters this last Lord's Day for the saints suffering from the war. The rest is for The Open Door.</p><p>The church in Pu-Tien, May 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Brothers in the Lord:</p><p>Peace to you in the Lord! The Lord has been gracious to us, and everything is in peace. Thank the Lord! Please be assured, and please pray for us. Two or three brothers are starting a photographic studio. God has blessed their business, and they have offered according to their income. The Lord is worthy to be praised and worthy of everything. The brothers have asked me to transfer this money to you and to send it to Szechuan and Yunnan for the work. The total amount is X dollars. May the Lord remember your work. Greetings in the Lord.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chu Ai-tseng, June 4</p><h2 class="head2">Swatow, Kwangtung Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>For a long time we have been preserved in peace by the Lord. Two weeks ago I received a few letters from my sister in Bangkok urging me and Hwei-min to go there. There is no meeting in Thailand, and the two of us going there alone is a fearful thought. I do not know whether there are brothers and sisters in Thailand. If there are, please send us the address.</p><p>Sisters Chai Lan-jen and Hwang Hwei-min, June 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(Presently, we do not know of anyone living in Thailand. If anyone knows of any, please inform us.)</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Recently, the broken dams on the Yellow River caused widespread catastrophe in a vast area. I wonder whether there are any brothers and sisters living in the disaster area. Hankow is now dispersing its population. I wonder whether there are brothers and sisters who have moved to other places. How are the meetings there? The political situation here is still very tense. More sisters have moved to the inland regions, but they are all safe, which is comforting.</p><p>Enclosed please find the X dollars which we received from the offering box. X dollars of this are for the pioneering work in the border regions, and X dollars are for relief to brothers and sisters in difficulty.</p><p>Brothers Chai Gi-chen, Chen Fang-ching, and Hsie Tse-shun<br />June 22<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">K'un-ming, Yunnan Province</h2><p>The church here has experienced much of the Lord's grace. We see many people saved continuously. Many brothers and sisters have active, personal evangelistic work. After our first baptism, we had three more baptisms. Altogether twenty-five brothers and sisters have been baptized into the Lord's name. May all the glory be to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Praise the Lord! He has saved a few instructors and students at the Aviation Institute through the brothers and sisters, and the saved ones have also been baptized into the Lord's name. Some of the baptized ones work in the hospitals, and some in the Telegraph Bureau.</p><p>K. H. Weigh, June 6</p><h2 class="head2">Ku-Jiu, Yunnan Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Brothers Weigh, Chen, and Lin:</p><p>God has cared so much for us humble specks of dust. At the crossroads of hopelessness, He caused us to turn suddenly into the way of life and light. Thank God that through the mouths of you three, I was brought to the understanding of the truth of regeneration. At the meeting on Tuesday afternoon, I testified to the saving power of Christ. Tonight, at the house of Mr. Fung of the Railway Department, I gathered together a group of friends, and we studied 1 Corinthians 13. I hope that every week we can have three special Bible studies together. But I am weak and powerless in myself. I hope that the brothers and sisters will pray for me. I pray that the Lord would bless all of them.</p><p>Brother Gung En-lung, April 24</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Brother Weigh and Brother Chen:</p><p>Since you left, the brothers and sisters have been very zealous. They have come on time to every meeting, and everyone speaks with short testimonies. During the past two Lord's Day evenings at the bread-breaking meetings, we were joined by a few new believers: Brother Hu, Sister Wang, and Brother Suen. We are all very young. Please remember the church in Ku-Jiu all the time. May the Lord bless all the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Brother Gung En-lung, May 18</p><h2 class="head2">Hong Kong</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Recently, the number of refugees suddenly increased. Yesterday the newspaper said, "In one week there has been an increase of one hundred seventy thousand people. Since the start of the war, the population in Hong Kong has swollen by four hundred thousand. Rents in some places have doubled, and prices have increased by thirty-five percent. The British government is already trying to stamp out the flooding in of refugees." Brothers and sisters among the refugees are increasing day by day. Finding lodging for them has become a big problem. In the house of Brother Hsie from Amoy, over thirty people are being housed temporarily. Many brothers have not been able to find lodging after many days. We need the Lord's special grace under such circumstances. The Lord has opened the door to the work in Hong Kong recently. I regret that I am too weak and useless to meet all the needs.</p><p>Brother Philip Luan, June 8</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Recently, rent in Hong Kong has skyrocketed, and many refugees are suffering unnecessarily. It seems that all the houses and all the streets are full of people. What a pitiful sight!</p><p>Philip Luan, June 12</p><h2 class="head2">Macao</h2><p>Thank the Lord! He has shown me clearly through the situation along the south coast of China that I should move away from Chungshan. On the afternoon of May 26, I arrived safely at my aunt's house in Macao. On the Lord's Day afternoon, we had a meeting at the house of the brother-in-law of Rev. Ma Mu. All five brothers from CBC Laboratories came to the meetings. Brother Chang Shi-wu is leaving Macao today to go to Shanghai via Hong Kong. Yesterday, I saw Mrs. Yeh, the sister of Sister Liu Shu-bao, at Mrs. Ma's house. We prayed together. The Lord willing, I may go to Hong Kong later. Presently, I will stay in Macao for a while. Please pray for me.</p><p>Sister Roh-chen, May 31</p><h2 class="head2">Penang, Malaysia</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Enclosed please find X dollars for The Open Door and for the brothers and sisters in difficulty. Please use it according to the Lord's leading. May all the glory go to God's name. Greetings to all the brothers and sisters.</p><p>The assembly in Penang,<br />Juang Dah-deh, Yang Jien-hsiung, Chang Nai-tsung,<br />Tseng Pei-ran<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>We have received Issue Nos. 1&mdash;6 of The Open Door. Through this publication, which is filled with God's love, we have learned with much rejoicing about the meetings, the work, and the situations of the brothers and sisters in all these places! The assembly in Penang now has about forty members with over thirty breaking bread together. In January Brother Faithful Luk came and conducted an evangelistic revival meeting. We witnessed an abundant blessing from the Lord. On April 1 Brother Watchman Nee passed through on his way to Europe, and through him we again received the Lord's grace. He stayed for a few days and spoke to us about the truth. All the children of the Lord received much edification. Thank and praise the Lord! After reading the book Rethinking Our Work (The Normal Christian Church Life), we all wish to obey God's will in one accord and to act according to the principle of the Bible. May the Lord grant us grace, and may you pray much for us. Enclosed please find X dollars to be used for the apostolic work in the pioneering endeavor in remote regions. Greetings in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Chang Ke-shu, May 4</p><h2 class="head2">Surabaya, Indonesia</h2><p>Sister Ruth:</p><p>I received your letter dated April 21 through Singapore and learned of all the news from it. In times of difficulty, brothers and sisters are more precious to us than before. "A friend loveth at all times,/and a brother is born for adversity." May the Lord's grace be with you in your traveling. My wife and I arrived in Surabaya on May 3. It is very difficult to get permission from the Dutch government to work. I intend to go to Singapore at the end of June and perhaps to Hong Kong at the end of July. Four of my children are in Hong Kong, one is in Singapore, and the youngest is with me. Presently, I do not know where I will be staying. My Singapore address is: Leland Wang, 13 Jerrois Road, Singapore, S.S. My address in Hong Kong is: 6 Kwong King Terrace, Bonham Road, Hong Kong. My parents are now in Hong Kong. Brother Wilson Wang's family arrived in Singapore on May 13. If Sister Miao can come to Singapore, I would be delighted to meet her. Please inform me ahead of time. Greetings to Sister Yun and Sister Peace Wang. Peace to you.</p><p>Brother Leland Wang, May 17</p><h2 class="head1">MISCELLANEOUS NEWS&mdash;<br />(WHEREABOUTS OF DIFFERENT SAINTS)</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>Thank the Lord that we can still publish this issue in Hankow! If the readers cannot send their letter to Hankow, they can send it to either Mrs. Yuan How-tsai in Chungking or Brother Ho Nai-yee in Hong Kong. They have been charged by this magazine to serve the brothers and sisters in the Lord. We hope that we can continue our work in Hankow. Should this become impossible, we will tell you where we will be when we have settled down.</p><p>There are more pages in this issue than before. Some of the letters are from faraway places and are very sincere. Some tell of moves and changes as a result of the political turmoil. Some are comforting reports, while others are disturbing reports. I intended to start a column on supplication and thanksgiving, but there are too many pages already, and I had to give up. I hope that the readers will read through the whole magazine so that they will know what to make supplication for and what to give thanks for.</p><p>The addresses of the co-workers are recorded in the column "Footsteps of the Co-workers."</p><p>If you have any question regarding Bible exposition, please send it to the editor of The Christian. This magazine does not deal with that kind of subject. "Questions and Answers," as seen in Issue No. 2, has to do with the church meetings and is different in nature. We wish to remind the readers that the emphasis of this magazine is on the work of the gospel and the practice of the church.</p><p>Wire transfers to Tsingtao have now been cleared. Mail to Shu County and Chou County is still not clear. We have received letters from northern Kiangsu; they are in much difficulty. Presently, we are doing all we can.</p><p>Fukien and Kwangtung are in much turmoil. Many have difficulty taking refuge in Hong Kong. The Lord has to open up the way for the brothers and sisters who are moving inland from Hankow to Szechuan and Hunan. In the past the Lord prevented these refugee brothers and sisters from becoming homeless through the love of many. In the future He will also lead them through His miracles. Our God is also our Father. He is the One who is both the beginning and the end! As I am writing this, I cannot help but have mixed feelings of comfort and apprehension, and my tears freely follow my pen!</p><p>Ruth Lee, at a village in Wan County<br />July 2, 1938</p><p>Correction by Chang Tze-jieh: In Issue No. 7 I wrote about the man who was sick for eighteen years who started to walk.

But the Lord is the One who is guiding my footsteps.</p><p>I have no other purpose in coming to Europe this time; I feel that God has led me to seek God's remnant here, to communicate with them, and to learn to pray together and to bring in God's kingdom. We do need a revival to see what we saw at the beginning. May our work be governed by this vision.</p><p>Watchman Nee, June 13</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Witness Lee, Chefoo</h2><p>There is much of the Lord's blessing on the work here. Since spring we have had two baptisms. About forty brothers and sisters have been baptized. Among them, a few brothers have been actively seeking the Lord. Thank the Lord! The Lord willing, I will make a trip to Peking and Tientsin. There are urgent needs in the work waiting for me there. I cannot say definitely how long I will stay there and where I will go from there.</p><p>Witness, June 10</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chai Tse-chung, Pu-Tien</h2><p>The meeting hall in Kulangsu is housing one hundred fifty refugees. Two stories of the building at the back are reserved for our brothers and sisters who are taking refuge in this place. The gospel meetings at the meeting hall have been forced to be temporarily suspended. Brother James Chen has returned to Kulangsu from Swatow, and he is conducting a Bible study at the believers' houses daily. On June 6 Brother Chen Ke-san went to work in Feng-Ting. Later Sister Bau Hsu-min joined him. Brother Chen Jai-seng and I had twelve days of meetings in Fu-Ching. Brother Jung Chun-geng and Sister Wang Yien-tse are helping us.</p><p>Brother Chai Tse-chung, June 28</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Sister Miao and Sister Tso,<br />Shanghai</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Beginning July 1 the gospel work with the women has been taken up entirely by the local sisters. We finished studying the Gospel of John the Wednesday before last. In the future we will still have a sisters' meeting on Wednesday. May the Lord lead them on.</p><p>Two weeks ago I was quite tired. My heart was somewhat sick, and I was weak. After resting for a week, I am improving, but I cannot leave Shanghai yet. Brother Hsu Dah-wei has been in Shanghai for three weeks. Beginning July 11, at the invitation of the local church here, he will conduct a perfecting meeting for the young brothers and sisters. It will be four times a week, starting at four o'clock. Beginning this Lord's Day, we will start a bread-breaking meeting in the house of Wu Shen-lai. We hope that a few more places will open up eventually. When the number of people in a meeting becomes too large, the worship becomes a little too stifling. Because of the increase in business affairs, a few brothers and sisters have been added to the list of deacons and deaconesses. Neither God's love nor His grace will touch some, and we can only ask for God's discipline. The Lord has truly heard our prayers recently, and a few brothers and sisters have turned back.</p><p>Miao Yun-chun, July 13</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I received a letter from the brothers and sisters in Ch'ang-sha recently. They have asked Brother Liu Ai-wu to write a letter of invitation to me, hoping that I can go to them and do some work among the sisters. How do you feel? If you feel the same way and I am clear that this is God's will, I hope that I can go.</p><p>Sister Tso Fu-ru, June 14</p><p>(On July 27 I received Sister Tso's letter, dated the nineteenth, saying that she has decided to go from Shanghai to Ch'ang-sha via Hong Kong on the twenty-sixth.

We worked there for seven evenings. The Spirit of God had gone before us, and every evening about three hundred people came to listen to the word. Even on rainy nights, at least half that number showed up. Such quietness and attentiveness have rarely been seen elsewhere. On the third night some began to yield to the Lord. Thereafter, some began to believe in the Lord, both in the day as well as at night. On the last evening more believed. Over thirty people knelt down to call on the Lord. Miracles and works of wonders testified to our word. At the end of May we did some watering work and some became clear about their salvation. They have asked to start meeting and have already rented places for their meeting. On the Lord's Day of June 12, they began to meet. Every Wednesday evening they meet for prayer and to learn to sing hymns. The offering box was placed in the meeting place, and everyone brought chairs and other furniture from their own homes. God has also selected some among them who are like elders. We praise the Lord unceasingly at seeing His great grace and power! At the beginning of June, we conducted five days of pioneering work in the foothills of Bai-Luh Mountain, which is three miles west of Hwang-Ni Mountain. One person believed in the Lord. On June 30 we advanced to Jien-Tan Mountain, which is five miles northwest of Hwang-Ni Mountain, and worked there for seven evenings. The attendance was no less than that in Hwang-Ni Mountain, except that the crowd was noisy. God prepared a village chief who accepted the Lord. This has been to the disadvantage of the opposers. Thank the Lord that seven or eight have repented and believed in the Lord. Since God has done a great work, the enemy will not let go. In Hwang-Ni and Jien-Tan recently, he has been using many ways to attack God's children, and he has enticed some to draw back. May the victorious Christ continue to display His victory in His children and shame His enemy. I hope that the co-workers will remember this and pray.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,</p><p> Hu Bu-dao, Chen Meng-tsao, July 10</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Rachel Lee, K'un-ming</h2><p>The Lord willing, I will leave soon for Yunnan. At any rate I have to repay my present debt. I am clear concerning the Lord's will and will be in Yi-Liang and Luh-Liang by the end of the month. Then I will travel to areas around Shi-Ping, Ku-Jiu, and Mong-Tze. During the past three weeks, the pastor from the Episcopal Church and his wife have asked Sister Yu to preach at their place. The situation during that week was very good, and some of the newly saved ones were revived. Recently, much progress has been made with the sisters; they now desire to seek after the Lord very much.</p><p>Sister Rachel Lee, July 8</p><h2 class="head1">WHEREABOUTS OF THE CO-WORKERS</h2><p>(1) Brother Han Jin-siu has recently been working in Chang-Tai in Fukien.</p><p>(2) Sister Bao Hsu-min is in Pu-Tien.</p><p>(3) Brother Chou Kang-yao went to Chu-Jing with his family to work.

No one wants to stay too long because this is too close to the war zone. Moreover, there have been air raids (four times already). They stay for as long as a month and as little as one or two days.</p><p>Brother Ma Chuan-foo<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Ning-Po, Chekiang Province</h2><p>I was able to secure copies of Issue Nos. 2 through 4 of The Open Door through indirect means, and through them I became acquainted with the news of the brothers and sisters. What a joy and relief! I even received light from them. I thank the Lord with all my heart, amen. I arrived here in February. There are not too many students in the school. Both staff and salaries have been reduced. Although we receive less, God is able to cause us to use less. He is indeed the wonderful King. Sisters Hsiao Yu-yin and Chang Yi-hwa are living in Shi-Lou-Tou, Chin-Nan. I heard that their light shone before men; even some unbelievers gave glory to our God because of their works. I heard that Mr. and Mrs Wang Sheng-how live Lin Chun in Chin-Si. There are still a few brothers both within and without the city who are holding on to their jobs. The local meetings are still suspended. The rented house has been returned to the owner, but we can still keep our furnishings there. Recently, there has been a surge of theft. All of the neighbors' houses were broken into, but the belongings of Brother David Hsu and Wang Shu-fa were not touched. No one was guarding them; God was protecting them. Brother Hsie Tze-yuen from Shiao-Shin was here a few days ago. He said that Dr. Ma Ming-huan in Hu-Shu of Hangchow told him that Brother Ruan Feng-tien is setting up a relief center in his school and is seeing good results. He preached the gospel there, and many were saved. Praise the Lord! Brother Ruan Tze-rue has recently been working as a hawker. Brother Chao Tsen-ting left for Shanghai a few days ago. He mentioned that Brother Sun Shao-shan's house in Hangchow was burned. Their whole family is taking refuge in Feng's Girl School.</p><p>Brother Yu Yun-fei, June 12<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tai-Ho, Anhwei Province</h2><p>I received The Open Door promptly. Thank the Lord who loves us and enables us to know of the news of His spiritual work in the midst of all troubles. Enclosed please find stamps worth X dollars for purchase of Rethinking Our Work (The Normal Christian Church Life) and X dollars for the expense of The Open Door. Because I am unskilled in words, I apologize for my inability to communicate the news of our church to the brothers and sisters. Recently, there has been no war in the border regions of Honan, Anhwei, and Shu County. There was an air raid in Shu County with three hundred seventy casualties, but none of God's children were hurt. There were also bombings in Tseng-Yang-Kwan, Ying-Shang County, and Tai-Ho County, but no believer was hurt. The bombing in Fu-Yang was even more devastating; ninety percent of the houses were burned, and no less than eighteen hundred people lost their lives. However, there were no children of God among the dead.</p><p>Brother Ho Chi-chen, July 15<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Sian, Shensi Province</h2><p>I am now in Sian. Because I am a good friend of Brother Chang Tze-yi, the principal of the orphanage, I was able to move myself and my company of people, over thirty in all, into the orphanage. When the people saw the seven hundred orphans and the forty or more staff members meeting every day, worshipping God, and praising the Savior with one mouth, they were all moved. The cold ones were revived, and the unbelievers began to seek after the Lord. Thank the Lord! The Lord's word has greatly prospered in Sian lately. Many evangelists are here. Wounded soldiers, refugees, and wanderers can hear the gospel of the Savior everywhere. Thank and praise the Lord!</p><p>Brother Tsung-kung, July 8</p><h2 class="head2">Tsinan, Shantung Province</h2><p>I received thirty copies of Issue No. 7 of The Open Door. This number is adequate for the brothers and sisters. There are about four or five brothers and sisters who are clear about their salvation. In the near future we hope to have a baptism meeting. We also hope that the Lord would send His workers to come and help us. We heard that Brother Chao Bi-chen has a burden to come. May the Lord release him to come. We can only put this matter into our prayers. May the Lord grant him the grace and give him the guidance. I hope that the brothers and sisters will pray much for the meetings and the saints here.</p><p>Your brothers representing the church in Tsinan,<br />Ren Yi-cheng, Chen Shi-chen, Yu Tsia-chi, June 30<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Yi-Du, Shantung Province</h2><p>Brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>The news in The Open Door brought me up-to-date concerning the whereabouts of the brothers and sisters. I was very comforted. The faithfulness of the brothers and sisters before the Lord renewed my strength. I see God's blessings and the needs in these places through this publication. As I read, I could not help but call on the Lord! Oh, may the blessings and power of God be with the footsteps of the brothers and sisters, and may their footsteps be according to the Lord's leading.</p><p>God has been gracious to us in Yi-Du. We are able to worship Him and remember the Lord at His table. We began having the Lord's table last fall. Now there are about thirty in the meeting. God has done this for His own glory; we have not done any running or striving. We are weaker than others and prone to making mistakes. We need more of the Lord's grace and dealing than those who are in other places. Please remember us weak members in your prayers. Brother Chang Tze-jieh visited us in April and preached for three days. There were over two hundred people in the audience. Thank the Lord that those who were thirsty were satisfied. That day is now closer to us than before. Whenever we consider the expansion of God's work, we feel joyful as well as fearful. We rejoice that many are saved and that God has gained the glory. We fear because we are afraid that our work will not pass through the fire. Greetings in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Lee An-rong<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Wu-Yang, Honan Province</h2><p>This is the first time we have communicated by letter. Since I received The Open Door, my spirit has felt as if we are a group of children gathering around our Father. Recently, some brothers and sisters left because of the political tension. Two missionaries also left for Gi-Kung Mountain. Those who were left could only pray with one accord. Presently, the church functions as normal. The shops are open, and there are many customers. This is a golden opportunity for preaching the gospel. Please pray much for this.</p><p>Shi Nai-en, July 6, in the Gospel Hall</p><h2 class="head2">Hankow, Hupeh Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>On the nineteenth of this month, there were bombings in the three cities around Wuhan, and the casualties rose to over a thousand. It was too gruesome to hear of the condition of the bombed areas and of the dead and the wounded, much less to see. Four bombs were dropped at the place where Brother Hwei-tze was. Fortunately, no one was hurt, and no house was flattened. All the brothers and sisters in Wuhan are well. Please be at peace.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi, July 20</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>The Lord willing, I intend to take the train on the evening of the twenty-third to Ch'ang-sha for the conference. Sister Shuai-shin will be with me. I will only be there for ten days. Please pray for the conference in Ch'ang-sha.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi, July 22</p><h2 class="head2">Yi-Yang, Hunan Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Tsi-yi in the Lord:</p><p>Brother Ma Chuan-foo came yesterday and told me that you are concerned about our recent condition. Let me relate it to you in the following way. There were over fifty brothers and sisters from Fu-Yang. After we arrived in Lan-Si, we had to take refuge at a relief center. There was no liberty to move around in the relief shelter, and it was not convenient to preach the Lord Jesus in public. During the month that I stayed in the relief center, I always prayed that the Lord would give us the chance to preach the gospel to individuals and to the refugee children at least. Thank the Lord. He allowed me to preach the gospel to the presiding Buddhist monk and some of the refugees. I was able to teach for two weeks at the refugee school and tell them Old Testament stories and the salvation of the cross, including one short hymn.</p><p>But there were still inconveniences at the relief center. On June 22 I took my family of six and left Lan-Si. The old and weak were not used to traveling and became sick. We rested a few times on the way. On July 2 we arrived at Yi-Yang. Now we are living in Brother Chang Gung-jih's house. Praise the Lord, all six members of my family have been healed. The Lord's grace is sufficient for us.</p><p>We ask for your prayer concerning two things: (1) Prolonged traveling has tired me out. I find that I cannot sustain myself in writing and reading, and my eyesight is failing. I wonder how I can continue to serve the Lord this way. (2) Pray that the brothers and sisters taking refuge in Lan-Si would soon find a safe place where they can support themselves and worship God. The prayer meeting, gospel meeting, and Bible study meetings have begun here. There are more brothers and sisters. Some of them will go to Ch'ang-sha for the conference (Brother Tang will be conducting the conference). Please do not forget to pray. Greetings in the Lord!</p><p>Brother Yu Yien-chuan, July 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Chungking, Szechuan Province</h2><p>Sister Ma Tsi-ying and Sister Tang from Hankow are presently staying in my place (July 13). Brother Lee Shi-chun, Brothers Chung and Ping, Sister Yuen Jing-hwa, Mrs. Wang (Aunt of Sun Wen-sian) and the children, and Miss Kuo have arrived in Chungking. The brothers are living in the inns, while the sisters are living in the rented house of the local church in Lo-Tsia-Wan. Sister Ma Min-jen is sicker; she is staying in Yi-Chang but will come to Chungking soon (July 19). Seven members of the Mei family arrived this morning at eleven o'clock. After lunch at my place, they moved to Lo-Tsia-Wan. My husband's company will move here in two weeks (July 20).</p><p>Sister Jie (wife of Yuen How-tsai,<br />Chungking, Szechuen)</p><h2 class="head2">Swatow</h2><p>Swatow has been bombed quite frequently of late. Most of the brothers and sisters have scattered to inland regions to escape the war. The Lord's Day before last, we still had our meeting, but the number was very small. There were only ten persons in the bread-breaking meeting. Yesterday was the Lord's Day, and we had to abandon the meetings. Presently, the brothers and sisters scattered in the inland regions are trying to help each other. Temporarily, they are still able to get by. If the condition continues, some brothers and sisters may be in difficulty soon. A few families have moved to Jing-Gang Village near Jieh-Yang. Brother Chia Tze-shun is also there. The rest of the brothers and sisters returned to their hometowns or are staying with relatives. Brother Chai Gi-chen has moved back to his village, and we do not have his address. This is the general condition of Swatow. We do not know what will happen in the future. May the Lord be merciful to us and care for us. Please remember the brothers and sisters remaining in Swatow and those who have been scattered.</p><p>Brother Chen Fang-ching, July 4<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Changchow, Fukien Province</h2><p>The brothers and sisters in Changchow have scattered all over the inland regions because of the war. Brothers Deng Tsu-chin, Chen Jin-chuen, and Chang Li-jin are in Lung-Yen. Brother Chen Wen-zhang, Sister Tseng Bi-lien, and Brother Kuo Shu-fan are in Hwa-An County. Brother Dai Jen-tsia is in Chang-Tai County. Praise the Lord that He has preserved us in peace. The denomination in Hwa-An often invites the brothers to preach. The pastor of the denomination is quite humble, and he has invited Brothers Chang Tung-yuen and Han Jin-siu to conduct conferences there. We see the reality of the open door. May the Lord's truth spread during this time, may the church be built, and may the Lord's name be glorified, amen. I have written this letter to ease the concern of those brothers and sisters who know us. Please pray for us.</p><p>Brother Kuo Shu-fan, June 23<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Pu-Tien, Fukien Province</h2><p>Recently Brother Chen Ke-san received a letter from Brother Chou Tsung-hwei, telling of Mr. and Mrs. Lu Hua-seng, who were living in their relatives' homes. One day the house was bombed, and the unbelievers in the house were killed. But these two were preserved. A few months ago, the city of Changchow was bombed. One brother was in the middle of the bombing. When the dust settled down, some people had been killed right next to him. All of this proves God's wonderful provision for His children. We cannot help but say, "Hallelujah, Praise the Lord!" Most of the brothers and sisters in Ding-Wei have moved to inland regions; only a few poor believers remain. Sui-Tou was also bombed. The meetings there have stopped, and the brothers and sisters are scattered in the inland regions. Other places like An-Hai, Shi-Shee, Chuenchow, Tseng-Mao, and Tung-Yuen are meeting as usual. The brothers and sisters are all safe. The meetings in Fu-Ching, Pu-Tien, and Shien-You have not stopped, and the saints are safe. Nevertheless, all the brothers and sisters in the south and middle part of Fukien still need your prayer.</p><p>Brother Chai Tse-chung, June 28<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tien-Sui, Kansu Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear co-worker Sister Peace Wang:</p><p>By the Lord's grace, I was happy to see you and Brother Witness Lee in Sian last year.

Although we have learned many lessons, He has commissioned us to do some work. We have over ten co-workers in all. Three of them are engaged in medical work, while the others are strictly working on evangelism. We are all blessed. About fifty people have been saved during the past three months, and over ten village churches have been raised up. At present we are erecting a church building in Living Stone Village, where Brother Ji is. We have much work here, but the workers are few. We hope and pray that God would send some who would deny themselves to co-work with us. Greetings.

We are sympathetic to their cause in the preaching of the gospel. May the Lord bless them. Perhaps they have not seen what we have seen concerning the establishment of the local church, the work and the church, and the apostles and the elders. We hope that Brothers Gung, Ji, and Duan would search the Scriptures carefully so that the work would belong to the work and the church would belong to the church.

I am from Kweichow and have been saved for many years. Thank the Lord that I moved to Hong Kong from Swatow last year and was brought by one sister to meet at Changshawan for about a year. I have received many blessings from the Lord since then. My husband, Mr. Chiang Chi-dang, was very sick this spring, and no medicine was effective. He almost died. I asked  senior Mrs. Nee to come, preach to him, and pray for him. He repented and received the Lord and was healed. Glory to His name. Some of my family, that is, my brother's family and my sisters, are still in Chungking. Please visit them when you have time and tell them about the truth of salvation.

Thank the Lord for His grace! The Lord cares for the lives of every one of His children and counts them as precious. May we not care for our own life or count it as precious.

I have also testified a little for the Lord. Presently, one brother and I go out on Saturday and the Lord's Day to do some personal evangelistic work. The opportunity is great. Sister Hwang Bi-gwe came and preached for a few days at the Methodist Church. Afterwards she went to Si-Li-Jie, Ku-Lu-Pu, and Ma-Lo-Ge-Po and is now in Cebu. Last Wednesday I received a letter from her saying that she will be preaching in provinces around Jia-Yi-Jia-Na-Yeh. There are over ten brothers and sisters in Sarawak who are on the same way.

O. Box 84, Hankow, September 1938</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">Footsteps of Brothers Hu and Hsu,<br />Yunnan Province,<br />Having Returned from Li-Suh to Yeh-Ji and<br />en Route to Areas around Gung-Shan County</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Respected Brother Kwang-hsi:</p><p>The Lord bless you and your family with grace and peace! The work in K'un-ming has truly comforted us. May the Lord multiply your strength. We are always praying for this. Yesterday (June 26), Brother Hsu Jung-jieh and I returned from evangelistic work in Tuo-Bah-Oh, Zha-Tze-Oh, Yen-Wah-Loh, etc. Although our bodies are tired from traveling, our hearts are rejoicing greatly. I have worked in these places before. The ones who came to listen to me were baptized, but none of them dared to admit that they were saved. When Brother Hsu spoke, I interpreted for him, which took a long time. Thank the Lord that it all went very smoothly. The listeners were all very quiet. These people were once very impatient and could never keep any order. I know that we accomplished God's will this time because when we returned, we were filled with joy. According to Brother Hsu, their meetings are all according to the principle of the local church.</p><p>Brother Hsu and I sent men to borrow a gas lamp and a barrel of gas from the Wei-Si Assembly of God Church. This is for use in gospel work near Lu River and Cha-Wa-Rong, because most of our work is conducted in the evening. We very much need a gas lamp, gas, and an accordion. The one who borrowed the lamp will be here in eight days. By then we will have to go on further. Our itinerary is not limited by time; we just want to move as the Lord leads. We do not know when we will return home. Because of the Lord's grace and the love of the brothers and sisters, the storm has been quelled, and everywhere we have peace. The only way we can advance is through the Lu River. There are a few thousand people who have been baptized but do not know what it means to be saved. If we do not give them the truth of salvation and the church, we will be like those who cross oceans and lands to lure some into their religion, making them sons of hell. Hence, this is the first thing that God has charged us to do. We will inform you as to our plans later. May the Lord grant you rich power and gifts, amen. Give our greetings to all the brothers and sisters in K'un-ming!</p><p>Brother Hu Yi-min, June 27</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>My Brother Kwang-hsi:</p><p>On the fifteenth of this month, Brother Hu and I set out to preach the gospel in Li-Suh. We went to three places, all of which were former fields of Brother Hu. The Li-Suh believers were brought to the Lord by Brother Hu. Originally, both Brother Hu and I were reluctant to preach in these places for fear that we would be accused of stealing others' sheep. Later, he felt that he should testify to them of his former mistakes and his future way. I felt that it was right to preach the gospel to those places which previously had not heard the true gospel. As a result I agreed to walk with Brother Hu. Getting to those places from Yeh-Ji is, at most, a two-day journey; it takes one day to get to the nearest place. These three places are (1) Tuo-Ba-Oh, (2) Zha-Tze-Oh, and (3) Wah-Shi-Loh Street. There were six to seven hundred people baptized in these areas in the past. After Brother Hu left for Shanghai, many of them became backslidden, and now there are only about two hundred left. Some of them (not too many) are saved, but they do not know anything about the truth. Most of them are not even regenerated.</p><p>The natives of Li-Suh mostly live in the mountains, in places that are very inaccessible. Most of them are scattered. In some cases a dozen or so families cluster together, while in other cases, a whole hamlet consists of only one family. Most of their houses are built along the slopes, in the clefts of the rocks, or by the mountain gullies. The houses are made of wood and are called Mu-Leng-Tze, which hold at most five or six people. Except for work, the dwellers spend all four seasons of the year in the house around a fire. For their beds they spread two or three wooden planks on the floor. During the day most of them are out of the house. When the sun goes down, they come home to sleep. Our gospel preaching is conducted mostly in the evening because they have no other free time. Most of the unbelievers among the natives like to drink and are in heavy debt. The Han Chinese induce them to drink wine, and then strip them of their possessions, land, and properties. Most of the Li-Suh natives labor day in and day out. There are only two months out of a year when they have some better days. The rest of the time they cannot even make enough to fill themselves. What a pity! Recently the Lord's word has spread among them, and many Li-Suh natives have turned to the Lord. As a result they abhor alcohol as much as snakes and do their best to remove this abuse. The Li-Suh culture does not consider fornication to be sin. For this reason fornication is very common. Of course, the believers are not like the others; they have advanced greatly. Since the Han merchants realize that believers do not drink, which takes away their source of profit, they have a deep hatred for preachers. However, they can do nothing about it. May the Lord grant them much grace and save their souls from sins so that these Li-Suh people can receive the benefit in their spirit, soul, and body. When the Lord's light shines on them, they will turn to Him through the testimonies among them. Of course, the responsibility is on our shoulders. May the Lord make us faithful to the end, and may the brothers and sisters pray much for us and share in the work here!</p><p>We spent ten days traveling to three places. The purpose of this trip was to bear a testimony and to survey the situation. Thank the Lord that many people like to hear about God's salvation and the gospel of Christ. Many know that they have eternal life and that the Spirit is in them. Those who are saved desire the truth very much. The nature of their meetings is somewhat local (in the eyes of the local believers). But the X denomination in Yeh-Ji considers this area its parish and extension. This is why we do not stay too long to preach the gospel. In these mountain regions I have observed that some among them do have a brotherly love, which proves that they are saved and have life. The past three to four months (between April and July) have been the most difficult months for them. Sometimes they are unable to even buy any food. When we were among them, they always gave us the best. Although we are by no means well-fed, our hearts are filled with joy. The Lord has enlightened us concerning the work ahead. Both Brother Hu and I are of the same mind.</p><p>Preaching in these areas must be conducted in the evenings. These people cannot even afford kerosene lamps. They use chestnut oil for their lamps. The first need in our work is lamps. (Sikang is also short of oil, more than we are.) It is uneconomical to use candles. Brother Hu and I considered buying a gas lamp and a few cans of gas from K'un-ming and using them here. Please ask about the price of a medium-size gas lamp (the kind that lights up without alcohol), the price of a can of gas, and the price of a hand-held lamp in the stores in K'un-ming.</p><p>If it is of the Lord's will and if He so arranges, Brother Hu and I intend to go to the upper tributary of the Nu River, around Gung-Shan County, and preach the gospel. (This area is at the border of Yunnan and Sikang.) No gospel has been preached to this area yet. According to Brother Hu, the natives of Nu River (an eastern tribe) are much less hungry for the truth than the natives of Li-Suh, yet they are quite aggressive. Brother Hu preached there before. There are about five to six thousand people in this place already, and it is an excellent place to work. May these ones truly belong to the Lord. If the Lord is gracious to us and the gospel spreads from here, we can establish local churches here and stay for a longer time. We need a house for our work. Houses near Nu River are mostly built with bamboo, and we can build three or four of them with thirty to forty Yunnan dollars. Gung-Shan County is also close to Sikang. It would be easier for us to advance into Sikang from here. Presently, Sikang province belongs to the Chinese government in name only. The whole region from the west of Jin-Sha River has been under the jurisdiction of the Tibetan government. A few counties east of Ba-Tong are still under the jurisdiction of the Szechuan government. Any Han Chinese entering the areas under Tibetan jurisdiction must first have their papers examined and checked. They consider Han Chinese the same as Westerners. This is one of the reasons there are still no Westerners preaching the gospel in Sikang; there are too many difficulties involved. May the Lord grant us mercy and grace and open the door of preaching so that we can preach His gospel and advance into Tibet. Please pray for us. We will report the details of the work to you later. Peace.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, June 27</p><h2 class="head2">A Trip to Mong-Tze and Shi-Ping, Yunnan</h2><p>When I arrived in Mong-Tze, I stayed at an inn. Later, I lodged temporarily in the little house behind Mr. Hsu's residence and ate elsewhere. I tried to preach the gospel a few times on Dah-Jin Street. A few friends were saved. This was truly the Lord's own work. I also did some edifying work for the brothers and sisters by preaching the message "Who Is Jesus?" It seems that I can only lift up Christ and attract many to Him. Christ has to gain them first before more can be done. I also met two brothers and a few friends in the Southwest United University and have given some of them my personal testimony. This morning, I plan to go to Shi-Ping because Brother Lin has written to me again.</p><p>Brother Chen Hsi-wen, July 11</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Witness Lee</h2><p>I should have left for Tientsin already.

The Lord willing, I will be going to Tientsin tomorrow and then to Peking. In every place I will stay for about half a month. During the recent months, the Lord has given me new leading concerning the gospel work in north China and in northwest China. It seems that the confirmation is becoming stronger. Thank the Lord! He is also turning much of my attention to the truth concerning the kingdom. I can only acknowledge my unworthiness in the face of all these needs. May the Lord supply us more and release us more!

May we accomplish the last part of His plan while we still have a little light. Whenever I read The Open Door and see how the Lord has worked through a few co-workers, I cannot help but give much thanks for the fresh fruit borne in the many inland provinces through our brothers. Hallelujah. In Chekiang to the south of the Yangtze River, the roads are very damaged, which causes much trouble in traveling. But most of the places are still meeting and preaching the gospel. A few of the local churches around Ning-Hai are somewhat revived. For example, we see much of God's work in Shen-Chen and Hai-You. There has been a meeting raised up near San-Men Bay also. When we see the newly saved ones, we rejoice and praise loudly for the great lovingkindness of the Father! Brother Lou Chuan-en and his family have now come to live in Ning-Hai. The Lord has used him to lead the brothers on. Beginning August 4, we will have a conference in Ning-Hai. We hope that Brother Lou will be responsible for this conference. I promised to visit Tai-Shun and Wen-Ling, but I cannot fulfill my promise because of the inaccessibility of the roads. The Lord willing, I will go to Wu-Yih in the fall. As far as my personal life is concerned, I have been very dry and thirsty. I very much wish that Jesus Christ, the source of life, would fill my heart so that I will only be satisfied with Him and not have merely a doctrine of the filling of the Spirit. This is all I will write for now. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>A weak brother in the Lord, Hwa Shi-bin, July 16</p><h2 class="head2">Conferences in Hunan and Wuhan</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>God has brought us through in our work in Ch'ang-sha. First we had seven days of meetings in Yi-Shing Girls' School. This was followed by three days of meetings in Brother Yun's house. All the success goes to the Lord, and all the failures are mine. May the Lord preserve His own work. I intended to go to Szechuan after the conference in Ch'ang-sha, but at the persistent invitation of the brothers and sisters in Hankow, I came to Hankow on the fourth by public bus. We started a conference today. We do not know how many days we can continue meeting; everything depends on the political situation.</p><p>Tang Shou-ling, Hankow, August 7</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I left Shanghai on July 26. Under the Lord's guidance, I arrived safely in Ch'ang-sha on the afternoon of August 4. Along the way I saw the Lord's wonderful and gracious leading. I could not help but be filled with thanksgiving and praise. Many brothers and sisters have left Ch'ang-sha because of the change in the political situation. But hungry, seeking sisters are still waiting to meet with us here. We have scheduled a conference to begin on the eighth of this month. There will be two sessions each day. The length of the conference will depend on God's leading and the provisions in the environment. We can only say that we will have it as long as we can.</p><p>Sister Tso Fu-ru, Ch'ang-sha, August 6</p><h2 class="head2">Recent Work in Chungking</h2><p>We preached the gospel for four evenings and then conducted a three-day study on the truth of salvation. All were under the Lord's blessing. All the brothers and sisters strove in oneness in prayer, and the outcome was good. In the next few days, we will schedule a baptism. (According to a letter from Chungking on August 11, twenty-four brothers and sisters were baptized on the seventh&mdash;Editor.) The weather in Chungking is tolerable. Some have said that this is the first summer in forty years which has not been that hot. This is also God's grace. I received a letter from my own brother some time ago saying that the Lord rescued him from great danger. Thank and praise the Lord. The brothers and sisters are all safe. Beginning next Tuesday, we will have a Bible study meeting every Tuesday at Brother Chang Tsing-yu's home. I have agreed to be responsible for this meeting while I stay here.</p><p>Brother Chang Yu-zhi, Chungking, August 4</p><h2 class="head2">Work in South Fukien</h2><p>Dear brothers in the Lord:</p><p>...I went to Zhuang-Shan in An-Hsi this time. It so happened that it was harvest time, and people were busy. As a result I was able only to have a four-day conference. They hope to start the Lord's table in the near future. Presently, Brother Chang Tung-yuen is working there. Please put him in your prayer. I did not go to the meeting in Ban-Ling, Wu-Keng because of the political unrest there. Presently, Brother Wang You-yi is still there. Please remember them in your prayer. Thank the Lord that Du, Nan-An, has raised up a brother, Brother Hung Deng-an. Now there is a gospel meeting every Lord's Day at his house. May the Lord also raise up some brothers from Du. There is only one sister who loves the Lord; she is living there with her family; the rest are all gospel friends. Some believers who met in Chuenchow have moved to Du, Nan-An, and every Lord's Day they have gospel meetings there. May the Lord raise up His testimony in that place also.</p><p>Brother Han Jin-siu</p><h2 class="head1">WHEREABOUTS OF THE CO-WORKERS</h2><p>(1) Brother Tang Shou-ling went to Szechuan by steamboat after his conference in Hankow.</p><p>(2) Brother Han Fu-shen returned to Chang-Deh.

Please direct it as the Lord leads. May the Lord bless this little offering. May the grace and love of the Father be with you all the time. May the Lord bless and grace your work.</p><p>Brother Wang Bao-guang, July 9<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Lung-Ju-Tsai, Shensi Province</h2><p>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>During the past few years I have been working around Kansu and Tsinghai provinces. The Lord has been very gracious to me, and there is nothing I can say except to thank Him with full satisfaction. Two years ago I left the interior of Tsinghai and went to the area around Liang-Chow in Kansu province and have frequently witnessed the Lord's wonderful power. Last May I arrived at Lan-chou from Liang-Chow, and from there I went to south Kansu. I spent about a year in south Kansu. In April of this year, the Lord directed me to come to Shensi. Unfortunately, I am not that useful; my faith is not that strong, my love is cold, and my spiritual condition is dry. What a pity. Please pray for me.</p><p>Yet I treasure all the brothers and sisters I see along the way. I went to Sian on June 6 of the Chinese calendar. The Lord has been protecting me all the way, and I am safe. The meetings in all these places are under the Lord's blessing, and we thank the Lord for this! While I was in Sian, I read The Open Door and received all the news. It has indeed refreshed my heart. Please send me two copies of The Open Door from now on. If possible I would like to have back issues starting with Issue No. 3. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Hu Tien-en, June 28 of the Chinese calendar<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(This brother is the co-worker of Duan Chai-ju. Thank the Lord that a few of them are zealously preaching the gospel in the provinces in Kansu, Tsinghai, and Shensi&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Chuenchow, Fukien Province</h2><p>Thank the Lord. Despite the difficulty in the environment, we have received every issue of The Open Door. The news makes us feel that the Lord's love is ever deepening. Thank the Lord that through Him we can stand in the present grace by faith. In the past He has caused us to look forward to His coming with joy. In tribulation He has caused us to rejoice all the more. He wants our tribulation to beget endurance, our endurance to beget hope, and our hope to not be put to shame. May the Holy Spirit pour out His love in our heart so that we can feel His love and love Him. The brothers and sisters here are all under the Lord's protection and are living peaceably. May glory and praise be to our gracious Lord. We are forwarding X dollars to be used for the expense of The Open Door. Please accept it. In the future please send us thirty copies. There are many brothers and sisters who are scattered in inland regions, and if they ask for it, we can then send them a copy.</p><p>Brothers meeting in Chuenchow,<br />Yang Shi-chao and Wu Ren-jieh, July 16</p><h2 class="head2">Feng-Ting, Fukien Province</h2><p>Thank and praise the Lord. His wonderful grace has come also to Feng-Jiang. We also thank and praise Him for sending Brother Chen Ke-san and Sister Bau Hsu-min to come and edify us. We also thank and praise the Lord that two brothers and sisters were baptized in the meeting hall on June 11. In particular we thank and praise Him that He recovered His table on June 12 so that we can practice fellowship and remember and worship Him. Please pray for the meetings here. May the Lord be merciful to preserve the meeting until His return, amen. July 7 (Thursday) was our regularly scheduled prayer meeting. All the brothers and sisters fasted and prayed. Although the amount we offer is small, the thought behind it is sincere. Please find X dollars sent to you via the post office, and please direct it to brothers and sisters in difficulty.</p><p>Chen Bing-jiu, Keh Chang-chai, and Chen Tuo-sien, July 12</p><h2 class="head2">Wu-Chow, Kwangsi Province</h2><p>Dear Brothers Kwang-hsi and Hsi-wen:</p><p>Through your letters I learned that you preached in Ku-Jiu and Lin-An and were blessed by the Lord. Furthermore, the bread-breaking meeting has started in Ku-Jiu. Thank and praise the Lord that He has enlightened His children and attracted sinners to come under His name. I left for the south on April 14, going through Hanoi, Liang-Shan, and Lung-Chow. From there I traveled by bus to Ch'ang-Wu and arrived here on the twenty-second. Along the way I witnessed the Lord's protection. Thank and praise Him.</p><p>On May 1 (Lord's Day) we began to have the bread-breaking meeting in my home. In addition to myself, Brother Lin Dao-liang (who is a teacher at the Bible school here) comes to join us often. Brother Mu and I have written a letter to Brother Philip Luan inviting him to come and pioneer in Wu-Chow. The Lord willing, this wish will soon be realized. Presently, I am renting an apartment with Brother Mu, which we secured on the day we arrived. There are six rooms (all on the third floor with water and electricity). The sitting room, when opened up, can hold thirty to forty people. The rent is $12.50 plus water and electricity. In considering the world trend, believers all realize that the night is dark and the day is near. We should do our best to testify for the Lord and preach the gospel. During my long travel, I had many opportunities to preach the gospel to individual travelers and to sow gospel seeds. May the Lord water these seeds so that they can grow. I have witnessed to six or seven of my colleagues at work. Most of them are willing to accept without much resistance. I hope that in the future they will solidly receive the Lord's salvation. Yesterday morning Sisters Lin Siu-jieh and Hu Hwei-ying from Shanghai came here via Hong Kong at the recommendation of Brother Luan. The same day they took up jobs at the Nan-ning Railroad Hospital. Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord. Peace to you. The brothers and sisters and Brother Mu charge me to greet you.</p><p>Brother Lin Yau-huei, June 7</p><h2 class="head2">Shu County, Anhwei Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Lan:</p><p>On May 18 my whole family moved into the refugee relief center. Although we passed through danger, the Lord protected us, and we are finally safe. Brother Yuan Lin-shu is in the villages and has visited us twice at the relief center. We are told that the brothers and sisters in the villages are also safe. Brother Chang Yun-siu and his family moved into the second relief center and are also safe. Thank the Lord. Greetings to you in the Lord. All the brothers and sisters send their greetings to you.</p><p>Brother Hwang Tse-hou, July 9</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'ang-sha, Hunan Province</h2><p>According to the newspaper report, fifty thousand people escaped from Ch'ang-sha into the countryside in two days (July 23-24). But thank the Lord that the brothers and sisters were not affected during our conference. Brothers Zhang Gun-jih and Yu Yien-chou from Yi-Yang, and Brother Feng Shian-lu from Chang-Deh have also come. The subject of the conference was "The Glory of Christ." Brother Tang Shou-ling was responsible for giving the messages. We had one tragedy in Ch'ang-sha: Eight hundred people who were escaping to the countryside hired a steamer, and the steamer sank because of being overweight; only six people survived. Indeed, those who do not have God are afraid of death when they do not escape, and face death even sooner when they try to escape. This world is filled with tragedies! We can only ask the Lord to come quickly and to terminate these things.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi, Ch'ang-sha, July 26</p><h2 class="head2">Chungking, Szechuan Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>There were four days of gospel meetings from July 27 to 30 at 4-3 Chang's Garden. Although it was hot, many people came. Two rooms were filled, and we added more chairs outside the door. There were over a hundred people within that little place. Thank the Lord, there were twenty to thirty people who raised their hands to receive the Lord, and many put down their names. On August 1 and 3 there will be a new beginners' Bible study. The brothers and sisters are all in one accord this time toward the work of preaching the gospel. We do thank the Lord for this.</p><p>Yuen Chou Jieh-min, August 1</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>This time the Lord has done some special work at the Midwife School. Five girls were baptized. On the seventh of this month, we conducted a baptism using the swimming pool of the YMCA. There were seven brothers and sixteen sisters. We truly thank the Lord! Brother Lee Shi-chun from Hankow has left for Ch'eng-tu already. Mrs. Wang has found a job through the recommendation of Brother Hu Suen-ming. Sisters Ma and Tong are now working and studying at the Ren-Je Hospital through my recommendation. Others are preparing themselves to apply for the schools. Sister Yuen Jing-hwa has gone to Nan-An to work as a private tutor.</p><p>Yuen Chou Jieh-min, August 11</p><h2 class="head2">Luzon, Philippines</h2><p>Enclosed please find X Hong Kong dollars for the following uses: (1) X dollars for the publication of The Christian, (2) X dollars for the publication of The Open Door, and (3) X dollars to each of the workers. (Since there are no workers in Hankow, please direct the money to workers nearby who are in need. Please distribute it according to your discretion, and please retain one portion for yourself.) Eighty percent of this money is from one sister, while the rest is from four brothers. Please notify us when you have received the money.

The trip to Szechuan will have to be cancelled temporarily."</p><p>(8) According to a letter sent by Brother Kuo Bu-yueh to Lan Tsi-yi, he felt clear to go through Hong Kong and Shanghai and to return north to Chefoo.

The Lord's servant, Brother Tang Shou-ling, spoke on the subject of "The Glory of Christ." The result was good. Many brothers and sisters were revived in life and had a turn. Thank the Lord. Beginning August 8 there was a sisters' conference on the subject of "The Will of God." There were two meetings every day. What was released met the real need of the sisters in Ch'ang-sha. May the Lord bless these messages. Sister Tso's footsteps have not been decided yet. She has moved into a sister's house. Mail can be directed to the meeting hall.</p><p>Brothers Yang Dai and Kuo Jen-yung, August 12</p><h2 class="head1">THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE SAINTS<br />IN HANKOW, HUNAN, AND CH'ANG-SHA</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">A FEW REMINDERS</h2><p>(1) Whenever a brother or sister changes his or her address, please inform us of the new address in detail, as well as his or her condition, so that we can publish them in this paper. This will relieve the concern of many.</p><p>(2) Many local churches are meeting in the homes of the saints. Saints who arrive in a new locality can look up the address of any brother or sister in that city listed in this paper, and can find the meeting place accordingly.</p><p>(3) If the brothers and sisters move to a locality without a meeting, they should meet by themselves, even if there are only two or three, because the Scripture says, "Not abandoning our own assembling together...but exhorting one another; and so much the more as you see the day drawing near" (Heb. 10:25). The Lord Himself promised that "where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst" (Matt. 18:20). We also hope that wherever the footsteps of our brothers and sisters are, the opportunity for men to hear the gospel is also present.</p><p>(4) If brothers or sisters want this paper mailed directly to them, please write to us. Otherwise, please receive your copy from your local church.</p><p>(5) Of the co-workers and local churches that we know of, none have solicited relief funds or raised money for the need of the work or the local churches. We wish to maintain the same nature by the grace of the Lord.</p><p>(6) At this critical hour we need to practice the words of Hebrews 13:1-3: "Let brotherly love continue.

We have hurriedly typeset Issue No. 11, hoping that the Lord would give us the grace to send this issue out from Hankow as well. We have not moved to another city, because Hankow is most centrally located. The co-workers in Hankow are fulfilling their ministry under all kinds of dangers. If not for the grace of the Lord, we would have spent all our time in fear, and there would not have been any time for work. The political situation is changing unpredictably. If Hankow becomes blocked, we will move back to Shanghai. The Lord willing, I hope to pass through Szechuan, Kweichow, Yunnan, Kwangsi, and then to Shanghai via Hong Kong. Brother Lan Tsi-yi's itinerary is still uncertain, and we can only move on according to the Lord's grace. Presently, we dare not make any decision.</p><p>Please send the news of the work and the news of the churches to either Hong Kong or Chungking. If you live close to Hankow and the surface mail can be delivered, you can send your letter directly to our P. O. Box in Hankow.</p><p>Brother Hwang Tze-hou has sent us letters from Shu County. But wire transfers of funds are still impossible. We have not received any letters from the brothers in Chou County. I do not know where Brother Chai En-shang of Ho-Tsin in Shansi is. We hold him in remembrance!</p><p>Concerning the relief to brothers and sisters who are in need because of the war, funds from Kiangsu and Chekiang have been under the direction of the few workers in Shanghai during the past months. Funds from Szechuan, Hunan, and Hankow have been dispersed through fellowship between Brother Lan Tsi-yi and myself. Recently, any money that came in was immediately used up, mostly on those with dire problems. Relief work is like putting out fire. Thank the Lord that some brothers and sisters moving into the Szechuan and Hunan areas through Hankow have found ways to take care of themselves. Some are still unsettled. Anyone who tries to walk from Hunan to Szechuan and then to Kansu and Sinkiang needs God's miracles to lead him on. The few of us co-workers always pray for those brothers and sisters in tribulation and in need. Please pray also for us so that we can truly be led by the Holy Spirit and be faithful in the things with which He has entrusted us.</p><p>If you want to send any money, please send it to Mrs. Yuen How-tsai in Chungking, Szechuan. Once Brother Lan Tsi-yi or this magazine has a fixed address, we will inform you.</p><p>At such a critical juncture, this issue is trying its best to publish news concerning the work as well as news concerning the churches. We ask that the local churches try their best to give this magazine to the local brothers and sisters so that they can pray for us. Some places have many brothers and sisters. In addition to announcing this magazine to them, please, if possible, use other means to send them a copy. Some do not pay attention when things are announced, or some may have missed a meeting when an announcement was made. Once I went to a place and asked one sister, "Have you seen Issue No. X?" She said no. I asked, "Is it not true that they are at the meeting hall?" She said she did not know. Actually, after the meeting someone had made an announcement, but the sister who was quite burdened for the magazine still missed it. Needless to say, those who are not as concerned will surely miss it. Some may think that since a person is not concerned about it, we should not give it to him. But I think that some messages can give encouragement to those who are not concerned, and that we should do our best to distribute it to them. The Lord does not forget us, who are always weak and cold; let us not forget those who are also weak and cold.</p><p>I am still in Wan County.

Box 84, Hankow, October 1938</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">Brother Faithful Luk, Singapore</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Brother Philip:</p><p>I received your letter of June 13 and read everything. Two weeks ago I went from Penang to Na-Bang in Thailand and did some work. I did not return until yesterday. After reading your letter I must thank the Lord unceasingly. I cannot help but praise the Lord greatly for the work that He has done through you in Hong Kong! Allow me to say a few words about the meeting in Na-Bang in Thailand. I believe you would like to know about it. Two years ago a servant of the Lord went there to pioneer the work, and some were baptized. They began to break bread every Lord's Day to remember the Lord. The believers were very anxious about being raptured, and they began to wait for His coming at their meetings. In one of the Lord's Day morning meetings recently, they waited from ten o'clock until two o'clock the following afternoon. Evil spirits deceived our brothers, saying, "The rapture is coming. In a few hours you will be raptured. Close your eyes, or else you will become a Laodicean." When night came, no one went home. Instead, they groped their way in the dark from the meeting hall to the courtyard outside the hall and waited the whole night. They fasted for four meals. They were beaten by the wind and the rain at night and scorched by the sun in the day. Although eight or nine of them eventually went home throughout the time, about twenty or thirty people were left, and they did not disperse until two o'clock the following afternoon. The evil spirits, who always try to buffet us or deceive us, were indeed evil. But the Lord is victorious, and He will also preserve us (2 Thes. 3:3). Many left after this episode, and the meeting was almost abandoned. But thank the Lord for His grace. They are now learning to sing Hymns #41, #159, etc. Through the prayer of the brothers and sisters in various places, they are slowly being recovered. However, we still need the desperate prayer of all the brothers and sisters everywhere.</p><p>They have the book The Spiritual Man, and they also purchased seven or eight copies of Rethinking Our Work (The Normal Christian Church Life). Under such conditions, we were still able to baptize seven brothers and sisters into the Lord's death, and some others are waiting to be baptized. We hope that the local meeting can be established and preserved until the Lord comes back. The responsible brothers are Brothers Lei Ming-ching and Lei Ming-shuang. The address is [omitted]. If any experienced co-worker is willing to correspond with them or to help them by sending literature, they will gladly receive it. Most of the people here are from Foochow, and no other denominations are working here. I heard that some time ago there was a Foochow brother who testified in Hong Kong and who later came to Thailand. I do not know his name or address. Please find out who he is and write a letter to him. If he is still working in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, he may be able to give some time to visit the brothers and render them some help. I hope that the Lord establishes His own testimony throughout Thailand. Last week Brother Tang Wen-tze was in Penang and conducted meetings for a week. There may be more meetings next week. Please pray for us. Peace to you all. Greetings to Brother James Chen, Brother Wen-yau, Brother Stephen Kaung, Brother Chu-yien, all the co-worker sisters, and the brothers and sisters meeting in Kowloon!</p><p>Brother Faithful Luk<br />July 7</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Sister Lee:</p><p>Peace to you. We are at peace in Southeast Asia. The weather is always the same. There are two common sayings here: "The whole year it is summer, but one shower of rain turns it into autumn," and "This is an evergreen country, daily bathing in the sun and timely moisture with abundant rain." I have received your letter. May the Lord care for the brothers in all the localities.</p><p>A few days ago I received a letter from Brother Nee in London: "During this time of national tragedy, my concern is the support of the workers....If I would do things like others, I might be able to earn a high income. But we have learned the lesson of the cross. How can we exercise fleshly hands in hope of helping God's faithfulness, while in reality we tear down our own faith?...May the Lord be gracious to us." Opportunities opened up in Penang and Thailand. After I returned to Penang from Thailand, I had another week of meetings, and the Lord gained some people. May the Lord preserve us all the way to the end. Peace be to you. Greetings to Sisters Wang and Chang.</p><p>Faithful Luk, August 1</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Brother Kwang-hsi:</p><p>May you be greatly strengthened and graced! From The Open Door I have realized that you are constantly engaged in outdoor evangelistic work. My heart is greatly comforted by this. We preach the gospel here once, twice, or three times a week. But I would say that what you are doing is the real gospel preaching. I only ask that the Lord would give us more time to pray. If we need one or two hours to prepare in prayer for a message to believers, we need at least three or four hours to prepare ourselves in prayer for a message to unbelievers. If you agree with this, please pray for me. Brother Leland Wang has returned to Hong Kong. Sister Ding is in Sitiawan, and Brother Wilson is here. He meets often at the Gospel Hall and preaches here five or six times. The Lord has used him. Thank the Lord! Peace be to you! Greetings to all the co-workers.</p><p>Brother Faithful Luk, August 12</p><h2 class="head2">Cebu, Malaysia</h2><p>Sister Lee in the Lord:</p><p>The work here has been much blessed, and many people are seeking after the truth. The Lord has moved the heart of Mr. X in the parish, who is now quite sympathetic towards our work. He is reading many of the books from the Gospel Book Room. I have only read half of Rethinking Our Work, but he has read it all. Except for the Lord's work through this person, I would not have been able to stay here. I have practically traveled through this whole place. I still look to the Lord for His leading in the future. Please do not forget to pray for the work, for Mr. X, and for me. I feel very weak and in need of perfection. The Lord willing, I will go to Singapore to receive help from the brothers and sisters. Bible Studies for Beginners is very suitable for our use here. Every time I buy some copies, they are distributed quickly. A month ago a few elderly brothers asked me to help them study the Bible at my sister's home. May the Lord bless this book.</p><p>Sister Hwang Bi-gwe</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Hsu Jung-jieh,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>Dear Sister Ruth in the Lord:</p><p>...I went with Brother Hu to Li-Suh with no other intention than to observe the situation. Thank the Lord that He has shown me some light concerning the future of the work. Both Brother Hu and I have the same leading and have decided to advance to Sikang through the upper tributary of Nu River. The natives around Nu River (a branch of the eastern tribe) are more zealous for the Lord's gospel than the natives of Li-Suh. These natives from the Nu River have invited Brother Hu to work there. (They are also part of the fruit of Brother Hu's former work.) However, we have decided that we will not do anything more than testify among them. We want to go to Gung-Shan County at the upper course of the Nu River and preach the gospel, because the gospel has not reached that part yet. If the Lord grants us the grace, a few local churches will be set up to shine for the Lord, and all the Nu natives in search of the truth will come and turn to the Lord. However, the journey is full of danger, and we need your prayer. In traveling to Li-Suh, we had to cut through wild mountains, shrubs, and forests. The paths are narrow, winding, and difficult to access. Sometimes we have to cross water, and sometimes we have to climb up cliffs with the help of creeping tendrils. Sometimes the rain washes away the roads, and we have to crawl along precipitous cliffs. The danger is great. We heard that the Nu River is more dangerous than the terrain. Whenever I travel along the mountain paths, I think of our Lord seeking for lost sheep. Then my strength is renewed, and I thank the Lord for His great grace. In two or three weeks I will begin the journey with Brother Hu. Part of Sikang province, east of the Jin-Sha River, is under the jurisdiction of Szechuan province. There are altogether eight or nine counties here. The area west of the Jin-Sha River is under the jurisdiction of the Tibetan government. Han Chinese who enter Tibetan land must pass through checkpoints, just as Westerners do. The procedure is quite troublesome. However, Tibetan merchants traveling to Yunnan do not need to pass through checkpoints; there is a great difference. I heard that Han merchants doing business in Tibet do not encounter much trouble. The only kind of people who encounter troubles are those who do not have a job and who carry propaganda materials. Therefore, it is not easy for us to enter Tibet and the Tibetan-ruled Sikang region to preach the gospel there. The Lama religion exercises great influence over this area, and there are obstacles everywhere. We ask that the brothers and sisters pray much for us. Peace to you in the Lord. My greetings to Sisters Wang and Chang.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, July 9</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Witness Lee, Tientsin</h2><p>I arrived safely in Tientsin on the sixteenth of this month. The brothers and sisters are all doing well. Thank the Lord that we have His grace! By the Lord's grace I hope to have a few meetings with the brothers and sisters here and to learn to enter God's great riches through the matter of consecration. The Lord willing, I will be going to Peking on the second of next month, and I will stay there for at least half a month. Then I will see how the Lord leads. Brother Lee Jin-biao has written to me and asked me to go to Sui-Yuan. I am still not clear what the Lord's will is.</p><p>Brother Witness, July 30</p><h2 class="head2">Letter from Chang Tze-jieh, Tsingtao</h2><p>I read Issue No. 9 of The Open Door today. After reading Brother Hsu Jung-jieh's letter, my heart was pressed to obey the Lord willingly and go forward on the one hand, and to fill up the lack of my work in the past on the other hand.</p><p>From my conversation with Brother Witness Lee and from his prayers and letters, I can see that he is burdened for the work of the gospel in the northwest. He is so pressed that words cannot describe his feelings. It seems as if a fire is burning within him....I wish that I could have the opportunity to work together with Brother Witness again for a few days and receive help from him. Presently, I do not ask for power; I only ask that the portion the Lord has assigned to me be fulfilled. Nor do I hope for the work to expand. On the contrary, I am most fearful of falling into the condition of those in Matthew 7:22. I remember reading about God's chosen people being left on the east side of Jordan because some were for the pleasure of the flesh. Although they could help in warfare, receive blessing, and have the altar, they eventually became common. When I read that, I poured out my heart before the Lord and told Him that I was willing to die in the battlefield. I asked the Lord not to allow me to retreat in the heat of the battle or to crave ease and comfort. Oh, there is indeed the need for a people who would bring God to earth. Unless there is such a people, men will not obey God.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Tze-jieh, August 4</p><h2 class="head2">News from a Few Workers in Fukien Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>After Brother Chai completed his work in Yu-Si, he went to Ping-Tan and Su-Ao. Brother Jai-seng said that thirty-five people were baptized in Yu-Si, most of whom had been brought to the Lord through local ones. Praise the Lord! Brother Jai-seng has returned to Han River. The Lord willing, he will travel to villages around Dong-Yuen and Feng-Ji and will be working there. (Feng-Ji is the hometown of Brother Fang Jia-ze.) Sisters Wang Yu-chu and Chen Tien-leh have gone to work in Sien-You. They will also be working in the countryside. Last Lord's Day I met Sister Weigh Kwang-ying at Han River and found out that the Lord's calling has been very strong within her lately. She has decided to quit her tutoring job at Wang's house. May the Lord lead her.</p><p>Recently, I have followed the Lord's limitation and have rested in Him. Because of the lack of strength for further advance, I feel that I should pause a little before the Lord. Thank the Lord for His love and for His willingness to deal with us and trim us. During this period, I read The Spiritual Man again and treasured it very much. I was particularly enlightened and helped by the point about the passivity of the mind. During this week, by the Lord's grace, I studied the Bible with the brothers and sisters every evening. If the Lord is willing and if the co-workers obtain their passports, we will do some work in the upper part of Fukien. Please pray much for us.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Ke-san, August 9</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Thank the Lord! I went out with Brother Chai Tze-chung and worked for about two months and learned many lessons. Presently, Brother Tsai is still working in Ping-Tan and Fu-Ching. May the Lord fill him and use him and gain more glory and men through him, amen. Since the meeting in Fu-Ching moved back to its original location, work has become easier, and the spiritual condition of the saints has improved. Thank the Lord. Glory to Him, amen. Thank Him that the brothers and sisters in Dong-Jang have been baptized and are breaking bread. They are all advancing well. Glory to the Lord, amen. Satan has been doing all kinds of work here and has used some sons of disturbance to falsely accuse Brother Liang (a responsible brother) through an anonymous person (who does not exist), with the intention of destroying the Lord's work. Lord, forgive us and deliver us from the enemy, destroy the counsel of Ahithophel, and turn Balaam's curse into blessing, amen. The brothers and sisters in Yu-Si are very diligent in their pursuit of the Lord. Thank the Lord that the result of the work is good. Although the force of darkness is strong, we can break through it by trusting in our victorious Lord.</p><p>Brother Chen Jai-seng, August 10</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Dear Brother Nee in the Lord:</p><p>During the Overcomer Conference in Chuenchow four years ago, I received much help and have never forgotten it. It is God's leading to put me on the pathway of victory. Since our departure I have visited brothers and testified in Pu-Tien and Han River. I also went to preach the gospel in Yu-Si and Fu-Ching. Later, I worked in Lia River and then returned to Fu-Ching to do some pioneering work. The Lord attracted many to Him through miracles, works of wonders, healings, and the casting out of demons. Some co-workers also went to these places to conduct revival meetings, and many brothers and sisters have turned to obey the Lord, remember Him, build up the churches, and glorify His name. I also did some pioneering work in Dong-Jang, and the Lord came forth in casting out demons and healing the sick and led some to Himself. I was in Tung-An and Kulangsu and in other places. Thank the Lord. Although I cannot do much, the Lord has been gracious! Later, Brother Yeh Shi-jien invited me to do pioneering work in Chang-Pu. The Lord has given me peace in traveling over land and water. Lately I have been continuing my work in Sister Chen Hwang Ren-ai's house in Dun-Bing. There are seven places in Chang-Pu ready for the establishing of churches. Please pray much for this, and please give me instruction as to how to go on. Peace to you in the Lord. Please give my regards to your parents.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Bing-hsi, August 14</p><h2 class="head2">Letter from Chen Chin-fa, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Is the Gospel Book Room in Hankow still in operation? How are the brothers and sisters? I have been thinking of them much. The churches in Yung-Jia, Ping-Yang, Rue-An, and Foo-Ding have been preserved by the Lord and are at peace. But the brothers and sisters are not as spiritually living as before. It seems as if a cold and dry atmosphere has pervaded us. Under this condition, we feel that we are so inadequate in the work and realize that we cannot move anything forward! Perhaps God is testing us and showing us that the result of the work does not depend on activity but on the satisfaction of God's will. As long as it is from God, it is good. Although the internal work with the believers has been somewhat cold, the external work of preaching the gospel has been very blessed. From July 5 to 18, Brothers Chou Da-ching, Lin Chu-chien, Lee Shu-ren, Hwang Deh-en, and a few brothers from Hu-Shan preached the gospel in Chao-Yang-Shan. The result was good. A house has been rented, and meetings have begun. Over twenty people have received the Lord and are coming every Lord's Day to meetings. Presently, the brothers from Hu-Shan are still going there to help them. Hopefully, a proper local church will be established in the near future.</p><p>On July 27 Brother Lee Shu-ren and a few other brothers began preaching the gospel in Tah-Gang and in Bei-Gang. The opportunity was great and many were moved by the word. Many also received the Lord. But we have not started any meetings. May the Lord raise up more workers to go there to reap the ripened harvest. Brothers Chou Da-ching, Lin Zen-wu, Yang Li-ren, Su Ti-shen, and Jin Tze-fang will soon preach the gospel in Fen-Shui-Kwan, Yueh-Hu-Yang. May the Lord be with them in their work. I intend to visit the brothers and sisters in Tai-Shun with Brother Hwang Li-chuan. Then we will go through Tai-Shun to Rue-An, Da-Xue, and Shin-Teng to do some work there. Please pray for this work. Brother Lee Shu-ren intends to bring another brother to preach the gospel in Die-Shi and Wu-Li-Pai, the border region between Ping-Yang and Tai-Shun. Then they will come to work in Ping-Yang, Wenchow, and Wu-Yi through Fu-Ting. Brothers Hsu Dah-wei and Chou Shing-yi will come to Ping-Yang from Shanghai and will stay at the meeting place in Shia-Kwan in Pu-Men-Jen. Brother Chai Chi's health is the same as before. Brother Chuang Kwang-po is very weak. Brother Pan Huo-ling has gone to the Lord.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Chin-fa, August 24</p><h2 class="head2">Work in Ch'ang-sha and Hankow</h2><h2 class="head3">Ch'ang-sha</h2><p>We are on the sixth day of the conference. Probably there will be two or three days more of meetings. Many unsaved ones have come and joined us. The Lord willing, we hope to have two or three days of gospel meetings after this so that we will not owe the unsaved ones anything. Although man is weak and corrupt, God works apart from man and gains men for Himself. I can only praise Him with all my heart.</p><p>Sister Tso Fu-ru,<br />August 13</p><h2 class="head3">Hankow</h2><p>Thank and praise the Lord! He has preserved us and allowed us to meet in peace for a week. The conference ended last night. We studied Revelation in the mornings, and in the evenings we preached the way to love the Lord or the practice of loving the Lord. The attendance in the morning was less, about twenty, than in the evenings, about forty. The brothers and sisters received much help. The day before yesterday three brothers (Lee Jung-ming, Chu Chi-cheng, and Huang Da-gan) were baptized.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi, August 16</p><h2 class="head2">News of Co-workers in Yunnan Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Sister Ruth in the Lord:</p><p>I set out to work in south Yunnan for the second time on August 19. I worked in Mong-Tze for about ten days. If the Lord intends for me to work here, I will need my own place to stay. On the morning of August 29, I took the train to work in Lin-An and lodged at the house of Brother Chou Je-min, the superintendent of the state hospital of Yunnan province. Recently, he has become clear concerning the truth of salvation and has become quite seeking. Another sister, Kuo, who is a nurse, is in the same condition as Brother Chou. Both have been baptized into the name of the Lord recently. The Lord has also opened the door of the gospel in Lin-An. If any brother has a leading from the Lord, it would be wonderful to see him stay here for a few months. I have written a letter to Brother Tsing-yuen. I wonder when the Lord will grant him the leading to go. The saints in Shi-Ping have received much help from the work of Sisters Yu and Lee. Even some sinners were saved. After the sisters finished their work in Shi-Ping, they went on to work in Lin-An for a while. I met them at Mong-Tze. I heard that they have now returned to Shanghai via Hong Kong.</p><p>The church in Ku-Jiu is wavering because of the sickness of one of its leading brothers and because of outside influence. I intend to visit the brothers and sisters in Ku-Jiu after my work here. There is one more brother in Ku-Jiu, Mr. Lin Kwang-hwa (the eldest son of Lin Yau-huei), who is working in the aluminum factory. The church in K'un-ming will move its address to [omitted]. You can find brother Hwang Chung if you go to the meeting hall, because the janitor can lead you to his house. Between Kai-Yuen and Bi-She-Chai Station, there is a place called Dah-Juang Station. Recently, the Lord arranged for a sister, Mrs. Ma, to move there. Her husband indicated that he wanted to believe in the Lord while he was in K'un-ming. (Both of them were Muslims.) I intend to preach the gospel there after I finish my work in Ku-Jiu. Mr. Ma is the general director of Pioneering Farm. He said that he can introduce me to the workers of the farm to preach the gospel to them. Peace to you in the Lord! Greetings to Sisters Chang and Wang and to all the brothers and sisters in Chungking.</p><p>Kwang-hsi, September 1</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>On July 10 Sister Yu and I went to Yi-Liang for a few days. Brother Chang Tsing-yuen was with us. There is only a Pentecostal Church there. We preached the gospel for two days. After returning from Yi-Liang to K'un-ming, we left on July 19 and arrived safely in Shi-Ping on the twentieth. The sisters' meeting began on the twenty-sixth, involving two meetings a day. Sister Yu is responsible for them. There are about twenty sisters here, with over ten who are able to stand for the Lord. Beginning August 5, we will have a few days of gospel meetings. May the Lord gain more people for Himself.</p><p>Sister in the Lord,<br />Rachel Lee, August 3</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>We left Shi-Ping for Lin-An and stayed for half a month; there were ten big evangelistic meetings. Brothers Lin and Chen and Sister Rachel were responsible for the meetings on the first few days. During the last few days, Brother Lin had to return to Shi-Ping, and Brother Chen, Sister Rachel, and myself were responsible for the meetings. We had one gospel meeting every day. During the ten days, many indicated that they wanted to receive the Lord. Brother Chen spoke every morning at the Health Department on the victory of Christ and every evening on the requirement for entering the kingdom.</p><p>Shu-jen, August 24</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>We stayed in Lin-An for two weeks, and the Lord blessed the work. On August 24 Brother Chen and I came to Kai-Yuan from Mong-Tze. There is only one Pentecostal Church here. We have conducted eight meetings so far, including something for believers and something for unbelievers. The meetings are good. Many have become clear about their salvation, and many have risen up to seek after the Lord.</p><p>Rachel, August 29</p><h2 class="head2">Brother Pan Huo-ling Sleeps in the Lord</h2><p>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>You have heard that Brother Pan Huo-ling from our locality had been sick for a long time. We thank all the brothers and sisters in all the localities for praying for him. On the morning of July 28, our brother was called by the Lord and departed from this world! We will arrange for the funeral and cemetery. We should thank and praise the Lord for Brother Pan because he has now been delivered from the sea of sorrow and is in Paradise. But we are grieved at the fact that the church in Kien-Ou has lost the help of a strong arm! In our sorrow we are concerned that the brothers and sisters would not be aware of this news, and thus we are sending this announcement.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Chang Ting-shiang, Chang Gao-lai, and Chang Tsai-kwang<br />on behalf of the brothers in Wenchow</p><p>(Brother Pan Huo-ling was a good brother and a good worker lauded by all the co-workers in Ping-Yang and Wenchow region. His leaving the world to be with the Lord is surely an excellent state for himself but is undoubtedly heartbreaking news among the co-workers! I remember last year when Brother Watchman Nee was in K'un-ming, how the passing away of a certain brother triggered him to recall the fading away of many zealous, faithful, honorable, and loving co-workers during the past eight to nine years, and how grief and sorrow swelled up from within him. I have the same feeling today! Yet God cannot be wrong. On that day we will know His good will.

May He give you peace in the midst of danger, and may the Father manifest His care to His children. By the Father's special grace, the brothers in Ning-Hai are able to meet and preach the gospel as before. We must be thankful for this. Recently, we had a special conference for ten days (August 4 to 14). We saw many new believers coming from various places, praising the Father and the Savior with tears. How our hearts rejoiced at seeing this. Unfortunately, my spiritual life is not deep enough to render them deeper edification. By the Lord's grace, Brother Lou Chuan-en is now rendering some help to the brothers in Ning-Hai. The Lord willing, I will go to Shiang-Shan, Feng-Hwa, or Wu-Yi to do some work there. How we need the prayer of the lovers of the Lord. Enclosed please find X dollars from the offering box in the meeting in Ning-Hai. Please direct it according to the Spirit's leading to the brothers engaged in pioneering work in inland provinces. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Hwa Shi-bin, August 15</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Enclosed please find X dollars. This is an offering from a brother meeting in Ning-Hai. X dollars are for gospel work in remote border provinces, and X dollars are for saints in need. Please distribute it in prayer. Thank you for taking the time to do this. May the Lord remember you.</p><p>Brother Hwa Shi-bin, August 16</p><h2 class="head2">Ning-Po, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Dah-wei in the Lord:</p><p>We are still living in the villages. The brothers and sisters are all under the Lord's protection and are at peace. Please do not worry. Because of my business, I have stayed in the city as well as the villages. Although the environment is not safe, thank the Lord that business can still be carried on. There was even a period when business was quite busy. Everything is by the Lord's grace. Please be at peace. Shi-jie is still working in Hankow. If the situation becomes unstable, he will move to Chungking. Every Lord's Day morning, we have a children's meeting with thirty to forty children. They like to sing and are quite attentive. May the Lord cause seeds to be sown into good ground so that He will receive the glory. We feel that we are empty, weak, and in need of the support of His power and grace. Please pray for us and for the work. One brother who came to know the Lord three years ago was recently revived and has become very seeking. Unfortunately, he has been sick with some kind of tuberculosis for about a year. When I first arrived in the villages, he was very sick. Now he has improved and can stand up. He has joined us in the worship of the Lord four times. Because of his sickness, he has the opportunity to read many books and the Bible, and his spiritual life has advanced quickly. May the Lord heal him quickly. Please pray for him. His name is Chang Peng-ling. Three women have definitely believed in the Lord; they are our neighbors. We thank the Lord for this.</p><p>We feel that the Lord has started His work, and we intend to ask Brother Yu Shung-fei to come and preach the gospel for a few days. May the Lord give him the burden and the opportunity to come. May He save all the people in Shi-Lu-Tou so that He will gain something. Sister Hsiao Yu-yin's nephews and nieces were in Hangchow; she lost contact with them for half a year. Thank the Lord that He has heard our prayer. In May they arrived safely in Shanghai. The elderly Brother Bi wrote that he is doing well in the villages, and he sends greetings to you. The sisters give you their greetings. Greetings to you in the Lord!</p><p>Brother Chang He-nien, July 11</p><h2 class="head2">Lin-Pu, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear Brother David in the Lord:</p><p>I left Ning-Po on June 2 and arrived home on the fourth. On the Lord's Day I gathered some poor, blind, and despised ones, and witnessed the gospel to them. At the invitation of the Yung-Kiang Girls' School in Ting-Shia, I testified to the truth of the gospel at their graduation ceremony. While passing through Si-Kou, I lodged at the True God Chapel. Mrs. Shen (sister of Mrs. Yuen Hou-tsai) and Miss Chang Fan asked me to say something that night. They were still hungry when I left and wanted to have a week of meetings. I promised that I would put this into prayer. I have asked God to grant them grace according to the principle of satisfying the hungry. While I was praying this morning, it seemed that He wanted me to convey this need to you. May the Lord commission His own servant, amen. I intend to go to Shao-Shing at the end of this month. I heard that there will be a conference in Ning-Hai at the beginning of August. I would like to participate in such a feast. The school holiday will be over by the end of August. We are all safe. Please do not worry. Greetings to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Yu Yun-fei, July 12</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Fei Chang-bau, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Philip in the Lord:</p><p>From Issue No. 8 of The Open Door, I learned that you have recuperated from your sickness. Thank God for His great grace. Although I am separated from you in body, my heart has been constantly in fellowship with you before the Lord, and I often have mentioned your name and prayed for you before God.</p><p>Four years ago God revived His own work in the churches in Nan-Sha. The churches which long had been dormant have had a big turn. We can only thank and praise the Lord with all our hearts. I see that God is raising up a group of workers in Nan-Sha for the building up of Christ's Body. There are now seven places with the Lord's table, and three other places are about to begin. Recently, God raised up a group of gospel preachers to preach the gospel in the mountain villages around Shao-Shing. God has started His work. The door of preaching is now open, and soon churches will be established. Brother Shan Kai-fen often comes to help us. Although the political situation is tense, God has given us peace under His wings. God has shown me that if a servant of God is humble before God and men, God will continually use him. But if he becomes proud, he will immediately be set aside. David and Saul can be examples to us. When a church is in one accord, it will be revived. Throughout history there have always been two groups of people in the church. There are the fleshly ones and the spiritual ones. The fleshly ones always persecute the spiritual ones. But God's sovereignty always turns things to the benefit of the spiritual ones. The fleshly ones continually persecute the spiritual ones so that the self of the spiritual ones will die. God will deal with the fleshly ones and will save the spiritual ones. May we pray for each other before the Lord so that His plan will soon be fulfilled. May the Lord be with us until He returns, amen. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Fei Chang-bau, July 11</p><h2 class="head2">Shanghai</h2><p>...Presently, there are no workers here. Brother Yu Cheng-hwa and others do not have the burden. As a result, the meeting that is on the line of the work (i.e., the Lord's Day morning meeting) was stopped temporarily. Thank the Lord! He has shown us that there is a difference between the church and the work and has taught us to obey this truth. According to the Lord's arrangement, we have no more meetings on the line of the work. But all the meetings of the local church continue as usual. Although most of the brothers and sisters are unaccustomed to this practice, we cannot easily invite people to preach, because we have to care for the Lord's work. Nevertheless, we feel that the brothers and sisters in Shanghai have been overfed. We would rather allow them to go hungry for a while. When they feel the need again, our Lord will surely provide....</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Yu Cheng-hwa, Wu You-an, Du Tsong-chen, Lin Kwang-biao<br />August 28</p><p>Please give our regards to Sisters Wang and Chang, Brother Chang Yu-zhi, and Mr. and Mrs. Yuen.</p><h2 class="head2">Yi-Yang, Hunan Province</h2><p>I received your two letters. I am concentrating on the work for the Lord and have no clear assurance yet. In the near future, I will have to find some way to support myself and wait on God's leading through a job. Over thirty brothers who fled from the war in Chekiang arrived here safely. They are now being accommodated at the Yi-Yang Relief Center. Please pray for them until, as you hoped, they no longer have a need to be supported by others and are self-sufficient. Peace to you in the Lord!</p><p>Brother Yu Yien-chuan, August 15</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'eng-tu, Szechuan Province</h2><p>Dear Sister Ruth in the Lord:</p><p>I heard that Sisters Chang and Wang have arrived in Chungking and will soon go to Kuei-yang. May the Lord bless your future. When I was in San-Tai, I met a British missionary in a Friends Church. She told me that the Friends Church does not emphasize outward formalities but inner light and that baptism and the breaking of bread are unnecessary. I showed her the meaning of baptism and the breaking of bread from the Bible. She accepted the truth concerning the breaking of bread but was still in doubt about baptism. The next day I went to her again, and she gathered a few to listen to me. I was led by the Spirit to speak boldly concerning the truth of the church. Thank the Lord that they were all very attentive. On the third day in their fellowship meeting, we studied a few passages concerning fellowship with God. The Lord was indeed with us, and they were all willing to receive the word quietly. This is the Lord's doing. May all the glory go to Him. Meetings here are as usual. (On the Lord's Day morning from nine to eleven, we have the fellowship meeting; in the evening from seven to eight-thirty, we have the bread-breaking meeting. On Saturday evening we have a Bible study meeting at Mrs. Shen's house starting at six-thirty.) Last Thursday at the prayer meeting, we fasted and prayed from three o'clock until eight o'clock. We may continue this way with the prayer meeting on the coming Thursdays. Thank the Lord that He always blesses the work that He has ordered.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chao Rue-tze, September 7</p><h2 class="head2">Kuei-yang, Kweichow Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Tsi-yi in the Lord:</p><p>Thank the Lord that in the midst of all the hectic activities, I have this opportunity to fellowship with you once again through letters.</p><p>I believe you heard that the Lord brought us to Kuei-yang safely! Because of the lesson we learned last time, we did not move rashly this time. I was concerned about exposing the children to the danger of long-distance travel by bus. The mountain roads are dangerous, and there is always the danger of accidents and robberies. Thank the Lord, He cared for the weak and gave us a full promise: "Your women, children, and all your possessions will come in the way of peace." Indeed, we were safe. Although there were dangerous places along the way, we were at peace. The smoothness of the road was beyond my expectation. It was very difficult to get the tickets from Ch'ang-sha to Kuei-yang. But thank the Lord, a supervisor of the Railway Company, who had been my patient, came to consult with me about his sickness. By chance he told me that he worked at the Railway Company. He secured the necessary tickets for me. I work at the Provincial Hospital. My uncle (Brother Liu Ching-si) has been relocated from Kuei-yang Medical School to the Kweichow Provincial Hospital. Presently, malaria is rife in Kuei-yang, and I also have been assigned to the Provisional Immunization Hospital. There are many patients, and work is busy. More and more people are moving to Kuei-yang. The standard of living has become too high and the houses too few.</p><p>Visitors from out of town can find me at the Provincial Hospital. Peace be to you.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Liu Chu-fei, August 8</p><h2 class="head2">Kweilin, Kwangsi Province</h2><p>Brother Kuo Bu-yue, Sister Lee Tse-tseng, and I arrived safely in Kweilin on August 26. They are staying at the Independent Church, while I am lodging at the house of Sister Chang Tze-ping, who works at the Provincial Library. There are over ten sisters who are in fellowship with us. The people of Kweilin are simple, and their standard of living is not too high. The roads are clean, and the air is fresh. The city is surrounded by mountains, and the weather is fine. The people are quite receptive to religion. It takes a two-day journey by car to go from here to Nan-ning. Transportation is easy. We heard that there will soon be trains from here to there. There are four denominations in this city: the Independent Church, the Baptist Church, the Anglican Church, and the Methodist Church. If some will come and work in this place, there should not be too many obstacles. However, housing is difficult. I need a period of rest, and I am looking for houses.</p><p>Sister Tso Fu-ru, August 31</p><h2 class="head2">Lung-Ju-Tsai, Shensi Province</h2><p>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>I left Sian and traveled through the churches in Shing-Ping, Shang-Jen, Mei County, Kwei-Ya-Jen, and Sin-Chuang and met many brothers and sisters. Although they live in remote and inaccessible mountain regions, they love the Lord very much, and I was very touched. I spent two weeks on the road and then returned to Sian. I stayed in Sian for a week, going to the houses of the believers and fellowshipping with them. This has reaped much benefit for me. On July 16 I went from Sian to Shang-Chow Union. I stayed there for five or six days and conducted meetings every morning, afternoon, and evening. They all witnessed the Lord's blessing. On the twenty-second I came to the church in Lung-Ju-Tsai. Let me relate a little concerning the condition among the Tsinghai natives of this inland region. Four years ago the Lord led me into the inland regions of Tsinghai to preach the gospel to the natives. I was born in Honan, and prior to this, I had never traveled far. In 1932 the Lord directed Brother Duan Chai-ju and myself to go to Tsinghai. We set out on September 11, 1932, from Shantung and walked by foot to the west through the provinces of Hopeh, Honan, Shansi, Shensi, and Kansu. In 1934 the Lord led us into Tsinghai and the western part of Tsinghai to preach the gospel to the natives. The interior of Tsinghai province is inhabited exclusively by nomadic tribesmen. Their cultures and habits are vastly different from ours, the Han Chinese. I spent about a year in Tsinghai and cannot enumerate all the benefits and help I received through my stay.</p><p>It has been almost seven years since I was commissioned by the Lord to preach the gospel. Everywhere we went, we saw the Lord's power, glory, and wonderful work. When I consider all these things, my heart is filled with joy. Hallelujah. Praise our precious Lord Jesus! I will probably not be able to stay here for long. Later, I will go west again. The meetings here will begin September 1. I ask the brothers and sisters in the Lord to pray much for me. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Hu Tien-en, August 24</p><h2 class="head2">Gao-Mi, Shantung Province</h2><p>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>In April, I related the condition here to you briefly. I trust that you have remembered us in your prayer. There has not been much progress within the past few months. We do not know how to obey and how to deny ourselves. There is still much need for your prayer. Presently, we have Bible study meetings on Monday and Wednesday. We are studying the truth concerning the church. On Friday we have a prayer meeting, and on the Lord's Day we hope to start a bread-breaking meeting. There are many difficulties, and we are still praying. In everything we are learning.</p><p>We only have a little spark within our heart, and the enemy is already becoming indignant. He is attacking us from all sides through small matters. Please remember the church in Gao-Mi and your weak brother often. In April Brother Chang Tze-jieh had some meetings in Gao-Mi, and one brother was saved. His condition is very good now, but we still need much edification. Brother Witness Lee may come later. We can only ask the Lord of the harvest to send His laborers to come quickly and to accomplish His work so that His name may receive much glory. May the Lord's grace abound.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Wang Shu-ge and Hu Shen-fu, August 15</p><h2 class="head2">Foochow</h2><p>The various places in Fukien are at peace, except Foochow, which experiences occasional air raids. There was a large-scale air bombing in the city the day before yesterday. All of the neighboring houses were destroyed. Our house was shaken and slightly damaged, but on the whole, it was preserved. From this we see the Lord's care of His people. He is worthy to be praised! We have moved into Chang-Chien-Shan. If there are no further changes in Foochow, we will remain. If we move, we will inform you. All the brothers and sisters in Foochow are well. Some have moved to the upper regions in the rural areas. The Lord has brought the gospel to the remote regions through these tribulations. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in Chungking.</p><p>Brother Hsu Shiao-hwa<br />with Sisters Hsu Shiao-keng and Hsu Shiao-fang, July 14</p><h2 class="head2">Swatow</h2><p>Enclosed please find X dollars. Please use it for the Lord's work and for the brothers and sisters in difficulty. Everything is calm. All the Christians are preserved and at peace in the Lord. Please do not worry, but do not forget to ask the Lord to preserve us in prayer, amen.</p><p>Brothers Chai Gi-chen, Hsie Tse-shun, and Chen Fang-ching</p><p>August 29</p><h2 class="head2">Taishan, Kwangtung Province</h2><p>Honorable Brother Lan in the Lord:</p><p>The Lord has led Brothers Philip Luan and Chen Ju-yien here to Taishan. In the near future we will have gospel meetings and Bible study meetings. They are still praying as to how long they will work here. Brother Luan's health has been weak. However, since his arrival in Taishan, he has felt quite comfortable. The Lord willing, he may rest quietly in Taishan for a while before visiting the brothers and sisters in Kwangsi. Peace to you.</p><p>Brothers Chai Zhi-yun and Hsu Bo-ying, August 18</p><h2 class="head2">Hong Kong</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Brother Tsi-yi in the Lord:</p><p>A meeting place for the church is a problem. The landlord decided to take back his house, and we were forced to move out. Thank and praise God that He prepared a place for us. On August 1 we moved to 39 Shek-Kip-Mei Street, Second Floor. In the future any news of the churches and any correspondence between the brothers and sisters should be directed to Hong Kong, P. O. Box 1664. The work here goes on as usual: On Tuesday night we preach the gospel, on Wednesday night we have a Bible study, on Friday night we have our prayer meeting, on Saturday we have a perfecting meeting, and on the Lord's Day morning we preach the gospel. Recently in Emmanuel Bookroom, we had meetings on Thursday and Friday evening and on the Lord's Day morning. There is a good opportunity there, and the emphasis has been the Swatowese population and those living in the area who can speak Mandarin. The nature of the meetings is teaching and gospel preaching. The work here was under Brother Luan. Now that he has left Hong Kong, the work has been passed on to the local brothers. Please remember us before the Lord. Peace to you in the Lord. Greetings to the brothers and sisters remaining in Hankow.</p><p>A weak brother in the Lord,<br />Ho Nai-yee, August 5</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Brother K. H. Weigh:</p><p>The work here has been taken up mostly by the local brothers. However, since the introduction of the new principle, we have learned one lesson. Brother Luan said that the book Rethinking Our Work (The Normal Christian Church Life) is a very good book. But we should not neglect the fact that this book concerns only the line of Paul, not the line of Peter in Jerusalem or the line of John in Asia. If we practice according to the principle of the book, it creates a great problem between the work of the local church and the work of the workers. There is no way to separate these two kinds of work. This is the experience we have learned in the past. We have often neglected the Lord's work and the Lord's workers. May the Lord grant us grace and mercy. The brothers here are quite burdened for the work in K'un-ming and Sikang. We pray about it all the time in our prayers. We hope that you can give us reports frequently and publish news of the work in K'un-ming in The Open Door so that the brothers and sisters can pray according to the needs. May the Lord be with you, amen.</p><p>Your brother, Ho Nai-yee, August 10</p><h2 class="head2">Singapore</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Brother Yue-chiao:</p><p>Enclosed please find X dollars for Sister X, which should be distributed to workers in remote border regions.

This is a big task, and I look to the Lord for His guidance and blessing. I ask that my work be published in The Open Door so that the brothers and sisters can pray for me. I will not need any offering because there is support from special funds. (Brother Yen is from Honan. He studied in the Methodist seminary in Che-Kou.

Thank the Lord that His work can still be so prevailing under the present circumstances.</p><p>The condition of the churches in the northwest has improved recently. Some of the Chinese brothers in the China Inland Mission adopted the policy of self-propagation and began pioneering evangelism in Ching-Yang last year. Suh Siu-deh, who loves the Lord, is taking responsibility there. Last winter some brothers and sisters from Kaifeng, who were zealous for the Lord and who were from the Methodist Bible School, established an evangelistic band and intended to go to the northwest to preach the gospel. Lately, the Assembly of God has been very active. It has a little evangelistic band working in the northwest and has done some lasting work in many areas in Tsinghai. Our respected Brother Witness Lee went to the northwest once last year. Many who desired to see him for years were unable to see him. There are still many in Sian and Lan-chou who would like him to come again with the Lord's full gospel and edify the brothers in the northwest. Mr. Liang Bin-yu was in Hue-Ning in July, and he obtained his missionary passport for working in the northwest from Lan-chou on the fifth. There are only one or two churches with a few dozen people in each between Lan-chou and Di-Hwa, a distance of a few thousand miles. If Brother Chao Yung-chuen has a burden in his spirit for the gospel work in Sinkiang, we would very much respect it, because there is a great need for men to go there. The church in Hue-Ning is absolutely the Lord's. But there are many things which we do not understand as far as the way is concerned. Although we were helped by the books Rethinking Our Work and The Open Door, they are not enough. May some writings that can render us more help be published. May God give you deep wisdom so that thousands of people may receive the benefit. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Brothers in Hue-Ning: Sun Fuh-ji, Jacob Chang,<br />Xing Ling-shuen, and Chang Ying-tien, August 10</p><h2 class="head2">T'ai-yuan, Shansi Province</h2><p>Thank God our Father, who has sent us our desire&mdash;The Open Door....Last August I went with two co-workers, Sisters Shang Yee-rong and Wu Deh-shin, to my hometown of Tai-Gu. God opened the door of preaching for us. In every meeting there were forty to fifty women. Later, Brother Chai En-shang also came to work in Tai-Gu for a week. Through negotiations with the supervisor of the students at Ming-Shien Girls' School, we were allowed to preach the gospel at the high school. We were ready to invite Brother Witness Lee to come to work in Tai-Gu, but there was no transportation. I graduated from Ming-En School ten years ago, and I have been working in it for five years. In T'ai-yuan Sisters Han Miao-ying and Chang Li-yeh are taking this way. Two weeks ago I received a letter from Sister Peace Wang in Szechuan, telling us that she will soon go to Kweichow.</p><p>Sister in the Lord,<br />Chang Chui-hsi, in my sickness, August 22</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>Thank God that Issue No. 11 was published in Hankow under His grace! This issue is being typeset in Hankow. We hope it can come out safely in October through your prayers.</p><p>During the past month I have received a few letters reminding me of something concerning this publication. I take them to heart and am very grateful for them. For example, one brother wrote, "In one issue of The Open Door, you mentioned one item briefly. Although it may not stir up much attention, I am afraid that mentioning this news will cause the readers not to turn away from it. If this work is legitimate, we should pay proper attention to it, because it would mean that God has one more worker. But if this work is not proper, we should ignore it altogether." I was directed by my reasoning at that time. While I did not trust in the brother, his letter seemed to indicate some kind of a turn. Since I was afraid of being bound by my own prejudice, I only deleted the portion of the letter which pertained to his work and published the part about his escape from the war. In addition, I said in that issue, "Some news is good, but if the editor does not feel peaceful about publishing it, she will not dare publish it." I was referring to the deleted part of this brother's letter that has to do with his work. Recently, I checked into this matter and found that this brother has written many places telling others how God had greatly used him. Certain believers who contacted him said, "He is liable to lie, despite the fact that what he says is similar to what you are saying." Of course, we cannot control others from becoming false apostles, but neither are we willing to remove the rooftops of others and uncover them. The best we can do is ignore them. We have no way to stop anyone from utilizing the podium or taking godliness as a means for base gain. But a church such as Ephesus will be able to discern those who call themselves apostles but are not. Moreover, those who are truly spiritual will recognize who these people are. We still hope that the brother says these things out of an ignorance of his self, not out of a willful intention to deceive others.</p><p>A few other brothers wrote, "You should be careful and discreet in publishing the condition of local churches, personal letters, reports of personal work, or stories about the work of others." They also quoted examples, saying, "In one issue you said that a certain brother was giving messages. We dare not say such a word before the Lord. In another issue you published a letter by someone whose salvation is still doubtful. It would be better to be more careful and discreet in such cases. Moreover, in another issue, the report is not very accurate." To be careful and discrete is truly right in principle. But there are often difficulties. With most of the news, I have done my best to cut off certain things so that we will not fall into exaggeration. With some letters, the writer is my personal acquaintance. In order to avoid problems, I have investigated, according to my ability, the trustworthiness of the statements that come from other sources. It is inevitable that there will still be mistakes. There are two points, however, I wish to make. On the one hand, I hope that by prayer I will have a clearer inner guidance. On the other hand, I hope that all correspondents will take care not to exaggerate. Moreover, if anyone knows of anything that requires correction, please do not hesitate to make it.</p><p>On the first page of every issue, we have the words: "This is a personal ministry and not the official publication of an organization." Therefore, we wish that the co-workers and the local churches would pay attention to the fact that in this magazine, the recommendation or nonrecommendation of any individual and the selection or deletion of any news of the work or of the churches are of a personal nature and are not in the nature of any official organization. All relationships are spiritual.</p><p>As to the offerings designated for the work, Brothers Ho Yueh-chiao and Lan Tsi-yi and myself are merely entrusted to transfer money to others. We are not a faith mission. Even the cares among the co-workers are lessons in supplying the needs of others; no one is responsible to anyone else. Our eyes should be set on God alone, and our hearts should give thanks to Him alone.</p><p>Recently, most of the brothers and sisters who are in Hankow, Ch'ang-sha, and Szechuan have found ways to meet their needs. We thank the Lord for His grace with all of our hearts!</p><p>We cannot predict the future of Hankow. Should communication with Hankow become blocked, all questions and orders should be sent directly through Mr. Ho Nai-yee in Hong Kong.</p><p>I will leave Chungking for Kuei-yang soon and will be in K'un-ming in the middle of October. Then I may go to Kweilin or back to Shanghai via Hong Kong. All news of the work and the churches should be directed to Brother Weigh in K'un-ming if you are sending it before the middle of October. After the middle of October, please send it to Mr. Ho Nai-yee, P. O.

O. Box 323, Shanghai, November 1938</h2><h2 class="head1">A CHALLENGE FROM THE BORDER REGIONS</h2><p>In view of the drastic changes in the world situation, some of the co-workers have had a deep realization of the imminent coming of the Lord. They have given themselves selflessly to the obedience of the Lord's commission in spreading the gospel to the far border regions, such as the provinces in Yunnan, Sikang, and Tibet. These places are now imprinted with the beautiful footsteps of the gospel preachers and the announcers of the glad tidings. The gospel messengers in the remote border regions have received special gifts, a special commission, and a special leading from the Lord. They are not deterred in any way. They are ever charging forward. They have won the admiration of all believers throughout the nation. We, who are confined to our homes and unable to follow their fine footsteps to faraway countries because of circumstances and the lack of being equipped, are undoubtedly ashamed. But there are two ways to interpret the meaning of the words remote borders. We can say that the border regions of our nation are the great border regions. But we can also say that the edge of our cities and villages, regions where the gospel has not yet reached, are smaller border regions. Although we cannot go to the greater border regions, we can go to the smaller border regions. In fact, there are urgent cries from these smaller border regions and numerous opportunities. For example, although there is a church in the county-town of Fu-Ting, there are a hundred households and over ten thousand people outside the town who have never heard the real gospel. Even though a few people have believed in the gospel in Shuen-Cheng, which is about thirty miles from Fu-Ting, they are very isolated. We need workers for the follow-up work. Although churches can be seen everywhere within Jin-Shiang in Jiang-Nan, many villages outside the east and west gates of the city are void of believers. Some have never even seen a gospel preacher pass by their place. We owe them very much, and our debt is heavy. The Lord is coming. When are we going to repay this debt? Although the gospel has spread to Shan-Men in Bei-Gang, the town of Yuen-Pan, which is only ten miles from Shan-Men, has no knowledge of the church in Shan-Men. Some have not even heard the name of Jesus yet. These places are very desolate. Not only are they in desolation, but many other places are also desolate. During this period of crisis, sudden deaths can be seen everywhere in the cities and the countryside. Furthermore, the spread of epidemics has taken the lives of many healthy men and women. Their bodies have died, yet their souls have not heard the gospel; they are destined for perdition. Whose responsibility is it? In consideration of this, the brothers in Hu-Shan have banded themselves to preach the gospel in Chao-Yang-Shan and have gained many souls. Why would the brothers and sisters everywhere not rise up and do the same?</p><p>Chen</p><h2 class="head1">AN ADDITIONAL WORD FROM THE EDITOR</h2><p>The preceding article was published in the fifth issue of Local News of the Churches of God in Border Regions between Chekiang and Fukien. We intended to quote this in the last issue, but there was not enough time. We have published it in this issue. One fact is difficult for me to point out: In Issue No. 1 of this magazine, Brother Watchman Nee said, "During this time, the apostles should spend more time to labor in the inland regions." We thank the Lord that since then many brothers have turned to the inland provinces. We thank the Lord also that many brothers and sisters are becoming burdened for the work in the remote border regions. But from my understanding, during the past year, much attention, consecration, zeal, and concern have been given to the remote border regions, and the inland regions have been neglected. Some even think that the "border provinces" are the "border regions." I myself could not differentiate between the two either at the beginning. There has also been misunderstanding concerning the words remote and inland regions. I would, therefore, like to say something based on what I know.</p><p>"Border provinces" are those provinces such as Yunnan, Sikang, Tibet, and Sinkiang, which touch the national borders, excluding those by the sea. However, the provincial capitals and some regions of the border provinces are not "border regions." For example, although some counties in Yunnan are within the general boundary of the border provinces, their actual condition is the same as some of the counties in Kiangsu and Chekiang, and they are as prosperous. For example, the region between Yunnan and Sikang is truly a border region. But the area between Sikang and Szechuan, such as Kang-Ting, cannot be considered a border region.</p><p>Concerning what is considered "remote" or "desolate," there are two kinds of places. One kind of place is where the people live very poorly and their livelihood is bleak. The other is where people are living in sin and have never heard the gospel (such as those mentioned in Brother Chen's letter above). Any place that fits the above two descriptions is a "desolate border region" if it is situated in a border province, and a "desolate poverty-striken region" if it is situated in any province that is not at the border.</p><p>There are also two kinds of "inland regions." The two kinds are the provinces which are more inland from the sea and the counties and municipalities which are geographically situated toward the inland. Among the provinces which are "inland," some counties and municipalities are not that poor or sparsely populated (such as some of the bigger counties and municipalities in Yunnan and Kweichow). Some are even quite rich (such as the many counties and municipalities in Szechuan). We can say that some of these places (like Chungking and K'un-ming) even resemble big cities. In contrast, some counties and municipalities in provinces in north and central China and even some provinces bordered by the sea, are still quite poor. Therefore, I hope that in the many prayers and offerings, the work and the workers in every place will not be forgotten, especially the workers who are working in the "desolate regions."</p><p>I must also say a few words to the co-workers who have been called to work in the "desolate regions." We must not think that by going to inland provinces, we have reached the "remote regions" or "desolate regions." Nor should we remain in one place, thinking that we will move on only after we have built up the church to a certain degree. (Of course, if some have special burdens, as Paul did in Corinth and Ephesus, it is a different story.) There are so many "desolate regions" in the inland provinces outside the larger cities. If we stay in one place, how can the other places expect to see men visiting them? This summer I was in a mountain village in Wan County, which is only twenty miles from the city. No one has come to preach the gospel to the village folks there yet. Recently, a few co-workers and I traveled by bus from Chungking to Kuei-yang. What we saw along the way was enough to break our hearts! Some coolies are overloaded with heavy burdens, shuttling back and forth on mountain pathways. What they earn in a day is enough only to fill their stomach. What hope do they have in this life? How much these people need the gospel preached to them! But in order to preach the gospel to these coolies, we must first sit down and count the cost. Are we willing to suffer psychologically and physically? In some places, one cannot buy things even if he has the money. Some bigger roads have inns along the way. But some smaller pathways are very foreboding! It is not an easy thing for us to advance into these villages one by one. Yet such labor in the Lord will not be in vain. When I was in Kuei-yang, I heard that a certain Westerner who works among the Miao tribes has become so blended in with them that he eats and sleeps with them on the floor. He eats (not on purpose) the same fly-infested food that they eat. As a result he gains souls among them. I am not one who has been commissioned by the Lord to preach the gospel everywhere, but I know a little of the hardships involved. I say this with sighing tears and hopeful sincerity. I hope that the co-workers will forgive me for saying this!</p><p>Ruth Lee, in Kuei-yang, October 17</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Watchman Nee, England</h2><p>My work here has experienced much blessing from the Lord. Praise His name. Many people hope that we will be able to put the truth that we have been given and have learned from the Lord into English. I myself see the real need for this work. The English-speaking world is indeed poor. However, unless this is absolutely of the Lord, I would not like to initiate anything. We ourselves must be bound in order for the work to remain pure and of spiritual worth. Many people are exalting me highly here. Yet my eyes are set only on the Lord. I refuse to do anything based on outward prompting. As one who has learned the lesson of the cross, none of these things can cause me to regard myself one bit higher. If a man knows the meaning of conformity to His death, how can he seek glory from men again? But I must say that the Lord has indeed been gracious to me here. Praise His name.</p><p>One thing has been on my mind for many years, which is that the brothers are so easily satisfied. There are indeed many ways not yet traversed. But some are satisfied with what they have already! It seems that much solid food does not have the right kind of recipients! This time the Lord has been gracious to me. I have met a number of people (not too many) who are deep in the Lord and who speak of the deeper things of God. You know that I never demand to be considered a teacher by others. (What an evil attitude that would be!) I have always waited for others to ask me. The same is true this time. The Lord has touched others to come to ask of me. They receive the help, and I receive the reviving. I feel that if I write any book, I should write it in Chinese first and then have it translated into English. But I cannot say under the present circumstances that I am clear about the Lord's mind. The money sent to you was from two or three brothers and sisters who exhausted their means to support the Lord's work. Other than these few people, material giving among most others, and even among the zealous ones, does not come up to the standard of our own brothers in China. Some will give only if others ask them. Such people have nothing to do with us. No matter how difficult our condition is, we have to maintain what we are holding fast to before the Lord. Trials are everywhere, but the God we believe in is the living God! Once the Lord shows me that I have gained what He wants me to gain here, I will set out for my homeward journey. How I long to walk in God's will exactly according to His timing, without being too quick or too slow! Realizing the urgency of the situation around us, I am all the more fearful of having my own way. Sometimes I feel forlorn at the thought that the co-workers are all scattered everywhere and we are not able to gather together in one place. May our scattering be for the accomplishment of the Lord's will. The reports in the The Open Door have stirred up praises to the Lord. Yet our prayer to the Lord is that the younger co-workers will know the cross and how it deals with the flesh and the natural life!</p><p>Brother Watchman Nee, the evening of the fifteenth</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chang Kwang-rong</h2><p>I left Shanghai on August 12 and arrived in Fu-Ting on the afternoon of the fourteenth. Praise the Lord. I believe this trip was under the Lord's leading, having received the light from the book Rethinking Our Work. After a long period of prayer and waiting, I unexpectedly met the responsible brother of Fu-Ting, Brother Wu Sho-liang. He came as a buyer for merchandise but related the need of workers in the churches there. Subsequently, I went with him to Fu-Ting.</p><p>Fu-Ting is a border region between the provinces of Fukien and Chekiang; it is surrounded by mountains on four sides. When I first arrived, I was not well-adjusted to the climate and felt somewhat ill. By the Lord's grace I soon recovered. I conducted some perfecting work internally for the believers and preached the gospel for a few days to the outsiders. Most of the brothers and sisters are illiterate. Yet their desire to know the Lord is stronger than their desire to read. Their prayers are sincere. The meetings are held at Brother Wu's house. He and his three sons have a dye shop. In addition to their own living quarters, they have built two more rooms to be used for the meetings, with one upstairs to be used for guest houses. Brother Wu manages his house very well and is very hospitable. I was quite touched by him. Although there are only about twenty people breaking bread together, they all love one another. When it comes time to preach, over a hundred come. Although Fu-Ting is between two provinces and is surrounded by mountains, the brothers from Ping-Yang and Tai-Shun come all the time for fellowship. Brother Chan Chin-fa said, "The meeting hall in Fu-Ting is a station for the brothers from Ping-Yang." After I arrived in Fu-Ting, the co-workers from Ping-Yang and Tai-Shun, such as Brothers Chen Chin-fa, Hwang Li-chuan, Jin Tze-fang, and Chou Dah-chin, all came and participated in instructing and teaching us. Over a few dozen places invited me to go to them. I felt quite fearful. I ask that the Lord be merciful to me and trim me so that I can be more humble and obedient. I only want to be a pure vessel and a faithful slave in His hand. I do not want to disappoint the brothers' love or bring shame to the Lord's name. After I finish the portion that the Lord has assigned to me, the Lord willing, I will leave Fu-Ting on the ninth of this month and go to Ya-Yang Village in Tai-Shun, Chekiang, and from there I will go to Shi-Si. Please pray for this.</p><p>Brother Chang Kwang-rong, Fu-Ting, September 3</p><h2 class="head2">The Footsteps of Brothers Hu and Hsu,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><h2 class="head3">Intending to Go up Nu River into Sikang</h2><h2 class="head4">One</h2><p>As tender shoots in a thorny land, we can only trust in the power of God and go on in faith. Today is our happiest day because the days of trials, of "tending sheep in the land of the Midians" have been completed. Many difficulties are behind us. Thank the Lord who loves us, who has given us the same mind, the same hope, and the same footsteps. Tomorrow we will go upstream along the Nu River and enter Tibet. May the Father bless His testimony, and may glory be to His holy name. We wish that the dear brothers and sisters would offer up a special prayer for us.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Hu Yi-min, the night before departure</p><h2 class="head4">Two</h2><p>Brother Hu and I have decided to set out on August 22 to cross the Lan-Chang River, climb Nu Mountain, and go up Nu River into Sikang, preaching the gospel along the way. May the Lord bless our work this time, and may He glorify His own name. We ask that the brothers and sisters pray much for us! This trip will take us two months. The Lord willing, I will send my wife to live in K'un-ming when I return. I heard that Ah-Dun-Tze was attacked by robbers on August 12 and that everything was ransacked. This has closed that way into Sikang; therefore, we can only go up the Nu River.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, August 19</p><h2 class="head3">Temporarily Stopping at Nu River</h2><h2 class="head4">One</h2><p>We cannot thank the Lord enough for bringing us safely to Nu River. We stayed here for more than twenty days, working in the areas where Brother Hu used to work. I heard that there are over a thousand Li-Suh believers in this part of Nu River, meeting in over ten places. These Li-Suh natives have asked us to preach to them. Thank the Lord that we have found ready ears when we preach. Perhaps some will receive God's salvation. Brother Hu and I had intended to enter Tibet and then Sikang, but the way to Tibet is closed. No one is allowed to go through it. We have been stopped from advancing any further. The situation in Ah-Dun-Tze is very unstable, and it was impossible to take that way either. We can only preach in Nu River. We will come down from Hwang-Shan to the Shang-Po region, having heard that many areas around there have never heard the gospel. We will work there. In two weeks I will have to return to Yeh-Ji. After my return I will send my wife to K'un-ming. The Lord has opened the door at Nu River, and we intend to look for a place to do some serious work. May the Lord's will be accomplished, amen.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, on Na-Ou Mountain at Nu River<br />September 15</p><h2 class="head4">Two</h2><p>We have been at Nu River for about a month already. The Nu tribes and the Li-Suh natives desire the Lord's truth very much. Unfortunately, there is no one to preach the real gospel to them. But now the Lord has opened their eyes a little. Thank the Lord that some have understood the truth of eternal life and of the forgiveness of sins. There are many places in this area that have never heard the gospel before. We intend to work in these places. Brother Hu is still at Nu River and will return in approximately three weeks. Presently, I am getting the luggage ready and preparing to send my wife and children to K'un-ming. The Lord willing, after I settle them in K'un-ming, I will return and enter the Nu River or the Chu-Tze River before the snow blocks the mountain way. I heard that many Chu-Tze natives have believed in the Lord, and the preachers are Li-Suh natives and Nu natives. The only ones who have been to these places were some Westerners from the Assembly of God Church. There are still many places that have never heard the gospel before. The Lord has prepared one or two people who know the Li-Suh language well. One is a Han Chinese, and the other is a Li-Suh native. Both of them have implored me to stay at Nu River and Chu-Tze River to preach the gospel there. It seems that we cannot go into Sikang for now. Perhaps the door of the work has not opened yet. The disturbance in Ah-Dun-Tze is still going on. We can only commit our future to the Lord. If we can set out on the third of October, we can arrive in K'un-ming on October 21 or 22.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, September 30</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Sister Sun Wen-hwa<br />Sent from Denmark to London</h2><p>Dear Brother Nee:</p><p>Enclosed please find a letter from Miss H. to me, which she requested that I send to you after I have read it. I have read it through. I believe that you have left Kilcreggan, so I have changed the address and directed the letter to London. Miss H. and others would like to discuss some questions related to the church based on your book Rethinking Our Work, particularly, concerning chapter five. She intends to call a little gathering in her home, including church leaders, and invite you to have a private talk with them. If the Lord leads you to accept such an invitation, you will be able to freely express the message that the Lord has revealed in your heart.</p><p>Mr. Fjord Christensen and we are very happy for the help your book has rendered us (a few chapters have been translated into Danish). I have sent him the few chapters which are already translated, and whenever I finish the rest, I will send them to him. He has read the chapters to brothers and sisters in small prayer meetings all over Denmark. We are particularly thankful to the Lord for the fact that these chapters have laid a good foundation in the hearts of the majority of those who have heard them. It was indeed the right time for the Lord to arrange to have this book released. During one meeting two sisters did not understand anything during the first forty-five minutes, yet as Mr. Christensen kept reading, the Holy Spirit suddenly opened their understanding, and they realized that the book was an answer to their recent desperate prayers. They were praying for the Lord to show them the plan of His church on earth. They were forced to join the local Pentecostal denomination because they thought that they should be in some kind of more organized church, even though they were outside the state church. Now they know that the Lord has prepared a better plan for them, and they subsequently dropped the matter of joining the Pentecostal Church. Presently, some are meeting in four small local meetings and sincerely praying and asking the Lord to show them who should bear the responsibility of the eldership so that they can express and carry out the plan the Lord has accomplished among them in God's house.</p><p>Two nights ago I attended a prayer meeting. After Mr. Christensen read chapter five and part of chapter ten of your book, the Spirit was clearly working. Most of the people understood and treasured this truth concerning the church. Mr. Christensen has received letters from places that he visited recently, and they related how this truth has deeply penetrated their hearts. In one place a brother received a message in tongues, and after its interpretation, he realized that it was a message concerning the lampstand. At that time he did not understand the meaning of this. He was concerned whether it was a dubious message. This happened before Mr. Christensen visited. After he heard Mr. Christensen reading chapter five concerning the church and the churches, it suddenly occurred to him that this church truth was what the Lord had spoken to him in his prophecy. He was ready to accept the message of this truth. We are praying much for the meeting in Helsingor in October. Praise the Lord that He has preserved our hearts in peace in Him. I have no doubt that the Lord has waited for such a long time to give you this light because He knows that our faith has to pass through tests. Greetings to you and the brothers and sisters in Honor Oak.</p><p>Sister in the Lord,<br />Sun Wen-hwa, September 22</p><h2 class="head2">South Fukien</h2><p>The Lord's leading in these days seems to be in the evangelization work of the surrounding villages. On September 2 Brother Jai-seng, two other brothers, Mrs. Hwang Bi-hou, and I went to work in Ping-Hai (eighty to ninety miles from Pu-Tien by the sea). There are many children of the Lord who are in need of truth and testimony there. During the day time we preached the gospel in the open air in the villages. In the evenings we gathered together for meetings. Every night we had about two hundred people; the opportunity was quite great. On September 12 we returned. Sisters Wang Yu-chu and Chen Tien-leh preached the gospel in the homes of sisters in Shi-Cheng Village near Jiang-Kou, and the Lord saved some there. As a result we went there in September and did some work. We found some who are seeking God, and hopefully, the Lord's table will be set up. Presently, Brothers Jai-seng and Kwang-ru and Sisters Weigh Kwang-ying and Fang Chiung-ying will pioneer in areas around Wu-Tung. Their route leads into the mountains. The Lord has used Brothers Keh Yu-tang and Keh Lien-min to save and revive some there. Sooner or later the Lord's table will be established, and the testimony of the church will be realized. The Lord willing, I intend to set out with Brother Lan Jin-yang. May the Lord accomplish the work He set out to accomplish. Please pray much for the co-workers in this part.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Tsai Tse-chung, Chen Ke-san, September 30</p><h2 class="head1">MISCELLANEOUS NEWS</h2><p>(1) A letter from Shanghai stated that there was a series of Bible study meetings for five evenings from September 20 to 24.

Since the war spread to northern Kiangsu, everyone is frightened. Those of our village are also very uneasy. Most of the brothers and sisters moved to the countryside. My family and the local brothers and sisters moved temporarily to Tao-Lao-She (a village ten miles from south Yi-Lin) because of the tense situation. Later, we moved to Hsu-Tsia Lou. Since then the Lord has led us safely back to Yi-Lin.</p><p>On May 28 of the Chinese calendar, Yi-Lin, Dong-Gou, Ban-Hu, and Su-Jia-Tsui were all bombed. At that time Brother Feng Shien-Tze and I were both in Yi-Lin. I hid temporarily in the fields. In my prayer I recalled the Lord's words: "Not one of them will fall to the earth apart from your Father....You are of more value than many sparrows." Although the bombs came down like rain and my body was covered with dust, I praise the power of God for protecting my life and delivering me from danger. In Yi-Lin over sixty people died and twenty houses were burned (all of which were very close to our home). My family and my house and the houses of all the brothers and sisters meeting in Yi-Lin were saved. This was truly God's grace!</p><p>Brothers from Ban-Hu wrote and told us that some of our brothers and sisters experienced some bombings, but their bodies were not hurt. Some crawled out of holes near fallen walls and houses. No one was hurt under such a barrage of fire and bombs.</p><p>According to Brother Hu Siao-lan, the meeting place was preserved, although the town of Dong-Gou was damaged. The brothers and sisters were scattered. Although they often met with danger, the Lord was with them, and they are all safely back home.</p><p>Brother Ji Yung-tung from Soo-Jia-Tsui said that when the bombing came to Soo-Jia-Tsui, both he and Brother Chiu Ri-jien were at home. One heavy bomb hit the northwest corner of the meeting hall. But thank the Lord; it fell harmlessly into the river, and no damage was done. A neighboring house caught fire, but it was extinguished. Because of the Lord's protection, the meeting hall was undamaged.</p><p>The brothers and sisters as well as the meeting halls in Yien-Chen and Fu-Ning are all safe and unharmed. We marvel at the Lord's grace and cannot thank Him enough for having cared for the churches in northern Kiangsu and having kept His children in safety. We also thank the brothers and sisters for remembering us before the Lord. We have had heavy rain here for many days, and the water is fierce; many fields in the lower plains have been flooded. The disruption of the war has caused many people to become unemployed. May the Lord lead us and arrange everything for us. Please do not forget to pray for us.</p><p>We have received Issue Nos. 5, 6, and 8 of The Open Door, but have not received Issue No. 7. If you still have some copies of Issue No. 7, please send them to us. In the future please send us fifty copies of each issue. The postal service in other places in northern Kiangsu is functioning, so please send the magazine to them as before.</p><p>Brother Wu Wei, August 9</p><h2 class="head2">Hangchow, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Brother Run Chi-yu wrote to Brother Yu Shiung-fei on July 10: "My nephew's wife and Brother and Mrs. Hsu Yung-ming and their two children are lodging at my house. My third uncle, Hsu Si-chiao, is safe in Ning-Hai. Brother Lee Kwei-sien visited me once; he is still living in Si-Wen-Che, a suburb of Hu-Shu. Brother Wang Shun-fah still has a business in Hu-Shu. Brother Lou Feng-ming went to Fu-Yang once. His wife was seriously sick at one time, but she has now recovered. Chang Wen-jih is my brother-in-law. According to Brother Hwang Tsai-ching, he is definitely saved. His family still lives in the same place. God's grace has been great in me.

Actually this is what we owe them (Rom. 15:27; James 5:4). This little amount is an expression of the Lord's love as members; nevertheless, we feel quite ashamed. Please forgive us for our lack.

Your translation of Mr. Paget Wilkes's book gave me light and guidance for my work in every paragraph. Both myself, as well as many Western brothers, are waiting for the book to come out. It will help us as well as those who are working for the Lord. I believe you have heard something from Brothers Lee Geng-shun and Sun Fu-ji concerning the situation in the northwest. During this period the Lord's work has become brighter and more vigorous. We arrived in Lan-chou on August 15. The prosperity here is unmatched in all four provinces of Sinkiang, Ningsia, Kansu, and Tsinghai. We intend to work in Jiu-Chuen. But this is a more difficult region than Tsinghai. Yet when we consider the work of Livingstone in India, the work of Morrison in Canton, or the work of X in Tibet, we feel ashamed of ourselves. Brother Lu Shao-gu, with whom we have fellowship in the Lord, was relocated by his work to Jiu-Chuen in June and returned to Lan-chou on August 14. He has sown some seeds of the gospel there. One can take a bus from Lan-chou to Jiu-Chuen (the cost is $44.40). We intend to conduct evangelistic work in Jia-Gu-Gwan, which is seventy miles from Jiu-Chuen. The brothers and sisters who have been praying for Jia-Gu-Gwan are joining us seriously in prayer and waiting for the Lord's will. We intend to first go west from Lan-chou to Wu-Wei and then decide on how we will work. We would like to draw the prayer-power from The Open Door, and we hope that some brothers and sisters will be sent by the Lord to join us there to serve Him.</p><p>Brother Liang Bin-yu and the co-workers from the northwest,<br />August 28, evening</p><h2 class="head2">Chefoo, Shantung Province</h2><p>I received the tenth issue of The Open Door last night, and I realize that the Lord has heard the prayers of His children everywhere and preserved them in peace.

The brothers and sisters in Chefoo are at peace under the gracious protection of the Lord. Meetings go on as usual. Brother Witness Lee is still working for the Lord's gospel in Peking and Tientsin and has not returned. The brothers who are in business or in other enterprises in Chefoo have experienced the gracious protection of the Lord. Although things are not as good as they were, they are tolerable.

Then Sisters Bau Hsu-min and Lee Mu-cha came to do some perfecting work. Sisters Wang and Chan are back in Pu-Tien, but Sisters Bau and Lee are still here. May such work that is for the Lord bring much blessing to His children. The brothers and sisters in Sien-You are very young and weak.

But there are obstacles, and I am not able to go now. I passed through all the other places quickly, staying for the longest period of time in Shao-Wu. Thank the Lord that Sisters Chuang and Lee have given excellent testimonies in Shao-Wu. Recently, the Fukien Shie-Ho University moved to Shao-Wu, and a few more brothers who are one in striving for the gospel have been added. Since returning from Shao-Wu, I have written to eleven co-workers in south Fukien, asking them to come to work in north Fukien. Thank the Lord that Brother Chen Ke-san has replied and told me that two or three brothers will come. Probably they can leave for the north next month. I ask you and the saints in K'un-ming who are concerned for the Lord's work to pray earnestly so that the brothers can be filled with the power of the Spirit and spread salvation to Yien-Ping, Kien-Ou, and Shao-Wu, bringing many sinners to salvation. Afterwards, we hope to see meetings properly established and the breaking of bread initiated. Sister Chu Shue-chin has been in Kien-Ou for five months. She is working as a nurse in the Christian Hospital. Lately, she has been sick. When I visited her and talked to her about the Lord's truth, I was overjoyed to find out that she is a sister. She was also comforted by my visit. I know that you are concerned about her. This is why I mentioned this. Shao-yun will graduate from vocational school in Foochow this term, and Jia-en is still here. Thank the Lord that they have made much progress lately. Since you are so concerned for them, I thought that I should report their progress to you. Peace and grace from the Lord to you. Greetings to Sisters Wang and Chang and to Mrs. Nee, the senior Mrs. Nee, Mrs. Weigh, and Sisters Lee and Yu.</p><p>Sister Yu-bing, the evening of September 27</p><h2 class="head2">Swatow</h2><p>The Lord has been protecting us, and we are still safe. Most of the brothers and sisters have returned to Swatow, and the meetings have resumed. We can only thank the Lord. One thing gives us reason for great thanksgiving: He has led His servant Stephen Kaung to come and conduct meetings in Swatow. During the past week we have had gospel meetings in the evenings, in which we have seen His saving grace for sinners. We hope that the Lord will still be gracious to us and give us more meetings starting next Monday. We hope that He will grant us words of edification through His own so that we can grow in grace. Enclosed please find X dollars for brothers and sisters in need and difficulty.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Tsai Gi-chen, Hsie Tse-shun, Chen Wen-kwang,<br />Chen Fang-ching, September 19</p><p>P.S. Enclosed also find X dollars from two sisters in Thailand. Please use it according to their written directions.</p><h2 class="head2">K'un-ming, Yunnan Province</h2><p>After the first air raid in K'un-ming, most of the citizens were dispersed to the villages. They return to the city at night. A few days ago the city was quite deserted. But it is now gradually coming back to life. Mrs. Nee (Watchman's mother) and Mrs. Nee (Watchman's wife) left for Hong Kong on the twenty-second of last month. I heard that Brother Lin Yau-huei from Kweilin is being relocated and is applying to come back to K'un-ming. Last Lord's Day we had the eighth baptism in K'un-ming (with six brothers and nine sisters). The lease for the meeting hall is up. Because of the turmoil, we do not intend to rent any place for the moment; instead, we will conduct the meetings in the brothers' and sisters' homes. The prayer and gospel meeting on Wednesday night is held at Mrs. Yin's house at the following address: [omitted]. The Bible study meeting or the meeting for testimony and edification on Friday and the bread-breaking meeting on the Lord's Day are held at Brother Hwang Tsung's house. A small number of brothers and sisters have moved into the country. Everyone is preserved and safe. I have been staying at home to do some literature work, to have some spiritual time with the Lord, and to engage in some personal preaching and counseling.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />K. H. Weigh, evening, October 10</p><h2 class="head2">Hong Kong</h2><p>Mrs. Tseng is still in Hong Kong. Sister Ro-chen is still in Macao, and her letter said that she is engaged in personal work. Brother Ma Mu and his wife are staying in Macao. The senior Mrs. Nee and Sisters Yu Shu-jen and Rachel Lee arrived in Hong Kong from K'un-ming on September 29. Brother Stephen Kaung completed his work in Swatow and returned to Hong Kong. The address of the meeting in Hong Kong changed on August 1 to [omitted]. News of the churches and correspondence can be sent to P. O. Box 1664. The work here is being carried on as usual. On the Lord's Day morning we have the gospel meeting, and the opportunity is great. The number in attendance is also high. Unless the Spirit does His own work, no one can repent and turn to the Lord. From October 3 to 8 there will be a special gospel meeting at the meeting hall for the women. The senior Mrs. Nee and Sisters Rachel Lee and Yu Shu-jen will be responsible for them. We intend to rent a sign in the busiest section of Hong Kong to be used for a gospel billboard. We intend to put Scripture verses made of neon lights on it so that the pedestrians and those on the ferries can see it. May the Lord lead us. Thank the Lord that we have prepared quite a bit for this work. But we pray that the Lord will bless this so that it will glorify His own name. Please pray for all these matters. Peace to you in the Lord!</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Ho Nai-yee, October 5, 1938</p><h2 class="head2">Manila</h2><p>I have not corresponded with you for a long time, partly because both my wife and I have been very busy and partly because we do not know where you are. A few days ago we received a copy of The Open Door, and figured that you would be in Chungking by now. Enclosed please find X dollars for you, for the Lord's workers in central and west China, and for brothers and sisters in need. Please distribute it on our behalf. Our whole family is well, thank the Lord! Brother Simon Meek travels often to different parts of the Philippines for evangelism. Today he is leaving again and will not return for a few weeks. The Lord willing, one worker, Brother Wu, will come to Manila from Chuanchow soon to join Brother Meek in his work. We hope that Brother Witness Lee can come also, because this place needs workers like Brother Lee to come and edify the believers. Please bring this matter to prayer before the Father. Greetings to you and to the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Lin En-hung, September 7</p><h2 class="head2">Yung-Ping, Malaysia</h2><p>Thank the Lord that the church in Yung-Ping rented a meeting hall on April 1. There are about thirty brothers and sisters, of which about one-third are baptized. The work here has witnessed the Lord's blessing. On the Lord's Day we have a gospel meeting at ten o'clock. In the afternoon we have the bread-breaking meeting at two o'clock. On Thursday we have a prayer meeting. I sent X dollars on the twenty-first of this month. It is to be used for the expense of The Open Door and for helping the saints in difficulty.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Cheng Kwang-ju, September 23</p><h2 class="head2">Hankow</h2><p>Brother Lan Tsi-yi wrote from Hankow on October 7: "I mailed out Issue No. 12 of The Open Door on October 4.

Even though the military has been put on full combat alert, my work cannot be concluded yet. Although the situation is tense, I am still peaceful within. The work is very busy, if not busier.

He heard our prayer. We were able to mail out Issue No. 12 from Hankow before October 5. Mail to and from Hankow will be stopped beginning October 23. Therefore, beginning with Issue No. 13, we will move the publication work to Shanghai. By the grace of God, we hope to put out at least one more issue.</p><p>(2) It is difficult to send letters from one place to another. Before the mail routes become clear, we hope to send out one or two more issues of this magazine. The churches and co-workers who receive the magazines first should spread the news to other brothers and sisters. Those who receive the magazine later by surface mail should also try their best to distribute it to other brothers and sisters who can read.</p><p>(3) In the past there were shortcomings in the way we handled the correspondence in this magazine. I am, of course, guilty of such mistakes. I pray that God would give me the grace and the leading of the Spirit to work more carefully in the future. I also pray that the message in every letter would be written under His grace so that it will express the pure love in Christ, manifest an unceasing union in the Spirit, and relate all the work of God through the saints and the real condition of the gospel work everywhere. May all the correspondence bear spiritual value and be for the furtherance of the gospel and the benefit of the church.</p><p>(4) Some brothers and sisters do not hold the same view concerning the truth as we do. Their understanding of the church and the work may not be the same as ours. Yet because of our relationship in Christ, we have spiritual fellowship one with another, and at times, we publish their news in the column "News of the Churches." This is because we may know of gospel activities in other places. If some brothers and sisters go to these places, they can receive the help.</p><p>(5) During this critical period we are trying our best to inform you of the whereabouts of the brothers and sisters. This is to allay the concern of others and to facilitate correspondence between the saints. However, we do not know some saints very well and are not familiar with their spiritual condition. This is why we are not recommending anything here.</p><p>(6) Thank the Lord that His grace is sufficient in supplying the brothers and sisters who are in need because of the war! Most of the saints in Hunan and Szechuan have found means to take care of their livelihood. A few in Hankow still need relief; others have found jobs. Brother Lan Tsi-yi has not been able to leave Hankow. Both letters and telegrams cannot get through to Hankow. But, in reading his letter of October 21, we know that he is still taking care of brothers and sisters who are in difficulty. Some saints who intended to go to Kansu and Sinkiang have found that the Lord has opened the way for them, and they are now serving in their jobs. Some are still in north Hunan working part-time and waiting on a clearer leading from the Lord. The mail route and money transfers are clear to and from Chou County, but Shu County still is not ready. We need to pray much concerning the matter of supplying the saints' needs so that those who really need our supply are not neglected.</p><p>(7) Thank the Lord that He has given the co-workers much light through the book Rethinking Our Work. Of course, there are thousands of years of tradition and prejudice when it comes to questions related to the church and the work. If we want to return to the pattern of the Bible, we will have to pay a price inevitably. Any new light is difficult at the beginning of its practice. In this transitional period, we should obey God on the one hand and do things properly on the other hand. The most important thing is that we carry on our practice according to the Bible. Even if we do everything according to the letter, we may still be dead. We are living and full of life only when we are in the Holy Spirit. Sister Sun Wen-hwa's letter from Denmark shows us that God has prepared the hearts of a group of people to pursue and receive His truth and to accomplish His work in this age. I beseech God today to raise up more such people, to prepare their hearts to receive His truth, and to propagate His truth through prayer.</p><p>(8) I have to say a few words fearfully to our young co-workers. I am not more qualified or more experienced that I should say anything to you. But because I have seen something and because of our relationship, I feel that I have to say a few honest words. It is true that we are called and used by God, but we must still fear God. Only then will our words and walk have discipline before men and carefulness when we are by ourselves.</p><p>Sometimes we may be misunderstood or reviled. "But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God" (2 Cor. 4:2). Our corrupted self can neither cope with God's appointment nor His dealings. May the Lord be merciful to us and enlighten us so that we will know what the flesh and the self are. May we accept the dealing of the cross and give no ground to the flesh or to the activities of the self. The days are few. There are so many souls waiting to be saved! We should learn the lessons in a serious way and be dealt with in a proper way so that we can become useful vessels in the hand of the Lord.</p><p>Finally, we have to remember the brothers and sisters in and around Shansi, Kuling, Hankow, I-Chang, Ch'ang-sha, Ch'ang-Teh, and Canton. May the Lord lead them and protect them in everything.</p><p>Ruth Lee, K'un-ming, November 1, 1938</p><h2 class="head1">A REMINDER</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2><p>[Parts omitted] The manuscript of this issue was sent from K'un-ming to Shanghai.

Box 323, Shanghai, February 1939</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Turn in the Work<br />and in the Spiritual Condition,<br />Brother Hwa Tien-min, Kirin Province</h2><p>Brothers Ai-seng and Jia-teh:</p><p>I have had two meetings at Ju-Tzen. The situation is now very different. When we spoke the word before, we did not accompany it with faith. Even as we spoke, we did not believe that our audience would receive the grace that we spoke of. We spoke truth without flowing out grace. While I was in Peking and Jirin, the Lord gave me a special turn in the work and in my spiritual condition. He showed me that our teachings could not render help to the saints because of our very selves. The enemy had injected the image of the audience's evil condition into us and suppressed us to the point that we could not believe that they would receive grace. We did not wrestle with him on this point. Instead, we blamed the audience for their refusal and poverty. Should not those who refuse and who are poor be released? Should not the evil ones be saved? Yet many people were bound by our condemnation. We did not plunge into the spiritual warfare. As a result the unhealthy condition of the brothers was a weight upon us. We were powerless to release others or to sympathize with their poverty. On the contrary we condemned them and bound them, thinking that they did not deserve grace, and that this one and that one were bad. Actually, they had fallen into this condition because we conceded and accepted it. We were overcome by it. As a result, the devil created in the church the very condition which prevails in us. We blamed the brothers and sisters for lacking zeal, for not pursuing after the Lord, for not growing, for their rejection, and for taking the truth with the flesh. However, this condition existed because we first allowed the enemy to work on us to the extent that the truth became a loss to others instead of a blessing.</p><p>While I was in these two places, the Lord showed me again and again the vanity of the work. The work had no results, and the few who were able to understand our speaking were very poor. I was forced to seek the Lord again, realizing that if I continued on in this way, I would waste my whole life, and the brothers and sisters would be following after me in vain. Thank the Lord, He showed me that I had not been fully saved and therefore was unable to be a blessing to the church. The church does not lack truth but blessing.</p><p>Thank the Lord! During the past years, He has released much truth concerning victory and sanctification. This is much better than the vain teaching of exhorting men to do good. Yet the messengers of the church have not yet brought in the blessing, and the church is in desolation before our eyes. At the same time we are condemning the sin of the unsaved ones. Even some who take the same way as us are being set aside. When I realized this situation, I could only wail before the Lord, confessing that the Lord's rich grace has been limited by our narrowness. This rich salvation has been sealed up by us; we are not able to make many rich, and the poor fleshly ones and the ones who are in false spirituality are still bound by their condition. When I confessed these things to the Lord, He showed me the salvation of death and resurrection, and He showed me that I am already in resurrection (1 Cor. 15:22). The resulting condition of Adam's fall is finished. Now in resurrection and in Christ, our fallen condition is finished, and we have become God's children, full of love and mercy. Hallelujah! Only when we are in resurrection can we be manifested as the children of God, resurrected with a new image and a new likeness. The old image is finished in His death and the grave. Nothing of it comes out in resurrection. The image in resurrection is incorruptible, unchangeable, strong, and full of glory.</p><p>Dear ones, do not be afraid that the work might produce the flesh, and do not be afraid to discover what is impotent and poor. This fear is but an attempt to preserve the soul. We should do our best to uncover the poverty of the unresurrected state so that we can receive grace to enter into glory. Please note that faith in death and resurrection is not attained through self-effort in grasping hold of the truth, believing in death and resurrection, or appropriating the word of the Bible. Most people think that faith is man's duty and man's act. But the result is vanity. When the Holy Spirit reveals the unsanctified areas in us, we can only desire death and the experience of death and resurrection. There is no need to act in any way. All we have to do is wait for Him to act in our spirit.</p><p>I have been forced to the point where I must have this experience of resurrection. He has created a deeper faith in death and resurrection in my spirit. He has created a faith not only in resurrection but also in ascension and enthronement. First, He showed me the scene at the throne. The Lord manifested the condition of the throne on earth. (We experience His victory first, and then His enthronement.) When He needed the colt or the upper room (Mark 11:1-6; 14:14-16), He merely asked the disciples to take them and use them. Through His faith, all the evil power of men (the evil of rejecting the Lord, not being for the Lord, and being indifferent toward the Lord) was finished; it has all been overcome. This is the victory of the cross. He did not believe for one moment that the evil power of men or the operations of evil spirits existed before God anymore. Only this faith can release men and give them blessing.</p><p>Unfortunately, the poor condition of the brothers and sisters always looms over us. They have not been able to receive grace. We have not been able to dispense grace to them. We are subdued by the evil nature of men and by the result of the devil's operation. We have not brought the authority of the kingdom to earth and have not prevailed in the battle. All the nations should be blessed because of us. But first we must conquer man's evil power of rebellion against God. Then we can exercise the faith to bring in blessing.</p><p>We used to think that evil men and those believers who do not want the Lord are merely waiting for judgment. We did not believe that they could be saved or be turned to the Lord. Actually the faith that is upon the throne is a faith that believes that all of man's rebellion against God has been subdued by the victory of the cross; there is no more rebellion. Even the unbelievers should be working for the Lord; they should not be rebelling or be destined for perdition. In the past we allowed them to rebel, so they acted in opposition to God. The result was a curse. Now we are sitting on the throne. We have overcome and shattered the evil power of man and have subdued all the evil power that comes up against God's work. The evil condition of being against the Lord and of being ashamed of loving the Lord is gone and shattered. Everyone has to give his heart to the Lord. Everyone has to offer himself willingly to the Lord. Although this age is becoming more and more evil, the faith of God says that the glorious church is closer and closer to heaven. It may sound strange, but the fiercer the devil, the stronger our faith is in believing that his end is near. Although Lazarus was dead for four days and stank already and although it appeared to be hopeless, he was still living in the eyes of the Lord. Man's death cannot prevail against His resurrection. Although the Jews rejected Him, His faith was not weak; He still believed that the colt and the upper room were reserved for Him. In His eyes man's death (spiritual) and the devil's work are under His feet. This is kingship. This is enthronement. Hallelujah! This victory comes from man's active desire and is wrought through his spirit. Spontaneously, we inherit this faith. It is not something we acquire through strenuous effort in believing or through grasping hold of such a truth. It is something generated from within when our own activity ceases. Only that which is begotten of the Spirit is spirit. There is no activity of the self. Rather, everything issues from His Spirit through our will. Hallelujah!</p><p>Henceforth, we will see many people blessed, released, and seated in the heavenlies because of us. This faith turns that which is not being into being and calls that which is dead into life. It removes everything that is poor and dead, making the church full of riches, resurrection, consecration, love for the Lord, and the glory of God so that we are no longer ourselves but are the sons of God. May praise and glory be unto Him forever and ever! Amen. Peace be unto you.</p><p>Brother Hwa Tien-min, November 12, 1938</p><p>(This letter was sent to two brothers in Feng-Tien, who transferred it to us&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Witness Lee, Chefoo</h2><p>I left Peking for Tientsin at the beginning of October and spent two weeks conducting meetings at the chapel of the Evangelistic Crusade. Then I had a few days of meetings with the saints in Yao-Hwa Lane on the subject of the cross and life. At the beginning of November, I left Tientsin for Chefoo. In Chefoo I spoke with the brothers and sisters about the kingdom and the matter of testimony, and then I met with the co-workers for a few days. The condition of the saints in Peking was quite good. In particular, the sisters seem to have experienced an inward revival. Two sisters seem to have been called by the Lord. They are both nurses and had discussed the matter of calling with Sister Wang. The time was not yet ripe for them then. But now perhaps the time is ripe. Brother Chao Chi-gwang has been raised up to join the co-workers. This brother studied at the Baptist Seminary in Hwang County. Now he is preaching the gospel around Si-Shiang. Brother Chang Tien-ren is now working for the Lord in Yi County. They all came with Brothers Chang Tze-jieh, Kuo Bu-yueh, and Chao Bi-chen to meet with us in Chefoo. Then Brother Chang Tze-jieh went to Tsingtao. He is still there. Brother Chao Bi-chen went to Tsinan and intends to stay there for some time. Brother Kuo Bu-yueh left for Tientsin and is now in Peking. Presently, four sister co-workers are in Chefoo&mdash;Soong, Ang, Lee, and Wang.</p><p>Concerning the literature work, we have not taken care of The Christian properly during the past few years (the responsibility being mainly with me). But more and more I have the inward feeling that this magazine is necessary. May the Lord bless it and grant that it be published once every two months as scheduled. The Lord has mainly shown me the truth of the kingdom during the last year. In Peking and Chefoo I have turned the attention of the brothers and sisters to the pursuit of the kingdom. I have the intention of making the next few issues of The Christian special issues, concentrating on the gospel of the kingdom. I also feel to write on some simple subjects and something related to prayer.</p><p>Has Brother Nee left for the United States yet? I have not corresponded with him for a long time! I wonder when he will be back. I deeply desire to be taught by him again. I read one piece of news from a Brethren magazine, The Witness, which spoke of Mr. Nee's testimony for the Lord abroad. The listeners had a very good impression of him. Thank the Lord! I intend to prepare some articles for The Christian here. The Lord willing, I will go to Tsingtao, Yi-Du, Gao-Mi, and Tsinan after the Chinese New Year and visit the brothers and sisters there. The Lord's grace be with you.</p><p>Brother Witness Lee, January 17</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Watchman Nee, England</h2><p>My work here has witnessed much blessing. I hope that everything bears eternal value before the Lord. More and more I feel the need for the natural man to be bound. When we lose our freedom, we will have the power of life. Do you agree with me? My concern about the co-workers is that not too many know what their natural strength is, much less how to deny it. I sigh for purity for myself and seek to be without any mixture. May the Lord grant us the grace.</p><p>Brother Watchman Nee</p><p>P.S. My concern all these years has been that brothers who have come in after us have not learned the cross; they do not know the corruption of the flesh. They lack the experience of the hollow of Jacob's thigh being touched. They need revelation, and they need to be touched by God so that their flesh will experience an irreparable blow that makes them lame for the rest of their life. When we passed through the Lord's dealings, we did not treasure these dealings. When we see the need in others, we realize how much these dealings are necessary. I intend to leave England for America on February 4. I am still translating Rethinking Our Work [The Normal Christian Church Life]. I will return home from America. If there is the need for me to return earlier, please write, and I will come back earlier. My correspondence address is: c/o Thomas Look & Son, Paris via Siberia.</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Miss Elizabeth Fischbacher</h2><p>Brother Luan:</p><p>I was greatly comforted to receive your letter today. I am now quite free and am quite happy to write several messages for you. As I settle down to write, I may be able to give you a brief outline of all these messages. Please allow me to first sincerely thank you for your letter and tell you how my heart is encouraged whenever I receive news from you and the dear brothers and sisters in China. Thank the Lord that He has given all the glory to the name of His Son! This is true even in this age of tribulation and confusion. Since Brother Nee arrived in England, the Lord has given me many opportunities to meet with him and to find out the many things that are happening in China. God has blessed many souls in this country through our brother, among whom I am one. I praise God for the help Brother Nee has rendered us.</p><p>Since my departure from your country two years ago, the Lord has shown me many things concerning spiritual pressure and conflict. Through these experiences, the Lord has been leading me to know Him in a deeper way and has been revealing His great and eternal purpose in a clearer way. He has given me much light for my pathway. I believe that His will is to lead me back to China in the near future. It may be at the end of this year. I hope to go to Norway in three to four weeks, and from there to Denmark and Sweden. I should be back by the first of November. Unless the Lord gives me clear guidance, I will not return to England before November, because He has assigned many things for me to do in the Scandinavian Peninsula. After November I intend to stay in England for a few weeks and then go to China with Miss Deck. We cannot be sure about the future, but if we take our steps according to the Lord's will, He will reveal His will to us in a clear way. How my heart rejoices at the thought that I will see you soon and will be discussing the things related to the increase of the kingdom of heaven in China.</p><p>Miss Deck is now in London. She hopes to go to Scandinavia with me. Miss X is working with the Lord, and the Lord has blessed her testimony in Denmark. In October there will be conferences in Denmark, and some have invited me to go as a speaker. I put much emphasis on prayer and believe that God will do a new thing for His own church in this country. Please join me in prayer for this so that I can accomplish all of His will during my stay in Norway and Sweden and then return to China. May the Lord accomplish everything according to His own will. Please give my warm regards to Mrs. Luan and your daughter and to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Elizabeth Fischbacher, September 1, 1938</p><h2 class="head2">Footsteps of Brothers Hu and Hsu,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>From the upper course of the Nu River around Dah-Dah in Gung-Shan County, Brother Hu and I descended to Gu-Dah around Shang-Pa County. We spent over a month passing through eight places. All eight places were areas where Brother Hu once labored. We had to go through on foot. In each place we stayed for a minimum of two or three days and a maximum of seven or eight days. There are about two thousand baptized nominal Christians in this area. However, we met only a few hundred of them, and most of them are not genuinely regenerated. A few of them are saved, but unclear about the truth of salvation. These people have given up demon worship and have demonstrated faith in prayer for healing. Yet there is an element of superstition in them. This is not a judgment upon them, because they have never heard the clear gospel or other truths. During a month's work, thirty to forty people raised their hands at various times to confess that they believed and had received eternal life. Their hearts are sincere and simple. When they say that they want to believe, it means that they genuinely believe. At the beginning some did not understand. But thank the Lord, He opened their eyes, and they began to rejoice greatly. One elderly man in Gu-Dah jumped up when he understood the redemption of the cross, the effectiveness of the blood, the grace of forgiveness, and the truth of eternal life and shouted, "I've got it!" The Lord's joy filled Him. Those who have been enlightened by the truth wish that we could be with them all the time. They told us that they never heard such a gospel before and implored us to speak more of God's truth to them. Thank the Lord that the door of the work has opened. May the Lord greatly bless His own work. We are but unprofitable and empty vessels.</p><p>Since the door of the work is open before Brother Hu and I (there are other places which do not have any believers, but which have requested that we come and preach, sell books, and teach the truth), we feel that we need to prepare the necessary provisions for the work. Before I set out on my journey, I will send my wife to K'un-ming and shop for necessary supplies for the evangelistic work. I will return by February of the next Chinese New Year. If any co-workers wish to join me, they should come as quickly as possible. If the Lord permits, we will pass Nu River, Gung-Shan, and Gao-Li into En-Mei, Kai-Jiang, and Pien-Ma and work there. I have heard that this region is more desolate and that the people are wilder. Please pray so that I do not waste my time or occupy my place in vain. May the Lord gain what He wants to gain in me, and may He enable me to take up the cross to follow Him. Amen. I will not elaborate. Peace be to you. Greetings to Brother Yu Cheng-hwa and all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, K'un-ming, December 21</p><p>(Last November, while I was in K'un-ming, Brother Hsu was there with his family. The few co-workers had one or two meetings together, in which we asked Brother Hsu to report a little about the work in the remote border regions. I asked of the need there and what he would need to bring with him when he goes. He said they first need literature, Bibles, Questions and Answers on the Truth (published by the China Inland Mission), and Hymns in the Li-Suh language. They can purchase only the four Gospels and Acts in the Li-Suh language from the Bible Society. The other books of the Bible have not been published yet. There is no place to purchase hymnbooks and Questions and Answers, etc. If they want them, we will have to print them ourselves. The Lord willing, Brother Hsu is willing to translate Bible Studies for Beginners into the Li-Suh language. This will help them learn to read (they have no language of their own) as well as make them clear concerning the basic truth. We will try our best to buy some hymnbooks, which will be usable temporarily. Before Bible Studies for Beginners is translated, the four Gospels and Acts can be used.</p><p>Second, he needs a sturdy accordion for use in the evangelization work. Pioneering evangelism is very difficult; there is no suitable place to gather people to listen to the word. But the Yee tribes love music. Hence, an accordion is a must.</p><p>Third, there is the need for lamps and oil. It is hard to get these things now. Oil is expensive and difficult to transport. We intend to send homemade candles in its place. The work there is conducted mostly in the evenings.</p><p>Fourth, there is the need for some kind of medicine. The Yee tribes have many kinds of diseases and infirmities, such as malaria, common colds, eye diseases, parasites, boils, epidemics, cholera, etc. We will furnish them with some common medicines to meet the immediate needs. We are not trusting in medicine for their healing, but this is a means for us to draw near to them and to provide them an opportunity to hear the gospel.</p><p>Fifth, we will purchase a tent which holds three to four people for use in their traveling. This will alleviate some of the suffering of camping in the rain in the mountains.</p><p>Sixth, they need one or two mules for carrying luggage; the men can walk&mdash;Editor's note.)</p><h2 class="head2">Work in Amoy and Kulangsu</h2><p>The situation in Kulangsu is the same as before. There has been an increase in number. The place is calm, and there is no lack of food, except the prices are somewhat expensive. Brother James Chen is still here. Two Bible studies were held recently. First, we studied the Song of Songs when Brother Wu Ren-jieh passed by. Second, Brother James Chen conducted a study on the subject of salvation and the kingdom. The number was quite large. Last week we had a baptismal meeting. A few who were once deep in Buddhism were released. Glory to His name. The number of refuge centers has been reduced, but we still have much opportunity for work. The meeting in Amoy has resumed, but the number is not large. Communication with inland provinces has not fully been restored, and traveling is inconvenient. Sister Yien-tse's health has improved, but Sister Yuen-yee is still bedridden.</p><p>Sister Chan Wan-chin, November 29</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Liao Ong Yu-bing, Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear Sister Lee in the Lord:</p><p>I hope that you have arrived in Shanghai by now. A few days ago Sister Bao Hsu-min wrote and expressed her desire to go to Shanghai for some edification. This stirred up my desire to go to Shanghai. In looking back, I think we were fed too well; now we are too hungry. By myself, I am unable to undertake any of the work here. But thank the Lord that everything is of Him. I can only follow Him and consider His work. The brothers have not set out for the north, because their traveling documents are not yet ready. But all the localities are eagerly expecting their visit. Sister Chou Gi-chen has been here for several days already. Thank the Lord that I now have one more sister who is one with me. Peace to you.</p><p>Sister Yu-bing, December 18</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brothers Chen and Chai,<br />Fukien Province</h2><p>A few weeks ago the co-workers sent you X dollars from Chuenchow to be used for relief to brothers in need. I wonder whether you have received it. (We have received it&mdash;Editor.) The regions along the coast in Fukien province have witnessed the clear working of the Holy Spirit during the past year. However, if there are no proper workers, how can we have proper work? Even if we work, everything is futile if we do not accomplish God's most excellent will. For this reason we desire very much that you come and help us. We have written and mentioned the work in Dong-Yuen. Thank the Lord that He brought us through. Thirteen people were baptized, and the Lord's table was started. There is now a testimony of the local church. Glory to His name!</p><p>Brothers Chen Ke-san, Chai Tse-chung, October 27</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Chang Kwang-rong, Chekiang Province</h2><p>After the meetings in Shi-Si in Tai-Shun, I went with Brother David to Ju-Si. He received a special commission from the Lord the next day and left to go to Tsen-Shia-Kwan. After staying in Tsen-Shia-Kwan for five days, I went to Ding-Bu-Tou, Yueh-Hu-Yang, and Wan-Yao. Now I am in Chiao-Dun-Men. Tomorrow I will be in Kwan-Mei and Wu-Tai- Shan. Everywhere I go we will have a few days of meetings. I have been taught and am now clear that the ministry God has assigned to me is not to gather many people and conduct big meetings. Rather, it is to visit small places and to have home meetings every evening according to the condition of each place. Drawing near to the Lord, studying the Word, and mutually asking and answering questions in this way gives everyone a chance to touch God. From my experience, this affords the Spirit more freedom to work in the meetings. This is what I am doing. May the Lord make me faithful.</p><p>Brother Chang Kwang-rong, January 31</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Hwa Shi-bin, Chekiang Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Brother Dah-Wei:</p><p>After the conference in Ning-Hai, I went to two meetings in the villages in Shi-Pu at the invitation of Brother Hwang Mei-tong. Recently, I joined Brother Lou Chuan-en to work in the denomination in Hun-Si-Kou. I would be happy to see any so-called results of the work manifested at the judgment seat of the Lord. The responsible brothers here hope to join Brother Chang Kwang-rong to do some work and render the brothers some help in the cities and the villages when spring arrives. Some believers in Shi-Pu need your edification. Brother Hwang Mei-tong charged me to request your prayer for him. Recently, I have been learning the lesson of a prayer life. Dear beloved Lord, although we are separated in different parts, may Your pillar of cloud guide us all the time so that our ways, our life, and our work will fall within Your will, amen. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Hwa Shi-bin, September 14, 1938</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I left Ning-Hai for Sin-Chang at the end of July. On August 2, which was a Lord's Day, I went to Chang-Loh in Sheng County for three days of meetings. About thirty brothers who came from Shen County and Dong-Yang were seeking the truth. The atmosphere was good. May the Lord lead them on. On the eighth I arrived at Wu-Yi. I went to Yao-Chi the next day to work together with Brother Ding Keh-chang. We prayed and served the Lord together and testified for the Lord day and night. Thank the Lord! The Lord willing, we will first do some work in the villages, and we will wait on any large-scale meetings in the cities until you come to Wu-Yi. I heard that Brother Chou Shing-yi is resting in Ping-Yang due to illness. Please give my sincere regards to him. If Brother Chang Kwang-rong returns to Ping-Yang from Tai-Shun, please give him my regards. May the Lord's grace be merciful to me so that I can be dealt with through this coming trip, so that my self-life may be lost, and so that the spring of life can flow out from His fullness. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Hwa Shi-bin, October 3, 1938, Ning-Hai, Chekiang province</p><p>(We received Brother Hwa's letter on February 2, stating that he had returned from Jin-Hwa over ten days ago.

I hope to stay in the countryside for two to three months. Next spring I will pay a visit to Chi-Li and then go to Dah-Yung. Thank the Lord that my health has been recovered. I expect to be able to withstand the hardship of traveling. By summer of next year, I may be able to work in Yuan-Ling and Chen-Xi. The only thing I am clear of is the first step. I will have to wait for His guidance concerning the rest.</p><p>Brother Han Fu-shen, December 31, 1938</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Sister Luh Tsi-tsien,<br />Szechuan Province</h2><p>Since the time I sent out my last letter from Fu-Shan, three months have passed. During these three months the Lord has given me evidence of His grace in everything. This does not refer to the result of my work. (The success or failure of the work does not have much to do with me personally.) I am referring to spiritual experience. God has shown me the evil and corruption of the flesh. The flesh can only please men; it cannot please God. God is the One who searches man's inward parts. Outwardly, we may be completely separated from the world. But inwardly, we are still mixed up with it. There must at least be once when God deals with our self and the flesh in a deep way. When we see the Lord being hung on the cross, we cannot refrain from speaking from our heart, "Lord, You have paid such a high price for me! You are worthy of everything from me." After I consecrated myself unconditionally to Him, God began to show me how my way is one of loneliness and dejection. My previous experiences were something outward, but now His real work has begun. We met with the sisters in Chungking for four days. Although they initiated the meetings, God showed me my own needs. Hence, this meeting was altogether for me. During the past two weeks, under the Lord's leading, I came to preach the gospel in Jiang-Bei in Brother Wu Fuh-chu's home. His wife was recently saved. We will leave Chungking after the middle of January. We may go to Bei-Pei, or we may travel to the south. In the meeting hall at 9 Garden Road, there were gospel meetings every night from the second to the seventh of this month. There was quite an enthusiastic attendance, and the seats were all filled. The main speaker was an American by the name of Brother X. Please do not forget to pray for me, Sister Ma, and all the brothers and sisters in Chungking.</p><p>Sister Luh Tsi-tsien, January 4</p><h2 class="head2">The Work in Hong Kong and Macao</h2><p>Thank the Lord! He has been gracious to us, leading Mr. Luan, senior Mrs. Nee, and Miss Wang to conduct a conference in Macao. We received the help, and we saw God saving sinners. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth of this month, there were three consecutive days of baptisms. Altogether eighteen brothers and sisters were baptized. A good number of sisters have changed since the ten days of conference. They have truly realized that they can no longer neglect spiritual things. I left Macao with Miss Wang to come to Hong Kong on the afternoon of the nineteenth. The Lord willing, I will return to Macao in two or three weeks. Brother Liao Bo-hui wrote to Hong Kong from Lung-Men. Thank the Lord that He has kept him in safety.</p><p>Sister Ro-shen, December 22</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Brother Faithful Luk, Singapore</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Over twenty brothers and sisters were baptized into the Lord recently in Yung-Ping and other places. May the Lord preserve them to the end, and may they obey the Lord in everything. At this moment Sister Chang Shou-jen is rendering some help to the sisters there. The correspondence address is [omitted]. The brothers in Penang are all at peace. Thank the Lord! I cannot go to Surabaya this year. Please pray about this. Can one of you sisters come to Southeast Asia? Please do not neglect us. There are many needs among the sisters. Sister Huang Yu-mei is in New Foochow; I cannot go there to join her work yet. I feel very lonely and feel that I owe much to the Lord's grace. I dearly hope that some co-workers can come and work here. Peace to you!</p><p>Brother Faithful Luk, November 18</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Tomorrow I may have to go to Penang. From there I will decide whether I will go to Sitiawan or to Thailand. There are two sisters in Thailand from Swatow who are living in Pu-Ji Island near Penang. There are 170,000 to 180,000 Chinese in that place, mostly southern Fukienese. I intend to take a trip there. Please pray for my future. Sister Ding is still resting in Singapore in the house of Dr. Hsie Wen-lung. Peace to you!</p><p>Brother Faithful Luk, December 28</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Wu Ren-jieh, Manila</h2><p>Through the Lord's good will and His commission, I came to the Philippines for His work as scheduled. Thank the Lord that His Spirit moved ahead of me. Not long after I arrived, I encountered Him in many things. I was sick for ten days after I arrived, because of my maladjustment to the environment. However, it was actually the base attack of Satan. Thank God that He always leads us into victory in the Christ. Hallelujah! Glory to Him! I need greater dealings, brighter revelation, and deeper knowledge. Spiritual work is indeed most serious, proper, and real. Unfortunately, we have worked foolishly, capriciously, and loosely in the past, and we have truly come short of the glory of the Lord. Except for the Lord's mercy and endurance, our one talent would have been withdrawn and given to those who have ten talents. Thank the Lord that He is willing to give us grace, and by grace we are still able to go on. The victory of Joshua at the bottom of the mountain was due to the lifted hands of Moses and the supporting hands of Aaron and Hur on the top of the mountain. Please pray much for the work in the Philippines. I hope that the Lord will give us some Filipino and Western co-workers, release much truth, and build up the scriptural local churches. In Christ there is no difference in nationality, race, and social status. If we only preach to the Chinese, is our work not somewhat unbalanced? Sister Chai Teh-an is still here. May the Lord open the door to the work among the Westerners and the Filipinos.

He has been shuttling between Ch'ang-Teh and Yi-Yang, and he knows the condition in that area firsthand. He and I have been seeking the Lord's guidance in oneness concerning the way to distribute the money you sent. I was filled with thanksgiving to the Lord when Brother Kuo related how the saints from Ch'ang-sha escaped from danger. Sister Chao Shi-chi intended to stay in Ch'ang-sha but eventually left with Brother Yen Wen-shiang's family. We heard that the bombing in Ch'ang-Teh was quite devastating. Nothing has happened where I am. In particular, the neighborhoods around the homes of Brothers Shang, Liu, Yang, and Shen have been burned because of the bombing, but the burning stopped at their doorstep. The Lord is truly the refuge to the saints.</p><p>Brother Yang Dai, December 14</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I intended to send money through Brothers Liu Ai-Wu, Yang Dai, and Zhang Gun-jih to be distributed to saints in difficulty throughout Hunan. However, Brother Liu has gone to Ch'ang-Teh, and Brother Zhang has gone to Dong-Ping in An-Hwa. Brother Yang moved into the countryside sixty miles from the city of Yi-Yang. Thank the Lord, I met a Mr. Lung Rong-hwa of the Lutheran Church on my way from Ch'ang-Teh to Ch'ang-sha, and he was willing to send the money to his home. By the time I reached his home, I was able to cash it back. I had not intended to involve myself in this matter. As I walked back to Ch'ang-sha the next day, there was a storm on the way, and it was difficult to go on. I returned to Lung's house and left my belongings there, choosing instead to walk to Brother Yang's place which was sixty miles from Yi-Yang. I was happy to see him and his wife. When we talked about the money, Brother Yang suggested sending it to Ch'ang-Teh to let Brother Liu decide on its use. I felt that this was not the right thing to do, and I advised Brother Yang against it. The instability of the political situation has caused mail correspondence to become extremely unreliable. A letter from Ch'ang-Teh to Tao-Yuen, which is only sixty miles away by road, takes a week to get there. If the brothers did not see each other, the mailing back and forth could take more than a month, not to mention the loss in postal fees. Even if the money arrived in Yi-Yang, I was not certain that there would be anyone who could distribute it to the countryside. This is why I persuaded Brother Yang to distribute the money immediately.</p><p>When Yueh-Yang capitulated, all the brothers who had jobs before the city capitulated were given two or three months' salary in advance before they dispersed. Some brothers are still drawing a salary even now. Therefore, they do not have much need. After the great fire in Ch'ang-sha, most of the brothers and sisters left. Only four sisters who worked at an orphanage of a Westerner remained. Although the orphanage was burned, the livelihood of the four sisters was taken care of by the Westerner. The ones who are finding it difficult to make ends meet are the saints who have escaped to Yi-Yang, An-Hwa, Ch'ang-Teh, and Yuan-Ling (with a few poor local ones). Their suffering is untold. In the past they have always been distributors of money to others, taking care of others rather than meeting their own needs. When I found out their true condition and after much prayer, I had to give the money to them, according to their practical needs.</p><p>Yueh-Yang capitulated, and Ch'ang-sha was burned, but the Lord's children left in time. No one was stuck. The Lord has been gracious to His children.</p><p>Brother Kuo Jen-yung, December 14</p><p>(Brother Kuo, we thank the Lord for the way the money was distributed. From this matter we see that our God never delays!&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">An-Hwa, Hunan Province</h2><p>Brother Zhang Gun-jih's family and I arrived in Tung-Ping from Yi-Yang on November 13. The Lord guided us all the way. Brother Zhang has been sick for more than two months. Presently, he is not in critical condition, but he still needs the prayers of all the brothers and sisters. The fever has not left, and there is still much coughing.</p><p>Brother Yu Yien-chuan, November 26</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'ang-Teh, Hunan Province</h2><p>After spending some time to recuperate, and through your prayer and concern, I can ask now that you turn your prayers into praise, because God has completely healed me, one who has so little faith in Him. I came out of the Yi-Yang hospital with God's promise. Although my fever was gone and the test on the sputum was negative, I still had many ailments&mdash;headaches, stuffed nose, bronchitis, etc.&mdash;when I was in the hospital. I weighed only ninety-seven pounds and figured that I would need over half a year for recovery. But God's thoughts and ways are higher than mine! In early September Brother Yang Dai came back to Yi-Yang from Ch'ang-sha. He had a letter from a brother in Tientsin, which spoke of a sudden tragedy in his life that caused him to become very sick. The Lord enlightened him, and he realized that he had not obeyed Him. In desperation he called on the Lord and confessed his sins, and God gave him a promise from Proverbs 4:22. His sickness then left without the assistance of any medicine. The letter did not affect me much at the time. But as I was praying one day, I felt that the Lutheran Hospital was not doing my health any good, and that I might have to pass through the suffering of surgery if I went to the Shing-Ya Hospital. It seemed that the best thing was to ask for God's healing. At that moment the promise of that brother entered me. I did not know then that I would receive the healing medicine by faith. I only knew about God's healing and decided not to remain in the hospital.</p><p>After leaving the hospital, relief was not as steady as it was in the hospital. My temperature was the same, but I could get up and walk around a little and do a little work. While faith was just beginning to establish itself, it was tested. Brother Zhang Gun-jih, who was living in the same house, came down with typhoid fever. He said that when he had a fever earlier, he realized that it was the result of forcing himself to work before he was completely healed. He also said that he learned the lesson that one has to deal with sickness as one deals with sin: the dealing must be thorough. I was afraid after I heard this, and I prayed that the Lord would show me His will and whether or not leaving the hospital was something I had forced upon myself. In the middle of the night, I saw an elderly man with a shining garment walk to my bed and put something white on my right hand. He put his body over mine and spoke something softly like a prayer and then left. I cried out loudly and woke up, and I felt a strange scent permeating my being. I felt that this dream matched His promise very well (Prov. 4:22). The next day I got up and worked as usual. Of course, I did not have the assurance to travel a long distance or to engage myself in difficult work. When Ch'ang-sha was sacked, I retreated with the brothers to Ch'ang-Teh. I had to take a sedan chair. When I arrived in Ch'ang-Teh, the trial became more fierce. Sometimes the cold wind would become very severe, and sometimes I had to walk a long way. In the past I would cough even when I put on a lot of clothing and would feel tired even when I walked a few miles. Now I do not have to wear a fur coat in snowy weather and do not cough at all. I am not tired even when I walk over twenty miles. Faith has been tested, and the fact has proven itself that I am completely healed and recovered to my former health! Hallelujah! He alone is the One who calls things not being as being and who resurrects men from the dead! He alone has done wonderful things, answering the prayers of all the brothers and sisters!</p><p>Recently, I have been resting before the Lord and learning to hear His voice. Hebrews 10:5 and 7 have often touched my heart. Since He has prepared a sound body for me, I should walk according to His will. The ministry which He intends for me to receive from Him has been recorded in the Scriptures, the ministry of feeding the lambs and caring for orphans in tribulation. Providentially, I have seen God's provisions. I left the orphanage last year. Since then Brother Kuo Jen-yung has also received a burden for serving the orphans; he has suggested that we embark on this work together. I thought the time was not appropriate, and I suggested that we pray more. When I returned to Ch'ang-Teh, Brother Kuo came from Ch'ang-sha a few days later. He had thought about going to K'un-ming; instead, he returned to Yi-Yang. He came to Ch'ang-sha on the tenth of the month with the intention of traveling from here to Yunnan. After he left, I felt the meeting in Ch'ang-sha and the work of the orphanage deeply pressing upon my spirit. As a result I wrote a letter to him asking whether he had the same leading. I intend to move into the city and give myself to recovering the meeting and to starting a school for the poor on a small scale (gathering less than ten pupils at first). Presently, I am still waiting to see whether this is His pure and good and acceptable will.</p><p>Recently, I received a letter from Sister Chang Ai-teh. She did not escape during the great fire. During the most dangerous moments, she could only trust in the Lord. There was burning on both sides of the Faith Orphanage, but God protected them with His mighty power. When the fire spread next door, the wind turned and the orphanage was preserved, even though there was fire all around. Many unbelievers came to know our God after the fire, and they acknowledged Him as the real and living One. Hallelujah!</p><p>Although the ones meeting in Yi-Yang have been scattered, Brother Chiu Chung-seng and Sister Tzo Teh-en are still there testifying for the Lord in the surrounding areas. The Lord is responsible for protecting them. Brother Yang Dai is still residing in the countryside, but he may move back into the city soon. Brother Zhang Gun-jih moved to Dong-Ping in An-Hwa along with the Lutheran High School.</p><p>Law and order have gradually returned in Ch'ang-Teh. I personally witnessed the bombing on the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth of last month. The devastation is great within the city. Although the area around the meeting hall and the Living Stream Teahouse have all been turned to rubble, these two houses have not suffered any damage. Not even a piece of glass in the meeting hall was shattered. A few houses behind the teahouse were bombed, but the bombs did not explode. God has been gracious to us and has perfected the faith of His children in a wonderful way. There are not too many in the meetings, but we still have the Lord's table on the Lord's Day. Brother Han settled in Chou-Shi-Tzen and will be resting there for a while. He will travel to north Hunan and work there next spring. Brothers Shang and Zhu are living with him. Brother Shang said that he has received much light by reading the biography of Madam Guyon, and that he is learning the lesson of not working for the Lord. Brother Zhu still needs your prayer!</p><p>He never fails! He is glad to grant us the grace! May praise and thanksgiving be to Him forever, amen!</p><p>Brother Liu Ai-Wu, December 26</p><h2 class="head2">Tsinan, Shantung Province</h2><p>Brother Chao Bi-chen returned to Tsinan from Tsingtao. Beginning on January 9 there will be a week of prayer, followed by a week of perfecting meetings, and then a week of home meetings. The time for all the meetings will be from six to eight o'clock. May the Lord bless all the meetings. Brother Witness Lee will pass by on the railway line before the Chinese New Year and will probably be able to come to Tsinan. May the Lord bless his footsteps. There are about twenty brothers and sisters at the table meeting in remembrance of the Lord. The atmosphere before the Lord is somewhat depressed at the present moment. There is a lack of brothers and sisters who can go out to visit others. May the Lord raise up some among us. Please pray for us.</p><p>Brothers representing the meeting in Tsinan,<br />Chen Shi-chen, Ren Yi-cheng, Yu Jia-chi</p><h2 class="head2">Chefoo, Shantung Province</h2><p>Greetings to those who are members together in the Lord:</p><p>A brother in the Lord learned from Issue No. 11 of The Open Door in the "A Word on Behalf of the Editor" column that the saints in Chekiang and Kiangsu had needs because of the war, and that there was also a need of supplies for saints in Szechuan, Hunan, and Hankow. He realized that we are all one Body in Christ, and he was willing to participate in helping the saints. Enclosed please find a check in the amount of X dollars. Please distribute one fifth of this amount to the saints in need in Chekiang and Kiangsu and the rest to saints in need in Szechuan, Hunan, and Hankow. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Zhia Shen, October 12</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from the Offering Box</h2><p>Brothers in the mutual love of the Lord!</p><p>May He receive the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus, forever and ever, amen. May the Lord lead us all to the stage of Song of Songs 4:9. May His grace, mercy, lovingkindness, compassion, power, authority, and blood always overshadow us until He returns. May the Lord hide us in Himself until that day, amen. May He receive the rightful place in the church, and may He be exalted in the church. May the Lord's redeemed say, "Give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good, for His lovingkindness is forever." Enclosed please find X dollars of the Lord's money. May the Lord distribute it according to His will, pleasure, and need. May the Lord gain the rightful glory, and may the glory of His victory be displayed everywhere, amen.</p><p>A child in the Father's house<br />December 4, 1938</p><p>(The above envelope was received from the offering box in Peking. Half of the amount has gone to the needy saints, and the other half to co-workers in various places&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Chou County, Shantung Province</h2><p>Brother Chen Bo-heng passed away as a result of the war's turmoil. This brother had a pure heart for the Lord. But the Lord allowed him to go first. Not only are the believers grieved about him, but even the unbelievers felt sorrowful about his death. Brother Sun Shi-bih returned to Chou County and has temporary lodging. I returned to Dong-Tan-Dien Village. There is still a Lord's table meeting every Lord's Day at Si-Kwan in Chou County. The correspondence address is [omitted]. Presently, Brother Sun and I are engaged only in some personal evangelistic work. We are also studying the Bible, praying, and taking turns meeting in the saints' homes. Please pray for the brothers in Chou County so that we can walk with God in all things and so that glory can go to the Triune God.</p><p>Brother Liu Tien-min, November 3</p><h2 class="head2">Lin-Zi, Shantung Province</h2><p>Since the capitulation of Shu County in April, I have been living in the countryside and learning the lesson of prayer with the brothers and sisters. Although we passed through the valley of the shadow of death, we feared no evil because the Lord was with us. The Lord brought me through the past year almost exclusively through the word in John 17:2a and Isaiah 54:16. As far as the work goes, it is difficult to preach the gospel or to gather any meetings. But we still engage ourselves in visitation. The brothers agreed that I should return home from Shu County on November 21. I stayed in Tsinan for five days, fellowshipping and breaking bread with the saints. On the twenty-eighth, I returned home. Through the Lord's dealing and stripping, I have come to realize my emptiness, uselessness, and the need to prostrate myself before the Lord and to look to His mercy. Since returning home I have been waiting for the Lord's revelation and guidance, seeking to walk in His will and to glorify His name.</p><p>Brother Yuan Lin-shu, December 3</p><h2 class="head2">Mo-Gan-Shan, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Miss Fu-en:</p><p>Someone is leaving for Hungchow tomorrow. Therefore, I am jotting a few lines and asking my friend to relate the rest to you. This will save me another letter. May the almighty God be with all the saints, amen. (1) We are happy to hear that Brother Tang Shou-ling has returned to Shanghai. Please send our greetings to him. (2) Miss Yeh Chui- chung had asked for prayer for Miss Kao. Now she is saved and is diligently studying the Bible. She also has a good understanding. We ask that God heal her sickness. Perhaps this one is a chosen vessel of God. The Lord has been doing all the work in the past. May He continue to grant us grace. Please do not cease your prayer. (3) Thank the Lord for bringing Miss Ruth Lee and the other sisters back to Shanghai. Our two families, Sun and Yu, are safe in the mountains. There is also an opportunity for us to do some work here. Indeed, we have been in the experience of 1 Corinthians 2:9. Praise His name. (4) We have now moved to [omitted]. Because of the school situation for Ming-Bao, the mountains are comparatively safer now. (5) We have received The Christian from Brother Ho Yueh-chiao. Thank you. In the future, please send any new books to us. The mail route is not clear, and delay is unavoidable.</p><p>Sun Wen-yuen, Chen Hsiao-ai, Chen Yao-jen<br />January 13, 1939</p><h2 class="head2">Lan-Si, Chekiang</h2><p>I read about two sums of money in Brother Chao Jing-hwai's letter from Chefoo in Issue No. 13 of The Open Door. On October 1 Brother Lan Tsi-yi wrote to me concerning the same two amounts. Brother Chang Hwei-zhi wrote on October 7 that the wire transfer fee was too high and that he could transfer the amount to us through his account. After further investigation I learned of the circumstances of the intended recipients: Brother Wang Fu-tang's family moved to Yi-Yang and Mr. Yu Teh-hwa was killed by Japanese soldiers. I wrote back to Brother Lan on the twentieth and told him everything. There is no way to forward these two sums. I have not taken out the money from Brother Chang Hwei-zhi's account because I am unable to do a transfer. Please let Brother Lan know about this. On the fourteenth of last month, Lan-Si was bombed for the seventh time. None of God's children were hurt. The houses of two sisters were damaged, but no one was hurt. Over ten brothers and sisters were in the meeting hall, including Brother Mong-tsao and I. Although the glass was shattered and the ceiling fell down, we were not hurt. The flesh suffered some shock, but inwardly we were still at peace. Thank and praise the Father!</p><p>Brother Ma Chuan-foo, en route, January 8</p><h2 class="head2">Ning-Po, Chekiang</h2><p>Brother Yueh-chiao in the Lord:</p><p>Most of the brothers and sisters in Ning-Po are still hiding in the countryside. A few saints have been added to the ones in the city. A few of them would even like to gather together for meetings. They have discussed the matter with me. I also feel quite lonely, especially on the Lord's Day. Presently, however, I only see the need of the members and have not yet discerned the need of the Lord. Hence, I dare not act rashly according to my zeal and set up meetings. May the Lord's mercy and timing come quickly. May He gather His saved children to build up His own Body so that all the members can function according to each one's part. This is our prayer. Please pray for us! Brother Wang Shu-fa from Ping-Yang wrote that he is clear concerning the Lord's calling and will conclude his business next term and then devote himself to serve the church, working in areas around Ping-Yang. Peace to you in the Lord.

How blessed we are. Brother Chang delivered messages concerning the importance and difference between the salvation of the spirit, soul, and body. The conference lasted from January 27 to February 5. Every day we had over seventy people. In the last meeting the Lord gave us a great release. May glory be to God.

We can only say that everything that happened before was God's work; man did not try to do anything. Everything here is good. Brother Tang gave us much help during this period. May the Lord reward him much on that day. There was a conference from October 24-30. Brother Tang was responsible. Praise the Lord that He has blessed His own work. The brothers and sisters were all edified, and the number in attendance was great.</p><p>Because of the peculiar situation here, we feel that workers should be stationed here all the time. We have Brother Tang's approval and have written to Brother Stephen Kaung, inviting him to come and work among us and to shepherd us. We have not received an answer from Brother Kaung yet. May God lead him to us soon. Please pray about this. Presently, the house where the meetings are held belongs to Brother Luk. In order to facilitate the negotiation of affairs related to the meeting, it became necessary to ask Brother Luk to be responsible for the affairs of the church. Later, we were given the consent of Brother Tang to ask Brother Luk to take up this responsibility. We would like you to know that there are now five responsible brothers. May the Lord be with you and bless your work. If the Lord delays His coming, we will surely have opportunity to see each other again. Please do not forget to pray for us. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Brothers Mei Tui-an, Lee Yun-sien, Liu Kwo-hwa,<br />Ge Shien-shen, Luk Tsi-shun, November 3</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Brother Shou-ling in the Lord:</p><p>Thank and praise the Lord that I, who drifted away in 1938, am now back in the Father's house. When I was in Hankow, you exhorted me twice in the name of the Lord, but I was still stubborn. However, God's love was upon me, and I would like to relate what happened. In December of last year, I was busy with my own business and with the world. Sometimes I had to work late and did not get home until two or three o'clock in the morning. On the night of December 26, I could not sleep, and on the morning of the twenty-seventh, I realized that I had a fever. By the afternoon, the fever was higher. My whole body was weak with chills. Fortunately, two brothers in my house were doctors. Another brother next door was also a doctor. They diagnosed that I was infected with some kind of virus, and they suggested that I rest for two weeks. While I was laying on my bed, the Lord continued to send those who were His to come and visit me. His love was displayed at every minute. Our God is worthy of praise and thanksgiving. On the afternoon of the thirtieth, one brother came to visit me, and we prayed together. While I was praying, my body was numb and my chest was pressed with unspeakable weight. It was painful. The faith given by God enabled us to pray. When we stopped our prayer, my faith led me to measure my temperature because I believed that God had healed me. When I measured it, I found that my lingering temperature was gone. The terrible virus had left. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Brother, my past stubbornness truly offended God and the brothers and sisters, as well as my whole family. May the Lord forgive me again because of His beloved Son Christ! I wish you well, and may peace be unto your house.</p><p>Brother Yuen How-tsai, January 2, 1939</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'eng-tu, Szechuan Province</h2><p>Thank and praise the Lord for answering our prayer and for preparing a suitable meeting place for us. The church meeting was moved from Brother Chao's house and Mrs. Shen's house into the new meeting hall. The house is spacious and the location is central. There are also eight to nine adjacent houses which can be used for hospitality. (They are now filled.) Thank the Lord that He has added more saved ones to the church. We had our fourth and fifth baptism meetings; four brothers and three sisters were added to us. Rev. Tsia Yu-ming recently visited Ch'eng-tu. He has a clear burden for these young brothers and sisters. Soon the winter vacation will begin, and we hope to have a conference lasting a few days. Lately, Brother Chao Rue-tze has been spending his time traveling and inspecting and supervising projects. He is seldom in Ch'eng-tu. Brother Tien Bi-sin's foot disease has been healed. All the brothers and sisters are experiencing the Lord's grace.</p><p>We would like very much to hear your teaching on the reality and practice of the church life. Every time we think of the idea that God is bringing us back to the beginning, our hearts rejoice, and we become stirred up and elated. Yet how fearful and careful we are! May the Lord manifest His glory in weak and unspiritual vessels so that all will see that the exceeding great power is of Him and not of ourselves. The sisters are taking turns having a prayer meeting in their homes on Wednesday afternoon. This began last week. The new address for the meeting hall is [omitted], but the meeting times are the same.</p><p>Brothers Wang Yung-gui, Liu Shi-shun, Ji Tsung-yu<br />January 21, 1939</p><h2 class="head2">Han River, Fukien Province</h2><p>Brother Tien-sin:</p><p>I returned to Han River from Fu-Ching on the twenty- second of this month and am now residing at home. My family is at peace, which is comforting to me. Brother Chen Bi-yin came from Ku-Tien last month and had meetings for a few days. Although it was a brief time, the opportunity was great because many believers were edified and some sinners were saved. Thank the Lord. May all the glory go to His name. Brothers Chen Jai-seng and Cheng Kwang-yu and Sister Weigh Kwang-ying and my niece left for Wu-Tung Village on the sixth of this month. They rented some houses and are engaged in evangelism work. I have heard that over twenty men and women have been saved. Presently, Brother Jai-seng is conducting Bible study meetings in the village to strengthen their faith. Please pray much for the work in Shang-Zi. Greetings to Brother Faithful Luk and his whole family.</p><p>Brother Jia-jeh, October 30, 1938</p><h2 class="head2">An-Hai, South Fukien<br />Sent from Kulangsu to Manila</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>The church in An-Hai (south Fukien) is under the Lord's blessing. There are now over fifty genuinely saved brothers and sisters breaking bread together. Every Lord's Day we have over a hundred people meeting with us. When an air raid came to An-Hai, all the brothers and sisters were able to stand fast in God's grace. Thank the Lord! Please pray much for us. Yesterday, I came to Kulangsu from Chuenchow, and I intend to go to Manila with Brother Wu Ren-jieh.</p><p>Brother Hsu Ching-en, September 5, 1938</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Presently, Brothers Hsu Shi-chuen and Sun Ju-yee are bearing the responsibility of the church before God. Please pray for them so that they will understand God's heart and match His will.</p><p>Brother Chen Ke-san</p><h2 class="head2">Si-Tou</h2><p>Since my return home, I stayed with the co-workers in Ping-Yang for a few months learning to preach the gospel. Last year I was in Brother Wu Siu-liang's house in Tung-Cheng teaching a few children and helping to preach the gospel. God has affirmed the gospel with miracles and wonders, and many people have come to listen, among whom many have believed. It is a blessing for my eyes to be able to behold His work. Thank Him. There was only one household in Tung-Cheng in the beginning, plus a few brothers from out of town. But now there are over a hundred people meeting every Lord's Day. Thank the Lord and glory to Him! The Lord has indeed opened the door of the gospel for His church. I answered the call of the brothers in Si-Tou, which is a few dozen miles from Tung-Cheng, to take a part-time teaching job and to learn to serve the Lord part-time. The Lord's table has been raised up with over ten brothers and sisters. On the Lord's Day there are over thirty people in the meeting. There are two more desolate areas in Fu-Ting that now have churches of God. All the work is the result of the pioneering effort of co-workers from Ping-Yang. I tell you this as an aid to your prayer. The Lord has led Brothers Hwa Shi-bin, David Hsu, and Chang Kwang-rong to work in Ping-Yang, Tai-Shun, and Fu-Ting for a while. Thank the Lord.</p><p>Lin Wei-jung, October 14</p><h2 class="head2">Yu-Si, Fu-Ching, Fukien Province</h2><p>Thank the Lord that He has given us peace so that we can testify to His salvation.

Every meeting has seven to eight persons. Sisters from Kwangtung, Lu Tzi-chan, and Du Ai-jen left here for Chu-Jiang on the afternoon of the twenty-fourth. Mrs. Chiang's family will go to Kuei-yang on the thirtieth. Nan-Meng was burned, but the house of Sister Sun was preserved and did not suffer any damage. I have been waiting and delaying the matter of leaving Kweilin. I am still not clear and cannot decide whether I should leave. Please pray for me so that my footsteps would be in His light and would be preserved by Him. Sister Shu-fang may take up a job at the provincial hospital.

Since Brother Luan, Miss Wang, and the senior Mrs. Nee worked here for a week, over ten brothers and sisters have been baptized into the Lord's name. We truly thank and praise the Lord for this. We hope that the Lord will be gracious to us and set up His own testimony in the near future so that He will gain the glory. Sister Wang was in Hong Kong conducting meetings for three weeks. In the beginning they borrowed the Yu-Ren Chapel. During the last two weeks, they used the meeting hall on Shek-Kip-Mei Street and conducted two weeks of Bible study for the believers. The Lord blessed His own work. Presently, Brother Luan, Mrs. Nee, and Miss Wang have gone to Swatow for work and will be back in Hong Kong in a month or two. After they come back, they will decide where to go next. The work in Hong Kong and Macao must wait for their return before anything can be settled.</p><p>Brother Ho Nai-yee, January 23</p><h2 class="head2">Surabaya, Indonesia</h2><p>Dear Brother Faithful Luk in the Lord:</p><p>Since you are able to come to Dutch Indonesia, this proves that the Lord has opened a straight way for you. The places where you were are far from Java, and we have not even heard of the names of these places before. Yet the Lord has brought you to these places. We truly have to praise Him for His greatness and wonder. We see that the Lord is not a respecter of persons. "The people sitting in darkness have seen a great light; and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, to them light has risen." May the Lord's grace overshadow you, and may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you so that you receive abundant power to strive together in oneness for the Lord's holy work. The brothers and sisters in Surabaya have grown recently. However, we are still young. May the Lord bless us so that we may grow and mature. The work of the preaching of salvation is still not being carried out yet, and this matter has been a burden on our heart. We do hope that this burden can be released from our heart. We hope that the Lord will bring you to us soon. Yet it must be according to the Lord's own will. Please tell us a little of your experience of coming to Indonesia, and please pray for us. Peace to you in the Lord! Greetings to the saints who are with you.</p><p>Brothers Dai Chung-ming, Chen En-shen, Wang Fen-hsing</p><h2 class="head2">Manila, Philippines</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Brothers and sisters who are called by the Lord in every place:</p><p>May the grace and peace of the Lord be multiplied to you, amen. There are many denominations in the Philippines, and the complexity of them is no different than that of other places. Over ninety percent of the Filipinos are Catholic. Although they know about Jesus, they do not understand the truth of the redemption of the cross and the blood. This is indeed sad! A few years ago the Lord's servant, Leland Wang, came to the Philippines and preached the redemption of the cross. Not long after, the Lord sent Brother Simon Meek to come and continue with the shepherding work. Although the brothers and sisters here are spiritually immature, our Lord, who is the Author and Finisher, has been working silently to accomplish His plan step by step. Two years ago Brother Watchman Nee was going to England, and the Lord led him to pass through here. During that brief period, he expounded the truth of the church a little in addition to releasing the truth of overcoming. All the seeking brothers and sisters received much help from this. Later, because of the saints' spiritual hunger and because of the need of the work which necessitates Brother Meek's going out for evangelization work, the brothers were in one accord to ask the Lord to send a servant to work in our midst. After praying, we sent a letter of invitation to Chuenchow to ask Brother Wu Ren-jieh to come. After he received the letter and after waiting before the Lord for a long time, he arrived in the Philippines in September.</p><p>After Brother Wu arrived in the Philippines, the Lord gave him the opportunity to have a conference for the edification of the believers. All the seeking saints received help. From November 24 to December 4, the Lord led the workers to come together. Workers from Cebu and Mindanao also came and joined us. All of them have some contributions for the Lord's work. We will have a more practical plan to carry out the work in the "great frontier land" and the "small frontier land." Brother Meek has been most enthusiastic and will set out for the gospel to the outer islands again. He hopes to preach the gospel even to the Filipinos so that they can bear the same testimony as ours. Please do not forget to pray for the small work in this remote region.</p><p>A young brother in the Lord meeting in Manila, Philippines<br />December 23</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>We have a few sisters here who would like to offer X dollars for the workers in Szechuan, Hunan, and Hankow and for the saints in need. We do not know their names or their condition. We can only find your address from The Open Door. Please discuss this with Sister Ruth Lee. Our desire is that more help should be rendered to the sisters.</p><p>Sister Ruth Chen, October 9, 1938<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>(1) Issue No. 13 was sent out from Shanghai at the end of November. My trip from Yunnan to Shanghai via Hong Kong was tiring. After arriving in Shanghai, many affairs were waiting to be handled. On top of this, we had ten days of meetings for the sisters. Moreover, I had to wait for news from the brothers and sisters in Hunan and Hankow before I could proceed with the next issue. Consequently, Issue No. 14 has been delayed again and again. Of course, this was not the main reason for the delay. Many times, as I was starting to edit, something within me urged me to wait a little. Today I know that this waiting has not been in vain. I thank the Lord for this!</p><p>(2) I have prayed again and again about which letters to publish and which not to publish. If there is any impurity in the heart and if the news is not accurate, we will not have God's blessing. Consequently, I have done this work in fear and trembling.</p><p>(3) Recently, we heard that some brothers and sisters have been called to serve the Lord full-time. Of course, we have to thank the Lord for this, but they have to be tested. A man should be clear himself as to whether or not he has been called and what ministry he has received from the Lord. As for us, we can only express what we feel (whether or not we are sympathetic) after we have observed and seen the fruit. This expression from us does not mean that we have any authority at all; it is merely an objective comment. The most important thing is each person's own relationship with the Lord.</p><p>(4) During these perilous end times, there are men who will not maintain respectable work, and there are men who will use godliness as a means for base gain. If we are not discerning and allow these men to come in or recommend them to others, the churches of God will suffer loss. I hope that the churches everywhere will learn of the church in Ephesus: "You cannot bear evil men; and you have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false." I hope they will also learn of the discerning ones in Smyrna, who knew of "the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan." A man is not something just because he calls himself such; we have to test such a one. If anyone wants to recommend anyone else, he must be very careful. "And we sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the churches, and not only this, but who has also been selected by the churches as our fellow traveler....And we sent with them our brother, whom we have proved to be diligent in many things many times..." (2 Cor. 8:18-19, 22). This is a good example of the way to recommend others. A genuinely good brother or an apostle used by the Lord will not become something that he is not just by moving to another place. The environment often only reveals man's real condition.</p><p>(5) During this critical period, it is right for all the churches to do their best to provide hospitality for the visiting believers and those who are fleeing from tribulation. But not everyone for whom we have provided hospitality can be recommended. In the past we have published the names of some people because we have received letters from the places where they come from or have passed through. We do this also to relieve the concern of many caring ones. Unfortunately, some have tried to use our publication for their own goal. This is too much of a shame to the testimony! Some do not know the flesh and engage in fleshly activities! How our heart aches over such things! We wish that God would use and bless those brothers and sisters who are pure and who fear the Lord. We are more than willing to testify for them. But if we see that some have other motives, not hating sin and not judging their flesh, how can our conscience allow us to recommend them? If we have offended anyone because of this, we do it out of compulsion. What else can we say except ask for them to excuse us?</p><p>(6) Since the time the co-workers have been paying attention to the work in the inland regions or frontier regions, we thank the Lord that much sympathy has been aroused. But we wish the co-workers in the inland regions or the frontier regions would take note of one thing: Some may write to you and tell you that they have the calling and the burden, and they may ostentatiously say that they have seen the truth of the church or that they are taking the way of the cross. You cannot consider them workers just by words in letters. If you do not know them, and no one has recommended them in a solid way, you have to pray and investigate much. Even if you have seen them face to face, you must still test them. As far as we know, two persons have written to the workers in Yunnan, indicating that they want to go to Yunnan. Fortunately, they did not go. One of these two has always been unruly and full of lies. The other one was excommunicated from being a preacher. Some have even said that the second one was accused of selling opium and had been in jail. It is a small thing to inflate numbers and reports, but it is a great thing when evil behavior ill-affects the work. Therefore, we have to point this out in a frank way.</p><p>(7) God has done more than what we ask or think in supplying the needs of the saints who became needy through the war. In Issue No. 13 we said in the "Letter on Behalf of the Editor" that the saints in Hunan and Szechuan province have mostly been taken care of. After that word was published, Yueh-Yang capitulated and Ch'ang-sha had a great fire. Reports of danger also came from Yi-Yang and Ch'ang-Teh. I was almost unable to sleep or eat, and I could only call on God. Thank the Lord that at such a critical juncture, one brother from Chefoo and a few co-workers in Chuenchow sent some money. According to their designation, not only was there enough money to relieve the brothers in Hunan province, but we were able to render help to other places as well. At that time I was in K'un-ming and did not know the whereabouts of the brothers in Ch'ang-sha, Yi-Yang, and Ch'ang-Teh. After much prayer I sent the money to Yi-Yang and asked a few trustworthy brothers to distribute it. I found out later that the brothers had left Yi-Yang, and I was condemned, thinking that the money was lost. Yet I recalled that this was what I felt should have been done in the first place, and then I felt peaceful about it. If you read Brother Kuo Jen-yung's letter in this issue, you will see that God demonstrated special grace in this matter, and I can only thank Him with all of my heart!</p><p>(8) Presently, the mail between Shanghai and Hankow is clear again. Recently some brothers arrived in Shanghai from Shu County. According to their report, everyone is safe with the exception of Brother Lee Teh-shiu, who left a while ago and has not sent back any news. There is no news yet from the brothers in Kuling. Although there have been bombings in Kuei-yang, Brother Liu Yu-chuan wrote to say that all the saints were safe. Thank the Lord. All the offerings that we have received from various places have been sent to their designated place if they have been so designated. If they have not been designated, we have sent them to places where the needs are the greatest. As far as we know, Hunan province is in more trouble than other places. Szechuan and Hankow provinces are tolerable. Many in Tai-Shan, Kwangtung, have lost their jobs. Kuei-yang already has a high cost of living. After the recent bombing, demand has exceeded supply, and the situation has become even more difficult. We have to investigate the situation thoroughly before we send them relief. In the past the amounts of money sent to the various places have not been large. In consideration of the practical situation in various places, we have always entrusted the distribution to reliable local brothers. We thank the Lord with all our heart for everything in the past, and we look to the Lord for everything in the future! On the one hand, we ask God to care for the brothers who are truly in need and to open up ways for them. On the other hand, we ask God to bless those who are offering in secret and giving in private! As for me, I receive with one hand and give out with the other. Yet I am always afraid that I do not do a good job or that my work will become unacceptable to the saints. May the Lord be merciful to me so that I would carry out the work faithfully through the prayers of many.</p><p>Ruth Lee in Shanghai, February 6, 1939</p><p>We have already run out of Issue Nos. 1, 8&mdash;10, and 12 of this magazine.

O. Box 323, Shanghai, March 1939</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Watchman Nee</h2><p>My work during the last year has been centered around Honor Oak (where Mr. Austin-Sparks is). Although there are many other works, to me the most important work is at Honor Oak. The situation in Europe is the same as that in China. Many works and many of the workers are good, but not as the result of revelation. Rather, they are based on tradition. As in China, the knowledge of the flesh and the denial of the natural life are subjects that are almost unheard of. Honor Oak is indeed the center of testimony in Europe and America today. The testimony, the revelation, and the knowledge of the self and the natural man are here. The light concerning the Body life is rarely seen by others. Of course, Honor Oak, like any other place, needs help before it can be perfect. But so many have volunteered to come and help in Honor Oak that the brothers at Honor Oak cannot but be careful. During the past year, they have indeed treated me as being much more than a common guest. They are both open and on guard at the same time. I have gradually shared with them what I have received from the Lord through His grace, what has been kept hidden by the environment. You know that I never presume to be a teacher of others. I know of many areas that God can help Honor Oak in, yet how do I know that I am not wrong? How easy it is for man to be governed by his own deceptive dreams and to be obsessed with his own importance! Therefore, I am waiting and waiting patiently. My heart is really earnest for coming home, yet I know that there is work that I have to do. During the February conference, God led us&mdash;especially Mr. Austin-Sparks and me&mdash;to see many similar things. Our two testimonies are completely one now...</p><p>Brother Watchman, February 17</p><p></p><p>(We received a telegram today (March 9) from Brother Nee saying that he is on his way home. He will arrive in Shanghai, at the earliest, by the end of this month and, at the latest, by the beginning of April. Many places have asked about him. We will answer them all here and not answer each place separately&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Witness Lee, Chefoo</h2><p>By the Lord's grace, I hope to mail out the manuscript for The Christian next week. This is the Chinese New Year, and we are having conference meetings. On the one hand, we are preaching the gospel, and on the other hand, we are edifying the believers. The conference will end tomorrow. The Lord willing, I will go with a few brothers and sisters to Chi-Hsia County and the surrounding villages to testify for the Lord. After returning to Chefoo, we will go to Tsingtao after the middle of March. Thank the Lord. Lately, the Lord has been doing a new work in Chefoo and Tsingtao. Sisters Soong and Wang, together with Brother Chao Chi-kwang, went to West Village in Peng-Lai to testify for the Lord before the Chinese New Year began.</p><p>Brother Witness Lee, February 27</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Brother Chao Bi-chen, Tsinan</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>As far as the condition here is concerned, the brothers and sisters who have a foundation in the Lord have left. Only four or five young brothers and sisters are still serving the Lord in a faithful way. They have asked me to stay in Tsinan for a period of time. On November 3 I went to Chefoo to attend the co-workers' meeting and told Brother Lee everything. He also felt in his spirit that I should stay in Tsinan for a while and render the saints some help before going elsewhere according to the Lord's leading. We see the Lord's blessing and presence in our work. Now the Lord has opened the door of the gospel. We have been invited to preach the gospel and to testify in the brothers' homes and in the homes of many Pentecostals, Methodists, those of the Assembly of God, and in the homes of many members of Chi-Loo University. May the Lord bless His own work so that the truth is released and so that God's children see the light and take the way of obedience! Please pray much for us. Lately, the work has been too heavy, and I have become too tired. On February 6 I vomited blood. It has now stopped; thank the almighty, gracious Lord.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chao Bi-chen,<br />Tsinan, February 11</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>The Lord has indeed blessed me through my illness. He has also blessed the brothers and sisters. We have all received the proper lessons and profit before the Lord. The condition of my sickness was actually more serious than it was in Tientsin. But the Lord heard our cry and showed mercy to my weakness. He proved His victory. Within the shortest possible period of time, I became well again, and there is only a little cough left in me. Please pray much for us.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chao Bi-chen</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother K. H. Weigh, K'un-ming</h2><p>The meetings here are going on as before. The gospel meeting on the Lord's Day afternoon has improved much. Thank the Lord for His leading. On Friday we have a meeting for the saints. The focus of this meeting is on Bible study. Presently, we are studying Matthew. We are studying it chapter by chapter (one or two chapters each week). During the week the brothers and sisters read the chapters at home. When they come together, each takes a turn reading a verse. Then they have mutual exhortation and edification according to the leading of the Spirit. According to the practice of the past two weeks, it seems that this kind of meeting combines the functions of edification, Bible study, and testifying. Most of the brothers and sisters apply the exposition of the Scriptures to their daily living. But the Lord also leads some brothers to speak something on the side of knowledge. During the past two meetings, I have received much edification from the mouths of the brothers and sisters. Some light is new to me. May the Lord continue to bless this kind of meeting so that all the glory goes to God. Recently, I have felt that the meeting according to 1 Corinthians 14 is an important kind of meeting in the local church. But I am still not clear as to how this kind of meeting should be conducted. I hope to receive some help from some brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Thank and praise the Lord for His leading and arrangement. He has prepared a suitable gospel hall in the heart of K'un-ming for us. (This is something the workers are responsible for.) We have been having gospel meetings continuously for a few evenings. The house is not very big, and the meetings appear to be very crowded. Every night the Lord works, and some repent and receive Him. After the Chinese New Year, the Lord willing, I intend to go to west Yunnan to do some work there. Brother Jiang Shun-chin from Yau-An County wrote a few times asking me to go and preach the gospel at the beginning of the next Chinese New Year. I helped the two brothers from Norway go to Da-Li. Is there any news from Brother Nee? When will he return home?</p><p>Brother Kwang-hsi, February 9</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chen Hsi-wen, K'un-ming</h2><p>I went to Shan-Cha River on January 25. Later, I returned to Luh-Liang. On the twenty-eighth I left Luh-Liang and arrived at Yi-Liang on the twenty-ninth. On the thirtieth I returned to K'un-ming. It takes two days to travel from Chu-Jing to Luh-Liang. Luh-Liang, Ma-Jie, and Shan-Cha River are thirty miles apart from each another. Ma-Jie is more important, and the population is larger. Shi-Jung County is eight miles from Ma-Jei, and it is smaller than Luh-Liang. I have heard that a Western missionary worked there once but left after a short time. I have also heard that there are no believers in the town, but there are two or three sisters and a Brother Chao and his family in the villages twenty miles from the town. I have met with Brother Chao and have tried to find out about his situation. Although they were persecuted, they are still standing for the Lord. We thank the Lord for this.</p><p>It is one hundred miles from Shi-Jung to Lo-Ping. This county is larger than Shi-Jung and has a bigger population. No one is preaching the gospel there. From Lo-Ping I went to Ban-Chiao, which is a distance of fifty-five miles. This is the main way to enter Kweichow. When Brother Chou Hung-bao, Sister Chen Huei-sien, and I went to these places to conduct open-air evangelization, many came to listen to us. Although we have not seen fruit yet, the seed of the gospel has been spread. The work in Yunnan is indeed important. May the Lord send more workers to this region to do some long-term work. They will surely see results.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Hsi-wen, February 8</p><h2 class="head2">A Conference in Pu-Han, Fukien Province</h2><p>Between October 6 and 23 of last year, Brothers Chen Ke-san, Tsai Tse-chung, and Lan Jin-yang went to Hwei-An, Tseng-Mao, Dong-Yuen, and Bai-Chi under God's sovereignty. In Bai-Chi they rented temporary places and conducted gospel meetings for a few days. The Spirit did some clear work. Unfortunately, the harvest is ripe but the workers are few. On October 24 Brothers Chen Ke-san and Tsai Tse-chung went to Chuenchow and then worked in An-Hai, Jiu-Du, Chuenchow, Shi-Shee, etc., separately or together. Finally, they went to work in Sien-You. Everything was under the Lord's leading. May glory be to the Father and to the Lord Jesus Christ, amen! (Ke-san, etc., returned on December 13.) During this period of time, Brother Jai-seng and a few brothers and sisters spent most of their time doing pioneering work around Wu-Tung. From December 26 to January 4, the three of us had a special conference in Pu-Tien. The Lord was gracious to us. Glory to His name! We also conducted conferences in Han River on January 16-29. The attendance came from the three counties of Fu-Ching, Pu-Tien, and Sien-You. The number of saints filled seven or eight tables. What a joy it was when those of us from various places met together and fellowshipped in the Lord! The conference in Han River had three meetings a day. The Lord showed us our poverty and pitiful condition, and then He showed us the fullness and riches in Christ. We also studied the book of Ephesians, which shows God's eternal purpose. Finally, we had exhortation for our daily living. Thank the Lord that in His faithfulness and mercy, He has graced the church here, and the Spirit has granted them gifts of prophecy, healing, etc. May glory be unto Him forever and ever, amen! Finally, we were taught of the Spirit and received the same revelation to soberly and carefully appoint elders and deacons in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. (The elders are Brothers Fang Shi-rong and Fang Jia-je.) We fasted and prayed and committed them to the faithful Lord. The church has been properly established, and there has been a clear line drawn between the church and the work. May the Lord gain the preeminence in the church, and may He receive the rich inheritance and glory, amen! At the end of the conference, believers were revived, sinners were saved, and sick ones were healed. The conference in Pu-Tien was more or less the same. (The elders that were appointed are Chu Ai-tseng and Lin Gao.) Through this experience we learned a little about being co-workers together. We realized the danger of working alone and saw the benefits of working together, including: (1) mutual edification, (2) mutual correction, (3) mutual learning, and (4) mutual help. Our future is in the Lord's hand.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Chen Ke-san, Chen Jsai-seng, Chai Tze-chung<br />February 8</p><h2 class="head1">MISCELLANEOUS NEWS</h2><p>(1) Brother Stephen Kaung wrote from Hong Kong on February 15: "The work in Hong Kong is as before.

I waited on the Lord for over a month concerning going to Ch'ang-sha, before setting out to come. En route to Ch'ang-sha, I passed through Yi-Yang. Four or five days prior to my arrival, Brother Yang Dai and Sisters Chiu and Tso came to the city from the villages. I was able to meet with them. I found out from them that the Lord has done a wonderful work in the villages around Yi-Yang. In Yang-Jia-Wan, which is about a mile from Yi-Yang, Sisters Chiu and Tso led the relatives of one sister and her whole family to the Lord. There are over ten people in the family, and all of them have believed. In Ho-Jia-Ho, which is five miles from Yi-Yang, a certain believer, Mrs. Chang, was not too clear about salvation. The Lord used Sister Chiu to help her accept full salvation and to heal an epileptic woman through prayer. A few repented and believed in the Lord because of this. In She-Jia-Jou, which is about seven or eight miles away, there are over ten families of Methodist believers. But most of them do not know the Lord. Sister Chiu has a distant relative who went there to escape the war, through whom she has been able to communicate with these believers. The believers are mostly illiterate farmers. But they have a hunger for the Lord, and they always ask Sisters Chiu and Tso to come and help them. Because these three places need the leadership of brothers, Sister Chiu wrote to Brother Yang and asked him to pray and then perhaps to go there and work. Brother Yang was not clear concerning going to Ch'ang-sha. He first went to Yang-Jia-Wan to preach the gospel for a few days. He did not go to the other two places because of rain. When I showed up without invitation, Sister Chiu implored me to stay for a few more days and visit the remaining two places with Brother Yang. After praying about it, I felt burdened within. On the thirteenth I walked to Ho-Jia-Ho and preached the gospel for three days. On the fifteenth I took the boat to She-Jia-Jou. The Lord led us in a spirit of oneness to have two days of perfecting meetings. Mrs. Chang came and about twenty believers gathered together, even though it was close to the Chinese New Year. We had a meeting every day in the morning and in the evening. I spoke on the subject of God's purpose in creating man. Every meeting lasted for one to two hours. The audience was very attentive and not tired at all. Thank the Lord for the work! I thank Him even more for the growth of life in the brothers and sisters. Sister Tso Teh-jen rejoiced in suffering and often traveled around the countryside with the elderly Sister Chiu. They are also diligently teaching the old believers and the children to read and study the Bible.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Liu Ai-wu, February 23</p><h2 class="head2">Shu County, Anhwei Province</h2><p>Hwang-Jia-Juan had a fire. I intend to go and take a look in the near future because I heard that all the houses in that village were burned. Only Brother Huang Si-shin's (the responsible brother's) house remained. Thank the Lord. We heard that all his furnishings were burned and that the red potatoes in his cellar were not damaged. Last fall there was an exceptional harvest of red potatoes, which were kept in the cellar. These potatoes can last until next spring. Every Lord's Day they meet and worship the Lord at Pu-Zi, Shi-Wu-Li. The meeting at Pu-Zi, Shi-Wu-Li is in the house of Brother Lu Jen-wu, who has a household of over twenty people, a few of whom are already participating in the Lord's table. Their whole family is very hospitable. Our beloved Lord has blessed the meeting there as well as Brother Lu's household. The meeting in Pai-Ma-Chun is as usual. My whole family is in the Lord's grace. My daughter's tuberculosis is not healed yet, but there is no fever even though she has been coughing quite heavily recently. Please pray for this.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Huang Tze-hou, February 25</p><h2 class="head2">Ying-Chien, Fukien Province</h2><p>I am now serving as the physician to the Fukien Customs Department, and I moved into 16 Ying-Chien New Street on the twenty-fourth of this month. Any correspondence or publications should be mailed to the address above. I arrived safely through the Lord's leading and am full of thanksgiving! The meeting hall in Bai-Ya-Tan is only a mile or so from my home. I rejoice at the fact that I can meet with the brothers and sisters all the time and fellowship with them. My work has not been too busy, but I ask that you pray much for me so that I will not encounter temptations but will express the fragrance of the knowledge of Christ everywhere I go and glorify His name in all things. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Fang Jia-je, February 8</p><h2 class="head2">Tseng-Mao, Fukien Province</h2><p>I have received every issue of The Open Door. The news in every issue makes me realize the infinite love of the Lord. We thank and praise the Lord for the meeting here in the villages! He has sent His faithful servant to work here. Please pray that the Lord will give us deeper edification and raise up responsible brothers and sisters from the church to strive together for the furtherance of the gospel so that we will not be ashamed in the future. The brothers and sisters have been preserved by the Lord and are living in peace. May glory and praise be to our blessed Lord.

He has gathered us as a hen gathers chicks under her wings. The political situation is becoming more and more tense. There were large-scale bombings from February 17-22. All the major towns and cities in Nan-Sha, such as Nan-Yang, Tou-Peng, Gua-Li, and Zhe-Shan sustained high casualties, and much damage was done to the houses. But God has been protecting the believers in a special way. Not one of our hairs was hurt. An older brother, Mr. Shen Chi-jin, was a guest at a shoe store last Thursday in Nan-Yang. There was a bombing that day, and many were tragically killed. During the critical moments, Mr. Shen knelt down by the bed with his daughter and grandchild and prayed, and they hid themselves in the bosom of the Lord. A bomb dropped into the house about six or seven feet away from where they were praying. The house collapsed, and four or five houses next door were turned into rubble, but the brother walked slowly out of the rubble with his daughter and grandchild. They were not hurt at all! This was truly an act of God's love.</p><p>Wang You-gen, Chan Chung-yau</p><h2 class="head2">Chen-Hsia-Kuan, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Enclosed please find X dollars for the publication work of the Gospel Book Room and X dollars for distribution to the brothers in need. We are situated in the border area of Chekiang province and have not been able to communicate much with churches in other places because of its geography. Thank the Lord for the publication of The Open Door, which shows us God's work in every place and tells us of the news and excellent footsteps of all the servants and brothers of the Lord. Our narrow views have been expanded to see the churches of God, and we have been broadened to participate in the communion and supplication of the members. How we thank the Lord for this! Our church began seven or eight years ago. By the grace of God a few dozen people have been saved through us. The Lord's servants have not been able to come because of inaccessibility. As a result we have received little edification, and our spiritual life is immature. We hope that you will pray for us! Brother Hsu Dah-wei came with Brother Chou Shing-yi some time ago. They went to Tai-Shun three months ago to join Brother Chang Kwang-rong. They are now in Ma-Jan. Last Sunday night the town of Ma-Jan experienced a fire, and the shops of four or five brothers were burned. Thank the Lord! Although the possessions were lost, the brothers are still rejoicing in the Lord. Brother Chou Shing-yi has gradually recovered his health. Thank the Lord!</p><p>The church in Chen-Hsai-Kuan,<br />Wu Tze-tzien, Lee Si-ming, Chang Jun-tze</p><h2 class="head2">Makassak, Dutch Southeast Asia</h2><p>Under the Lord's leading we boarded a steamer on December 24 from Kulangsu and arrived safely in Makassak on January 5. On arrival we took lodging temporarily at the house of Mr. Yao. We are learning before the Lord to trust in His leading for our future and our business. May the Lord accomplish His work in His children. We ask all the brothers and sisters who are burdened to pray to remember us weak and useless ones. There are many lovers of the Lord in the denominations here. Unfortunately, they all lack the feeding of the pure milk of the word. May the Lord of the work send His servants so that His testimony can be raised up quickly, the life of the immature ones will grow, and many sinners will be saved from the authority of Satan. May God have mercy on this place.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Hsi Shih-chuan, Yao Ke-ju, January 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">FURTHER NEWS</h2><p>(1) There will be a special conference from March 22-29 in Lan-Si, Chekiang province.

During his study of the kingdom, many people came to listen....Since June of last year, about ten brothers and sisters have been added to our ministry to the Lord. The Lord has also increased the number of saved ones. There was a ten-day conference starting the first day of the Chinese New Year. We had prayer meetings from 5:30 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. every day and gospel meetings from 9:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. with Brother Liu Bei-min speaking. From 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Brother Witness preached on the subject of the filling of the Holy Spirit. The attendance was high. Now is an excellent time for us to expand the work in Chefoo. The Lord willing, Brother Witness and Brother Bei-min will travel to Chi-Hsia with two sisters for the gospel and visit the brothers and sisters there. In two weeks they will return to Chefoo and will have a special conference for the edification of believers. Please remember these things in your prayer....The brothers and sisters in Chefoo are enjoying peace under the Lord's grace."</p><p>(5) Brother Liu Ai-wu wrote from Ch'ang-sha on March 3: "Beginning January 8 Brother Han Fu-shen preached the gospel and did some work with the believers in Ch'ang-Teh....I have been learning to pray.

I have been traveling in places where postmen have never gone before. Every time I am away from home, my heart feels happy, and I feel transcendent in my private reading of the Word, in prayer, and in my preaching of the gospel to others. May the merciful Lord keep me on the road, working all the time. Since Brother Hsu's departure from Nu River, my foot ailment has flared up again. For more than ten days, I was unable to travel. After the ailment left, I brought my accordion and luggage and set off for Nu River again. By the time I got to the forest in Yen-Wah-Loh, rain was coming down unceasingly, and skies were not clear for six days. Later, we lodged in Yen-Wah-Loh for two days. The snow blocked the mountains, and I could do nothing except return home. During the second month of the year, I packed my luggage and traveled up the river to Yen-Za for four days. I had intended to cross the river and to go west to Men-Gung, but again snow blocked the way, and I had to remain in Yen-Za for four days. On the return journey I had to carry my own luggage. The trip took thirteen days. My original intention was to pass out Tibetan gospel tracts, and although I did not see my wish fulfilled, thank the Lord, I was able to preach to three to four or six to seven people everywhere I went. I hope that Brother Hsu can come back quickly. I went to Wei-Si on the twentieth day of the first month of the year. Brother He left home for his preaching tour, and Mrs. He was not at home either. While I was feeling lost as to what to do next, two Westerners arrived. They tracked me down by looking for me at Mrs. Luk's house. The Lord's love is truly wonderful! Who can search it? In the course of our conversation, the older of the two Westerners told me that they were given the names of Brother Huang, Brother Weigh, Brother Hsu, and myself by Watchman Nee when he was in Norway. Brother Nee told them that we could help them in their westward journey. I could not help but thank the Lord for the depth of His grace. In Wei-Si I helped them buy some daily necessities for their journey. I did not want to stay in Wei-Si and therefore left for home. After helping Mr. An in his journey, I waited for someone to travel with me westward. We will take whatever way that is open to us. Please continue to pray for us without interruption. Peace to you in the Lord. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in K'un-ming.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Hu Yi-min</p><p>The twenty-first day of the first month of the year</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Weigh and Brother Hsu, K'un-ming</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Two or three weeks ago a few brothers and sisters were baptized into the Lord's name. The Lord has started some work among the young students here. Please pray for this. Recently, Brother Hsu borrowed the local church meeting hall for a week-long conference. The subjects were: (1) the law, (2) the Holy Spirit, and (3) the bearing of the cross. There were seventy to eighty people in the audience. May the Lord gain what He is after.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />K. H. Weigh<br />March 16</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I am conducting a conference for a few days here. After the conference I may go with Brother Weigh. He will go to Hsia-Kwan and Bao-Shan and work there. Presently, Brother Lin Kwang-tsao is engaged in construction work with the Highway Department in Hsia-Kwan. When will Brother Nee return? We remember him!</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Hsu Jung-jieh, March 19</p><h2 class="head2">The Work in a Few Places in West Hunan</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Recently there was a week of gospel meetings in Chou-Jia-Dien in the Alliance Gospel Hall. There will be ten days of edification meetings for believers on March 6-15. Some may come from Ch'ang-Teh. We will have two meetings every day. After the meetings we will visit Brother Chang Gung-jih in Tung-Ping, An-Hua. Later, we will pass by Yuan-Jiang and Yi-Yang and then go to Chi-Li and Dah-Yung. May the Lord grant me a healthy body to work in these places on my return journey. Please pray for me. May the Lord open a great door for the preaching of the Word in west Hunan. Brother Shang Jiu-tze has decided to travel with me.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Han Fu-shen, March 1</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>A seventeen-day conference is about to conclude in Chou-Jia-Dien. God has blessed us. Brother Mei Han-ke and his whole family have been greatly revived. Soon a few people will be baptized. We intend to leave Ch'ang-Teh for Dah-Yung around the twenty-second or twenty-third of March. Dah-Yung has invited us a few times and is very hungry and seeking. In April they will have their annual retreat and have invited Brother Han to go. After staying in Dah-Yung for a month or so, we intend to go to Chi-Li. Then we will turn to Szechuan or to Yuan-Ling. May the Lord open a great door in west Hunan and glorify His own name through us useless ones.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Shang Jiu-tze, March 12</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Lan Tsi-yi, Hankow</h2><p>Since quitting the work at the refugee center, I have been living with Brother Hu in Chen's house in Bai-Tse Alley. During the past days I have been remaining quietly in the Lord, praying, studying the Bible, and learning to take God's dealing. Through His enlightening I have realized that I do not know God. I am not yet perfected and am far from being a vessel of the Lord. There is some comfort in the work at the orphanage.</p><p>During the past two or three months, the Lord has been showing me that much of my zeal for Him in the past, much of the work I was engaged in, and many of the things that I have written to the saints in my correspondence were done out of ignorance. Many of my prayers and pursuits, though honest in motive, were but expressions of my ignorance. I thought that it was good to be pure in heart and honest in conduct. Now I know that ignorance is a sin, and I am beginning to understand the meaning of the words: "We should imitate faith but not the act of faith." I am still inquiring of God and looking to Him day by day as to what my future should be. He delights not in the strength of the horse or the legs of man. He takes pleasure in them that fear Him, in those that hope in His mercy. The brothers in Hankow are all well.</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Lan Tsi-yi, March 15</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Philip Luan, Amoy</h2><p>On the morning of the sixteenth, I went for a medical checkup at the Chiu-Shi Hospital. Thank and praise the wonderful grace of the Father. The result of the examination showed that other than the slight inflammation of the eyes and throat (which was caused by my recent speaking and reading), my body was healthy. My blood pressure is thirty points lower than it was in Hong Kong. When I was in Ch'ang-sha, I had to give over three hundred cc of blood. Then my blood pressure was only six points lower. But this time, it went down thirty points without doing anything. The Lord has truly manifested His endurance and mercy on me, the chiefest of all sinners. What else can I say? I can only thank and praise the Lord who lives forever for me with all of my heart!</p><p>The work began officially on the twelfth. In the morning we have prayer meetings. In the afternoon we have sisters' meetings, and we have preaching meetings in the evening. There are over ten co-workers gathering here in Kulangsu. From this morning on, the co-workers are waiting on the Lord together. We hope that the Lord will gain the glory He deserves through these gatherings. We are not sure when the meetings will be concluded.</p><p>Brother Philip Luan, March 20</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Co-workers in Hong Kong and Macao</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Unless I have special leading otherwise, my trip to Szechuan will not be changed. (We have received a letter from Hong Kong stating that Brother Kaung will leave for Chungking with his family around April 19 via K'un-ming and Kuei-yang. Please pray for this&mdash;Editor.) Mr. Luan will perhaps return to Hong Kong within the month. Brother Chen Ke-san wrote and said that he can come to Hong Kong. Thank the Lord! Give my regards to all the co-workers.</p><p>A weak one,<br />Stephen Kaung, March 22, 1939</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>A while ago Brother Lin Bao-shen came to Macao and preached the gospel for seven days. Although it rained on the last day, there were still many people. That evening Brother Nee Hwai-tzu and Brother Chang Shi-wu stood up and gave a good word on the gospel after Brother Lin's preaching. Then Brothers Nee and Chang proposed to have a gospel meeting every Tuesday evening (which we are doing). In addition we have a brothers' and sisters' meeting every Thursday evening, and we have the prayer meeting every Saturday night. Those who come to the Sunday afternoon meeting all have a seeking heart. Thank the Lord!</p><p>Praise and thank the Lord. Brother Nee Hwai-tzu spoke many times in the meetings about what he read from the Word. Once he read 1 Corinthians 3 and Daniel 3 and shared something like the following: If we want our life and work to withstand the fire in the future, we must have the experience of His presence today. Only the things we do in His presence count, because only these things will pass through the fire. The three friends of Daniel were not hurt in the midst of fiery persecution and difficulty, because they had the Lord's presence. The fire burned up their bondage instead. Their clothing, signifying their righteousness, was not burned at all. Our God is a consuming fire. If we see God's presence, we will not live in a loose way.</p><p>Sister Ro-chen, March 31</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Faithful Luk, Singapore</h2><p>Sister Tsai Deh-an (a Western missionary) passed by here and stayed for twelve days. She gave her testimony a few times and spoke of the Lord's work in her, her Spirit baptism, her water baptism, and how she saw the truth concerning head covering and the church. It was very moving. She has been going through a wilderness experience during the past year and a half in the Philippines. We thank the Lord for His grace. On the fourteenth she left Singapore for Norway. She will travel from there to northern Germany. The Lord willing, she will then return to America via England. After two or three months, she will return to the Far East. She still does not know where she should work in the future, whether in China, the Philippines, Malaysia, or Surabaya. May the Lord Himself give her leading. It is my opinion that there is a big need in Surabaya, if she and Miss Loo cannot work in China in the near future. There are only seven or eight brothers and sisters in Surabaya. Two or three of them are brothers from Fu-Ching and Fukien, and the other three or four were baptized by Brother Leland Wang a few months ago. It is difficult for them to rent houses or work. I have written a letter to them telling them to break bread in the homes if it is a problem to rent a place. I intend to go there, but I am still waiting. Sister Ding is resting in the National Hospital; her illness needs our prayer.</p><p>A weak servant of the Lord,<br />Faithful Luk, March 17</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Lai En-shi, Canada</h2><p>Dear sisters in the Lord:</p><p>This short letter is to tell you of my continual prayer for and remembrance of you. I have always thought of you before the throne of grace. I know of your joy in the Lord and that you consider the Lord your life and your fortress. In the morning I read 1 Chronicles 26:27, which says, "Out of the spoils won in battles...." Ephesians 4:8 says, "He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men." Verse 10 says, "That He might fill all things," which can also be translated, "that He might fill the universe." From David's battle in 1 Chronicles 18, we can see what the spoils were and how they were used for God's house (vv. 8, 10-11). David reigned this way. One who is greater than David is now with you. May you find greater spoils from the battles in your daily life, and may you find more treasures in Christ. The servants in the house cannot satisfy His heart, only the sons and daughters can satisfy Him and inherit the possessions (Rev. 21:7).</p><p>A friend, who is a child of God, would like to offer this little gift through God's love to those among you who are in tribulation and need. Greetings to all the dear ones. May the Lord become your life, and may He overshadow you all day long. Please mention me before the brothers in the Lord, for they are all in my prayers and in my heart. While I am alive, I still open my window to the land I love&mdash;China. But I wait on God to release me back to you. Please pray for me so that I will know His will and not walk ahead of Him nor fall behind His purpose and His will.</p><p>Lai En-shi, Vancouver, Canada, February 4</p><h2 class="head1">MISCELLANEOUS NEWS</h2><p>(1) From Brother Watchman Nee's letter to his family we know that he was still in England before Easter.

The large busy streets in the city were burned to ashes, and the whole city was bombed. There were over one thousand casualties, and over ten thousand people became homeless. Thank the Lord that those who are His were all preserved and did not even suffer any material damage. What do we have that makes us stronger or more noble than others?

The saints close to our church are all under the Lord's grace. We are not too clear concerning all the details because of the inaccessibility to traffic. We will inform you after we have made further investigation. Thank God for His grace in protecting us during our move out of Yi-Lin and our temporary stay in Gu-Jia-Juang in Yien-Shu. This place is only twenty-five miles from Yi-Lin. The area is flat, and all the fields are flooded for hundreds of miles around. It is difficult to find food, and we find it hard to settle down. The spring harvest is in ruins, and we do not know what to do with the days ahead. We can only pray for God to open a way for us and to bring all those who belong to Him out of this crisis. Please pray for us so that God will open a way for the saints in northern Kiangsu. I will inform you of details later when I have them. Peace to you.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Wu Wei, March 27</p><h2 class="head2">Li-Wang-Jen, Ho-Jin,<br />Shansi Province</h2><p>Praise the Lord. My family and I are safe. Please do not worry. Since the interruption of postal service, how we have desired to know the footsteps of our brothers and sisters! Although our hearts are thinking about you, there is nothing we can do. We can only ask the Lord to protect, comfort, supply, and lead every child of His, amen. Recently, we received a letter from Sister Chang Pei-ling, together with Issue Nos. 4&mdash;13 of The Open Door. I was overjoyed and did not know what to say except, "Hallelujah" and "Praise the Lord!"</p><p>Praise the Lord that He has raised up a small number of people who are of one mind. I was very encouraged by some brothers and sisters who voluntarily went out after the conference to visit people and to preach the Lord's word to them. There are many seekers of the Lord in this area. There is the need for Him to send men to come and preach His glad tidings. Praise the Lord! In this small district a few villages already have local churches. In one place even the Lord's table has been established, and two other places are beginning to have the Lord's table as well. All these ones have taken up the responsibility by themselves. Some are saved but are not yet baptized. They intend to have baptisms in one or two places when the warm weather comes in spring. However, we do no know how many will be baptized. They are also willing to pioneer to the frontier lands for the gospel's sake. They intend to push towards the "mini-northwest" beginning in January. This is different from the "great-northwest" of China. Many brothers and sisters have migrated to the frontier provinces in the northwest and southwest of China. The saints here cannot go that far, but they want to at least move out to nearby areas. May the Lord create a good opportunity to promote the gospel in the "mini-northwest" and to attract a great number of people to Himself, amen. The truth in Rethinking Our Work meets my need. Although I am not a worker, I need it very much. We wonder whether Gospel Truth has been published yet? (Not yet&mdash;Editor.) These two are my most urgent needs. If possible, please mail them to me. Greetings to all the brothers and sisters with you.</p><p>Brother Chai En-shang, February 13</p><h2 class="head2">Hankow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Thank the Lord that the tribulation on earth trains our heart to care for the unseen and for the peace in the heaven. We thank the brothers and sisters in every place for their encouragement of the Lord's love, their constant care, and their supplication so that those of us in Hankow, His very weak children, can hide under the shadow of His wings and be preserved. Glory to His name! Enclosed please find a little sum of X dollars for use in the work in the inland provinces or in the frontier work. This little sum expresses the sympathy of the members in Hankow towards the labor of the Lord's faithful servants in the barren lands. This little gift also shows that our heart and prayer follow these workers. May the footsteps of the Lord's servants be excellent everywhere they go, amen!</p><p>Weak members in the Lord,<br />Lan Tsi-yi and Hu Lan-seng on behalf of the saints<br />in Hankow, February 24</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>There is now no more need in Hankow. Occasionally, one or two local brothers and sisters have needs, and the local church here can take care of them. Last Lord's Day we received X dollars from the local offering box, which was designated for the publication need of The Open Door. We will forward the money to you when the accounts are cleared. The Lord willing, I intend to come to Shanghai and learn something from the brothers and sisters. Please pray for this. May the Lord grant me the grace to learn the lessons that He has given me under the present circumstance.</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Lan Tsi-yi, March 30</p><h2 class="head2">Yuan-Ning, Hunan Province</h2><p>Dear beloved of the Lord:</p><p>We are unworthy sinners in the eyes of God, yet He has chosen to save us through His wonderful grace and mercy so that we can become fellow citizens with His saints and be His people. We cannot help but praise the Lord who has loved us forever and ever, amen! Since the fire in Ch'ang-sha, the population here has increased tremendously. We used to have meetings on the Lord's Day afternoon for testimonies or for the preaching of the gospel. Because the number of brothers and sisters increased (to about twenty), we began to have a bread-breaking meeting. The Lord has been blessing us. The population is dense, and there is a great need for the gospel. We ask that the Lord send His own workers to reap this harvest! When we have time, we borrow the Methodist Chapel to preach the gospel in the evenings. Please pray much for the members here. We are as weak as water! Enclosed please find X dollars for The Open Door. The Lord's grace be with you.</p><p>Weak members in the Lord,<br />Loh Yung-dien, Chou You-seng</p><h2 class="head2">Hsu-Fu, Szechuan Province</h2><p>Thank the Lord that we moved into our own rented place last Lord's Day. The address is Yu-Ying Elementary School on Well Street. This is God's provision for us. It is a private school, and the owner has agreed to let us use the main classroom of the school in the future. Chairs, tables, and boards are all there. We pray in one accord every evening that God would send workers here to pioneer the work. The door of the work is open. The China Inland Mission has been good to us. The Baptist Church has organized a women's Sunday school and has asked me to conduct the school.</p><p>If two brothers can come together, they can take the Hsu-Fu-K'un-ming Highway, which passes from K'un-ming through the Szechuan-Yunnan Highway. That route has never been touched by the gospel before....There are twenty-two small stations between K'un-ming and Hsu-Fu. It takes twenty days to get through with sedan chairs and costs about forty-four dollars. But this is cheaper than coming by bus through Kuei-yang and Chungking. This way was once full of bandits, but the Transport Department has set up stations now. There are now many daily activities in the loading and unloading of goods; therefore, the route has become much safer. Of course, it is very exhausting to take a sedan chair for twenty days. One needs God's grace for guidance and protection. If any brother comes, please inform us ahead of time so that we can tell the colleagues working in the stations along the way to care for him and to provide him with lodging. Please convey this message to brothers who are praying for this. We hope that the Lord's church can be built up soon here in Hsu-Fu.</p><p>Brother and sister in the Lord,<br />Yuen How-tsai, Yuen Jie-min, March 17</p><h2 class="head2">Hu-Shu, Hangchow, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Brothers and sisters in Shanghai and </p><p>those from Hangchow who are scattered everywhere:</p><p>Since the political turmoil, most of the saints in the church in Hangchow have been scattered. Only Brother Rang Chi-yu in the city and Brother Tao Chun-yen in Hu-Shu with their families did not move away. By the Lord's grace they are safe. Because of the danger in traveling, there is now only a home meeting in Brother Rang's house. The saints in Hu-Shu have been dispersed to the nearby villages. The meeting in Hu-Shu is better than before. Every Lord's Day there are about thirty to forty people. On March 26 five brothers and ten sisters were baptized, and they began to have the Lord's table also. We can only say that everything that has happened in the past was according to His grace, and we can only thank and praise Him. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brothers meeting in the name of the Lord,<br />Rang Chi-yu, Lee Kwai-sien, Tao Chun-yen, March 27, 1939</p><p>In addition to the newly baptized ones, there are over twenty brothers and sisters meeting in Hu-Shu, Hangchow. The ones who are responsible for the Lord's work are Brothers Lee Kwai-sien and Tao. I have not been to Hu-Shu for over two years. I must admit that I was never a responsible one there. Although I have my signature in the letter, I feel that I have come very short of the Lord. May He bless Brothers Lee and Tao and all the saints in Hu-Shu.</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Wang Shu-fa, Ping-Yang</h2><p>In Issue No. 14, Brother Yu Yun-fei of Ning-Po wrote, "Brother Wang Shu-fa from Ping-Yang wrote that he is clear concerning the Lord's calling..." I would like to make the following corrections:</p><p>Indeed, I told Brother Yu the above. But by the mercy of the Father and through His enlightening, I have repented in dust and ashes. I confessed my sins to God, and I have to ask Brother Yu and those who have received my word to forget about me. I cannot hide the Father's grace in me. He showed me clearly that my duty in the Body of His Son is to be a member. But my corrupted self did not accept this. How wicked I was! It was my wish and inclination to work full-time for the Lord because I was sick and tired of my job as a teacher. Hence, I took the excuse to say that I was called. Actually, this was not God's will but my own will. I was acting according to the desire of my heart! Furthermore, my flesh was never dealt with, and my self was so big. I do not have a particular determination, nor do I have a righteous and sanctified living. I am only a small, crooked bamboo shoot. How can God use me? I was deceiving myself and deceiving others. I was even deceiving God! I considered God's work to be such a light and frivolous matter! I am indeed the chiefest of all sinners. No one is more wicked than I am among the brothers and sisters! May I be spit upon, and may I receive shame! I deserve this through my ignorance and wickedness.</p><p>But thank the Lord that His lovingkindness has preserved me from this crooked way. He is still binding me. I am still teaching at Pei-Ling School, and His light is still enlightening me. I would like to confess my sins before the Father and before the brothers and sisters. May the Father forgive me and wash away my unrighteousness with the Lord's blood, and may the Father lead me to be faithful to death and to follow only the Lord's will, not my own will, amen. I, Wang Shu-fa, have been too forgiving of myself, which has given license to the flesh. This is detestable! By grace I hate myself, deny myself, and exercise the authority of the victory of the cross to condemn everything that is of the self. Please in the future call my name "Wang Yee-lieh."</p><p>A weak brother in the Lord,<br />Wang Yee-lieh (i.e., Wang Shu-fa), March 23</p><h2 class="head2">Surabaya, Dutch Indonesia</h2><p>Surabaya is not a small place. There are many Chinese from Fukien and Kwangtung here. But we have met very few brothers and sisters. Perhaps the reason for this is the language barrier. I hope that we can meet more brothers among the Chinese. I believe that there are many brothers from Fukien and Kwangtung who have come here for business. If the brothers in all the localities can write to me and recommend these brothers to me, we can meet them. At the meeting on March 12, we received X dollars from the offering box. The believers in Miri have also sent us X dollars. We are forwarding them to the Gospel Book Room. Please distribute it according to the Lord's leading to the brothers and sisters in tribulation.</p><p>In Him,<br />Dai Shi-shun, Wang Kwang-jeh, Wang Fen-hsing,<br />Chen En-shen, Kuo Shi-bing, March 16</p><h2 class="head1">ADDRESSES OF A FEW LOCAL CHURCHES</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>(1) Recently there has been much frustration on the mail routes. The post office will not deliver printed material that is not officially approved to many places. As a result many copies of Issue No. 15 were returned. In order to communicate with various places, we have sent the magazine out as letters instead. This is why many places which subscribed for more than one copy have received only one copy. We can only do the same thing with this issue. Those places which have received only one copy should pass on the news to other brothers and sisters in the same place.</p><p>(2) Since we have to send the magazine out as letters, we have stopped printing the column "The Dynamics of Service" in order to reduce the number of pages.</p><p>(3) We have sent copies of the magazine to all those who have subscribed to it. If you have not received a copy, it is either because the post office has refused to forward printed material or because it has been delayed in the mail. At critical times these things can happen all the time. If you have not received anything for a long time, please inform us. We will pay more postage and send a copy to you as a letter.</p><p>(4) We thank the Lord for the relief work to the saints in need. His grace is abundant! According to our knowledge, Kuei-yang, Wuhan, Szechuan, and Chungshan have no more needs. We are still paying attention to areas around Hunan. There are more needs in areas around north Kiangsu. It is quite difficult to forward funds by mail. We can only look to the Lord to open a way. In supplying the needs of the saints, we are constantly afraid of neglecting the ones who are really in need. Those who are looking to the Lord with a pure heart often do not say anything concerning their needs. I hope that those who know their real need will inform the responsible brothers in their locality, lest we owe them something.</p><p>(5) Rumors and one-sided reports should not be taken lightly. We hope that the brothers and sisters in the Lord would either carefully screen letters that spread reports about the churches or ignore them altogether. Believing in these reports lightly only provides an opening for attacks. However, if anyone is wrong or if any church has any weakness, we should speak the truth in love (Eph. 4:15). Our exhortations should be in Christ (Phil. 2:1). Evil-intentioned criticism, inaccurate reports, and shady, anonymous letters are not Christian acts. We cannot act as the unbelievers do. Although it is not an easy thing to speak the truth, love would rather see ourselves suffering hurt in order to save ourselves from misunderstandings.</p><p>(6) When the brothers and sisters quote from the book Rethinking Our Work, they should do so because the point quoted is according to Scripture. This is why we act according to what it says, and only when we act this way will we receive the benefit. If one says that he does this or that because the book says so, others will misunderstand that we consider this book to be more important than the Bible. We have no intention of doing this, and we dare not uplift any book more than the authority of the Bible. We should be careful in our words.</p><p>(7) Some brothers and sisters say that they have received the calling to serve the Lord full-time. We should rejoice and thank the Lord for this. Some co-workers do not know these ones well, and therefore cannot recommend them. This does not mean that these called ones are not qualified to work for the Lord. I wish all the young brothers and sisters who are called by the Lord would be like Henry Moore in England. Mr. Moody neglected him in the beginning because he did not know him. However, when Mr. Moody heard his preaching, he was driven to tears. This caused a change in Mr. Moody's preaching from that point on. Is this vindication not better than many self-recommending commendations? If a calling is genuine and the timing is right, what does one have to fear? If the calling is not clear, one should wait and examine even when there is sympathy and encouragement on all sides. This is something that we should not handle in a light way.</p><p>Ruth Lee in Shanghai<br />April 11, 1939</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 17</h1><h2 class="head4">The Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 323, Shanghai,<br />May 1939</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Hwa Shi-bin, Ning-Hai</h2><p>Thank the Lord for leading me step by step to walk in His will. Brother Shao Tzi-wen and I went to work in Hwang-Yen in the middle of March. All of a sudden, we heard that fighting had erupted in Hai-Men, and we turned back and went to San-Men-Wan instead to do some pioneering work for a month. At Hun-Du six men and three women were saved (mostly young adults), and a miniature local church was formed. Praise the name of the Lord! Brother Philip Luan wrote to me to invite me to stay in Hong Kong for a while. I always have a burden for missionary work in far-off places. It would be good to go first to Hong Kong and then elsewhere according to the Lord's leading. By this I may learn to live by the Lord and to suffer for Him, severing myself from affections based on kinship. But I see my own incompetence and am hesitant to go forward. The Lord willing, I would like to go to Shanghai to inquire of the senior co-workers about my trip to Hong Kong. I wonder whether Brother Nee and Brothers Chang Kwang-rong and Hsu Dah-wei are in Shanghai yet. A few churches in Ning-Hai have seen some progress. But there are very few brothers in all the churches who can stand between the breach, who watch and pray, and who deal with God directly, telling Him of the church's shortcomings and conveying to others the message from the throne! There are not many who can discern the wiles of the devil and who can set up defenses with authority in prayer! Most people only see the movement of the hands of the workers. The meeting life and the work are merely mutual imitations of one another, and rarely does one see God's standard. There is truly the need for God to continue to shed His grace.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Hwa Shi-bin, April 29</p><p>(Brother Nee is not in Shanghai yet, and Brothers Chang and Hsu are still in Chekiang&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chang Yu-zhi, from Jin-Hwa</h2><p>I left Lan-chou from Jin-Hwa today. From the twelfth to the sixteenth, there were five days of gospel work. We saw God's miraculous hand in the weather&mdash;it was neither rainy nor sunny. If it had been too sunny, the people would not have come and listened, and if had been rainy, it would have been very inconvenient. The best weather is when it is neither rainy nor sunny. We truly saw the Lord's blessing in Shui-Ting this time. Brother Tang's messages were on "The Best Love" and "The Presence of Christ." All the brothers and sisters were greatly edified. Thank and praise the Lord! I intend to go to Lu-Tang-Sha (fifteen miles from Jin-Hwang) tomorrow morning to preach at the Cheng-Mei Girls' School. Then I will preach the gospel at the local hospital for a few days. Later, I may go to Wu-Yih and Wenchow to preach the gospel. Please pray for me. I have read the book The Messenger of the Cross and have come to realize that my work has very little spiritual element in it. I deeply realize that my past work lacked the mark of the cross. I am willing to be dealt with by the Lord in a deep way and do not wish to work with so much of my own element still intact. I am not clear at present whether I should go back to Shanghai and then to north China or preach the gospel a little longer in the inland regions of Chekiang province. Please pray for me. May my walk be according to His heart and His timing.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Yu-zhi, April 18</p><h2 class="head2">Work in Jien-Ou, Fukien Province</h2><p>Thank the Lord for hearing our prayer. On March 2 Brothers Chen Jsai-seng, Chen Ke-san, and Chai Tse-chung came to Jien-Ou, and we had meetings continuously for twenty days. God has been with us in the work, and the condition is quite good. May the Lord gain all the glory and praise! Amen. The meetings concluded on the twenty-eighth. Five brothers and seven sisters were baptized. Brother Chen Ke-san left early for Ku-Tien at the invitation of the brothers. Brothers Tse-chung and Jai-seng are still talking to the newly baptized ones about the truth concerning the church.</p><p>We have also begun the Lord's table for the remembrance of the Lord. Praise the Lord! Although there are less than twenty people, the spiritual atmosphere is intense. Tonight will be our third table meeting. Thank the Lord! Recently the brothers were invited to preach the gospel to a group of drug addicts at the Health Department's drug rehabilitation center. We have a sister who works as the head nurse, who is very burdened for the souls of these people. Through this meeting the Lord saved one man who had been smoking opium for over forty years. After he believed, he was not only delivered from the bondage of the opium but also freed from many illnesses. If the Lord can save this brother, surely He can save others who have the same illness. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!</p><p>Sister Yu-bing, April 7</p><h2 class="head2">Footsteps of a Few Co-workers in Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Ho in the Lord:</p><p>Two months ago the Lord's workers, Brothers Chai Tse-chung and Chen Jai-seng, went with Brother Chen Ke-san to work in Jien-Ou in north Fukien. They passed by Yien-Ping and came to Foochow. On the twenty-fourth of last month, they passed by Ying-Chien and went to Chang-Loh to visit the saints. The saints insisted that they stay for five days of meetings. Every morning there was prayer, and in the afternoon they preached the gospel. All the meetings were held in the Gospel Hall in Tai-Ping Chiao. In the evenings there were the edification meetings in the house of Dr. Wu You-min. By the grace of God, the meetings were excellent even though the political condition was tense. On the twenty-ninth Brothers Chai and Chen went to visit Miss X (a missionary) in Bai-Ya-Tan. They rested there for two days. On the first morning of this month, they went to Che-Yu to visit Brother Huang Da-ji. In the afternoon they returned to Bai-Ya-Tan. Brother Chen Ke-san also happened to be there on the same day, and they attended the Tuesday meeting together. This meeting used to be conducted by Miss M. E. Barber on the first Tuesday of every month and has continued through all these years. Most of the attendees are workers from Foochow, Chang-Loh, and Lien-Jiang. Although it lasts for only one day, there are four to five meetings. The contents of the meetings concern prayer, mutual sharing, edification, and fellowship. During this critical period we are still able to meet in peace and to encourage one another. The Lord's grace and love are beyond our tongue's description. We can only thank and praise Him. May the Lord preserve His children everywhere to live in peace and godliness until His return, when we will share in His glory, amen. Brother Chai and the two Chens left for Foochow on the third and returned to Pu-Han on the fourth. Brother Ong Je-dun was working in the Yung-Tai and Lien-Jiang areas. However, due to his weak health, he is now resting in Lien-Jiang and Ma-Wei. He has recuperated slightly. Yesterday, he also left Bai-Ya-Tan. I heard that he will be traveling to north Fukien to visit the saints. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Fang Jia-ze, May 6</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Han Fu-shen, Ch'ang-Teh</h2><p>I returned yesterday. I went to Dong-Ping to visit Brother Zhang. It took me nine days to get there and eight days to return. I stayed in Dong-Ping for only two days. I intend to go to Chi-Li and then to Da-Yung. I have asked Brother Paul Tsao to stay temporarily in Yuan-Ling. The political situation is very tense. Hopefully, nothing will happen in the next two months. When I return from Da-Yung, I hope to be able to travel safely to Yuan-Ling. Last month four sisters and two brothers were baptized in Ch'ang-Teh and Chou-Jia-Dien. After we left, there were only three brothers left in Ch'ang-Teh. Brother Fung is now working in the post office. He is responsible for everything here. The meeting in the countryside is headed up by Brother Mei Han-ke, a newly raised up brother.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Han Fu-shen, April 5</p><h2 class="head1">MISCELLANEOUS NEWS</h2><p>(1) Brother Hsu Jung-jieh wrote on April 13: "Brother Hu wrote saying that this year the snow is particularly heavy. Men from Wei-Si came and said that the route through the snowy mountains in Wei-Si has been cleared only recently. Brother Hu was not able to leave Yeh-Ji to work elsewhere because of the blockage of snow. I intend to leave my family in Da-Li. If I can get the ticket, my whole family will set out."</p><p>(2) Brother Chen Hsi-wen wrote on April 14: "I intend to go to Yi-Nan to visit and then travel west. I am waiting for the Lord's arrangement and timing."</p><p>(3) Brother Stephen Kaung arrived in K'un-ming on the afternoon of April 27. It is said that he will travel with Brother Weigh on May 3.</p><p>(4) News from Chefoo on May 2: "During this week, there are two meetings a week at Brother Chao's house in West Hill in Chefoo. One meeting is the co-workers' meeting, and the other is the brothers' and sisters' meeting. During the brothers' and sisters' meeting, Brother Witness Lee spoke on Christ and the church. On the Lord's Day, April 30, there was a gospel meeting. Over thirty people stood up to receive the Lord. The Lord has been particularly blessing the gospel meetings on the Lord's Day."</p><p>(5) Sister Bao Hsu-min is said to be in Jien-Ou. The correspondence address for Brothers Wang Deng-ming and Wang You-yi is Tung-An, Fukien. Sisters Fang Chiung-ying and Weigh Kwang-ying are working in the villages around Han-Jiang in Fukien.</p><p>(6) Brother Lan Tsi-yi wrote on April 17: "There has been more urging in the direction of the orphanage recently. I hope that, by the Lord's grace, I will not be influenced by the need and the urging. However, I do not want to be too self-assured or disobey the Lord through withdrawing myself. Under the present situation, even those who have the heart and the strength are afraid to touch such an endeavor. Please pray for this."</p><p>(7) Sister Peace Wang wrote on May 5: "On the first of the month, I returned from Cheung-Chau to Kowloon. Brother James Chen was recently in Hong Kong. Brother Luan is still resting in Cheung-Chau. I have preached the gospel a few times in Kowloon-Tong." On May 13 she wrote: "On the fifteenth I will go with senior Mrs. Nee to Macao. Brother James Chen will travel with us. Barring any hindrance, I will leave Hong Kong for Shanghai on June 3."</p><p>(8) Sister An Siu-fen has arrived in Shanghai from Chefoo.</p><p>(9) Brother Chou Shin-yih has returned to Shanghai from Chekiang.

He needs our prayer.</p><p>(10) Brother Hsu Dah-wei wrote on April 24: "The meetings in Ya-Yao-Tou in Bai-Sha, Ping-Yang, lasted for seven days (March 17 to 23). The co-workers and elders in the five counties of Fu-Ding, Tai-Shun, Wenchow, Rue-An, and Ping-Yang used this time together to pray in oneness before the busy farming season began. Here and there Brother Chang would release a little message. Every time we gathered together, we always prayed first, and then some would stand up to speak. The Lord was with us, and we experienced much blessing from the Lord. The Holy Spirit was operating clearly among us, and many wept for their sins. The messages of Brother Chang were about hating sins and being under God's light and also about God's standard and man's tradition. Sisters came from Ping-Tai and Fu-Ding to work among the sisters. They stayed for many days."</p><p>(11) A letter from northern Kiangsu on April 14 said: "The brothers and sisters in northern Kiangsu are all safe.

Thank the Lord that we saw His protection and presence everywhere we went. After arriving in Tai-Yuen we found a rented place. Thank the Lord for His grace! After conducting meetings in the villages in Ho-Jin, we passed Chu-Wo, Lin-Fen, and came to Tai-Yuen. Everywhere we met seekers of the Lord. We sincerely hope that the Lord would lead some to come to south Shansi to work. May the Lord raise up many more obedient ones. In Ho-Jin County the Lord's table is in three places: Sin-Chun, Shia-Niu-Chun, and Yan-Chun. In each place there are twenty to thirty people. Thank the Lord. Most of the ones we knew from Tai-Yuen have left for other places. Thank the Lord that we can get to know more new brothers and sisters. Please pray much for the work in Tai-Yuen. May the Lord raise up men to bear the overcoming testimony of the Lord. Greetings to all the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Brother and sister in the Lord,<br />Chai En-shang and Chai Ying-fang, April 3</p><h2 class="head2">Chuanchow, Fukien Province</h2><p>Thank the Lord. Although Chuanchow was bombed a few times, we were all preserved by the Lord and are all safe. Over the past year the Spirit of the Lord has comforted us with several verses. Proverbs 1:33 says, "But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil." Isaiah 26:3 says, "You will keep the steadfast of mind/In perfect peace/Because he trusts in You." Verse 12 says, "O Jehovah, You will ordain peace for us." Please pray for us so that we will not receive grace in vain or make the ground useless.</p><p>Brothers representing the church in Chuanchow,<br />Yang Shi-chao, Wang Bu-jou, Gu Teh-en, April 13</p><h2 class="head2">Yi-Yang, Hunan Province</h2><p>Dear Brothers Kuo and Liu:</p><p>I have been in Yang-Jia-Wan for over a month. Although I do not see the Spirit's obvious work, He is operating here. First, the Spirit has been guiding us in the matter of prayer. Now we have meetings practically every evening. Every adult and a few children are opening their mouths to pray in the name of the Father. We believe that our God is a God who answers prayer, and soon He will perform great works. Second, there are three co-workers here. They have been enlightened afresh by the Lord and brought to Golgotha, and they have consecrated themselves afresh to the Lord. Presently, the women and children in Yang-Jia-Wan are studying Bible Studies for Beginners. We ask that you pray for me all the time so that I can stand faithfully for the Lord and have a life and an attitude of crucifixion, preaching "Christ, and this One crucified." Concerning the matter of divine healing, I do not doubt, nor dare doubt, its reality. Indeed, God's promise of healing is wonderful. Those who have faith to receive it will see the manifestation of God's glory. However, we should realize and be reminded that we are still in the flesh and still carry weakness. We are still restricted by natural laws. I am referring to our daily life after being healed. We should not overexert ourselves in walking or working. Our Lord rested by the well when He became weary of walking on earth. This teaches us that though He is God, He was limited by His body...Here I cannot help but consider how excellent is the Lord's coming! We will see Him as He is. He will change our body, and we will be like Him. Hallelujah! O Lord, come quickly! Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Yang Dai, March 8</p><h2 class="head2">Chou-Jia-Dien, Ch'ang-Teh, Hunan Province</h2><p>A year ago I was living in Mei-Chuang by myself. At that time I prayed that God would raise up a work in Ch'ang-Teh. After a few months God sent His servant Brother Han Fu-shen...In Ch'ang-Teh, we now have a meeting. But my home is about seventy to eighty miles from Ch'ang-Teh, and I cannot go to the meetings often. I then asked God to raise up His children and work in Chou-Jia-Dien, a small town five or six miles from my home. A few months later God sent His servants Han Fu-shen and Brother Shang to Chou-Jia-Dien. My wife, my mother, my sister, and I often pray and study the Word together. In the middle of the first month, the Lord led us to have a seven-day evangelistic conference, which was followed by a ten-day edification conference. The Lord used Brother Han greatly. The Lord saved my whole family. Glory to His name! The members of the Alliance Church as well as the preacher were greatly touched. We borrowed their hall for our meeting. Starting last Lord's Day, there is a table meeting in my house. We have seven or eight people breaking bread together. Even the missionary and the members of the Alliance Church joined us in the table. They are all beloved of the Lord, and they all love the Lord and desire to learn the truth. From now on there will be regular meetings. We will also be preaching the gospel to our friends and relatives. Please pray for us.</p><p>A weak brother,<br />Mei Han-keh, March 15</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'ang-sha, Hunan Province</h2><p>I have decided to travel with Brother and Mrs. Kuo Jeng-yung and two sisters by steamer to Ch'ang-Teh. I took my family and walked from Han-Dao to Tzi-Li. All the brothers and sisters in Ch'ang-sha are scattered. Some have moved to the countryside. Only Brother Ji Dun-wu and his family are still living in the Bible school. There are still two sisters in the orphanage.

Box 323, Shanghai,<br />June 1939</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Watchman Nee</h2><p>The Lord willing, my ship will arrive in Marseille tomorrow. I will probably stay in India and Singapore for a little while before returning to Shanghai....In reading The Open Door, I was happy on the one hand and worried on the other hand. If the co-workers do not have the basic qualifications for work, will the future of the work be different from the past? May the Lord grant us grace. You may have done much traveling, but are you sure of what you are doing? Everything depends on the knowledge of the cross in dealing with the natural strength.</p><p>Watchman Nee, May 22</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Witness Lee</h2><p>I am now on my way to Tsingtao by steamer with Brothers Chao Chi-gwang and Liu Bei-min. The Lord willing, I will stay in Tsingtao for half a month. Then I will travel along the Tsingtao-Tsinan Railway route to visit the brothers and sisters in Gao-Mi, Wei-Shien, Ching-Chow, and Tsinan. The Lord willing, I will return to Chefoo by the middle of July. The Lord's table meeting in Chefoo has now been subdivided into two places, one in Shuang-He-Li and the other in Brother Chao Xu-dong's house in West Hill. The condition of these meetings is quite good. I feel that there are two things pressing before us. One is the perfecting of the young workers, and the other is how much a local church has come up to God's standard. We cannot say that some people do not have the call, but it is too early for them to touch the work. It then becomes a real problem as to how to lead them on and perfect them. The more the work grows, the more we will see people turning to the Lord, and the greater this problem will become. As for the local churches, thank the Lord that He has granted us blessing in many places. We truly thank the Lord for the love of the brothers and sisters and their zeal toward Him. But we are still not up to the standard that the Lord has shown us. Is there a definite date for Brother Nee's arrival yet?</p><p>Brother Witness Lee on the Shun-Tien steamer, June 5</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Kaung and Brother Weigh<br />after Arriving in Chungking</h2><p>We left K'un-ming by bus on March 3 and arrived in Kuei-yang on the sixth. In Kuei-yang we had a few evenings of special meetings. The brothers and sisters in Kuei-yang meet every Lord's Day afternoon at the house of Brother Liu Jing-si for prayer. The Lord willing, they will soon have the Lord's table. We left Kuei-yang on May 11 and arrived in Chungking on the fourteenth. It was the Lord's Day, and we were able to remember the Lord with a few brothers in the afternoon. Recently, most of the brothers and sisters have been scattered everywhere. Under such circumstances, our work has been limited to personal visitations, home gospel meetings, and mutual exhortations. The Lord willing, we will go next Monday to visit the brothers and sisters in Hsu-Fu or Ch'eng-tu. Please pray for us.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Stephen Kaung and K.H.Weigh, May 16</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Hu Yi-min</h2><p>Presently, I am in working in areas around Li-Suh such as Loh-Toh-Loh, Yen-Wah-Loh, and Na-Bai-Loh. Every evening five to ten people come to listen. Once I spent sixteen to seventeen days between Yeh-Ji and Yen-Za. Although reaching that area involves only a four-day journey from Yeh-Ji, the inhabitants are all Sikang natives. They are not as willing to receive the word as the Li-Suh natives. If Brother Hsu comes, we can rent a house in this area and work for a longer period of time. During the next few months I will not be able to travel or do anything further. I wish I could be free from the burdens of family and the bondage of this world so that I might glorify the Lord's name all my life. My respectful greetings to the brothers and sisters in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Hu I-min, April 29</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Hsu Jung-jieh</h2><p>I will set off tomorrow for Wei-Si. Today I received the tent. Thank the Lord for His grace! I will work first among the Yi tribes. I will also go to Sikang if the Lord opens the door. Everything is in the Lord's hands. When will Brother Nee arrive in Shanghai? I am always thinking of him. Give my regards and greetings to the co-workers and saints in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, May 10</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chang Kwang-rong</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Since the meetings at Bai-Sha, I stayed with Brother Hsu in Fan-Shan for a month. On April 26 we left Fan-Shan for Shi-Ping, and on May 5 we went to Yang-Fu-Ling. On the thirteenth we went to Jin-Shiang. The churches in Ping-Yang are growing more rapidly than in other places, and the work is plentiful. We wish some experienced co-worker sisters would take some young co-worker sisters along and come to help the sisters in Pin-Shun, Tai-Shun, and Fu-Ding. Ping-Yang and Tai-Shun are poor areas and have been more so recently because of the war. But thank the Lord that the poor are able to hear the gospel. Since meeting Brother Hsu in Hu-Shan, I have been working with him. More and more I have felt that it is better for two to work together than for one to work alone. The co-workers in Ping-Yang and Tai-Shun would like to have a meeting for co-workers after Brother Nee returns. It would be even better if Brother Nee could come for some meetings in Ping-Yang. Has Brother Nee arrived in Shanghai yet? Please give my greetings to the brothers.</p><p>Brother Chang Kwang-rong, May 30</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Brother Hsu has gone to Ba-Chao from Jin-Shiang. I am still staying in Jin-Shiang and learning to be with the Lord by myself. Please pray for us.</p><p>Brother Chang Kwang-rong, June 7</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chen Jai-seng</h2><p>Thank the Lord for leading me to go with Brothers Chai and Chen to north Fukien to learn to serve the Lord. Although the itinerary was tight, I received much help and teaching concerning the work. I intended to stay longer in north and west Fukien to be trained by the Lord in those places, but the Lord did not open the way circumstantially. I had to turn from Nan-Ping to Foochow and Chang-Loh with Brother Chai to visit the saints in those places. We met Brother Chen Ke-san again in Bai-Ya-Tan. After the prayer meeting we returned to Pu-Tien. The next day the road was destroyed, and the order for dispersal came. During the past month, although there have been bombings, the brothers and sisters in the Lord have been preserved in safety. We give thanks unceasingly for the Lord's grace!</p><p>Transportation is difficult, and it is difficult to work in the cities and towns. But thank the Lord that this enables us to be burdened for the souls in the villages and mountain regions. Otherwise, when would the people who are sitting in darkness receive the light, and when would the footsteps of the apostles accumulate dust from their places? We see the Lord's good will even in these circumstances. Praise the Lord! May the Lord empower me so that I will not become a lazy servant.</p><p>This is a time when the harvest is ripe and the workers are few. Yet the workers have been restricted by distance and language and are holding out in their different corners. The work has been like a pan of scattered sand! Lately, I have been deeply aware of the preciousness of working together and the importance of praying together. I also see the danger of acting independently and the evil of walking in an unrelated manner. The flesh is exposed as being more and more evil, and our spiritual life has become more and more hungry. One as immature as I am truly needs prayer from all sides. If Brother Nee has returned, please give my greetings to him.</p><p>Brother Chen Jai-seng, May 29</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Sister Liao Ong Yu-bing</h2><p>The local church in Jien-Ou does not have official elders yet, but all the affairs have been taken up by local brothers and sisters. Sister Lee Mo-chai and I came to work in Shao. Our emphasis has been on personal evangelism, and there seems to be much enthusiasm. The Lord has blessed His work. The Lord has led us to do this particularly, and we are at peace about it. Indeed, we have experienced that those who nourish others will be nourished themselves! The brothers are not here yet, and we can only do miscellaneous work. I feel that I can leave the work in Jien-Ou behind now. After this summer Shao-yun and Jia-en will go elsewhere for high school, and I will be more free to serve the Lord.</p><p>Sister Yu-bing, May 17</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Bao Hsu-min</h2><p>Presently, transportation is difficult, and I do not know when I will have a free way to go to Shanghai. May He accomplish His best. Sister Mo-chai has returned to Ku-Tien, and I have returned from the country to the city. The Lord willing, I will go to Fu-Ding, Tai-Shun, and Ping-Yang by land and stay for a while. Brothers and sisters from Ping-Yang have written to me for a long time inviting me to come.</p><p>Sister Bao Hso-min, June 6</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Han Fu-shen</h2><p>I returned from Dong-Ping and stayed in Ch'ang-Teh for half a month. On April 16 I went to Chi-Li. The work along the way was blessed by the Lord. I conducted three meetings at the China Inland Mission in Tsou-Si. Missionary X and Mr. Shu were quite seeking. The missionary accompanied me to Jiu-Si, which is sixty-five miles away from Tsou-Si, and I preached at the Presbyterian Gospel Hall for three days. I arrived in Chi-Li on the twenty-third and had three evenings of meetings. Although the number was very small, the Lord did some definite work. Brother Shang is staying in Chi-Li. On the seventh we set off in sedan chairs and arrived in Da-Yung in two days. We met a few brothers for the first time, and it was a joy to fellowship with one another. Now we are in the process of renting a house for meeting use. Greetings to the workers and saints in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Han Fu-shen, May 5</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Lan Tsi-yi</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>By the Lord's sovereign arrangement, my family and I have moved to the upper floor of the meeting hall in Gospel Lane. The house is now being used in three ways. The church uses the first floor; I use a medium-size room; and the rest is used as temporary quarters for the orphanage, which can hold thirty people. In all the things we do, we see that the Lord's yoke is easy and His burden light.</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Lan Tsi-yi, May 31</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>The work of the orphanage is progressing smoothly.

Sending a single copy makes it easier for us to receive it. It enables those brothers in far-off places to know of the footsteps and news of the saints in other places and to see how the Lord protects His children in the midst of difficulties to enjoy peace in Him. It fills our heart with thanksgiving and praise. God has been continually gracious to us in the meetings here. May we continually pray. The amount of money which we have sent through Brother Tien is to be used toward the need of item number four mentioned in "A Word on Behalf of the Editor" in Issue No. 16. May the Lord direct you to distribute it. (This amount has been distributed to the needy saints in northern Kiangsu&mdash;Editor.)

We are remembering many brothers and sisters in our prayers, and we need you to pray for us as well. The Lord's work increased in the midst of tribulation. There are now believers even in this little corner of the mountain regions. May all the glory go to Him, amen.

X dollars are for the needy saints who are in the midst of the war zones (Heb. 13:3). This amount was collected from offering boxes in various places. It is the willing offering of the saints. On the first day of the first month of the year, some decided to skip a meal, and others decided to eat only light porridge for a few meals or to save up money by other means to make this offering for the purpose of caring for the saints in need because of the war. We are learning to walk according to God's commandment.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Ma Chuan-foo, April 23</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'ang-sha, Hunan Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Philip in the Lord:</p><p>During the past few days I felt that I had to take care of a few things personally, one of which is related to the passing away of my friend Ji Dun-wu of Shou-Jou, who is now with the Lord. God's will is always the best. Since my two long-standing friends are no longer with me, I have felt even more busy. My health is not good, and letters are piling up, waiting for my answer. I have been tired daily. Originally, I asked my co-workers to write this letter on my behalf, and then I would make the draft and sign it in order to save some energy. But sometimes I feel that I have to write a letter in my own handwriting. Furthermore, I would like the friends in Shanghai to know of the passing away of Mr. Ji Dun-wu. I still need others to pray for my health. Peace in the Lord. Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Cheng Ji-guei, Ch'ang-sha Bible School, May 31</p><h2 class="head2">Tung-Ping, Hunan Province</h2><p>Our dear brother Zhang Gun-jih rested in the Lord at 6:00 a.m. on May 30! We thank all the brothers and sisters in the Lord who prayed for and asked about him in brotherly love. During the first semester of last year, Brother Zhang was led of the Lord to come to Yi-Yang to teach English at the Lutheran High School. After classes he would always talk with the students about the salvation of the Lord. In the evening he would study the original language of the Scripture with the help of a certain Western brother. On the Lord's Day he would conduct either two or three meetings. During the summer vacation he traveled to and from Ch'ang-sha twice in order to serve the brothers and to conduct conferences. He did not rest the whole summer, and his poor health deteriorated into illness. Brother Zhang always had a desire to pioneer in the frontier lands. Two days before he died, he said, "The work should be initiated by prayer and progress from places that are near to places that are faraway." His concern for the service of the Lord was seen in his heart, in his prayer, and in his words. Brother Zhang is gone, but his testimony will have a lasting effect on the Western and Chinese brothers and sisters in Hunan. His family is in a dire condition. Please pray for them.</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Yu Yien-chuan, May 31</p><h2 class="head2">K'un-ming, Yunnan Province</h2><p>We had been renting the house in Dong-Si Street for our meeting. Now the owner is not willing to rent to us. Beginning from the thirtieth of last month, we moved to [omitted]. Because many of the brothers and sisters have been dispersed into the country, this place is adequate for our use now. Since the Lord's church was established in K'un-ming, we have moved seven times. We are learning to live the tent life and to thank Him as Jehovah-jireh. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Lin Yau-huei, May 3</p><h2 class="head2">Shia-Kwan, Yunnan Province</h2><p>We left K'un-ming on May 5, took the bus to Shia-Kwan, and arrived safely on the sixth. On the way we experienced the Lord's surpassing peace. Thank the Lord for putting me in this barren foreign land so that I may have the opportunity to recall all the things I have gained in the past. I remember from a sisters' meeting the story of Hagar and her bottle of water. My bottle of water can be exhausted, but there is still a well before me. Many of the teachings of God's servants have now become words in my heart and have led me through my days in this desolate land. My hospital is on a mountain, two miles from the town of Shia-Kwan. It is surrounded by mountains on three sides and faces a pond and a spring. There are forests all around, and there are fruit trees and bamboo in the forests. The produce in this land is rich, but there are not many foreign supplies. The people are frank and slow, and it is difficult to work among them. Most of the people are engaged in animal farming, and the common means of transportation is mules. Cows and goats are raised for their meat. The roads are very dirty. We have not started our work yet, because the medical supplies have not yet arrived.</p><p>Sister Chu Bao-ju<br />May 15</p><h2 class="head2">Kuei-yang, Kweichow Province</h2><p>The brothers and sisters in Kuei-yang have been preserved and are under His grace. May thanksgiving and praise be unto Him. We started meeting at my house every Sunday afternoon at two o'clock on March 26. The nature of the meetings is prayer, reading the Bible, or words of exhortation. The condition of the meetings is quite good, but the number is not great (four to eight people). Thank the Lord that His presence is with us. Please pray much for us. May the Lord shine on us so that we see where we should stand and how we should serve Him and glorify Him. Brothers Kaung and Weigh passed through Kuei-yang on their way to Chungking. They stayed in Kuei-yang for four days. There were three meetings on May 8-10. Brother Chang Teh-shu, the assistant professor at the Kuei-yang Medical School, was baptized on the ninth. He was saved a long time ago but has not been able to be baptized until now. Thank the Lord that there is now a good testimony here. I am still living in the same place.

Swatow was bombed last month, and the brothers and sisters were scattered to inland areas. There are still about thirty people remaining in Swatow. The Lord has preserved them, and they are safe. The prayer meeting and the Lord's Day morning meeting are as usual, but the number is significantly smaller. We have to mention one particular incident of the protection of the Lord. A sister named Liu was on a steamboat that was shot by machine guns from an airplane. At that time there were two brothers, the one sister, and many other people on the boat. One brother saw stray bullets falling into the water beside him. Another brother's clothes were pierced by bullets. Yet all of them were safe, and the people in the boat were also safe. During the past one or two years God has been stretching His gracious hand to protect His children everywhere. We are full of thanksgiving and praise. Enclosed please find X dollars, which are a cumulative amount received from the offering box. Please distribute it for us according to need. (It has been distributed to needy saints in other provinces&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Chai Gi-chen, Hsie Tse-shun, Chen Wen-kwang, and<br />Chen Fang-ching<br />June 13</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>(1) "The Dynamics of Service" column is still suspended in this issue. There are too many obstacles in mail delivery, and it is hard to get anything thick through. In some places we can only send a copy as an ordinary letter.</p><p>(2) From the news in this issue, we find that Brother Ji Dun-wu of Ch'ang-sha and Brother Zhang Gun-jih of Tung-Ping have slept in the Lord. The two of them have indeed left the world to be with the Lord and have rested from their labor. There are two less Christians on this earth. We cannot help but feel sad at such a thought! Although Brother Ji has passed away, his family is still able to manage itself. But Brother Zhang has left behind a widow and orphans living in strange lands. There is the need of brothers and sisters in the Lord to care for them. "This is pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction." May we sympathize with God's heart!</p><p>(3) We have found ways to send money to northern Kiangsu now. In some places we can even wire money. Thank the Lord!</p><p>(4) Presently, only Brothers Hsu Jung-jieh and Hu Yi-min are working at the border of Yunnan. I can say that many have paid attention to their work. But as far as I know, the hardship of the work and the struggles of the workers in northern Kiangsu, west Hunan, east Chekiang, and the border regions between Chekiang and Fukien are no less strenuous than the work in the frontier regions. I hope that our attention would not be turned to one direction alone. Our offering and prayer should not be directed by reports alone but by the Holy Spirit.</p><p>(5) I have said again and again that I am only distributing money for the work or for needy saints in a fiduciary capacity. Although the money passes through my hands, it has nothing to do with me. In order to make this more clear, let me state: It is not my money but the Lord's money. The giver and the receiver are related to the Lord alone.

After arriving, we spent a few evenings praying in one accord with the brothers and sisters. Then we conducted three edification meetings in the evenings. On the eleventh of this month (a Lord's Day) in the afternoon, we had the first Lord's table meeting in Shu-Fu. There were four brothers and four sisters. On the twelfth to the seventeenth of this month, we preached the gospel every evening at a building in the park, and we had a large audience. After the gospel meetings, we had three nights of special meetings for the new believers. The Lord willing, we will conduct a baptism in the near future. After the work concludes here, we intend to make a visit to Ch'eng-tu. The Lord has put brothers and sisters in a few places in Szechuan already (such as O-Mei-Shan, Rong-Chang, Yung-Chuan, Shin-Jin, and Nan-Bu). The Lord willing, we desire very much to go and visit them and to testify for the Lord.</p><p>Passing through the provinces of Kweichow and Szechuan this time, we were impressed by the vastness of the harvest and the scarcity of workers who are of the same mind. The testimonies of the lampstand are as rare as morning stars, and the situation in Kweichow is particularly desolate. While we passed through Jun-Yi (Kweichow), we met a Western missionary who was very sympathetic toward the book Rethinking Our Work. He had ordered a few copies and had given them to others. We spent some time to talk and pray with him. He prayed, "Lord, many of Your servants have passed through Kweichow from Yunnan to Szechuan or from Szechuan to Yunnan but have neglected Kweichow. May You send workers to Kweichow." These words show the need of Kweichow. Through the recent scattering of the saints, many doors to the work have opened to the workers. We pray that the Lord would send many workers to come and meet this need. As for me (Stephen Kaung), through the Lord's sovereign arrangement, I intend to move my family to Shu-Fu temporarily. It is an obvious fact that there is a great need in Szechuan and that the present time is critical and urgent. I am weak and do not feel adequate to meet this urgent need. I can only hope to stand in Szechuan while waiting expectantly for more workers to come. Greetings to all the workers in Shanghai.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />K.H.Weigh and Stephen Kaung<br />June 22</p><p>(According to correspondence from Shu-Fu on August 5, Brothers Weigh and Kaung left Shu-Fu for Ch'eng-tu on July 14. According to correspondence from Ch'eng-tu on August 14, they remained in Ch'eng-tu for about a month. According to correspondence from K'un-ming on August 21, Brother Weigh arrived in K'un-ming with Brother Chang Hwei-zhi on August 13.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Hsu Dah-wei</h2><p>I have been with Brother Chang ever since I met him in Hu-Shan on February 24. However, at a certain point, he felt ill-disposed to continue with the work during May in Jiang-Nan, so he went alone to Fan-Shan for a rest. I then went with Brother Chen Chin-fa to Yien-Ting and Sha-Di, and then with Brother Hwang Li-chuen to Lu-Pu, Ya-Yao-Tou, and Luh-Bien. After working there I went to Fan-Shan at the beginning of July to join Brother Chang again.</p><p>The Lord willing, I intend to take a little rest and wait on the Lord with Brother Chang. After summer, if the sea route from Wenchow to Shanghai is clear, I hope to return to Shanghai. There is much work waiting for us in many places, but the question is whether or not the workers themselves have food to distribute, and whether they can distribute it in season. We have accepted the doctrine of the cross for a long time. But the knowledge of Christ in the Spirit and the knowledge of the power of His resurrection and of our conformity to His death and our suffering with Him are life-long lessons. I feel that we truly need the Lord's mercy.</p><p>Hsu Dah-wei<br />August 8</p><h2 class="head2">About to Begin the Work at Nu River,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>Two weeks ago, Brother Hu came to Wei-Si and has now returned to Yeh-Ji. After he finishes his preparations, he will come to Wei-Si again, and I will set out with him to Nu River for the work there. We will probably leave on the twenty-sixth or twenty-seventh of this month. The way to Sikang is still very rugged. We heard that the two brothers from Norway are still in Yien-Jing County because of the inaccessibility of the roads. Due to the fact that the way to Sikang is still not clear and the door to the work among the Yi tribes in Nu River has now opened up, we decided to go to Nu River and work there. Last year Brother Hu and I worked for only a month there. All the places we went to now have two groups of people. One group just goes along with what we say, while the other group has truly heard the Lord's truth. They have accepted it and are practicing it according to the Scriptures. This is the Lord's doing! Some time ago some men came from Nu River and asked Brother Hu and me to go and do some work among them again. We are going to places we have not been before and will be away for two months before returning to Wei-Si. The Lord willing, we will probably be able to sustain ourselves for two to three months. After we return we will look to the Lord's leading for the next journey. Please pray much for us. Brother David Ho will travel with us. May the Lord lead us in His path according to His will. Give our greetings to Brother Nee if he has returned to Shanghai. Greetings to the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh<br />June 24</p><h2 class="head2">Recent News of the Work in Kulangsu</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>I arrived safely in Kulangsu on the morning of the twentieth. After praying in one accord with the brothers and sisters, we all felt the need to preach the gospel here. We have decided to have gospel meetings every evening from the twenty-fourth to the twenty-ninth. At the same time, we will have a prayer meeting every morning. It was unusual for the Lord to lead me to leave Shanghai just when Brother Nee returned. It is even more surprising that I have a burden for working outside Shanghai at this time. Perhaps the Lord is teaching me the lesson of dropping everything and trusting in Himself alone. Indeed, what else can we trust? We can only lift our eyes to heaven.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Tang Shou-ling, July 24</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Thank the Lord for leading His servant, Mr. Tang, to arrive safely in Kulangsu on July 20. Although he suffered sea-sickness on the boat, he is still healthy for the most part. We preached the gospel to the outsiders from the twenty-fourth to the twenty-ninth. About five to six hundred came and listened. Over one hundred raised their hands to indicate their willingness to believe in the Lord. Glory to His name! From July 31 to August 5 there will be five days of edification meetings for the believers. May the Lord accomplish His will through the ones He uses.</p><p>The meeting hall has become inadequate for our use. After more than a year's consideration and prayer, it seems that there is no other way except to build something ourselves. Recently, we purchased a piece of land. The Lord willing, we will begin to build.</p><p>Wan-ching<br />August 1</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Chen Jai-seng,<br />Han-Jiang</h2><p>Last month I went with Brother Chai Gi-chen and others to Si-Shan, Di-Lu, to learn to work on sowing. I received much teaching and encouragement through this hands-on experience in the field. One feels satisfied when he stays at home and realizes his emptiness when he travels around. I felt ashamed when friends visiting asked for help and I could not render them any. In my spirit I have often mused over Revelation 3:17 and have felt unqualified to work for the Lord. O Lord, be merciful to me and bend me. Please do not forget to pray for me. I have received and read Issue No. 18 of The Open Door. The two things that Brother Witness Lee spoke of are indeed our present need.</p><p>I heard that the Lord provided Brother Nee a smooth journey back to Shanghai. We are very pleased about this. Thank the Lord. We hope that we can grasp some of the riches of grace the Lord has given to him. I heard that Brother Chen Ke-san is conducting a Bible study in Sien-You, while Brother Chai Gi-chen is staying in Pu-Tien. I no longer rent the house in Gung-Kou. On July 17 I moved to Shang-Lin-Chun. This little village has about thirty local brothers and sisters. They have been persecuted for many years by their fellow villagers. But by the grace of the Lord, they have been able to stand fast. They have all experienced household salvation. Because there are meetings in this village, the believers in neighboring villages come to worship and remember the Lord together. May glory be unto Him forever, amen. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Jai-seng<br />August 4</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Wu Ren-jieh</h2><p>Because our distance from the throne is the same, I have been remembering the kinfolk in Christ while looking daily to the unmatched One. May He gain the fullness, the glory, and everything in the church, amen.</p><p>Brother Nee's word on the natural strength being dealt with and Brother Lee's word on being careful in touching the Lord's work have given me a deeper understanding of the words: "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling." I am always willing to be taught. Brother Chai Wen-bin, a responsible brother, has the burden to start an orphanage here. Originally, he intended to start one in Chuenchow but has not found anyone whom the Lord can entrust the matter to. Furthermore, the political situation is unsteady, and it is not wise to proceed. When he read The Open Door, he found that Brother Lan Tsi-yi had started such a work in Hankow, and he would like to offer X dollars. Please direct this sum to Brother Lan. We are happy that Brother Nee has returned safely. Please give my regards to all the co-workers.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Wu Ren-jieh<br />August 16</p><h2 class="head1">MISCELLANEOUS NEWS</h2><p>(1) Brother Shan Kai-fen wrote on June 24 that he visited the brothers in Si-Shing in May. After discovering that he had a lump in his chest, he dropped everything, returned home, and had dealings with the Lord. Thank the Lord that the lump in his chest has gradually softened, and he is healthier now. He has consecrated his whole being to the Lord once again, asking the Lord to trim him and perfect him. He is waiting in peace for the Lord's leading, no longer acting according to his own will.</p><p>(2) Brother Chen Meng-tsao wrote on June 29: "Brothers Lin Mei-seng and Hu Bu-dao have been preaching the gospel in Lan-Si. Brother Ma Chuan-foo released messages for five days in the Jin-Hwa Congregational Church. Recently, I preached the gospel in Dah-Tang-Jen, Lan-Bei, Chen's house in Lung-Yu, and Chien-Men-Jang in Tang-Si. Please pray for me when you remember me."</p><p>(3) Brother Lan Tsi-yi wrote on July 19 that there are now eleven students and teachers in his orphanage. He has recently admitted seven more, who have yet to arrive because of difficulty in transportation. In his letter on August 18 he wrote: "The children in the orphanage are preserved by the Lord's grace and are all safe. They are all lively and happy. They are totally different from the day they entered the orphanage. There are only two who are older; the rest of them are all eight to ten years old."</p><p>(4) Brother Han Fu-shen wrote from Yuan-Ling on July 18: "I came to Yuan-Ling on the fourteenth (walking for three days from Chi-Li to Ch'ang-Teh, resting for one day in Ch'ang-Teh, and then taking a bus the rest of the way). Yuan-Ling is undamaged, but the dispersion of inhabitants has decreased the population....There are quite a number of students who have been saved at the Fu-Siang Girls' School. The two meetings last Lord's Day were quite good. We hope that we can conduct a conference soon."</p><p>(5) Sister Luk Tsi-tsien wrote on July 8 that she is in the Gospel Village in Fu-Hu-Chiao.</p><p>(6) A letter from Luh-Liang, Yunnan indicated that three brothers and two sisters were baptized in Luh-Liang in June.</p><p>(7) Sister Peace Wang wrote on August 15: "Brothers Philip Luan and Faithful Luk went to Penang on the third of this month. The Lord willing, I will go with Sister Hwang Bi-gwe to Penang also at the end of this month."</p><p>(8) Brother Wang Tze-yu from Gao-Mi wrote on July 16: "Thank the Lord that we have been kept up to date with the footsteps of the brothers through The Open Door. The Lord led Brother Witness Lee to conduct a conference for believers last month in Tsingtao. Thank the Lord for gracing us and for guiding us to the way of obedience and submission to His authority. Although the Lord has gained me, I am quite weak spiritually. I hope that the brothers and sisters in Shanghai will pray much for me. My greetings to the saints in Shanghai."</p><p>(9) Brother Wu Wei wrote from northern Kiangsu on July 13 and sent his greetings to the brothers and sisters in Shanghai.</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE CHURCHES</h2><h2 class="head2">Gao-Mi, Shantung Province</h2><p>Thank the Lord, even though we are weak to the uttermost, He sent four of His workers, Brothers Witness Lee, Chang Tze-jieh, Chao Chi-gwang, and Liu Bei-min from Tsingtao. We had six days of meetings. God released the truth through the mouth of Brother Lee. The cold ones were revived, and the stubborn ones were turned. We truly saw the Lord's provision and blessing. Two brothers from Ping-Du were able to stay together with Brother Lee, and their hearts were deeply touched. The Lord's testimony was brought to the villages of Pin-Du through them. Brother Hsu Yi-min of Ju-Cheng and Brother Hu Yee-tzi of Jiao County were both revived at the Tsingtao conference. Please pray for the brothers and sisters in these four counties. Enclosed please find X dollars from the offering box in Gao-Mi for The Christian, the gospel work in the Chekiang-Fukien area, and the needy saints. Please distribute it on our behalf.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Hu Shen-fu, July 8</p><h2 class="head2">Ju-Cheng, Shantung Province</h2><p>Thank the Lord for starting His work here. The Lord has graced us. Three brothers and three sisters are standing on the testimony of oneness, serving Him, and glorifying Him. Other than the Lord's Day morning meeting, we will have a small meeting on the Lord's Day afternoon, the Lord willing. There are over ten brothers and sisters who come regularly to the meetings. We started the Lord's table meeting on July 16. Seven to eight people come each time. Please pray much for us. Enclosed please find X dollars for The Christian; the rest is for needy brothers and sisters. May the Lord bless this small sum as He blessed the five loaves and two fishes.</p><p>Weak members in the Lord,<br />Lee Wen-han and Hsu Yi-min, August 15</p><h2 class="head2">Mo-Gan-Shan, Chekiang Province</h2><p>I regret that I could not attend Brother Watchman Nee's special conference. Although the mail route is clear, land transportation is still blocked. I hope that more publications will come out so that those in the inland regions, who cannot listen in person, can receive the help from the literature. The church meetings in the mountains have been going on as before on the Lord's Day. There are still regular Bible classes and home prayer meetings. Thank the Lord for His great grace; His work is still able to go on in this hidden corner. Both my family and the Yu family have no leading to leave the mountain. Circumstantially, there is no possibility of leaving the mountain anyway. May the Father guide us so that by the time we leave the mountain, a few families can join us. The standard of living on the mountain has gone up quite a bit. Of course, we have to live in a simple way in everything. Greetings to Brother Nee and all the saints. Be comforted that we are safe in the mountains.</p><p>Sister in the Lord,<br />Sun Chen Yao-jen, August 11</p><h2 class="head2">Nan-Sha, Chekiang Province</h2><p>A few brothers from Nan-Sha found jobs in Shanghai. This is wonderful. Presently, the east and north sides of Sha-Di are disaster areas because of the flood. Much of the saints' land is flooded. More is about to be flooded. The saints can only look solely to the Lord and pray in oneness at set times in the morning. There is no other way. Please pray for all the things that are happening to the brothers in Nan-Sha.</p><p>Brother Kao Jin-fu, July 7</p><h2 class="head2">Kuling, Kiangsi Province</h2><p>My whole family is in Kuling and has been preserved by the Lord. Last year Brother Hu Bao-shan and his family left Kuling for Hunan. They are now staying at Shen Jou-shing's drugstore in Shang-Chiao, Tao-Yuan. Brother Cheng Tso and his family of five moved to inland regions in Kiangsi. The Lord's Day morning meeting in Kuling is conducted according to the number in attendance. Sometimes we preach the gospel, and sometimes it is for perfecting the saints. The Lord's table meeting is in the afternoon. The number ranges from twenty to more than thirty. There are more sisters than brothers. Please continue to pray for us in Kuling. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Yu Xin-liang, July 25</p><h2 class="head2">Swatow, Kwangtung Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>During May, the city of Swatow experienced several bombings. Thank the Lord that all the brothers and sisters in the Lord are safe. During the crisis, about thirty brothers and sisters remained in Swatow. Thank the Father for His grace; all of them are safe. The incident gave us an opportunity to know God through our experience. We believe that God is our hiding place and a shelter for our life. May all the glory go to Him forever, amen. Brother Wen-kwang intends to travel by boat to Kulangsu. Brother Ge-chen left for the inland regions on June 21.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Hsie Tze-shun and Chen Fang-ching, July 13</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Most of the brothers and sisters who were working at the steamship company or who were engaged in embroidery work have lost their jobs. But thank the Lord that He has sufficient grace. They are able to get by for now. We do not know what to do in the future. May the Lord grant us grace and open a way for His people.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Hsie Tze-shun and Chen Fang-ching, August 3</p><h2 class="head2">Jien-Ou, Fukien Province</h2><p>Brother Jie-dun has been here for two months. He had overly exerted himself, and I asked him to come for a rest. Lately, he has improved a little, but he is still weak and unable to bear any stress.</p><p>Jien-Ou experienced a large-scale bombing on June 25 and the sixth of this month. The first time we were in a meeting. Over fifty people were listening to a message. Soon a fire spread in a wild way. We were only a tree's distance from the fire. The leaves on the other side of the tree had already changed color. Yet we were all safe and continued to break bread as usual. The second time the bombing came we were a few hundred feet from Small Pear Hill. A house behind us received one bomb, and a large building received another bomb. The elementary school across the street received several bombs. Dust filled the air, and when we lifted up our heads, we found almost everything gone. Yet the amazing thing was that our house did not sustain any damage except some fallen roof shingles. The partition between the meeting room and the back room also fell. In the past we have complained that our room was not big enough for meeting. When Brother Chen Ke-san was here for a conference, I asked the owner to allow us to tear down the partition so that we could add more chairs. The owner was a devout Buddhist, and he thought that it could not be removed because it had Buddhist images. I could not do anything then. Thank the Lord, He bombed the images away. The next day the owner removed everything, including the idols and ancestral plaques. The front and back rooms spontaneously became one room, and the place was one-third larger. We really thank and praise the Lord! The Lord even moved the owner's heart to do some remodeling for us. We are safely living here. We can only say to the Lord, "We praise for the past, and we trust for the future!"</p><p>Sister Liao Ong Yu-bing, July 29</p><h2 class="head2">Han-Jiang, Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear ones:</p><p>Some of the believers have moved into the country because of the war. For this reason we would like to inform you of a change in our meetings so that you can pray for us. (1) There are eight to nine saints who have moved to Ma-Yang-Chun in Kwang-Yeh-Li (which is in the mountains, about fifty Chinese miles from Han-Jiang). They would like to have a meeting, but because of the lack of responsible brothers, they are not able to do so. Please pray for them. (Sister Chiung-ying has moved there.) (2) There were originally twenty to thirty brothers and sisters in Shang-Lin-Chun (eight to nine miles from Han-Jiang). They have started a meeting, and the nearby saints gather around there as well. Brother Tsai-seng may move his family there. (3) There were originally five brothers in Tung-Yuen-Chun in Jiang-Kou-Jen (thirty miles from Han-Jiang). I have moved my family there. Should it become necessary, we will move further into the mountains. We hope to start a meeting so that the neighboring brothers and sisters can have a place to meet. Please pray for this. (4) There are about six to seven sisters in Duo-Tou-Chun (eight miles from Han-Jiang by the sea). They do not have a suitable place to move, but they want very much to have a meeting. Because there is no brother there, they only have a prayer meeting. Please pray much for their future. (5) There are still over ten brothers and sisters left in Han-Jiang. They break bread on the Lord's Day afternoon in the believers' homes, and they have a prayer meeting on Saturday afternoon. The original meeting hall will be returned to the owner next month. In the future, please mail any letters to [omitted]. All the Lord's people in Pu-Tien and Han-Jiang have been preserved. Please pray much for us.</p><p>Brother Fang Shi-rong<br />July 17</p><h2 class="head2">Changchow, Fukien Province</h2><p>Enclosed please find a little sum of offering from the church in Changchow for the expense of the publication of The Christian. Last May most of the brothers and sisters moved to inland areas. In September a few saints returned to Changchow and resumed meeting. Thank the Lord that we have been preserved in everything. Presently, we have gospel meetings or mutual edification meetings every Lord's Day afternoon. We break bread in the evening, and we have the prayer meeting on Thursday.</p><p>The present responsible brothers in the Lord,<br />Wu Feng-yuan and Dai Jen-tsia, June 13</p><h2 class="head2">Thailand</h2><p>Thank and praise the Lord for bringing two useless ones like us to Pu-Ji. When we first arrived, we did not meet any brothers or sisters in the Lord, and we had no place to meet. All the neighbors are idol worshippers, and the environment is dark. We felt very lonely and did not know how to tell these superstitious ones about their false gods or about the Lord Jesus' gospel of salvation. We could only pray daily for the souls of the men of Pu-Ji and ask the Lord to grant them His grace. Although we had written to Brother James Chen and invited him to come, he did not come. We can only ask the Lord to do His own work in Pu-Ji. Thank the Lord that He has heard our prayer and has done a particular work among a group of young women. Two formerly devout Buddhist worshippers have believed in the Lord. One went home and immediately removed all her Buddhist idols after hearing about the Lord's love and about the fact that God is the true God. We marvel at the Lord's grace! There are now six sisters who have confessed Jesus as their Savior. Thank and praise the Lord. Glory to Him. Presently, we teach them to read the Bible and sing some hymns every Lord's Day afternoon at one o'clock, hoping that this will help them know more about the Lord. Although they are all Chinese, they speak Thai at home. We hope to help them read and speak a little Chinese from now on. May the Lord continue with His work.</p><p>Weak sisters in the Lord,<br />Chai Lan-jen and Huang Hwei-min, June 11</p><h2 class="head2">Manila, Philippines</h2><p>Thank the Lord that we are forever joined together in Him, even though we are an ocean apart. We often remember the brothers and sisters and especially the co-workers in China. We believe that the Lord will surely protect all of you and grant you His peace. Although we have been preserved in safety in a foreign land, our heart has not ceased to remember the saints in China who are in tribulation. Enclosed please find X dollars, which is an expression of concern in the Body of Christ by the saints meeting in the Lord's name in Manila. Please wait on the Lord's leading with two or three brothers and distribute it to the workers in China, to the saints in need, and to the publication of The Open Door and The Christian. Brother Philip Luan and Sister Peace Wang passed by here on their way to Singapore a little while ago. The brothers and sisters received much help from them on the Lord's Day. I hope that they can stay a longer time on their way home so that the believers can receive more help.</p><p>The church in Manila,<br />Hwang Ho-seng, Chai Wen-bin, and Lin En-hung, June 29</p><h2 class="head2">Makassak</h2><p>Enclosed please find X dollars. Please give it to the responsible brothers for distribution, according to the leading of the Lord's Spirit, to the saints in tribulation or in poverty or for other uses.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Yao Ke-ju, August 16</p><h2 class="head1">ADDITIONAL NEWS</h2><p>(1) A letter from Ch'eng-tu on August 25 said: "Brother Stephen Kaung went with Brother Chao Rue-tze to Guan County on August 23. Brother Kaung will work there for a week and then return to Ch'eng-tu."</p><p>(2) Brother Hsu Jung-jieh wrote on August 15 that he and Brothers Hu Yi-min and David Hsu had set off from Wei-Si on June 28 for work around the Nu River. They returned on August 9 to Wei-Si via Shang-Pa County and intend to go to Nu River again during the eighth month.</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>Issue No. 18 of this magazine was published in June. We have delayed the publishing of this issue for two reasons. First, mail delivery has been very difficult in many places during the past two months. Since this magazine cannot be considered government-registered printed matter, it is better to wait before mailing it out than to have it stuck in the post office. Second, the chief editor, Watchman Nee, returned from abroad at the beginning of July, and I have respectfully handed the responsibility of editorship back to him. After Mr. Nee arrived in Shanghai, he had a special conference for eleven days. In addition, many affairs of the church were waiting for his decisions, and there was the need for the work to go on in a positive way. As a result, he was not able to do any editing work on the magazine. Because two months had already elapsed since the publication of the last issue, we were afraid that many would become concerned. As a result, I reluctantly agreed to prepare another issue of this magazine. We cannot say anything about the future until Mr. Nee has settled other aspects of the work.</p><p>During this period of my substitute-editorship, I have only been able to gather and collect news from various sources. It remains Mr. Nee's job to fulfill the original intention of this magazine, which is to edify the workers, improve the work, give guidance to the churches, and answer questions. We take this opportunity to make this clarification and ask that all the brothers and sisters pray for this.</p><p>We have not been granted a license to publish this magazine as official printed matter yet. Since there are many problems in mail delivery, we cannot put too many pages into the magazine. Therefore, we have again postponed publishing "The Dynamics of Service."</p><p>We did not inform too many people about the special conference in Shanghai this time. Many of the co-workers in nearby places were not able to attend because of the inaccessibility of transportation. Brothers Witness Lee, Chao Chi-gwang, and Chang Tze-jieh returned to Tsingtao and Chefoo after the conference. Brothers Hwa Shi-bin, James Chen, Chang Yu-zhi, and Liu Bei-min are still in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother Chu En-seng was the first one to testify for the Lord in Chi-Shien-Chiao, Pu-Dong. During the past two or three years, he has been conducting a small business on the one hand and preaching the gospel in the villages on the other hand. When he came to Shanghai for the conference, he mentioned that he intended to sell his shop so that he could serve the Lord full-time. Unfortunately, he died of sickness three days after he returned home from the conference (August 13)! The co-workers were both shocked and saddened! By the Lord's grace the local church in Shanghai has remembered the needs of his family. May the Father comfort and protect the widow and orphans of this family!</p><p>We have passed on the money designated for the family of Brother Zhang Gun-jih to the designees. It is better to forward money to the provinces in the southwest directly rather than transferring it through Shanghai.</p><p>Ruth Lee, Shanghai<br />August 29, 1939</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENT 1</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENT 2</h2><p>[Omitted]</p></body></html>
