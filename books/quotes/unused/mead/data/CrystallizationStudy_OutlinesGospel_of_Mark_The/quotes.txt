[1]  Mark 1:15, 35; 4:23-25; 8:22-26; 6:45-52; 9:7-9; 10:45; 16:7 The desire of God s heart is that the reality in Jesus, the God-man living of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels, would be duplicated in the many members of Christ s Body by the Spirit of reality to become the reality of the Body of Christ, the highest peak in God s economy Eph 4:20-24, 3-4: The reality of the Body of Christ is the corporate living of the perfected God-men, who live the divine life of their new man by denying the natural life of their old man according to the model of Christ as the first God-man Mark 8:34; Rom 6:4-6; Gal 2:20; Eph 3:16-17a; 1 Pet 2:21.
[2]  The Lord then brings His followers as a collective person into His all-inclusive death Mark 15:16-41 and His all-surpassing resurrection 16:1-18 so that they may enjoy Him in His all-transcending ascension v. 19 as their life and life supply John 6:35, 57 , the Lord of all Acts 10:36 , God s Christ 2:36 , the Head over all things to the church Eph 1:22-23a , the Head of the Body Col 1:18 , the glorified One Luke 24:26 , the enthroned One Acts 5:31 , the One who is above all Eph 1:20-21 , and the One who fills all in all v. 23b to bring forth the new man as the reality of the kingdom of God Col 3:10-11; Rom 14:17 , consummating in the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2 . Finally, the Lord as the resurrected and ascended Slave-Savior preaches the gospel through His disciples as His reproduction for His universal spreading, until He comes again to set up the kingdom of God on earth Mark 16:20; Luke 19:12; Dan 7:13-14; Matt 24:14.
[3]  Message Three The Contents of the Slave-Savior s Gospel Service Scripture Reading: Mark 1:14-45 Christ as the Slave-Savior did not come to be served, but to serve; He served us in the past, He still serves us in the present, and He is going to serve us in the future Mark 10:45; Luke 22:26-27; 12:37: The story of the gospel and the meaning of salvation are that Christ loves and serves us first, and then we love and serve Him; whenever we have a need, we can come to the Lord and let Him serve us so that He can serve others through us Matt 26:13; 1 John 4:19; John 13:12-17; Rom 1:1; Gal 6:17; 1 John 3:16.
[4]  Message Four The Ways of the Slave-Savior s Gospel Service Scripture Reading: Mark 2:1 3:6 The five incidents recorded in Mark 2:1 3:6 reveal the five merciful and living ways taken by the Slave-Savior to carry out His gospel service: As God with divine authority, He forgave the sins of the victim of sickness that He might release him from Satan s oppression Acts 10:38 and restore him to God; the scribes considered this to be against the theology of their religion Mark 2:1-12: The Lord Jesus was both the God-Savior and the Slave-Savior, possessing deity and humanity; He had not only the ability to save sinners but also the authority to forgive their sins Luke 5:21, 24.
[5]  Receiving the forgiveness of our sins causes us to fear God Psa 130:4 and to love God Luke 7:36-50 ; in the Lord s salvation He not only forgives our sins but also causes us to rise and walk, to go in peace v. 50 , and to go, and from now on sin no more John 8:11 . As a Physician to the sick and miserable people, He feasted with the tax collectors, who were disloyal and unfaithful to their race, and with sinners, who were despised and isolated from society, that they might taste the mercy of God and be recovered to the enjoyment of God; this was condemned by the self-righteous yet merciless scribes of the Pharisees Mark 2:13-17: The self-righteous Pharisees considered themselves strong; hence, blinded by their self-righteousness, they did not know that they were ill and needed Christ as a Physician Matt 9:12-13.
[6]  As a Bridegroom with the sons of the bridechamber, He caused His followers to be merry and happy without fasting; thus, He annulled the practice of the disciples of John the new religionists and the Pharisees the old religionists so that His followers could be delivered from the practices of their religion into the enjoyment of God s Christ as their Bridegroom, with His righteousness as their outer clothing and His life as their inner wine in God s New Testament economy Mark 2:18-22: The real meaning of fasting is to stop eating all things other than the Lord Jesus and to not have a taste for anything other than Him Matt 6:16-18; Isa 58:3; John 6:57; cf.
[7]  1 Scripture Reading: Mark 1:1-11, 35; 10:45 In the Gospel of Mark we see a person, the God-man, who lived a life that was fully according to and for God s New Testament economy; the Lord s life was His work, and His work was His move; His work was His living and His move was His being Mark 1:35; 10:45; cf.
[8]  Message Six A Life Fully according to and for
[9]  2 Scripture Reading: Mark 4:1-20, 26-29; 12:30 God s New Testament economy is to sow the living person of Christ into our being so that we may live a life that is fully according to and for God s New Testament economy Mark 4:1-20, 26-29: Christ as the Sower is the Messenger of God, Christ as the seed is the message of God as the gospel of God, and Christ sown into our being to grow and develop in us is the building of God and the kingdom of God as the goal of God Luke 17:20-24; Mal 1:1; 3:1-3; Heb 1:2; 1 Cor 3:6-9; 2 Sam 7:12-14a.
[10]  Message Nine The Highlight of the Gospel of Mark Scripture Reading: Mark 8:27 9:13;
[11]  13:8; 14:3-9 The highlight of the Gospel of Mark is the vision of Christ s person with His all-inclusive death and His wonderful resurrection to be our entire, all-inclusive replacement for the producing, the bringing forth, of the one new man in the manifestation of the kingdom 8:27 9:13: After the Lord s followers passed though the steps recorded in Mark 1:1 8:26 experiencing the healing of their hearing, speaking, and seeing organs , they were qualified and able to see a wonderful person, who is the secret of the universe, a mystery to all mankind, and the secret of God s eternal economy 7:31-37; 8:14-26; Acts 17:23; cf.
[12]  After Peter made the declaration that Jesus is the Christ, the Lord began to unveil the mysteries of God s economy concerning Christ as the Son of Man with His death and resurrection; the Lord then brought His disciples to the mount of His transfiguration in order to show them that God s desire in His economy is for everything and everyone to be replaced by Christ, the all-inclusive One Mark 8:27-37; 9:7-8.
[13]  Christ as the life-giving Spirit, with His death and resurrection, replaces everything and everyone; He replaces Moses, He replaces Elijah, and He replaces us; this One replaces everyone, everything, and every matter in the universe 1 Cor 15:45b; Eph 1:23; 1 Cor 15:28; Col 3:10-11: For Peter to make his absurd proposal to keep Moses representing the law and Elijah representing the prophets on the same level with Christ was for him to make the law and the prophets equal with Christ to replace Christ Mark 9:4-6: In God s New Testament economy Jesus is today s Moses, imparting Himself as the law of the Spirit of life into His believers, and He is also today s Elijah, speaking Himself as the Word of life into His believers Heb 8:10; Rom 8:2; Acts 3:22; Phil 2:16; 1 John 1:1; John 6:63; Acts 5:20.
[14]  Praying with God as Our Faith Scripture Reading: Mark 8:31-38; 9:28-29; 11:20-24 In order to follow the Lord Jesus, we need to deny the self, take up our cross, and lose our soul-life Mark 8:34-35: When we set our mind not on the things of God but on the things of men, we become Satan, a stumbling block to the Lord Matt 16:23 in the fulfillment of God s purpose Mark 8:33 ; setting the mind on the things of men is a matter of the evil reasonings mentioned in 7:21.
