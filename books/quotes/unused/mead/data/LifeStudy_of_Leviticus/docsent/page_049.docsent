   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The fine flour in a pan signifies Christ's humanity in another kind of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the other items in this offering are the same in significance as those in the offering of fine flour on the griddle.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The green ears are produced of the harvest of the labor on the field.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This signifies that our labor on Christ produces the harvest with green ears.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Leviticus 2:14 speaks of "crushed grain from fresh ears."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word crushed signifies being dealt with by the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The green ears had to be crushed; that is, they had to pass through the crossing out of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that if we would live a life by Christ as the meal offering, we cannot avoid the cross.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"And the priest shall offer up in smoke as its memorial portion some of its crushed grain and its oil, with all its frankincense, as an offering by fire to Jehovah" v. 16 . The burning on the altar of some ears, some oil, and all the frankincense signifies that Christ's humanity in its freshness, with the Holy Spirit and the fragrance of Christ's resurrection, is offered to God as food for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Again we see that a portion of the meal offering the best portion is for God's food.</S>
