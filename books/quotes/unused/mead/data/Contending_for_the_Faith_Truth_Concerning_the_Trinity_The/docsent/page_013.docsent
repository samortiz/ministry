   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HERESY OF TRITHEISM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The tritheists, on the contrary, hold the side of the three, but neglect the side of the one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They say, "If the Father, Son, and Spirit are not three Gods, then how can They be three Persons?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, to use the designation "three Persons" to explain the Father, Son, and Spirit is also not quite satisfactory because "three Persons" really means three persons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, Griffith Thomas famous for his exposition on the book of Romans in his book The Principles of Theology wrote in this wise concerning the Trinity of the Godhead: "The term Person' is also sometimes objected to.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Like all human language, it is liable to be accused of inadequacy and even positive error.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It certainly must not be pressed too far, or it will lead to Tritheism."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By denying the fact that the Son is the Father and that the Lord is the Spirit, our critics spontaneously fall into the danger of being tritheistic.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although they would deny that they are tritheistic, unconsciously and subconsciously they hold the concept of three Persons of the Godhead as three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While most dare not admit this, some do admit it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1965, a brother who had accused me of being heretical in teaching that the Son is the Father and the Lord is the Spirit, came to visit me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He told me definitely that he believed in three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I told him that we should never say this, he attempted to argue with me, using Psalm 82:6, which says, "Ye are gods."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I pointed out that the word "gods" in that verse refers to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the entire Bible, there is no verse saying that we have more than one God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, everywhere we are told that our God is the only one God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To press the "three Persons" in the Godhead too far will surely "lead to Tritheism."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whoever does this spontaneously falls into the heretical extreme of tritheism.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Tritheism does not have the safeguard of the aspect of the one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the Bible says again and again that there is just one God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because the tritheists hold the side of the three and neglect the side of the one, they also have no balance or safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Both modalism and tritheism go to an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But we are in the middle and are balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we believe that the Son is the Father and that the Lord is the Spirit, we are simply quoting the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But, as we have pointed out, we also believe verses such as Matthew 3:16-17, 2 Corinthians 13:14, Revelation 1:4-5, and Ephesians 3:14-17.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We believe both sides of the truth regarding the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We condemn both modalism and tritheism as heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We believe that God is uniquely one for eternity, yet He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some may ask, "How can the Father, the Son, and the Spirit be three and at the same time still be one?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My answer is, "I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I cannot tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you try to understand this, you will be, in Martin Luther's terms, the teacher of God.'"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Trinity far transcends our mental apprehension, and only fools would try to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE TRIUNE GOD IN OUR EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, there is no doctrine of the Trinity in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Bible, the revelation of the Triune God is related to His relationship with man and to man's experience of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first verse indicating the Triune God is Genesis 1:26, which says, "Let us make man in our image."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not a doctrine; it is a revelation of God's relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first time the three of the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, are revealed is in Matthew 28:19.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This verse says, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This also is not a doctrine, but an experience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many terms have been invented or adopted by theologians related to the Trinity: person, substance, hypostasis, subsistence, etc. It is better to avoid these terms as much as possible and to simply quote the Bible, for anything we say may be wrongly understood or interpreted.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, for the sake of the experience of the Triune God, we cannot keep from telling people that eventually the Triune God today is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Examine your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although many of the critics are fearful of experience, our burden is that people would experience the Triune God as the all-inclusive, wonderful Spirit who is God Himself the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Trinity is not for doctrinal apprehension; it is absolutely for our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before I came to this country, I did not give a clear word saying that the Triune God is for the dispensing of Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One day, while I was ministering the Triune God to people, I suddenly received the impression that the Triune God is for His dispensation, for the divine dispensing of Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God's intention is to work Himself into human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For this purpose, God created man with a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God created man with a mouth and a stomach that he may take in, retain, digest, and assimilate food.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Likewise, God created us with a spirit that we may touch Him, contact Him, take Him in, and retain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God is Spirit, and they who worship Him must worship Him in spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Throughout the years, I have been more and more confirmed that the Triune God is for the dispensing of Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is not a matter of doctrine, but of experience.</S>
