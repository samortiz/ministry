Chapters one through three of Book 9 were given in Irving, Texas on July 5, 1986, December 23, 1986, and December 22, 1987 respectively
Later, we found that the practice of the Brethren was neither absolutely scriptural nor adequate to meet our need
In the early days of the Lord's recovery in mainland China, many churches began with not more than five saints
He indicated strongly that we should stop the Lord's Day morning meetings and spend that time to preach the gospel
He pointed out to us that the most clear word in the New Testament concerning the way the believers should meet is in 1 Corinthians 14
He said that the Lord's Day message meeting with one speaking and the rest listening was according to the 'customs of the nations'
If we take this way, we are like the children of Israel who followed the customs of the nations, and this is serious in the Lord's eyes
Brother Nee also said that it would be hard for us to change since we were accustomed to this traditional way of meeting
If we still meet according to the traditional way of Christianity, how can we say we have given up Christianity?
We have said that we hate, despise, and condemn the clergy-laity system, but what has been the real situation among us in the past years?
Spontaneously, hierarchy has also begun to exist among us, and the clergy-laity system has been increasing unintentionally among us
The new start had to be revolutionary in the sense of overthrowing the unscriptural and traditional way of meeting
We must overthrow the way of meeting with a big congregation, and with one person speaking and the rest listening
We need to have meetings in the new believers' homes, in the homes of the ones we gain through our preaching of the gospel
If we mean business with the Lord in sincerity to take the new way, this will overthrow the clergy-laity system
As long as we prefer to have big meetings with one speaking and the rest listening, we are a continuation of Christianity in some sense
We cannot deny that many people have been brought to the Lord through the old way of meeting with big congregations
There is another fact which no one can deny either, that is, that the old practice kills the functions of the members of Christ
Would we still take a way that causes us to suffer so much loss, the loss of the functioning of the members of the Body of Christ?
Brother Nee's eyes were opened long ago to see the truth concerning the church meetings in mutuality with all the saints functioning
Today we need to have a change to the God-ordained way of meeting and serving for the building up of the Body of Christ
The number one thing in my heart since 1984 has been to overthrow the system of one man speaking and the rest listening
Many of us can testify that at the beginning of our church life experience, when we were meeting in the homes, we increased rather quickly
The way of having big congregations is somewhat easy, but to have home meetings in every believer's home is a difficult job
If we would set our will to visit people with much prayer, the Lord will honor our will because this is His will
The elders and co-workers also need to learn how to use the positive ones among us who are desirous to serve and burdened to function
We have to anticipate that as we cooperate with the Lord to carry out His ordained way, we will gain a substantial increase
When our number is low we do not need a hall but when we gain a certain amount of increase it is good for all the saints to gather together
Regardless of how large a local church becomes, there is still the need for the whole church to come together periodically
For all the saints to meet in their homes and for them to get into Truth Lessons week after week in the group meeings will be very fruitful
When the saints are meeting in their homes every week according to the God-ordained way, each home can bring in at least one new one a year
The Lord has given us all the truths and has brought His recovery to the United States to be a center of His recovery
The saints need to be helped by us to give for the sake of supporting full-timers for the Lord's move on this earth
We want them to dive into the Recovery Version of the New Testament with the notes on the text and into the Life-study messages
The way we dress, cut our hair, and comb our hair will give us a proper appearance which can help gain people's regard and respect
They need to learn how to present the truths as they have been expounded among us in the Recovery Version and in the Life-study messages
We need to be desperate to take the Lord's ordained way for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ
In our preaching of the gospel, we should abandon the system of having large gospel meetings with one speaking and the rest listening
We have the burden in the full-time training to train the young people not only to preach the gospel but also to teach the truth
If we train the full-timers in the God-ordained way, and they return to churches who practice differently, this could cause problems
In the Lord's recovery, there should only be one work in one move with one ministry for the building up of the one Body
All of the elders and co-workers need to work hard with much prayer to make the Lord's move today clear to all the saints
If the saints do not receive the adequate education to make them knowledgeable of the Lord's present move, we may suffer some loss
Acts 5:42 tells us that the early apostles went from house to house to do two things: to preach and to teach Christ as the gospel
Their gospel was a living person, the very Christ, whom the Jewish religion at that time opposed to the uttermost
By these three verses, we can see the real situation and the real condition of the believers' meetings in the early days of the church
Such meetings of mutuality cannot be seen in today's Christianity, and it is hard to see them prevailing among us
We also have deviated to a certain extent because we have not fully practiced what is recorded in the holy Word
The present practice of Christianity leads to hierarchy, organization, and clergy, producing many so-called laymen
If the present practice of Christianity is torn down, hierarchy falls apart, organization is gone, and the practice of clergy is buried
The Bible shows us that the home meetings are not for doctrines or organization, but for preaching Christ and teaching Christ
They can build or rent a place to meet, collect some people together, raise funds, and hire someone to speak to them
We must labor to learn the God-ordained, scriptural way to practice the church life because it is really new to us
Following the preaching of the gospel to lead them to believe and be baptized, we must teach them the truth and help them to grow in life
In other words, we need to go to those close to us, that is, our relatives, neighbors, friends, colleagues, and classmates
We must take the God-ordained, organic, scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ
Within a short time after coming back from the full-time training in Taiwan, however, he baptized seventeen people
Another brother who went to Taiwan knocked on a particular door, and the gentleman said that he was not interested
These experiences show that we need to forget about the traditional way of Christianity and come back to the scriptural way
The number one thing in preaching the gospel is that we need to be desperate to gain new ones for the Lord's increase
When we are sharing the gospel with people, we should not ask them if they would like to receive the Lord and be baptized
A recent article said that since the mid sixties, the mainline denominations have collectively lost more than 4,778,000 members
These statistics show us that the traditional, unscriptural way of preaching the gospel does not work well over the long run
Many people have been saved through big gospel campaigns throughout the years, but where are these ones today?
Regularly, the church life will be going on in all the homes, and the entire church can also come together with everyone functioning
Every home can be a station of the gospel, a station of the truth, a station of life, and a station of the church life
To know this way outwardly is not that difficult, but to apply the biblical way to meet and to serve is not so simple
The Lord said that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth; then He charged the disciples to go and disciple the nations
Many years ago there was a Norwegian missionary in China who was very powerful and prevailing in preaching regeneration
After her message she greeted this pastor at the entrance and asked him whether or not he had been regenerated
The Holy Spirit worked upon him; he repented with tears and even rolled on the floor as he made his confession to the Lord
His experience and the experience of many others, in accordance with the truth of the Scriptures, show that regeneration is instantaneous
Regeneration and being filled with the Spirit essentially and economically are very normal, but they are also miraculous to the uttermost
In the old way of having group meetings, the attendants merely took turns reading through something from the Word and the ministry
Eventually, the new ones need to be led into prophesying in the church meetings for the building up of the Body of Christ
He pointed out, though, that it is difficult to get something to replace the Lord's Day morning message meeting
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
God promised Adam that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent and He waited four thousand years to fulfill this promise
About two thousand years after this promise to Adam God promised Abraham that through his seed all the nations of the earth would be blessed
Far, He has been waiting for almost two thousand years for the complete fulfillment of all of His words in the New Testament
According to my knowledge, the experience of 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 may be one of the final things that needs to be recovered
In 1952 he was put into prison by them, so there was no opportunity for him to see the Lord's recovery of 1 Corinthians 14:26
We must be one with the church where we are according to what the church there feels it must practice presently
We must go on gradually and positively with the Lord until we fully enter into the reality of His ordained way
Through His move in the book of Genesis, God gained some important persons and eventually He gained the house of Israel
In Exodus 19 at Mount Sinai the Lord told the children of Israel that He wanted them to be a 'kingdom of priests' and a 'holy nation'
They did not come out of Egypt one by one as individuals, but they came out as a corporate people, even as a nation and a kingdom
Among the children of Israel, these agents were the priests and the elders working together for God's theocracy
The law, like the United States Constitution, may be considered as the first written constitution of God's people written by God Himself
The very crucial part in God's government was God's instant speaking through the Urim and the Thummim on the breastplate of the high priest
Although the Scripture does not clearly indicate how the elders were produced, it does tell us how the priests were produced
On the breastplate with the additional piece called the Thummim, all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet could be found
According to this article, the Urim, which means light, was an illuminator inserted into the breastplate underneath the twelve stones
When the priest went into God's presence with the breastplate, suddenly a stone inscribed with a certain name became dark
The writer of this article said that it was through the Urim and the Thummim that the sin of Achan was discovered in Joshua 7
The breastplate of the high priest is called the breastplate of judgment in Exodus because it speaks for God instantly
After the high priest received the instant speaking from God, he did not directly execute or carry out what God spoke
He passed on the word he had received to the elders, and the elders became the direct administrators among God's people
When the priests became weak, such as at the time of Eli , the prophets were raised up to strengthen God's speaking
The instant speaking was either through the priests or the prophets, but neither the priests nor the prophets were the direct administrators
There is also not a direct word in the New Testament to tell us how the first group of elders in the New Testament church was produced
Either through seeing the Lord's death or through the appearing of the Lord to him in His resurrection , James believed in the Lord
When the Apostle Paul was raised up by the Lord and sent out by the Holy Spirit, the Lord used him to establish new churches
Acts 14:23 tells us that Paul returned to appoint elders in each of these new local churches probably within the same year
The elders were established among the saints by the apostles who had preached the gospel to them and had formed them into a local church
Titus 15 tells us that the apostles who established the churches had the position and the right to send a representative to establish elders
These apostles should be the ones who appoint the elders to carry out God's administration in each local church
At the very beginning of the Lord's recovery in mainland China, we adopted at least eighty percent of the Brethren's practice
By 1935 we realized that we could not fully follow them because we realized their serious mistake in the matter of the church practice
When Brother Nee began to see the light concerning the scriptural practice of the church life, he was still somewhat held by our humility
He said Today we are the unofficial apostles yet the unofficial apostles still have the unofficial right to appoint the unofficial elders
After a short time, another book was published in Chinese by Brother Nee entitled The Normal Christian Church Life
He said that if those of us who preach the gospel, teach the truth, and establish and form churches are not the apostles, then who are?
We have seen that in the Old Testament, the law could be considered as the written constitution of God's people
We know that Christ replaced the law, but we are referring to the aspect and sense of replacing the law in God's administration
The first group of apostles were charged by the Lord Jesus to teach the new believers what the Lord had taught them
The teaching of the apostles also includes what is recorded in the Acts, the Epistles, and the book of Revelation
At the conclusion of the book of Revelation, John tells us that no one should add anything or take away anything from the divine revelation
If you add something, you will suffer the plagues; and if you deduct something, you will suffer the loss of the divine blessing
The entire New Testament which is the complete teaching of the apostles must be considered as the constitution of Gods New Testament kingdom
Paul, in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, made this matter of God's administration in the New Testament very clear
By the New Testament teaching and example, we can realize that some elders had been established in the church in Corinth
If there is a problem in the church, we have to come to the New Testament to see what it says about this particular problem
We should not say we are for or against something until we go to the New Testament constitution to see what it has to say
When any problem arises, we must learn to be silent and go to the written Word of God, the New Testament constitution, without any opinion
We have to get into the presence of the Lord, stay in His presence, and wait on Him, asking Him to show us what to do
As an elder, you have the High Priest within you, and you can share in His loving capacity as symbolized by His breast
Besides the elders as the priests and as the administrators, there are the prophets and teachers as illustrated in Acts 13:1-4
After the apostles appoint the elders and commit the church into the hands of the elders, what shall the apostles do in the future?
We saw that Paul wrote a letter to the church in Corinth charging them to remove a certain sinful man from the fellowship of the church
In this sense Paul as an apostle kept his hands off of the church administration but not from teaching instructing and charging the church
There is another aspect to the apostles' relationship with a local church, which Brother Nee talked to us about, in 1 Timothy 5
Timothy 5:19-20 says, 'Against an elder do not receive an accusation, except on the word of two or three witnesses
Corinthians 11:34 says, 'If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment
Even after charging the church to take care of so many things, Paul says that he will set in order the remaining matters when he comes
All the states of the United States have their own administrations and governments, but they are not strictly independent
When the apostles kept their hands off of the affairs of the churches this did not mean that each local church became one independent entity
Concerning this matter, we need to look at the seven epistles to the seven local churches in Revelation 2 and 3
Every epistle was a particular word to a certain church, yet this particular word should be heard and taken by all the churches
On the other hand, all the local churches are still the one Body of Christ which is an organism, not a federation which is an organization
We have the leadership of one controlling revelation in the one ministry through those who bring in the revelation of the ministry
Paul was very burdened to help the Corinthians solve their problems, and their problems involved him and Apollos
Paul was not the leader in the New Testament move of God in the sense of commanding the co-workers to do things
In 1 Timothy 1:3-4, Paul urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently from God's New Testament economy
The aged Apostle John, in his second Epistle, told the saints not to receive anyone who brings a teaching other than the teaching of Christ
They went beyond the teaching concerning Christ, which is the basic teaching of the New Testament, the teaching of the apostles
He did a work in his own rented dwelling to proclaim the kingdom of God and to teach the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ
After such a training, they may decide to go back to continue their schooling, or they may go back to get a job
Of course, by having such a training, some will be tested out and approved to be life-long, full-time servants of the Lord
Sixty-six years have passed and we have not seen a model of a local church built up entirely according to what we have seen from the Lord
A driving teacher can impart the principles of driving to his students and even some details, but his teaching is not the application
Far, according to my observation, many of the leading ones are still building up the local churches in a 'probing way'
They heard something and they received some teaching, but in their practice they are not so clear what to do or how to do it
Maybe after a short time, some would find out that they were not suitable persons for the eldership and they would feel to resign
My negligence was in accepting these saints to be trained and not doing anything to prepare the training to fit in with their situation
We discovered that we could baptize many people, but then we realized that we did not have the manpower to take care of the new ones
We do not have any basic problems among us, so it should be easy for us to avoid speaking differently and speak the same thing
We should mean business with the Lord that the Lord's recovery will be prevailing and even flourishing on this earth for the Lord's purpose
We should try to avoid different kinds of terms, slogans, and sayings, and try our best to keep the oneness in the Lord's recovery
If a local church has a burden to visit people in their homes for the preaching of the gospel, they should carry out this commission
How can you have fellowship about these genuine concerns without being considered by others as negative and thereby causing another problem?
We come from different countries with different backgrounds, and we have different kinds of understanding and thinking
If you feel or observe something concerning the Lord's recovery related to a certain person, you should pray for him
We should be afraid that we would do something in a rush to damage someone's feeling and close the door for open fellowship
Before we go to see him, we should not say anything to anyone because this kind of 'pre-talk' opens the door for the devil to come in
We all have a heart for the Lord, and we all have the same goal to see that the Lord's recovery would be properly going on
Answer: Even with what we say to our wives, we must exercise our wisdom in order to have a marriage life with a peaceful and sweet feeling
If there are three elders in a certain locality, these brothers also need to exercise their wisdom in what they say to one another
If you, as one of the three elders, see some problems with the saints, do not talk to the other two brothers right away
They may not become negative themselves or cause some trouble, but the symptom in many cases is that they become discouraged
There are many cases where this causes them to question the leadership in their church or the ministry among us
That caused the church in Shanghai to close its doors and also caused Brother Nee to stop his ministry for six years
Why is it that after condemning him and saying negative things about him, your spiritual life has become so poor'?
Whether the thing you heard is true or not, as long as your hearing has a negative influence on your spiritual life, you should not take it
The spiritual things in the divine revelation are very mysterious, so God used physical things as symbols and figures to help us see them
If we want to know how to take care of the church as the organic Body of Christ, we have to consider how we take care of our physical body
Ephesians 5:29 says, 'For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church'
Once a brother becomes an elder, he is a slave to the saints in a church, and his wife becomes the wife of a slave
Some have said that after the apostles appoint the elders in a church, they should keep their hands off the church, leaving it to the elders
They have said that the apostles have no more right to touch or to interfere with the things concerning the church
In this book, he mentioned clearly that some brothers misunderstood his word in The Normal Christian Church Life
Administrations and helps are listed with apostles, with prophets, with teachers, and with works of power, healing, and tongues
According to our natural thought, the government of the church has nothing to do with the distribution of gifts by the Spirit
Romans 12 tells us that to lead, to administrate, to function as an elder in the church, is one of the gifts given according to grace
These three words eldership, administration, and lead are misunderstood by Christians as something organizational
John taught in his Gospel, in his Epistles, and in Revelation, and some others wrote some Epistles in the New Testament
All these parts of the apostles' teaching are the contents of the New Testament, which is concerning God's New Testament economy
They told the disciples Look for seven wellattested men from among you full of the Spirit and of wisdom whom we will appoint over this need
We need to see from the proper interpretation of the holy Word that there was no organization with the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus
Maybe the twelve became the spontaneous elders there because they initiated the church life, but there is no definite record of this
Acts 15 then tells us of the big problem concerning the heresy of those who said that circumcision was required in order for one to be saved
As we have seen, he had a concern for the church in Ephesus, and he called for the elders there to come to him
He wrote a number of letters to different churches to take care of them, even after the appointment of the elders
All of this proves that the governing leadership, after the time of the Lord Jesus, is not a person but the teaching of the New Testament
Soon after the time of the early apostles, however, the wrong teaching of Ignatius brought in the human thought of organization
The state churches and the private churches in Christianity have also adopted certain aspects of an organizational system of control
If the elders live in the spirit by life to nourish, cherish, and shepherd the church, they are not organizational but organic
Brother Nee appointed the elders in Shanghai and he still remained there to help the church and the other churches until he was imprisoned
There was no argument in the Lord's recovery organizationally because we practiced the church administration organically, altogether in life
The way the high priest received the word of God directly was by means of the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim
On the breastplate were twelve precious stones, and each stone bore a name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel
If the church has a problem and the elders need to see how the church should go on, they should go to God with much prayer
They received the instant word by the high priest going into the presence of God to read the names of God's people
We need both the constant word, the word in the Bible, and the instant word, the word from the present contact with God
The elders need to be living and exercised in contacting the Lord to be enlightened to read the situation among the Lord's people
In the twentieth century, God is doing the work of His recovery, and His recovery is to build up the Body of Christ
He expected that as he and his co-workers worked with them, they would grow, and through their growth, Paul could extend his work
In other words, the work establishes the churches, and the churches cooperate with the work for its furtherance
It is logical for a Christian worker to expect the result of his work to cooperate with the work for the promotion of God's move
Some opposing ones have said that we should not say that we need to be one with the ministry, that is, the work
In order to meet the Lord's present need, we must enter into two portions of His Word: 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4:11-16
To prophesy is to speak for the Lord, and in our speaking for the Lord, we have to speak forth the Lord and speak the Lord into others
The subject of 1 Corinthians 14 is prophesying, which is speaking Christ forth into others, dispensing Christ into others by our speaking
Our calling on Him is to receive Him, to breathe Him in, to enjoy Him, and to take Him as our portion for our daily practical needs
Every day and every minute, we need this Christ as our support, as our supply, so we have to call on Him all the time
Corinthians shows us that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus to enjoy Him, this enjoyment issues in the growth in life
Our eating of the nourishing food issues in the growth in life so that the problems within our physical body may be solved
A newborn babe has ears, eyes, hands, and legs, but without the adequate growth, these members will not be able to function adequately
Every member has its own function, but in the Body of Christ the top function is to speak for Christ, to prophesy
Our entire physical body with every member is functioning, and this functioning has one goal to build up our body
Paul, however, strongly belittles the gift of speaking in tongues and exalts the gift of prophecy to the uttermost
The factor of begetting has kept the human race going on from one man whose name was Adam to billions of people
Day after day week after week month after month and year after year the evil one Satan has been using tradition to slaughter and annul us
Concerning the preaching of the gospel, we are fully clear that we need to go to visit people by knocking on their doors
There are many ways to preach the gospel, but visiting people by knocking on their doors is the top way for preaching the gospel
They said that preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes is according to the New Testament plan and will never be improved on
Out of this one million they intend to baptize seventy thousand to make them members of the Southern Baptist denomination
Peter took advantage of the situation on the day of Pentecost to speak to thousands of people, and three thousand were added in one day
A spiritual giant may have big campaigns for the preaching of the gospel, but what is the real result for the building up of the church?
Tradition has killed us, cheated us, and deceived us, so we must come back to the ordained way of perfecting all the saints
Anyone can move his fingers on the keys of a piano, but to learn how to play the piano, a person must be perfected
Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4 are particular chapters in the New Testament regarding the building up of the Body of Christ
Brother Nee saw this matter over fifty years ago in 1937, but he told us he could not find a way to practice it
After four years of study beginning in 1984 in Taipei, the Lord has given us a clear view of 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4
The writer encourages the receivers of his Epistle to pursue, to desire, to seek, to excel, and to learn to prophesy
We need to pursue, desire, seek, and learn so that we may excel in prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ
The leading ones would charge them and urge them to speak, but they did not know how to speak or what to speak
From these notes we can have a topic to compose a short prophecy which is good for us to speak for three minutes
We have the Recovery Version which is a properly translated New Testament with notes that open up the text and many helpful cross-references
We are like carpenters who have the best tools to do the best carpentry to be 'an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth'
If we take the way of composing something to prophesy we will have something to present to the saints in the church meetings every Lords Day
Someone who realizes he should not speak first will wait for the appropriate time to speak his prepared prophecy
For Paul to teach the saints publicly means there was some public exhortation, probably in front of the saints as a congregation
An apostle should not only speak publicly but also go to the saints' homes day and night to perfect them, to teach them mouth to mouth
Where is the reality of such a verse on the earth today, and where can we see a meeting according to 1 Corinthians 14:26?
In the early church, there was such a reality for a short time, but it disappeared through the degradation of the church
It is much easier to remain in the old way because something has been set up, and every week they can do a routine work
They can routinely make the announcements about the scheduled times of the meetings, and appoint certain brothers to speak in the meetings
It may not be out of their heart to criticize or out of their intention to oppose, but their old habit is the problem
No one can deny that there are many ways to preach the gospel, but the top way is to visit people where they are by knocking on their doors
We should go to their homes and speak to them concerning God, Christ, the Bible, the gospel, salvation, grace, and redemption
They were touched that some would suffer to go out in such heavy rain to come to their home to preach the gospel
We need to have small group meetings to take care of the saints and to teach them the truth for their edification
According to the principle of the Bible, it is better that every week we have one day for the church to come together
If one third of the saints in a meeting of fifty to one hundred saints would prophesy, the time would be filled up with the riches of Christ
The growth in life first issues in the precious materials for God's building and then in the development of the gifts
The ultimate consummation of the enjoyment of Christ for the growth in life is the church built with the materials and by the skills
In the first verse of chapter fourteen, Paul says, 'Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy'
In chapter thirteen Paul made love higher than all the gifts, but in chapter fourteen he made prophesying more desirable
In verse 12 he says, 'Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church'
To speak in tongues is purely miraculous and does not require any learning, but to prophesy is a miraculous normality
The book of Ephesians presents the teaching given to the saints in Ephesus, while Acts 20 presents the practice of the writer
If Paul had not taught the Ephesians to prophesy, how could he have said that he declared all the counsel of God to them?
Surely Paul taught the Ephesians concerning the excelling gift of prophecy as a part of the entire counsel of God
When Paul was teaching the saints publicly and from house to house in Ephesus, he surely instructed them how to prophesy
While we are staying with the saints, we have to open up all the things concerning God's New Testament economy, His eternal plan
As an illustration of what it means to admonish, let us consider a father speaking to his son about his need to study diligently
In verse 19 Paul said that he served the Lord with tears, and in verse 31 he said that he admonished each saint with tears
We know that Paul had contact with them before he wrote 1 Corinthians because he referred to a previous letter that he wrote them
How could Paul have charged them to prophesy if he had not taught them something about it and if they had no knowledge of it?
In Acts 2 the three thousand new disciples met from house to house, but in 5:42 'they' refers to the apostles mentioned in verses 40 and 41
In the past, we may have baptized some new ones, but not many of them remained because we left them as orphans
We should thank the Lord for so many who are willing to go out, praying for them and looking to the Lord for His blessing upon the church
As long as such an activity is for the gospel of the Lord, we should thank the Lord that He has burdened so many
We must be careful to go on positively in a gradual way, and we must have a clear view with a definite purpose
We must have a vision that these two crucial portions of the Word 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Ephesians 4:11-16 need to be fully recovered
Our senior co-worker, Brother Nee, stressed this matter twice beginning over fifty years ago, and we must pick up this burden
We have to believe that this is the time and that we are the right people for the Lord to use to recover these two portions of the Word
According to Ephesians 416 the saints in the Body of Christ are categorized into two groups every joint of the rich supply and each one part
Ordinarily we need the elders and coworkers to go to visit the saints homes to teach them personally and directly mouth to mouth year round
It is not acceptable to prepare a message to speak once a week, and then take it easy the rest of the week to have leisure time
If a branch of the vine tree is really and richly enjoying the life juice from the tree, surely the branch will bear fruit
The saints and churches who have practiced visiting people in their homes with the gospel have testified of the fruitfulness of this way
In order to build His church, He first accomplished His full redemption from His incarnation through His ascension
If we say that the first century was the age of the apostles, this implies strongly that after the first century, there are no more apostles
However, we have to see and admit that there have been these four categories of gifted persons throughout the history of the church
When the Brethren were raised up by the Lord in the early part of the nineteenth century, many great teachers were produced
In the early days of the Lord's recovery in China, Brother Watchman Nee was greatly influenced by Brethren teachings
He realized that we could not follow the Brethren in an absolute way because of their serious mistake in the practice of the church life
Because he was influenced by Darby's teaching regarding the apostles, however, he said that we dare not say that we are the apostles today
Since the gospel was preached in many pagan regions, churches were established, and elders were appointed, how could there not be apostles?
From that time he began to say that we were the official apostles and that the elders established by us were official elders
It is hard to find someone among us in the Lord's recovery who has really been perfected in the preaching of the gospel
If a real evangelist were to stay with us for even a short period of time, we would be burning for the preaching of the gospel
When you knock on a person's door and they ask who it is, how you answer will many times determine whether or not they let you in
The burden of the gifted persons is to perfect the saints, and the perfected saints do the direct building work
After being perfected, the saints, according to Ephesians 4:15, will grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things
Suppose a brother comes to you, an elder, and says: 'First Corinthians 1:30 says that God has put us into Christ
If you give him a doctrinal answer concerning the twofoldness of the divine truth, you may lead him into the forest
If you were perfected, you might answer the brother like this: 'It is true that we are in Christ, brother, but what about our living?
We may have been generally edified in the past by listening to messages, but how much of the truth has been constituted into us?
In one of their big office buildings, there were many Americans in a big office space doing routine work eight hours a day
We would have practiced visiting people by knocking on their doors to find out about it and to break through in our increase
In order to go on, we all need to drop our old concepts and pick up the new view of the Lord's present recovery
We all have to admit that there are many ways to preach the gospel, but to visit people in their homes is the best way
The Lord told us in Luke 14:23, 'Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled'
Regardless of how little we think we know, we still must contact them as much as we can and minister to them as much as we know
Many of us may have to work for a living, but we still should have the evenings and weekends to give to the Lord
, but nearly every day the first thing he did when he came home from work was to go and visit people for the Lord
If we take this way, we will enjoy the Lord's presence, and we, our family, and our church will be greatly blessed
They need to realize that they have a regenerated spirit which they can exercise by calling on the name of the Lord and praying
Every time we go to visit them, we can check with them, 'Do you have something to say for the Lord or of the Lord'?
We can encourage them to first tell how they were saved and then encourage them to speak concerning how they experienced the Lord
We need to go on from the home meetings to bring them into contact with other saints in their neighborhood for a small group meeting
It is helpful to use either the Life Lessons or Truth Lessons because all the necessary verses and material are there
Perhaps the ones who go out to preach the gospel could transfer the care of their new ones to the ones who are burdened for home meetings
If we only beget them and do not visit them again and again to nourish them and cherish them, how can we expect to keep them?
As we practice the new way, we should not criticize other places that are not practicing the same way that we are
Every place will be practicing the new way to one degree or another depending on the situation in that locality
An elder should not have the attitude that the saints need to get permission from him to go out and knock on doors
The elders may have the heart to keep the church in a good order, but they should not restrict the saints in this way
If we are faithful to the Lord, the time will come when the Lord will gain twenty thousand out of a city of one hundred fifty thousand
Some may go out to knock on doors, some may go out to take care of home meetings, and others may be taking care of small group meetings
How could so many be under the mere control of the elders, that is, without the positive activities according to the Lord's leading?
The only way that things could be under the elders' mere control is for the church to remain with a small number
We needed to see how to serve God, how to meet together, how to function, how to carry out the work, and how to preach the gospel
They saw the truth concerning such things as baptism by immersion and the administration of the presbytery, the eldership, in the church
A big advance concerning the practice of the church life was with Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren in the eighteenth century
In the twentieth century, the Lord brought us in mainland China into His recovery through Brother Watchman Nee
He took the lead to read about the history of the church and to read the main writings of the seeking ones throughout the centuries
He saw the boundary of the local church and the local ground of the church to keep the unique oneness of the Body of Christ
According to this revelation, when the whole church comes together, each saint should have something to share, so 'each one has'
Such a traditional way of meeting has become the major meeting and the major structure of the practice of Christianity
Brother Nee saw that this meeting was not scriptural, and he said that it was according to the customs of the nations
The practice of preaching the gospel in the New Testament is a practice of visiting people, but our practice was different from this
When we began to practice visiting people with the gospel by knocking on their doors, the results confirmed the Lord's way
Ephesians 4 does not say that these gifted persons are for doing the particular work in their respective lines
There is the full possibility for the attendants of a church meeting to prophesy one by one because all of us have the divine life
Human beings can learn a language because in the nature of the human life there is the ability to learn a language
If we give up this obligation, our attitude is that we need a 'clergyman' to replace us so that he can speak to us all the time
The sinners saved through our gospel preaching are the main offerings we should offer to God in His New Testament economy
The gospel of God regenerates sinners, making them the members of Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ
As the New Testament priests we are handling the gospel of God to save sinners to raise them up and to perfect them until they can prophesy
Ephesians 4 refers to the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the New Testament ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ
Strictly speaking, there has been very little building up among us because we are short of the perfecting of the saints and the prophesying
The conclusion of the Old Testament priesthood and the beginning of the New Testament priesthood were in John the Baptist
Paul as a pattern of the New Testament priests of the gospel of God also offered the saved sinners to God as spiritual sacrifices
Sooner or later, some of the seeking saints will pick up some copies of these books and practice what has been released in them
As we care for them for six months to a year, they will be ready to present themselves as a living sacrifice to God as Romans 12:1 instructs
We hope that at least about one-third of the saints in the church would practice this kind of gospel visitation
The leading brothers should pray, 'Lord, raise up at least thirty-five of the saints to practice the priesthood of the gospel
The four major steps in the advance of the Lord's recovery today are workable, but they require our constant and regular labor
The governing principle of the Lord's ordained way is that it affords equal opportunity to all the members of the Body of Christ
The traditional way robs the saints of their opportunity to function and gives this opportunity to a small clerical class
According to the old, traditional way, the believers seemingly have little ability because they are not allowed to participate in anything
We have to help others to enter into what we have learned to bring them into functioning with equal opportunity
We may think that serving God, preaching the gospel, or functioning to give a testimony are things that we can do easily and naturally
She said, 'Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship'
The Lord Jesus adjusted her by saying that the worship the Father God seeks after is absolutely different from this
Today by His mercy and under His enlightenment, we can say that we are clear what it means to worship God in our spirit
In the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 5 through 7, the first blessing is the blessing of being poor in spirit
He told us that if we are going to be blessed with the kingdom of the heavens, we first have to empty ourselves in our spirit
We are empty, and the Spirit of truth can come in to unveil the things concerning this wonderful person, Christ, in an absolutely new way
Whenever we talk about the things concerning God, we have many opinions, concepts, and views which are mostly according to tradition
When we talk about how to meet, we may have the concept that we need to be reverent and exercise a certain amount of fear toward God
To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life
If we are going to carry out God's ordained way of preaching the gospel by visiting people, we have to learn to do it as priests
He is one who can teach people and tell people about God, about what God wants, and about what a man should be before God
As such priests, they should always live a life of being one with God to bring God to man and to bring man back to God
In the New Testament, God wants the New Testament priests to offer saved sinners to Him as parts of the corporate Christ
The Old Testament priests offered the types of Christ, but the New Testament priests offer the parts of Christ
Peter said here that we are living stones being built up into a spiritual house, and this built up spiritual house is the priesthood
Through God's virtues we were saved in a subjective way, being brought out of darkness into His marvelous light
We are priests handling God's gospel, which includes everything from the incarnation of the Triune God to the New Jerusalem
Most of us were just the helpers, the Levitical serving ones, who served one great priest, a gifted evangelist
We can use a few verses to impress these new ones that today Christ is the Spirit and that now they have Christ within them, in their spirit
Both Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3 say that since we are so full, we will sing and speak in psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs
With those who have recently been baptized, we should use the time to impress them that the Lord Jesus is in them
The husband would make the decision to smash this idol into pieces, and we would encourage him to do so right away
The fellowship brings in the interceding, the interceding brings in the mutual care, and the mutual care brings in the practical shepherding
Someone may ask what the cross is, and a young brother who was saved just three weeks ago can answer this question
Another brother may say, 'When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He was crucified not only for our sins but also for us'
If a new believer is brought into a group meeting, and he attends over forty-five group meetings a year, he will learn much truth
When Paul wrote this, he was talking to the Hebrew brothers and telling them not to forsake their own meeting, their Christian meeting
If someone were charged to be the leader of a group meeting, he would have to prepare a teaching to give, and he would be overburdened
All the riches of the attending members will come out in the group meetings, and these are the riches of the Body of Christ
If a certain brother were charged to take care of a group meeting, probably very few of the saints in the group would pray for that meeting
They would not bear the burden for the meeting because they know that a brother has been assigned to care for it
The Spirit knows what to cover, and He can be one with the attendants in the meeting to raise the appropriate questions
In the old way the riches within only one brother are dug out but in the Godordained way everyone has an opportunity to pour out his riches
He can tell this new brother to enlarge and uplift what he has been speaking in the group meeting for a prophecy in the Lord's Day meeting
His speaking will be prophesying with the riches of his experience of Christ or with the riches of his knowledge concerning Christ
They can take some time with the saints after the meeting on the Lord's Day to give them some helpful adjustments
One thing we need to remember for all of our meetings is that we need to be 'crazy' with and in the Spirit and the word
They may be concerned that nothing will come out if we begin to meet in mutuality and that this will result in a drop in attendance
The Bible has not been opened up among them, and they have very few books to help them get into the riches of the Bible
You can not only perfect them in the meetings but also perfect them outside the meetings by going to be with them
Paul said in Acts 20 that he taught the saints publicly and from house to house and that he admonished each one with tears
In this producing way, we all learn to do something and to share something, and we will fully use our capacity to function
