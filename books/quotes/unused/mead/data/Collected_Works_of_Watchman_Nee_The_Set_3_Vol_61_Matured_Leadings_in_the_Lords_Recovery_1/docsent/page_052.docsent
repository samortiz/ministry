   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WHOLE BODY COORDINATING TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today the Lord's way is for the whole church to coordinate together to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God does not want to take the way of individuals; He wants the corporate service of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was young I had many dreams and ambitions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I wanted to be a famous person of some sort.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After I was saved, I saw that Paul was ambitious to please the Lord 2 Cor 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I also wanted to please the Lord by becoming an evangelist or a revivalist.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, I saw that the Lord's desire in this end time is that we be coordinated together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His desire is for the whole church to rise up to preach the gospel together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the past perhaps we had the ambition to be an evangelist, but the Lord's intention is not for us to be zealous for the gospel by ourselves; His intention is for the whole church to rise up to preach the gospel together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today the Lord wants the church to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the church preaches the gospel, the gospel will spread throughout Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we offer up everything, it will not be hard to save everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we have to hand over our all and put everything under His direction through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever our position may be, our goal is for the "enterprise" to prosper, not for us to become rich individually.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the responsibility of everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The whole Body has to rise up to bear the testimony of the gospel, to do the work of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is most unfortunate today that some people want to be independent servants; they want to take the individual way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let me repeat that the service the Lord wants is church service.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The evangelism the Lord wants is church evangelism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the reason we have to work in coordination and in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hong Kong is a highly developed commercial city.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is hard to spread the gospel in such a place, but if we offer up ourselves to the Lord together, it will be easy to spread the gospel throughout this city.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I admit that Hong Kong is a loose place, a difficult place, but when the church rises up to preach the gospel, anyone can be saved easily.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Who can withstand the preaching of the whole church?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is hard for individuals to preach the gospel alone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is much easier for the whole church to rise up to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I hope that no one will misunderstand this, and I hope that no one will take his own way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We expect that everyone will hand himself over.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We hope that not only our money, our occupation, and our future but our very person will be consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our primary occupation is the gospel; everything else is secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For two thousand years, the Lord has never changed His standard concerning His followers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He has never broadened the way of the gospel; He has never allowed anyone to have his own freedom to come and go.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is fallen Christian preachers who have changed the standard of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord never said that a man can spend six days to love mammon and make money and then come to a worship service on Sunday.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today the church has to be recovered to its first state.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must not only offer up our money in a passive way; we must live for the gospel and the Lord in an active way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The requirement of the gospel is high.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord has given us everything, and today His demand is for our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has shed His blood and given His life for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we only take the passive way, it will be hard for us to follow His footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to break through in the positive direction.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have any reservation or passivity in us, we will not be able to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Brother Weigh: Lord, we confess that we have been loose in Your service for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have not been absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May Your great love grant us mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Lord, You have sacrificed Your life and blood to accomplish salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today we cannot be so light and easy with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May You gain our very person and possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not let any one of us go.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May none of us be a spectator, a bystander, or an observer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May all of us here bear the responsibility of not allowing ourselves to be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May we all follow Your footsteps in an aggressive way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Gain us completely and have a free way among us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Amen.</S>
