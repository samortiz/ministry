[3]  Likewise, man was created in the image of God with the purpose of containing God.
[4]  You are not merely created to contain food in your stomach, or to contain knowledge in your mind, but you are created to contain God in your spirit.
[5]  Since man was made in the image of God, he possesses a good nature that matches God s nature, with virtues such as truthfulness, goodness, loveliness, wisdom, kindness, and valor.
[6]  OF THE LIFE AND DEATH OF THE GOD-MAN 1.
[7]  God became flesh, born as a man called Jesus.
[8]  Since this Spirit is the life-giving Spirit, He dispenses God with His life into His believers.
[9]  Similarly, man cannot participate in God s kingdom and live a divine life by education, improvement, or regulation; he must receive the life of God!
[10]  ...if you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved.
