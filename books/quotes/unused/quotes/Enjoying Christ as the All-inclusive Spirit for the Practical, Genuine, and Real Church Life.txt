The following are messages given by Brother Witness Lee in San Francisco, California, from December 29, 1972 to January 1, 1973
The entire Bible is a revelation from God, breathed out by Him , and the order of the books of the Bible is also sovereignly arranged by God
We cannot put Genesis at the end of the Bible, put Revelation at the beginning, or rearrange the Gospels and Acts
In the New Testament we first have the four Gospels, presenting a full picture of a wonderful person, the Lord Jesus Christ
Following this is Acts, with the preaching, propagating, ministering, and imparting of this wonderful One into many persons
After Peter's first preaching, about three thousand people were saved, and later another five thousand believed
Butterflies, on the other hand, often behave individually and not in large groups, and their individual beauty stands out for a display
We forget about cultivating individualistic beauty in a peculiar way and simply gather together in a corporate way
Although many would say that Romans is a book on justification by faith, justification is only the beginning, not the goal
Chapter 12 begins, 'I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice
In actuality, it is not having the same feathers that brings birds together; it is having the same life within them
The divisions that the Corinthians suffered came from their differing kinds of knowledge and practice of the gifts
In 1 Corinthians we are told that Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit, and we have been given to drink of this one Spirit
The way to solve the problems in the church is not to gain more dead knowledge or to have more practice of the gifts
He says, 'I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more abundantly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers'
One day he went to the high priest to receive the authority to bind the members of the church, all those who call on the name of Jesus
Much of their knowledge, however, is of a religious and traditional nature, becoming veils to cover their sight
Satan uses sin and worldliness to keep people from God, but it is easy to understand that sin and the world are not good
The wonderful Jesus has been imparted into the believers for the purpose of the Body and the practical church life
A dictionary may tell us that religion is a good word, but Galatians 1 indicates that religion is versus Christ
Many in Christianity honor only its outward traditions and holidays without being truly for Christ in a pure way
In Gods eyes the old and traditional practices in Christianity without the presence and reality of Christ are a part of the present evil age
In this principle, traditional and religious Christianity today is the present evil age, just as Judaism was in the days of the apostles
Man discerns religion according to the view of tradition and morality, but God discerns it from the view of His eternal purpose
Even today, the Lord's recovery is confronting opposition from traditional Christianity as the present evil age
Religion is something for God and for the benefit of people, yet it is apart from Christ and without the Spirit of Christ
The Lord's recovery is to bring us back to the proper church life, and Christ as the Spirit is the only element that produces the church
Otherwise, whatever we do may be good, may be for God, and may be for people's benefit, but we will simply produce another kind of religion
Whatever we do must be realized and practiced in our spirit with the Spirit of Christ as the presence and reality of Christ
God's desire is not a matter of religion but of the living Christ, the life-giving Spirit, dwelling in our human spirit
Verse 15 of chapter 6 says, 'Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters'
As we experience the indwelling Christ's operating within us, we all love one another, and the result is that we have the church life
It pleased God to reveal His Son in us, all our veils are being removed, and we see only God's eternal purpose-Christ and the church
God's intention is to impart Christ, the wonderful One, into His many believers so that He may have the church as a Body for Christ
In the Old Testament, God commanded His people to practice circumcision, to keep the Sabbath, and to eat only clean things
Every seven days a Jew needed to keep the Sabbath and every day he had to follow the regulations concerning eating according to Leviticus 11
All these were required by the holy Word, and to keep these practices in the Old Testament age was absolutely right
Eventually, however, the Jews paid more attention to these matters than to God Himself, thus creating the outward religion of Judaism
The religious way of Judaism was a matter of the temple, the altar, the offerings, the priesthood, and regulations
He went into Egypt, and after coming out from Egypt, He went to Galilee of the Gentiles, to the small town of Nazareth where He was raised
The religious people continued to go to Jerusalem because that is where the temple, the altar, the offerings, and the priests were
The Jewish religion was built upon the three pillars of the Sabbath, regulations concerning eating, and circumcision
The Pharisees kept the Sabbath in a religious way, but Jesus abolished the outward observance of the Sabbath in a divine way
In the ancient times the Jews paid their full attention to the things of Judaism and not to God and His purpose
Now, in the same principle, many people pay attention to Christianity as a religion rather than to Christ and the church
At the beginning of the church life, for example, the apostles baptized people, but there was no ordinance of baptism
Even the knowledge and gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians have been utilized by the enemy to veil the New Testament believers
In Matthew 13:33 the Lord Jesus spoke of a woman who took leaven and hid it in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened
We realize that within the Catholic Church and the denominations there are many real Christians, servants of the Lord
Both the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches help people to know God and, to a certain extent, to be saved
It is to gain the reality of the Body of Christ here on the earth today, expressed in the localities in which we live
In today's Christianity we cannot find the genuine work that cares for the present, practical building up of the church
Galatians 1 tells us that religion with its traditions persecutes the church, ravages it, and tries to uproot it
Because of the religious nature in certain ones and their ordinances concerning dress, they were bothered by this new one
On another occasion, a number of saints who were burdened to leave their oldness behind had the feeling to be baptized a second time
To oppose the Lord's spontaneous moving is to keep the old religious ordinances, which bring in spiritual death and dormancy
Our living should be according to the holy Word, but we should not make any point in the Word an ordinance to keep
Although we may practice a certain matter, to make it an ordinance that causes others to be excluded is wrong and annuls the church life
If the Lord delays His return, those who are young people today will one day bear the responsibility of the Lord's recovery
We all, including the young brothers and sisters among us, must be clear that in the Lord's recovery we do not hold on to ordinances
Peter had seen the vision on the Mount of Transfiguration, and he was a witness of the Lord's resurrection and ascension
In Galatians 2 Peter realized that he was free to eat with the uncircumcised Gentiles, and he practiced to do so
At this point Paul opposed Peter to his face, rebuking him for not walking in a straightforward way in relation to the truth of the gospel
God's economy is to dispense Christ into us so that we may be His corporate vessel, the Body of Christ, as His expression
The law was simply a child conductor unto Christ to keep those whom God had predestinated for Christ and the church
Because we have the 'jumbo jet' of God's New Testament economy, we should no longer insist on keeping the 'mule cart' of the law
On the negative side, Galatians 1 exposes religion with its traditions, and chapter 2 speaks of the law with its ordinances
On the positive side, however, chapter 1 shows us Christ revealed in us, and chapter 2 unveils Christ living in us
Just as in chapter 1 Christ is in contrast with religion, in chapter 3 the Spirit is in contrast with the flesh
For redemption and as the One in the heavens, He is Christ, and for life imparting and as the One who indwells us, He is the Spirit
For this reason, God must come again and again in His mercy and grace to snatch us out of our self and bring us back into Christ
Every husband has sinned against his wife, and every wife against her husband, simply because we are too often in the flesh
There are always two realms before us-the realm of the flesh and the realm of the Spirit-which represent two possibilities for us
We may be in the realm of the Spirit one moment but immediately turn and be in the realm of the flesh the next moment
We need to forget about ourselves, because we cannot do anything or be anything for the Lord unless we stay in the Spirit
If we have a proper vision, we will see that we do not need to be careless or more careful, quick or slow, and we do not need mere teaching
We should not look only to the Christ who is in heaven, and we should not try to find Him in the considerations and analysis of our mind
The Triune God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, but this does not mean that we have three Gods; there is only one God
1 Corinthians 15:45b says, 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,' and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, 'The Lord is the Spirit'
The greatest blessing is not to receive a high degree, or to have a good husband or wife, good job, good car, and good house
The blessing of the gospel is not merely forgiveness of sins and regeneration, followed by peace, happiness, comfort, and the hope of heaven
On the negative side, Galatians 1:4 tells us that Christ gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age
On the positive side, 3:13 and 14 say that Christ redeemed us in order that we may receive the promised Spirit as the blessing of Abraham
If we do this, the Bible will become fresh, living, strengthening, and stirring to us; it will never be a book of dead letters
It will become food to nourish and satisfy us, and day by day we will grow in the divine life and be transformed
The issue and outcome of our experience of Christ as the Spirit is the building up of the church as the Body of Christ
You have been trying for twenty centuries to damage the building up of My church, but now My church is being built up
Today in Christianity people hold on to ordinances, particular doctrines, and certain gifts, which have resulted in division and confusion
He died on the cross to redeem us from our sins, and now He lives as the Savior to deliver us from every sinful thing
The Jews have Jehovah, and they have God, but we have Jehovah plus and God plus, that is, Jehovah the Savior and God with us
If Jesus had not been there, that manger would have meant nothing to the magi from the east or to the shepherds
We should not listen to the traditional teaching that the three persons of the Godhead revealed in Matthew 28:19 are three separate Gods
Some of the Brethren continued to teach that we should not pray to the Holy Spirit but only to the Father and sometimes to the Lord
One day Brother Nee invited a traveling preacher from the China Inland Mission churches to give a message in our meeting
At a certain point in his message, the preacher said, 'Please, do not think that Jesus is one and the Holy Spirit is another
Verse 16 continues, 'I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever'
Thou, Lord, the Father once wast called, But now the Holy Spirit art; The Spirit is Thine other form, Thyself to dwell within our heart
Later, after we came to Taiwan, we further saw the truth in 1 Corinthians 15:45b, which says, 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'
We should not remain in it but should return to the pure Word of God to see that our Jesus, whom God is working into us, is all-inclusive
When a mother is troubled by her children, or a wife by her husband, she simply needs to take Jesus as her all-inclusive drink
The proper church life comes not out of religion, ordinances, and the law but from the very Christ whom we experience
Once the law produces children, it becomes a concubine, and what she produces are not children of promise but children unto slavery
Paul tells us that the allegory of the two women portrays two covenants, the covenant of grace and the covenant of law
The first covenant, that of grace and portrayed by Sarah, was given to Abraham, to whom God preached the gospel
After more than four hundred years, the second covenant, that of the law and portrayed by Hagar, was given at Mount Sinai
After reading this, a husband may make up his mind to endeavor to love his wife, and to some extent he may be able to do it
The husband's love and his wife's submission are 'Ishmael,' not 'Isaac,' because they are produced according to the principle of law
Galatians is a book on Christ versus many negative matters, such as the law with all the ordinances, religion with traditions, and the flesh
Our entire being with all its inward parts-our spirit, mind, will, and emotion-becomes the dwelling place of Christ
If only the tips of the fingers are in the glove, we still can say that the 'hand' is in the glove, but this is not adequate
We need to leave the law behind, drop the ordinances, cast out religion, bury the traditions, and crucify the flesh
The nation of Israel is composed of only the relatively few who returned to the land of their forefathers, remained there, and built it up
To be sure, all the saved ones are genuine Christians, but many are still scattered in the denominations and divisions
If they would be rescued from the divisions, they will return to the practicality of the Body, where Christ Himself is our oneness
We ourselves may still be accustomed to certain kinds of ordinances, particularly in the practice of our meetings
The Lord is recovering the proper church life, which is a life with Christ, by Christ, in Christ, and for Christ
After Galatians 1 through 4, the emphasis of chapter 5 is no longer on the law, ordinances, religion, and traditions
It is difficult for translators of the Bible to decide whether Spirit refers to the Holy Spirit or to our human spirit
According to the context, the Spirit here is the Holy Spirit, who dwells in and mingles with our regenerated spirit
As we have seen, Christ is revealed in us, He lives in us, we have put Him on, and He is now being formed in us
We leave behind all the negative things-the law, ordinances, religion, traditions, and the flesh-and we remain in the mingled spirit
If we would do everything according to the Spirit in our spirit, we will be freed from problems and saved from turmoil
If we remain in our mind, worries come to us, and if we stay in our emotions, we become bothered and lose our temper
We care only for Christ as the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit, causing these two spirits to be one
Even when we come to the dining table, we may give a word of grace in a traditional way, praying in the same way time after time
Our human nature cares not for the Spirit in our spirit but for culture, the law, ordinances, religion, and traditions
From the day we were born, our spirit was dormant within us, but one day the Lord Jesus woke up our spirit by entering into it
We must see that the law ordinances religion traditions forms rituals regulations mere doctrinal teachings and the flesh all need to go
According to the present situation in Christianity, it is often difficult to recognize Christians by their life and walk
We do not oppose the exercise of the gifts, but we do not care for the traditional, religious, and even fleshly way of displaying them
The promise of the Spirit, which we have received, is the blessing of Abraham through the gospel that was preached to him by God
In order for us to be the sons of God, we need to have Christ formed in our inner being to make us the same as He is
Many in Christianity hold the teaching that every saved believer will enter into the coming millennium to be the kings in the kingdom
Even if many were to be given the kingship outwardly, they would not have the inner growth, measure, or stature of a king
Galatians 1 through 4 tells us that we need Christ revealed in us, Christ living in us, Christ put upon us, and Christ formed in us
Paul did not want to be troubled with the Judaistic religion, circumcision, the keeping of the Sabbath, or any such thing
In the ancient times, when a man was sold as a slave, the buyer marked him with a brand to indicate his ownership over him
Verse 1 says, 'Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness'
Following this, verses 7 and 8 say, 'Do not be deceived: God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap
For he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life'
If we sow unto our flesh, we will reap corruption of the flesh, but if we sow unto the Spirit, we will of the Spirit reap eternal life
Because of this, there is the possibility of gossiping even in the church life, which is the real social and communal life
Following this, Paul points out that circumcision, a strong ordinance of the Judaistic religion, is merely a good show in the flesh
For neither do they that become circumcised keep the law themselves but they desire you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh
Both verses 13 and 15 deal with circumcision, indicating that the 'world' mentioned between these two verses is religion
Circumcision, as an ordinance of the Jewish religion, has been crucified on the cross, and we have been crucified to it
In today's terms we may say that Christianity as a world is crucified to us, and we to the world of Christianity
In 5:6 Paul says, 'In Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith avails, operating through love'
Again in 6:15 he says, 'Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters'
The book of Galatians concludes with the new creation, which is the issue of all the things dealt with in chapters 1 through 6
In the future we will have the new heavens and the new earth, but even the new heavens and earth will not have the divine nature in them
The reason that Christianity maintains its ordinances is to make people appear to be living, even if they are dead
Some claim that certain practices in Christianity, such as the clergy-laity system, choirs, and Sunday schools are necessary
Although the Lord slew all the ordinances and buried them in a tomb, Christianity has opened the tomb to attempt to bring them back
The New Testament teaches us that we must baptize people, but the Lord has no intention that we make baptism an ordinance
The number of times to immerse someone, the direction in which to immerse them, and the kind of water to immerse them in are more ordinances
If we have the assurance that we are practicing something in the spirit it is good to do it but if we are not in the spirit we should stop
If we do this, we will come to the meetings with the rich experiences of Christ, and our spirit will be strong, high, and released
We will simply have the reality of the living Jesus, which is the reality of the new creation, the new man, the church life
In this reality there are no divisions, no confusion, no Greek, no Jew, no barbarian, no Scythian, no bond man, and no free man
We must walk by the Spirit, sow to the Spirit, and enjoy all the riches of the all-inclusive Christ in our spirit
For this reason, Paul concludes Galatians by saying, 'The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers
We need to digest and assimilate all the matters that we have fellowshipped in this series of messages in order to make them our living
We will enjoy the church life in the Lord's recovery, not merely in a doctrinal way but richly, in practicality and actuality
