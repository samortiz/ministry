   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. In Leviticus the Redeemed's Worship and Living</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Leviticus we have the redeemed's worship and living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not follow the common understanding of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the common understanding, to worship is to bow down or to hold a service with rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This, however, is not the denotation of worship in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Bible, worship denotes our contact with God to enjoy a common portion with God for our fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Leviticus worship is a matter of contacting God by enjoying a common portion with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The issue of this is fellowship with Him and with one another in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To do this is to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For many years we have been trying to practice this kind of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, I must honestly say that we have not been very successful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It seems that by birth we have the concept of religious worship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, many of us were raised in an environment of religious worship and learned to practice such worship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually religious worship became a part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This has hindered us from having the kind of worship revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Concerning worship, we need to have a change of concept.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we come together we should have a kind of worship that is a matter of contacting God by enjoying Christ as our common portion with God and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we have this understanding of worship, when we come to a meeting we shall surely share the experience and enjoyment of Christ we have had in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may do this by praising, by praying, or by giving our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to drop the religious and traditional way to worship and practice the biblical way, which is portrayed in the feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the feasts there was no religious worship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, there was the enjoyment of the things which the people offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They enjoyed these offerings with God and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to have a worship that is living, real, and rich in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This kind of worship requires that we experience and enjoy Christ every day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It also requires that we exercise our spirit to release whatever there is of Christ in our spirit so that we may share Him with the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In such worship God enjoys Christ, and we also enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is an aspect of the divine revelation in the book of Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose in a meeting we contact God by enjoying Christ as our common portion with God and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After such a meeting we shall be holy, for the issue of this kind of meeting is a holy daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we shall not only be holy worshippers; we shall also be a holy people living a holy daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This also is part of the advancement of God's revelation in Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the advancement of the divine revelation in Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus, we go from creation through the fall to redemption, and from redemption to God's habitation, where we worship God by contacting Him with Christ as our portion and enjoying this portion with Him and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Out from this worship will issue a holy living in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, in Leviticus God does not have only a habitation on earth; He also has a people worshipping Him, a people contacting Him and enjoying His Christ as a common portion with Him and with one another, with the issue of living a holy life to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This surely is an advancement of the divine revelation.</S>
