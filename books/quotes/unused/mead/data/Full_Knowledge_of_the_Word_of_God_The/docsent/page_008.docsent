   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO UNDERSTAND THE WORD OF GOD Understanding the Word of God Literally</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we read the Bible, the first way to understand the Word of God is to comprehend it literally.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must comprehend whatever the Bible says and never be distracted from the main thought.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we read the Bible, we should not interpret arbitrarily a passage that we do not understand, thus departing from the meaning of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many people study the Bible and spiritualize their interpretation of it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, John 3:5 says, "Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit " There is a group of people who feel that "water" here is difficult to interpret, so they take it as a sign, a symbol, and assume that the water refers to God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Ephesians 5:26, which refers to "the water in the word," they say that to be born again one must first hear the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When God's word comes to us, the Spirit also comes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, they say that to be born of water and the Spirit is to be born of the Spirit through the word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although this kind of spiritualizing in the interpretation of the Bible is not bad and seems to be consistent with the Bible, it does have its problems.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If this interpretation of John 3:5 were true, why did the Lord Jesus not tell Nicodemus plainly at the beginning that a man must be born of the word, instead of telling him that a man must be born of water?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By asking such a question, we can see that the interpretation of "water" as "the word" is unacceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, we can see that we need to try our best to understand the Bible literally.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To understand the Word of God literally, however, is not simple, and it also has its problems.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, there is a group of people in the United States who interpret the new birth in John chapter three to mean that a person must be born twice, the first time from his mother's womb and the second time of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the reason that the Lord Jesus spoke of these two things, the water and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to their interpretation, the water refers to the fluid that bathes the fetus in the mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A man, therefore, must be born first of the fluid in his mother's womb and then of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through these two births, he is born again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of "literal interpretation" is very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First of all, we must know to whom the Lord was speaking in John 3.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was speaking to Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John 3:1 clearly indicates that Nicodemus was a Pharisee.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When John the Baptist came to preach and to baptize people in water, he told the Pharisees, "I indeed baptize you in water unto repentance; but He Who is coming after me shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit" Matt 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In his speaking John already had put the water and the Spirit together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, Nicodemus must have understood the word of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of this, the Lord Jesus spoke to him in a straightforward way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is to not interpret the Word literally in a natural way but to interpret it according to its right meaning in the context.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As John the Baptist put all the repentant persons into the water, their old man was buried and terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus then followed this to enliven them with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The water is for burial, and the Spirit is for resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the two are put together, we have death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the meaning of being born again.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have used this example to show you the right way to interpret the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the next message I will tell you the two criteria for this kind of interpretation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first is to interpret the Bible with the word of the Bible, and the second is to interpret it according to the context.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who interpret the water in John 3:5 as the fluid from the mother's womb do so because they have not studied the Bible thoroughly and have not paid attention to the context.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They merely interpret the Word according to their natural understanding, and consequently they make a serious mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am using this opportunity to give you these basic rules, especially for the sake of the young brothers and sisters who still have a long future on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You need to labor on the Word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This Bible has been in the hands of Christians for nearly two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Tens of thousands of scholars have studied this book, but most of them have interpreted it in their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we want to know the Bible, the first thing we must do is to comprehend it literally; then we must pay attention to the context.</S>
