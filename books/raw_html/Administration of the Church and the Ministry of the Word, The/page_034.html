 <h2 class="head1">SEEKING HELP FROM OTHERS<br />
TO REDUCE OUR SUFFERING BEING A SHAME</h2>
<p>The way of consecration is a way of suffering, a way of sacrifice, in which everything that pertains to us is wrecked. Some people consecrate themselves in order to gain sympathy from others and reduce their suffering. These believers have lost their consecration. It is shameful to seek help from others in order to reduce our sufferings. Those who are consecrated should learn not to seek help from others. We would prefer to suffer before the Lord than to seek help from others, and we would prefer to starve for three days than to let others know our need. However, this is not our situation. Some who suffer just a little desire to be noticed by others and to receive help from them. This indicates that their consecration is not as strong as it was in the past.</p>
<p>The first group of serving ones among us did not seek help from others. They even told people that they would not take the way of receiving help from others. They had the ability to make money in the world, but for the Lord&rsquo;s sake they did not go to the world. This was the situation and character of the serving ones in the beginning. Sadly, some of us are now afraid that we will not receive help. It seems as if it is a shame for us not to receive help. However, it is glorious for others not to take care of us, because we serve the Lord full time. It is not glorious to seek the help and sympathy of others; rather, it is shameful.</p>
<p>We will become pitiful parasites if we always expect others to help us. Because of this, some are able to rebuke us, saying that we are the parasites of society since we depend on others for our living. This indicates that our consecration is not strong. However, this does not mean that the saints should not love or care for the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones. For many years the senior co-workers have held the principle that we do not appreciate or feel grateful for the care we directly receive from others. We do not want to receive any help directly from man&rsquo;s hand. Those with a burden to care for us should give through the offering box. We want to receive our supply directly from God&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Someone once asked a full-time serving brother how much support he received that week. Such questions are an insult to those who serve full time. Such people should be looked in the eye and told that it does not concern them. Their questions do not reflect a love for those who serve the Lord; rather, they are an insult. A person who is truly concerned should put something in the offering box without asking how much a serving one receives. Such questions are improper.</p>
<p>The wife of a serving brother once said that her husband received only a few dollars a week. This caused others to feel that we should help this brother find a job. This is shameful. Since this couple was willing to take this way, they should not complain. One who serves the Lord should not be like this.</p>
<p>Those who take this way should be clear that this is a way of suffering and poverty. They should not expect to have a prosperous life. The Lord never said that those who take this way will have food to eat and a good living. Instead, He said that we should forsake our all to follow Him. We should even lose our life. This is the way of consecration. It is glorious if we can live by faith for an entire year without anyone showing concern for us. However, there are situations in which serving ones ask others for help. When we are in this condition, we can do the work of Christianity, but we cannot do the work of building up the church. When we build up the church, our fame, reputation, being, and family will be wrecked. Our reputation, what we are, and what we have must be buried. The apostle Paul was wrecked by the Lord; the Lord gained his everything. The Lord Jesus can wreck people. Many lives have been wrecked by Him. This is a matter of consecration, of paying the price; this is to &ldquo;fill up...that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ...for His Body&rdquo; (Col. 1:24).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF CONSECRATION<br />
BEING CONSIDERED AS ABNORMAL</h2>
<p>We must consider this matter of consecration and consider the price that we must pay. Those in Christianity do not take this way. We must be prepared to be wrecked by Christ. We should not measure things according to natural thoughts. We should not consider our profession, marriage, family, or studies according to natural thoughts. The situation of the early apostles, the Christians in the early church life, and those who have followed the Lord throughout the ages surely cannot be considered as normal. We can be considered as normal only if we are not consecrated and not taking the way of consecration. All of the ways of consecration surely are abnormal. For example, the parents of Sister Dora Yu sent her to England to study medicine. However, when the ship she was on arrived at the port of Marseilles, France, she told the captain that she had to go back to China to preach the gospel. This is abnormal. We cannot take a normal path in our human life. If we take a normal path, we cannot take the way of consecration. May we all see that the way of serving the Lord is a way of consecration. Nothing is normal in this way; instead, everything is abnormal.</p>
