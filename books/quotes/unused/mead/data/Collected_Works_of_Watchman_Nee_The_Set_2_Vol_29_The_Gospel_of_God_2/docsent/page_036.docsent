   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE HOW GOD DEALS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE BELIEVERS' SINS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR ENTERING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>INTO THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have made it clear that the kingdom is the time when God will reward the Christians according to their works.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the kingdom, the faithful believers will be rewarded, and the unfaithful believers will be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people think that if a Christian is unfaithful, although he may have to occupy a lower position, he will nevertheless make it into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many who do not understand God's word and God's work think that they are guaranteed an entrance into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They think that when the Lord Jesus comes to rule, there will merely be a distinction between higher and lower positions in the kingdom; no one will lose the kingdom of the heavens altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, in the kingdom of the heavens, there is not only a distinction between higher and lower positions, but also the distinction between being allowed to enter and being kept out.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible shows us that there is a clear distinction between ten cities and five cities, between a large crown and a small one, and between a greater glory and a lesser one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As one star differs from another star, so also are the positions in the kingdom different.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only is there the difference of lower and higher positions in the kingdom; there is also the distinction of being able or not able to get in.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>DOING THE WILL OF THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible tells us of a very serious truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although someone may have eternal life, he may still be rejected from the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One verse that speaks of this is Matthew 7:21: "Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The persons in this verse all address the Lord as "Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord will make a distinction between those disciples who can enter into the kingdom of the heavens and those who cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord clearly shows us here that the condition for entering the kingdom of the heavens is doing the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although some have been saved and have called Him Lord, and although they have also done some works, without doing the will of God they nevertheless cannot enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reward of the kingdom of the heavens is based on the obedience of man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If one is not faithful while living on the earth, though he will not lose eternal life, he will lose the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the time comes for the heavens to rule, that is, when the Lord Jesus comes the second time, some will not be able to enter the kingdom, but will lose it instead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, the Lord mentioned this matter in verse 21.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Following this, in verses 22 and 23, He explained the matter to us in the way of a prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There will be many, not only one or two, who will not do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And then I will declare to them: I never knew you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here the Lord Jesus tells us what will happen before the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He says, "In that day."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, this does not refer to today, but to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are many who work hard but do not see the light of God in their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the time of the judgment seat comes, and when Christ begins to judge from the house of God, these Christians will have light for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They will see that they are off in their standing and in their living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In that day many will say before the Lord, "Was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Within one sentence, the phrase "in Your name" is mentioned three times.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This proves that these ones are the Lord's. The fact that they say, "Lord, Lord," proves that their standing is that of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not only do they say that they prophesy, cast out demons, and do many works of power; they do these in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The mentioning of "in Your name" three times tells us of their relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Amazingly, the Lord tells them, "And then I will declare to them: I never knew you."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because many do not understand the meaning of these words, they think that these surely are not saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if these are not saved ones, then the Lord's word here would be meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Matthew 7 is a conclusion to the sermon on the mount following the Lord's word concerning the Beatitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These words on the mount were spoken by the Lord Jesus to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After the Lord went up the mountain, His disciples came before Him, and He opened His mouth and taught them from chapter five to chapter seven.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Jesus said that they should not call Him Lord with their mouth only.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If they call Him Lord, they should do the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even if they have the outward works of prophesying, casting out demons, and doing works of power, these works must not replace the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Doing the Father's will is one thing, whereas prophesying, casting out demons, and doing works of power are another thing altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sometimes, one can prophesy, cast out demons, and do works of power without doing the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must remember that we should not only call Him Lord with our mouth, but we should do the Father's will in our walk as well.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the Lord were speaking about unsaved persons, this word would lose its meaning altogether, for if these are not saved ones, it would not matter much for the disciples to listen or not to listen to His word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The disciples may say that His word is for the unsaved ones, but they are the saved ones; therefore whether or not they do the Father's will, the Lord cannot deny knowing them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If this were the case, then all the unsaved ones would be those who do not do the will of God, and all the saved ones would be those who do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This would take away the highest meaning of these words.</S>
