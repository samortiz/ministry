<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Telling Out the Virtues of the One<br>Who Has Saved Us out of Darkness<br>into His Marvelous Light</H2><P>Second, the priesthood of the gospel should tell out the virtues (such as love, grace, and forgiveness) of the One who has saved us out of darkness into His marvelous light (1 Pet. 2:9). To tell out His virtues is to tell out what He is in His attributes. Our telling out to people in this way is our preaching of the gospel. To be the priests of the gospel of God is to tell out the virtues of what He is, to tell out how He has saved us out of darkness into His marvelous light.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Carrying Out the Stewardship<br>of the Grace of God in God's Economy</H2><P>Third, the priests of the gospel of God should carry out the stewardship of the grace of God in God's economy (Eph. 3:2; 1 Cor. 9:16-17). As the New Testament priests of the gospel, we have a stewardship, and our stewardship is the economy of God. Every time we go out to preach the gospel, we are carrying out our stewardship in God's economy to dispense Christ's salvation and life to others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Ministering to Others the Unsearchable Riches<br>of Christ as the Grace of God</H2><P>Fourth, the priests of the gospel should minister to others the unsearchable riches of Christ as the grace of God. This is to dispense Christ to people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Offering Up Spiritual Sacrifices<br>Acceptable to God, That Is, Offering Up<br>the Saved Sinners as Members of Christ</H2><P>Fifth, after we dispense Christ to others, there will be a result. Others will receive and believe in the Lord, and we will baptize them into the Triune God. Thus, the sinners whom we save become the spiritual sacrifices that we can offer up to God for His acceptance, and they also become members of Christ to constitute the Body of Christ (1 Pet. 2:5; Rom. 15:16b). After a sinner is saved and baptized through us, he becomes a lamb of the Lord to be offered as a sacrifice to God, and he also becomes a member of the Body of Christ to constitute the Body of Christ.</P><P>As priests, we must offer sacrifices. All the sacrifices of the Old Testament are types of Christ. Therefore, what the Old Testament priests offered were types of Christ; we may say that they offered Christ in type. But what the New Testament priests offer is Christ Himself, because the sinners whom we save are members of the Body of Christ, and they thereby constitute the Body of Christ. Therefore, in God's eyes what we, the New Testament priests of the gospel, offer is Christ. In the Old Testament, what was offered were types of the individual Christ, whereas in the New Testament what is offered is the reality of the corporate Christ. Therefore, what we offer is more and higher than what was offered in the Old Testament. Whenever we gain one person by preaching the gospel, we should rejoicingly offer him on the altar as a sacrifice to God and as a member of Christ's Body. When all the members are added together, they constitute the Body of Christ. Therefore, what we offer is the corporate Christ.</P>
