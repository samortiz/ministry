   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ s resurrection was His birth as God s firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Acts 13:33 reveals that to the man Jesus resurrection was a birth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was begotten by God in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God among many brothers Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity John 1:18; 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After incarnation and through resurrection He was begotten by God in His humanity to be God s firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was prophesied in Psalm 2:7: Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Acts 13:33, which quotes from Psalm 2:7, indicates that Christ was begotten as the Son of God on the day of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He needed to be begotten by resurrection because He had put on humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As to His divinity there was no need for Him to be begotten as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But as to His humanity there was the need for this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the day of Christ s resurrection His human nature was uplifted and transfigured into a glorious substance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was the begetting in power by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This begetting was also His designation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way Jesus was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God and designated the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word Firstborn in Romans 8:29 indicates that in addition to the firstborn Son of God there will be other sons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hebrews 2:10 speaks of many sons, and Romans 8:29, of many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In resurrection Christ came to His brothers, who compose His church, and declared the Father s name to them Heb 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through incarnation God s only begotten Son put on humanity and became the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then in resurrection this God-man was born of God to be His Firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before incarnation God s only begotten Son did not have human nature, only the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, in resurrection God s firstborn Son has a human nature as well as the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As believers in Christ, we all are sons of God and brothers of the firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through regeneration we have the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although we are human beings, we now have the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although the Lord Jesus is divine, He also has the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both the Lord Jesus and we are the same in that both He and we have the human nature and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In His resurrection the Lord was born of God to be His firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His resurrection was the release of the divine life and nature, and through this release He was begotten as the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the Son of God, Christ has passed through two births.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first birth took place at His incarnation, and the second, in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the first birth He was born as a son of man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, Christ was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then in the second birth in resurrection He was born as the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through the two births of Christ divinity has been brought into humanity, and humanity has been brought into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By the incarnation of Christ God was brought into man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Prior to Christ s incarnation, God was outside of man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, through Christ s incarnation God was brought into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With the birth of Christ God was born into man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, by Christ s first birth in incarnation God was brought into man and became one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then through Christ s second birth in resurrection man was brought into God and became one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A Resurrected Man</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>with a Spiritual Body of Flesh and Bones</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the day of His resurrection Christ came back to the disciples with a resurrected body, coming into the room where the disciples were with the doors shut John 20:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since the doors were shut, how could He enter the room with a body of flesh and bones?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our limited mentality cannot comprehend this, but it is a fact, and we must receive it according to the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ in resurrection is a resurrected man with a spiritual body of flesh and bones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot understand how a body of flesh and bones can be spiritual, but with the resurrected Christ flesh and bones have become spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that He has a spiritual body, yet the body is physical.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Luke 24:36 and 37 say, As they were speaking these things, He Himself stood in their midst and said to them, Peace to you!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But they were startled and became frightened and thought they beheld a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The disciples were troubled by the Lord s appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They could not understand how He could suddenly appear in the room.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The door was closed, and no one opened it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nevertheless, the Lord appeared with a physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord said to the disciples, Why are you troubled, and why are reasonings arising in your heart?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; handle Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you behold Me having vv.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then He showed them His hands and feet v. 40 . Here we see Christ s resurrected body, which is spiritual 1 Cor 15:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord s appearing was very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He came into the room as the Spirit, yet with a physical, touchable body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The prints of the nails could still be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The place in His side that had been pierced with a spear could still be seen and touched.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Not only was the Lord s body visible and touchable, but He was able to eat food: While they still did not believe for joy and were marveling, He said to them, Do you have anything to eat here?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>And they handed Him part of a broiled fish; and He took it and ate before them Luke 24:41-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We do not understand how the Lord Jesus as One with a spiritual body was still able to eat material food.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In 1 Corinthians 15:44 Paul speaks concerning the resurrection body: It is sown a soulish body, it is raised a spiritual body.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If there is a soulish body, there is also a spiritual body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A soulish body is a natural body animated by the soul, a body in which the soul predominates.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A spiritual body is a resurrected body saturated by the spirit, a body in which the spirit predominates.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After His resurrection Christ had such a spiritual body, yet it was a body with flesh and bones.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In Philippians 3:21 Paul speaks of Christ s body of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Christ s body of glory is His resurrected body, saturated with God s glory Luke 24:26 and transcendent over corruption and death Rom 6:9 .</S>
