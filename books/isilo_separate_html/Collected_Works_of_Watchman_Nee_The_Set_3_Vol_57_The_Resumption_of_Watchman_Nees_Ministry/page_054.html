Those who serve God are called priests. They may do many other works, but none of those works can be considered true service. Only one thing is true service, and that is dwelling in the temple. In the Old Testament there was the tabernacle. After the tabernacle there was the temple. Within the temple there was the dwelling of the priests. The book of Psalms speaks of the matter of dwelling in the house of Jehovah seven or eight times. The work of the priests was to go to God on behalf of men and to go to men on behalf of God. In order for God to be among men, to dwell with men, and to find rest among men, He has to have priests. God will find a resting place only when He secures priests.</p><h2 class="head3">God Calling the Israelites to Be<br />a Kingdom of Priests</h2><p>The Holy Place and the priesthood were the twofold requirements of God. The work of the priests was to serve God, and the Holy Place was the dwelling place for the priests; it was also the dwelling place of God. Melchisedec was a priest of God. But he was alone, and he could not satisfy God. God wanted a kingdom of priests. This is why He called out a people and brought them through the Red Sea into the wilderness. The purpose was to secure for Himself a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). In God's eyes God's people and the priesthood were one and the same. God desired that the whole nation of Israel be a priesthood. As long as a person was one of His people, he should have been a priest. This is why Moses told Pharaoh, "Let my people go, that they may serve me'' (Exo. 8:1; 9:1). Every one of God's people was there to serve God. As such, every one of them should have been a priest.</p><h2 class="head3">The Israelites Having Failed,<br />the Priesthood Becoming the Special Privilege<br />of the Tribe of Levi</h2><p>The law is God's testimony. What the law gives to man is what man should give to God. The law is God's testimony for Himself. Whatever God says to man, man should say the same thing to God. The law says that the children of Israel should be a kingdom of priests. Yet before the law was passed to the hands of the Israelites, while it was still in the hands of Moses, the Israelites had fallen and worshipped the golden calf. After Moses came down from the mountain, he ordered all the men to kill their own brothers and sisters. The Levites did according to Moses' word and killed over three thousand people. As a result, God chose the tribe of Levi to be priests (Exo. 32:1-28; Deut. 33:8-10). Originally, Israel was to be a kingdom of priests. Now only one out of twelve tribes was to be the priests. From that time on, no one had the right to be priests except the tribe of Levi. In the book of Judges, even when men had money, they could only hire the Levites as priests; they themselves could not be priests. In the Old Testament one king tried to be a priest and was smitten with leprosy (2 Chron. 26:16-20). All who serve according to their own will, will be smitten. Serving God is both a privilege and a right.</p><h2 class="head3">In the New Testament, God Intending<br />the Church to Be the Kingdom of Priests</h2><p>What the Israelites lost has been regained by the church today. God desires that the church be the kingdom of priests. Peter said that we are a holy priesthood and a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5). In Revelation the apostle John said that we are all priests (1:6). All the gold and silver are for the temple and the tabernacle; they are not for the golden calf. No one should worship a calf, not even the golden calf. A man has to learn to execute God's judgment and to deal with the golden calf. Only by this dealing will the real service be produced, and only then will the "Levites'' rise up.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> </body></html>
