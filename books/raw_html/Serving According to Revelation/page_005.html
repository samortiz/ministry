        <h2 class="head1">SEEING THE ISSUE OF<br />
ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH SERVING</h2>
<p>If we see that the service of the church is the service of all the members, there will be a desire in us to see the saints functioning in service in many different ways. This is the way for service to encompass every aspect of the church. If we realize that the service of the church is the service of all the members, we also will encourage the various functions of the saints.</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 12:12-27, every member of the Body of Christ has a function. The hand has a function, and the foot has a function. The ear cannot replace the eye, nor can the eye replace the ear. For example, a brother may have a burden from the Lord to visit and help the saints who are sick, but he does not necessarily have the function of expounding the Bible. Another brother may be very good at reading the Bible publicly. When he reads the Bible aloud, his cadence and tone help the listeners understand the meaning of the text. However, it may not be easy for this brother to visit people. Some saints know how to visit people. Such saints are concerned when they hear that a saint is in the midst of difficulties or problems, but they do not have the capacity to clean the meeting hall or to move chairs. It is easier for them to travel three miles to visit a brother than to climb a ladder to clean a window. Other saints may feel that it is easier to clean all the windows in the meeting hall than it is to visit people. These differences indicate that not all members have the same function. If we see that the service of the church depends on the function of all the members, our service will be to bring out their different functions.</p>
<p>We must understand that in the service of the church certain saints can do things that we cannot do, and we can do things that they cannot do. Certain brothers must take care of certain matters. Those who see the revelation of the service of all the members know that others cannot replace their function, nor can they replace the function of others, because every saint is different. The brothers and sisters must be clear concerning this. Those who have not seen this revelation have not seen the service of all the members. The clearer we are concerning the service of all the members, the stronger our feeling will be concerning the service of all the members. This will enhance our function and cause us to encourage the function of the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO PRACTICE</h2>
<p>In practice it is best for the responsible brothers and sisters to come together and pray. Then they should fellowship and consider the spiritual and practical matters in every district. Preaching the gospel and the edification of the saints should also be thoroughly considered. We may also ask the responsible ones in the group meetings to consider these matters and make a detailed list of necessary services.</p>
<p>All the responsible saints should study together in order to find a detailed way to carry out every service. They should consider how to preach the gospel, how to hold a gospel meeting, how to apportion visitations, how to lead the saints to fellowship and to pursue spiritual growth, how to arrange the meeting hall, how to usher and maintain order during the meetings, how to contact and fellowship with the attendees after a meeting, and how to clean the meeting hall. The responsible saints should find a way to carry out every service.</p>
<p>The responsible saints should also supply the necessary tools for each service. We need to consider this matter; we should not be stingy or extravagant. We should not overlook the things that are needed or prepare things that are not needed. There should be adequate preparation of the necessary tools.</p>
<p>The responsible saints should also find saints who will be suitable to carry out each service. This is a difficult and strenuous task that takes considerable time and energy.</p>
<p>The service of all the members can never be carried out solely by a few responsible saints; it can only be carried out by all the saints. We must hold on to this principle. Then according to the needs of the various services, we can bring the saints into their function. We should also consider the desire and condition of the saints before the Lord so that everyone functions. Then the service of all the members of the church will be manifested. The responsible saints must pray much for this matter. We must spend our time and energy to bring in enough suitable persons for every service in each district and thus bring every saint into a service. We must be patient and active to bring the saints in one by one, but we must not be anxious.</p>
<p>We must make a list of the services, find ways to do them, and prepare the necessary tools. Then according to the need of each service, we must identify suitable saints. We should not be the ones taking care of the services; instead, we must bring the saints into the service and let them function. For example, we must identify one or two suitable brothers who can manage the gospel van, give them a few principles, and let them manage it. In the arrangement and management of the church there should be detailed consideration. Then our service will be thorough, and all the saints will be brought into serving together.</p>
<p>Until a person has served, he may not be interested in a service and cannot be responsible for it. After a saint begins to serve, he will become interested and will eventually feel that the service is his responsibility. He will not feel that it is something the responsible brothers asked him to do. Then he will have a heart for the service of the church, and he will feel that the church&rsquo;s affairs are his affairs.</p>
<p>Some saints may not yet be interested in the service of the church. The responsible ones should pray for these saints, fellowship with them, and lead them to know the Lord&rsquo;s constraining love so that they would be willing to participate in the service of the church and to serve the Lord with the other saints. Some saints may not know how to serve even though they have the heart to serve the church. The responsible ones must lead these saints by teaching them to serve. Some saints have a heart to serve and know how to serve, but they still need to be led to serve in coordination with other saints.</p>
<p>If the responsible saints were willing to spend their time and energy to find the way to bring all the saints into serving, we would have the service of all the members. If we do not bring all the saints into serving, we will be short. If we have seen this revelation, we will be compelled to seek the Lord to find a way to bring the saints into service so that they would serve together with us. Whether we bring in one saint per week or a few saints per week, all the saints need to be brought into the service.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEEPER SPIRITUAL GROWTH</h2>
<p>We must also pay attention to deeper spiritual growth. The responsible saints must pursue deeper spiritual growth and stir up the saints to pursue deeper spiritual growth. We must lead the saints to pursue knowing Christ and expressing Christ so that the stature of Christ may increase in the church.</p>
<p>The gospel work is spreading, and more saved ones are being added daily. If we do not have more experiences of Christ, we will not have the spiritual life necessary to maintain a strong testimony. Our service must not consist of many outward activities without a rich inner life, nor should we have zealous excitement without spiritual reality. Our experience of life should be more than outward activities, and our spiritual reality should be higher than our zealous excitement.</p>
<p>Hence, we must not only bring the saints into the basic experiences of life, such as dealing with sins, consecration, obeying the inner sense of life, and being led by the Lord; we must also bring them to know Christ as our life. We must know the indwelling Spirit so that we may experience Christ, and we must know how to fellowship with the Lord and be in His presence. We must bring the saints into deeper spiritual knowledge and experiences. We should lead the saints to know the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and to have deeper experiences of His death. We should lead them to know the breaking of the outer man, dealing with the flesh, being delivered from the self, and being filled with the Spirit. Hence, the responsible saints in the districts and groups should have such a pursuit, such knowledge, and such experiences. The responsible saints in the districts and groups must pay adequate attention to spiritual growth. If a few saints would gather together to fellowship and pray concerning this kind of pursuit, the Lord would produce a hunger in their hearts and cause them to enter into deeper spiritual experiences.</p>
<p>I have a heavy burden concerning bringing the saints into a deeper spiritual pursuit. It is not too difficult to encourage the saints to zealously preach the gospel or to join gospel teams, but it is not easy to lead the saints in spiritual pursuit or into deeper spiritual experiences. Nevertheless, a church that lacks deeper spiritual experiences will not have weight and will not be able to satisfy the Lord. Therefore, we must pursue and enter into deeper spiritual growth. May we all pay attention to this point, and may the Lord prepare our hearts!</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
