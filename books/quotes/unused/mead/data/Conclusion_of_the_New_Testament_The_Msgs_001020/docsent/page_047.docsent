   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>JJ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>POWER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 1:24 speaks of God's power, which is a crucial item of the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"To those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, God's power and God's wisdom."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ crucified is God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This power of God destroys Satan, judges the world, deals with sin, crucifies the fallen man, the flesh, the natural life, and the old creation, and annuls the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is the power of crucifixion, the power of the wonderful death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This power not only deals with the negative things, but also carries out God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whereas the divine wisdom is for God's planning and purposing, the divine power is for carrying out what is planned and purposed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesians 1:19 says, "The surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's power toward us is surpassingly great.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is according to the operation of the might of His strength.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is the power which God wrought in Christ Eph 1:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's power toward us is the same power which God wrought in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First it has raised Christ from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This power has overcome death and Hades where the dead are held.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because of this power, death and Hades could not hold Christ Acts 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second, God's great power which God wrought in Christ has seated Him at God's right hand in the heavenlies far above all Eph 1:20b-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's right hand, where Christ has been seated by the surpassingly great power of God, is the most honorable place, the place of supreme authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Third, God's great power which God wrought in Christ has subjected all things under Christ's feet Eph 1:22a .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To seat Christ far above all is one thing; to subject all things under His feet is another.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The former is Christ's transcendency; the latter is the subjection of all things to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fourth, God's great power which God wrought in Christ gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church Eph l:22b .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The headship of Christ over all things is a gift from God to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was by God's great power that Christ received the headship in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In these verses God's great power which God wrought in Christ, is revealed in four aspects: resurrection power, transcending power, subjecting power, and heading-up power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This fourfold power is to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The phrase "to the church" in verse 22 implies a transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever Christ, the Head, has attained and obtained is now being transmitted to the church, His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, God's great power which He wrought in Christ is the Triune God, who has passed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and who has been installed in us as the all-inclusive power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Apostle Paul prayed that we may have a spirit of wisdom and revelation to know the surpassing greatness of this divine power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Surely we need to pray the same prayer!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>KK.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>STRENGTH</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ephesians 1:19 speaks of the might of God's strength, and Revelation 5:12 also refers to it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God has the attribute of strength as well as power.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Inherently God has strength.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to M. R. Vincent, the Greek word ischuos for strength in Ephesians 1:19 and Revelation 5:12 denotes indwelling strength.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is intrinsic, not outward.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>LL.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>MIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Finally, God has the attribute of might.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Ephesians 1:19 speaks of "the might of His strength."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Revelation 1:6 declares, "To Him be the glory and the might forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Revelation 5:13 all the creatures say, "To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb, be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Jude 25 ascribes might to God, and 1 Timothy 6:16 says that to Him should be "honor and eternal might."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Greek word for "might" kratos denotes manifested power.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Strength is greater than might, power is greater than strength, authority is greater than power, and sovereignty is greater than authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our God has might, strength, power, authority, and sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All these are His attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In these messages we have seen the many aspects of what God is in His person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have also considered God's attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This God is now dispensing Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that God with all that He is and with all that He has is being dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more we are under God's dispensing, the more the divine attributes are infused into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>While God is dispensing Himself into us, He is dispensing all that He is and has.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us quickly review the divine attributes: life, love, light, riches, fullness, holiness, righteousness, wisdom, prudence, faithfulness, truthfulness, simplicity, sincerity, goodness, mercy, compassion, grace, peace, joy, hope, encouragement, kindness, forbearance, longsuffering, endurance, jealousy, severity, impartiality, immortality, immutability, glory, honor, majesty, sovereignty, authority, power, strength, and might.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How wonderful that these attributes are being dispensed into us!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As we remain under God's dispensing day by day, His attributes will be dispensed and infused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After God's attributes have been dispensed and infused into us, they will all become our virtues.</S>
