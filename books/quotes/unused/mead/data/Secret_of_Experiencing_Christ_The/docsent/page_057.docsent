   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXERCISING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PRAY-READ THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians all have a particular emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But if we put these books together, we see five things that are crucial for our experience of Christ: the Word, faith, the Spirit, our spirit, and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If God had not created us with a spirit, we would not be able to receive inspiration from the Word, no matter how many times we may read it or repeat parts of it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The inspiration which comes from the Word is not a matter of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Human words may touch our emotion, but they do not touch our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I studied the classical writings of Confucius, but none of those writings touched my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Certain writings may stir our emotions, but only the Word of God can inspire our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only one book the Bible is able to touch our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Hebrews 4:12, the Word of God is a sharp sword that even divides soul from spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In worshipping God it is best to deal with His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when we read the Word, we should use not only our eyes and our mind, but especially our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When many Christians read the Bible, they just read with their eyes and try to understand with their mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They stop short of allowing the Word to touch their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we want the Word to touch our spirit, we should pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before we began to practice pray-reading, I would often pray after reading two or three verses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having read these verses, I would ask the Lord to make them my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although this practice is helpful, it is not as helpful as pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In pray-reading the Word, there is no need to wait until we have finished reading before we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, we read by praying, mingling our reading with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we receive the Word of God by means of all prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Colossians 3:16 charges us to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we would let the word of Christ dwell in us, we need to receive the Word by means of all prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the Bible, the ultimate way to receive the Word is to pray it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let us use Philippians 3:17 as an illustration: "Be imitators together of me, brothers, and observe attentively those who thus walk as you have us for an example."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You may be inspired by reading this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But only when you pray will this word get into you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How good it is to take such a verse into us by prayer!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we pray-read the Word, the Word does not stay in our mouth, but enters into our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is to receive the Word by means of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we pray the Word, the Word enters into the very depths of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As an elderly man with many years of experience, I can testify that the best way to take the Word is by means of all prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By praying the Word we drink the living water in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then this living water fills our inner being and causes us to be nourished and healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 1 Timothy 6:3 and 2 Timothy 1:13 Paul uses the expression "healthy words."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we pray-read the Word, the Word becomes to us the healthy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By this healthy Word we experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We thank the Lord that He created us with a spirit by which we may drink His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if we would use our spirit to drink the Word, we need to exercise the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The best way to exercise our spirit is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Ephesians 6:17 and 18 say that we should receive the Word of God by means of all prayer, praying at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we would have the Word, faith, and the Spirit, we need to exercise our spirit by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we walk, we automatically exercise our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Likewise, when we pray, we spontaneously exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul charges us to pray at every time Eph 6:18 and also to persevere in prayer Col 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we want to enjoy the Word and have the Spirit with faith, we must pray by exercising our spirit.</S>
