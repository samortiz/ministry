<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1><p>Volumes 37 and 38 of the Collected Works contain miscellaneous messages given by Brother Watchman Nee between 1934 and 1942. Some are words of exhortation and comfort; others are short expositions. Most of these messages were included in a Chinese series entitled Twelve Baskets Full, which consists of twelve books of miscellaneous messages. Four of these books have been previously published by the Living Stream Ministry under the title Twelve Baskets Full, Volumes 1&mdash;4. Since these messages were not originally published as a series under the title Twelve Baskets Full (they were later compiled from various sources by the Taiwan Gospel Bookroom), we have chosen to include them in the Collected Works under the title General Messages (1) and General Messages (2).</p>
