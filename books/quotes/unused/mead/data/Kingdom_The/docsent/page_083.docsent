   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many Christians have the concept that death automatically solves all problems.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to this concept, if they believe in the Lord Jesus, everything is settled when they die, regardless of whether they have been wise or foolish, good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They think once they die, they will go to heaven and everything will be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To them death is a type of graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It does not matter whether or not they have finished the course; as long as they die, they graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This concept is in the minds of so many Christians, but I must tell you that death does not solve any problem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Death does not automatically make everything all right.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If your problem with the Lord has been solved before death, it has been solved; if your problem with the Lord has not been solved before death, it remains to be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether you live or die, the unsolved problem is still there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some have considered that the five foolish virgins represent false believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But this is not logical.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How can we say that the foolish ones are false ones?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Parents who have several children know that some children are wise and some are foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Can the parents say that the foolish children are false children?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It simply is not logical to say that the virgins were false because they were foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They were all virgins in every respect: in nature, in essence, in title, and in position.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All were virgins; the only difference was in their behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A couple may have several children.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some of the children are wise, conducting themselves in a proper way; some are foolish, behaving in a naughty way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Can we say that the naughty ones, the foolish ones, are false children?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Can the parents refuse to recognize them as their children because they are foolish?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Likewise, whether they are wise or foolish, virgins are virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, all of the virgins had lamps which were burning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Matthew does not say that the lamps of only the wise were burning and that the lamps of the unwise were not burning because they were false.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All of the lamps were burning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How could a false Christian have a burning lamp?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is impossible!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Matthew also says that all of the virgins went forth Matt 25:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that they all went out of the world to meet the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only the five wise virgins went forth to meet the Bridegroom, but also the five foolish ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a believer, you are expecting to meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, you must be alert.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Are you wise or foolish?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whether you are wise or foolish does not depend upon your smart mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It depends upon your having oil in your vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The five wise virgins, besides having burning lamps, had prepared an extra portion of oil in their vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The foolish ones did not have an extra portion of oil in their vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This one point determines who is wise and who is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>OIL IN THE VESSELS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What does it mean to prepare oil in the vessels?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We praise the Lord that He has shown us the meaning of the lamps and the vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Bible there are the lamps and the vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Proverbs 20:27 tells us that the spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The lamp signifies the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What then are the vessels?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Romans 9:21, 23-24 say that we are God's vessels, made to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As God's vessels, we are human beings with a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our spirit is the lamp, and our soul is the vessel.</S>
