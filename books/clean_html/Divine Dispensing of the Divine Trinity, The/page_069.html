<h2 class="head1">MINISTERING GRACE</h2>
<p>Every member of the Body, whether small or large, has received something of the Triune God as supply, as grace ministered to that member. Large members, such as Peter and Paul, could minister the riches of Christ into all the churches. But even small members can receive grace and minister this grace to others. For example, at home you may minister grace to your wife or husband through your speaking, and this grace will build them up. This is the ministry of life. Do not think that you are too small a member to minister grace to others. Every member of the Body is able to minister grace.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:16 speaks of the operation in measure of each one part. According to the measure of every part, the Body enjoys the supply by which it grows. Of course, there are the joints of supply, which are large members such as Paul. Such members are life-joints full of supply. But even we who are small members have a measure, and according to the measure of every part, the Body is supplied to grow. This is the life-dispensing of the Triune God for the building up of the Body.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, I have seen many brothers and sisters, who are small members of the Body, minister grace as life supply to others. Because they are under the dispensing of the Triune God, enjoying grace and realizing reality, spontaneously they speak to their fellow members. This speaking conveys grace to the other members so that they may be nourished and grow. All the members in the local churches may be life suppliers. Whether we speak to others in a message or speak to them in our daily living, we may minister grace because we are under the life-dispensing of the Triune God. Both in the meetings and in our daily life the principle is the same&mdash;it is a matter of ministering grace through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
