   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and the Lord's new name written upon the overcomer indicate that the overcomer is possessed by God, by the New Jerusalem, and by the Lord; that God Himself, His city, the New Jerusalem, and the Lord Himself all belong to him; and that he is one with God, with the New Jerusalem, and with the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Less than a century after the Lord recovered the proper church in the early part of the nineteenth century, some of the recovered churches "assemblies" became degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This degraded recovered church differs from the reformed church signified by the church in Sardis; it also differs from the proper recovered church signified by the church in Philadelphia.</S>
