[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE FIVE "UPS" IN EZRA Scripture Reading: Ezra 1 THE TYPE OF THE CAPTIVITY
[4]  In order to understand the recovery of God's house and God's city, we must look back into the history of the people of Israel.
[5]  We all know that the Old Testament is a book of types, and the greatest, all-inclusive type is the history of the people of Israel.
[6]  After a time, the people of Israel were taken captive and scattered into at least three divisions.
[7]  We must be stirred up in the spirit, rise up with the body, go up to Jerusalem, and bring up the experiences of Christ that we may build up the church.
[8]  Even the Old Testament tells us to be stirred up in our human spirit.
[9]  The church is not a human society, but a divine economy.
[10]  If we only rise up, yet we do not go up to the church life, we may serve God, but we will only serve God in a synagogue.
[11]  CHAPTER TWO THE ONENESS, THE PRIESTHOOD, THE KINGSHIP, AND THE ALTAR Scripture Reading: Ezra 3:1-2 THE ONENESS
[12]  Chapter one of Ezra tells us that God stirred up the spirit of some of the captives in Babylon.
[13]  After their spirit was stirred up, they rose up to go back to Jerusalem, bringing with them vessels of gold and silver.
[14]  In the Lord's recovery, there is the need of the priesthood and the kingship; then there will be something recovered.
[15]  For the recovery of the house we need the recovery of the altar.
[16]  In other words, we must put all that we have, all that we are, and all that we can do on the altar for God's satisfaction.
[17]  I tell you frankly that if you will offer everything what you have, what you can do, and what you are on the altar, the Lord will bring in the seeking ones.
[18]  So far we have covered four main points: the oneness, the priesthood, the kingship, and the altar.
[19]  Many do not know how to bring people into the presence of the Lord, they do not know how to submit themselves under the headship of Christ, and they do not know how to be one with others.
[20]  The oneness, the priesthood, the kingship, and the altar are the preparation for laying the foundation.
[21]  According to typology, this foundation is nothing but Christ.
[22]  They did not care for anything but Christ, and we must be the same.
[23]  We do not care for prophesying, we do not care for healing, we do not care for speaking in tongues, and we do not care for foot-washing or head-covering.
[24]  The ground is for the foundation, and the foundation is Christ and Christ alone.
[25]  "Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the Lord God of Israel; then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them.
[26]  Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.'
[27]  But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.'
[28]  It was at this time that the prophets came.
[29]  "Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.
[30]  Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.
[31]  CHAPTER FOUR HAGGAI "CONSIDER YOUR WAYS" Scripture Reading: Hag 1:1 2:9 THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE KINGSHIP
[32]  Haggai speaks, first of all, not to the people, but to the governor and the high priest.
[33]  "In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest" Hag 1:1 .
[34]  The priesthood is the ministry that brings the people into the presence of God and helps them to contact God, be saturated, and even occupied by God.
[35]  We do not need the knowledge of the teachings, but we do need the saturation, the oneness, the fellowship, and the living contact with God.
[36]  This is why we have the morning watch with all the pray-reading it is simply to contact the Lord, to have a living fellowship with the Lord, and even to be saturated, permeated, and possessed by the Lord that we may really be one with Him in spirit.
[37]  What I mean is that we do not have the maneuvering of any human hand, but we do have a government, a divine government, a government under the headship of Christ.
[38]  In all my experience in the local churches throughout the years, I have learned a secret.
[39]  In the early years when different ones came to complain regarding something in the local churches, I would always listen to them.
[40]  CHAPTER FIVE CHRIST AS EVERYTHING FOR GOD'S BUILDING Scripture Reading: Zech 1 8
[41]  In this chapter, we come to another wonderful book of the recovery, Zechariah.
[42]  I cannot tell you how much I love this book.
[43]  Years ago it was a closed book to me, but later, due to the recovery of the local churches, it was opened.
[44]  Of course, we do not have the time to cover it entirely, but no other book of the Old Testament tells us so much about Christ as this one.
[45]  In the first section, there are eight visions, in which the prophet Zechariah saw the things of Christ related to the recovery of God's building; in the last section, Zechariah prophesies about Christ in the future, after the recovery of the temple.
[46]  Today in the Lord's recovery, we need the prophets such as Haggai to strengthen us, warn us, and stir us, but we need prophets such as Zechariah even more.
[47]  Who is the man riding on the red horse among the myrtle trees?
[48]  The fourth vision shows Joshua, representing the priesthood, standing before the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him Zech 3:1 .
[49]  We need the clothing of Christ to be in a position to bring forth Christ as the producing One as well as the foundation stone with the intensified Spirit for the recovery of the building.
[50]  This is why we need Christ as the branch to produce, we need Christ as the King for the headship and the kingship, and we need Christ as the Priest for the priesthood that He might be the real Builder to build up the local churches.
[51]  CHAPTER SIX THE FIRST AND SECOND COMING OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Zech 9 14
[52]  In the Lord's recovery there are three ministries: the priesthood, the kingship, and the prophethood.
[53]  The ministry of the prophet Zechariah is a ministry concerning Christ, showing that in God's recovery, Christ must have the first place.
[54]  But Zechariah not only prophesies concerning Christ in the present, but also about Christ in the future.
[55]  We need to read Zechariah 13:7: "Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones."
[56]  This is the Word of God, speaking about a man that is His fellow.
[57]  This is the Christ that we see prophesied in Zechariah, the mysterious Christ for the local churches, deeper than the Christ prophesied in Isaiah.
[58]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE ENRICHMENT, STRENGTHENING, PURIFICATION, AND PROTECTION OF GOD'S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: Ezra 7, 8, 9; Neh 1 2
[59]  According to the books of the recovery, the history is like this: First, the return of the captivity was begun.
[60]  When we read the book of Ezra, we see that he did not say much about himself.
[61]  We are not told how he was raised up, but we know that it was the Lord's doing.
[62]  Praise the Lord there are such Ezras, and I have full assurance the Lord is going to bring in more and more Ezras those who are one with God, saturated with God, filled with God, and skillful in the work of God.
[63]  Ezra not only strengthened and enriched the recovery, he also purified it.
[64]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE CITY AS THE ENLARGEMENT OF GOD'S HOUSE Scripture Reading: Neh 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13
[65]  After recovering the building of the temple, there is still the need to build up the city.
[66]  After Peter declared that Christ was the Son of God, he was told that the church would be built.
[67]  We know what Christ is, and in a sense we all know what the church is, but not many are familiar with the city.
[68]  Regardless of how small you are, as long as you are born of Christ, you are a part of Christ.
[69]  LIFE AND HEADSHIP FOR THE HOUSE AND THE CITY
[70]  Christ is life to us, and He has been wrought into us that we may enjoy Him as life.
[71]  The New Testament first tells us that Christ is our life, but eventually it says that Christ is our Head and we are His Body.
[72]  If we only experience Christ as life, yet do not realize Him much as our Head, we only have the church as the house.
[73]  When we realize that Christ is not only our life, but also our Head, then Christ will have the second step of enlargement.
[74]  It is easy for us to realize Christ as life, but it is not so easy for us to realize Christ as the Head.
[75]  In the church if we are only in the life of Christ, but know nothing of the headship of Christ, there may be breaches in the wall.
[76]  We may build up the church as the house in the life of Christ, but to have the church as the city, we must realize the headship of Christ.
[77]  The wall of a city is not only for protection, but also for separation.
