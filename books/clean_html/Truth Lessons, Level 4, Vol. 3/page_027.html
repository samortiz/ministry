<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson and the next we will see that through the experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the believers have the highest standard of morality and virtues.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING THE HIGHEST STANDARD<br />
OF MORALITY AND VIRTUES</h2>
<p>In the New Testament salvation is based on the principle of faith; it has nothing to do with the law. The believers have been saved through faith, not through the keeping of the law. However, after they are saved, they must live a life that has a standard of morality higher than that of the old law. They should not think that, just because God does not deal with them according to the principle of the law but according to the principle of faith, they should not care for the moral commandments of the law. On the contrary, their standard of morality must be far higher than that of the requirements of the law.</p>
<p>When we speak of the highest standard of morality, we are not using the word <em>morality</em> in a traditional way. Rather, we are referring to the highest standard of morality and virtues achieved through the dispensing of the processed Triune God. The highest standard of morality is the standard of life required by God. It is the living of the Lord Jesus Christ, whose life was a composition of God with the divine attributes and man with the human virtues. He lived such a life on earth in which the attributes of God were expressed in the virtues of man. God&rsquo;s intention in His New Testament economy is that all the believers in Christ would become a reproduction of Christ, the God-man, in order to express Him in all the human virtues created by God for man. With the divine attributes of the God-man these virtues are strengthened, enriched, uplifted, and filled.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Having Been Created in Christ Jesus<br />
for Good Works, Which God Prepared Beforehand<br />
in Order That They Would Walk in Them</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s eyes the church, the masterpiece of God&rsquo;s work, is the highest poetry (Eph. 2:10), expressing God&rsquo;s infinite wisdom and divine design. This masterpiece is an absolutely new item in the universe; it is something newly originated by God. As the believers, we compose God&rsquo;s masterpiece and are absolutely new because we are the mingling of God and man. As God&rsquo;s masterpiece, we have been created &ldquo;for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them&rdquo; (v. 10). However, the good works for which God created us are not the good things according to our general natural concept but the definite good things that God preplanned and ordained for us to walk in. These good things include doing His will, living the church life, and bearing the testimony of Jesus.</p>
