These four stations are Psalm 2, Psalm 8, Psalm 16, and Psalms 22&#151;24. Now we have come to the final part of Book One of the Psalms, Psalms 25&#151;41. The general title of Psalms 25&#151;41 is "The Mixed Expressions of the Psalmist's Sentiment in His Enjoyment of God in God's House." We need to consider the meaning of the word sentiment. A person's sentiment is the condition of his inward situation. When David was writing these psalms, there was a certain inward situation with him. He wrote these psalms according to an "inward scenery."</P><P>David was not a superficial, shallow person. He was extremely thoughtful. When he was writing these psalms, there was much feeling, thought, and consideration within him. Psalms 25&#151;41 are David's mixed expressions of his inward sentiment, his inward situation, his inward scenery, in his enjoyment of God in God's house. Expressions are outward; sentiment is inward. In David's enjoyment of God in God's house, he had many inward feelings and thoughts, so he expressed them.</P><P>These seventeen psalms contain many mixed expressions. Some are spiritual, some are divine, some are very natural, and some should be condemned. Some of his expressions should be put under our feet, whereas others should be uplifted to the uttermost. The expressions in these psalms are either divine, good, or bad. We need the proper discernment concerning whether these expressions belong to the tree of life or to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. IN SEEKING GOD'S GUIDANCE AND TEACHING<br>IN HIS WAYS AND PATHS</H2><P>In Psalm 25, David expressed his sentiment in seeking God's guidance and teaching in His ways and paths. A way is a main road, and a path is a lane or a trail, a small road. In the divine things of God, in His divine revelation, there are ways, main roads, and there are paths. We need to seek God's guidance and teaching in His ways and in His paths.</P>
