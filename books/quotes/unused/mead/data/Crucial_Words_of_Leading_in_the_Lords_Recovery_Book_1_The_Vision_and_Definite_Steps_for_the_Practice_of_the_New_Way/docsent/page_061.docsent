   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING LIVING IN TEACHING TRUTH LESSONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Recently I took some time to observe the teaching of the truth classes in hall one in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, the brothers took my word and stayed away from free expounding, keeping themselves instead to teaching the text.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the other hand, as the brothers have followed my words, they have become somewhat robotic ; they no longer act according to the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If asked why they are doing what they are doing, they may say, Brother Lee told us so.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I would like to point out the shortages here according to my observation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, your spirit is not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When you are teaching, you are not exercising your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are two ways to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One way is the institutional teaching, the teaching in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this case the teacher reads or teaches, and the students are occasionally asked to read.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This kind of teaching does not require the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The other kind of teaching is the teaching in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This requires the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we do not exercise our spirit, we will turn Truth Lessons into a school textbook.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If neither the teacher nor the students exercise their spirit while reading Truth Lessons, the result will be a killing meeting where people come merely to warm the pews and sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Throughout all these years, we have been taught that our meeting is a matter of the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Any time we meet, we must stir up our spirit and exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not a matter of being loud or soft.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a matter of exercising the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we exercise our spirit, we can read in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do not exercise our spirit, we will read in a mechanical way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have pointed out that there are many ways to read Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can read them with life, with repetition, with emphasis, with prayer, with explanation, and with singing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, no matter how we read them, the key is to exercise the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In our reading we should not be legal but flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While we read, we can ask questions to emphasize the main points.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As I have said before, in order for a chicken to live, it needs feathers, skin, and bones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The feathers are worthless, but without the feathers the chicken cannot exist.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the same way today, while we are serving others, we must remove the feathers and the skin from the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once in a while we may also serve the bones, but the main thing we serve others is the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we ask questions, we should not concentrate on the feathers or skin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, we should give others the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to know what the meat and the feathers are.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If our questions are on the main points, we can ask ten questions, and the time will still be well spent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may take the outline of the Old Testament as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have no intention to teach the brothers and sisters history.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yet most of the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament are a record of history.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without history, the Old Testament would be like a chicken without bones, feathers, and skin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, if someone merely focuses on the history when reading the Old Testament, he will be lost, unable to understand what he is reading.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason, in writing Truth Lessons, I gave a general sketch of the history of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The main points, however, are the spiritual matters related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have the discernment, we will spontaneously pick up the meat, that is, the spiritual points and the points related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We will not read the lessons in a dead or legal way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not merely run through a lesson in a nondescript way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To do so is to take the way of classroom teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such reading does not differentiate the meat from the bones and feathers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In reading, we must separate the bones, feathers, and skin from the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we come to the important points, we need to read with emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we do this, the meeting will be living, and the message will be nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In editing the materials, I have purposely left out many bones, skin, and feathers and have kept the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For example, with the twelve books of the Minor Prophets, the main points are the meaning of the names of the prophets and their prophecies, especially their prophecies concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The main purpose of the material is to show everyone that all the prophets in the Old Testament spoke of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although I included the background, history, and dates related to these prophets and their spiritual significances in the lessons, the goal of the lessons is to show the reader a picture of the entire chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we teach, we need to bring out these main points.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The thing that bothers me the most is that none of us have presented these main points in a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It defeats the whole purpose of teaching Truth Lessons .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At the end of each lesson there is a summary and some questions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the most crucial portion of the lesson and contains the real significance of the entire lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All the teachers should first study the summary and ponder the questions.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then they will know the main points.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In teaching, we should impart the main points into others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should speak, ask questions, and answer with our spirit, and we should read these portions with repetition and emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do this, in one hour we will give the attendants an impression of the main points concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>First Timothy 3:2 says that one of the qualifications of an elder is to be apt to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I hope that every elder would participate in the teaching of the truth lessons on the Lord s Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The elders should not excuse themselves from this responsibility simply because others can teach better than they can.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They must be teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>First Peter 5:3 indicates that the elders must take the lead in everything, becoming patterns of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If the elders do not take the lead in teaching but assign this responsibility to others, they are acting contrary to God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even if others can do a better job of teaching, they should still take the lead in teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>By doing this, the elders will be forced to learn the truth and speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In principle, the elders should know more of the truth than the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today in practicing the new way, we need every saint to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If the elders only encourage others to speak, yet they themselves do not speak, they are left without any excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>No elder in the Lord s recovery should be an honorary elder.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Every elder should be a practical and useful elder.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The first responsibility of an elder is to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the greatest need of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we read the Bible carefully, we will find that there is not much mention of the affairs that the elders should handle.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This proves that the scriptural requirement concerning the elders lies in teaching, supplying life, shepherding and care, becoming patterns of the flock, and not so much in the arrangement of affairs or the management and organization of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Strictly speaking, once the church life is built up in the saints homes, there will not be much need for the arrangement of affairs and organization.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>At that time the elders should take the lead even more in learning the truth, learning to speak, and teaching the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the grace that the Lord has reserved for the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You need to be a few steps ahead of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You should know the truth a little more than the saints so that you can fulfill your responsibility in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The foremost requirement of the elders is to be apt to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Never surrender such responsibility of teaching to other brothers and act merely as an overseer.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Even if others are more gifted, the elders should still take the lead in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>By taking the initiative and participating, they induce others to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>By this practice a good foundation will be established.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The Chinese have a saying, Champions are found among the students, not among the teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Sixty years ago there was a famous opera singer in Chinese drama; everyone knew him, but no one knew who his teacher was.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I am not a champion, but I truly hope that everyone taught by me would become a champion.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If you learn and put into practice what I have taught you, I believe you will do a better and more excellent job of teaching than I can.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If you do this, the teaching of the truth lessons will be living, with much spirit, having a good grasp of the main points, and with much supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In Chinese cooking, one famous dish is plain steamed fish.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The whole fish is steamed, and the original taste of the fish, including the head, the fins, the tail, and even the bones, is retained in the cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The fish is very tasty and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Because Westerners do not like the bones in fish, they usually cut the fish into fillets and throw away the head, the fins, the tail, and the bones.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>However, the taste is sometimes lost in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Today we are not here to serve merely the fish fillet ; we must learn to cook our plain steamed fish.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If we teach the truth lessons in this way, we will make them tasty and appealing.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>A FINAL WORD</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The burden in this message is first to bring the church to the homes, and second to bring the saints into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If we can achieve these two points, the new way will succeed, the gospelization of Taiwan will be realized, and there will be a bright future in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Therefore, we need to give our all to do these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We must build up the home meetings, and we must teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I hope that we will pray much before the Lord for these two matters.</S>
