<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The God-seekers, Illustrated by the Psalmists</H2><P>The second kind is the God-seekers, illustrated by the psalmists, especially by the writer of Psalm 119.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Seeking God</H2><P>"Blessed are those who keep His testimonies,/Who seek Him with all their heart" (v. 2). The writer of this psalm was one who sought God with his whole heart.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Loving His Name and Remembering It</H2><P>Verse 132 says, "Turn to me, and have compassion on me, /As is Your custom with those who love Your name." This verse indicates that the psalmist loved God's name. Verse 55 says, "I have remembered Your name in the night, O Jehovah,/And have kept Your law." When the psalmist awoke during the night, he remembered God's name. May we all love God's name and remember it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Entreating His Countenance</H2><P>The psalmist also entreated God's countenance (v. 58). To seek a person's countenance, his face, is actually to seek his favor. If we seek God's countenance, we will receive bounty. Often little children will earnestly seek the face of their mother. To them nothing is more precious than beholding the face of their mother. We also should seek God in such an intimate way. If we seek God in this way, we will not regard the law as letters but as a portrait of God which bears His countenance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Asking for His Face to Shine upon Them</H2><P>"Cause Your face to shine on Your servant,/And teach me Your statutes" (v. 135). Here we see that the psalmist lovingly sought God in an intimate way, even asking Him to cause His face to shine upon him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Walking in His Presence</H2><P>"I have kept Your precepts and Your testimonies,/For all my ways are before You" (v. 168). This indicates that the psalmist walked in God's presence.</P>
