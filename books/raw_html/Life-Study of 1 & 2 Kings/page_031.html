<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE REIGN OF SOLOMON</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(5)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Kings 9&#151;11</H1><P>We, the believers in Christ, are the greatest people in the universe. We have received God into us, and He is continuously working Himself into our constitution to make us God in life and in nature (but not in the Godhead). According to Romans 5:17, we reign in the life which we have received. To be today's overcomers we must reign as kings in life. If we do not, we will lose the top portion of the enjoyment of Christ and will be chastised by the Lord in the coming age. We all have to mature sooner or later. If we mature in this age, we will reign as kings in life in this age and will be the co-kings with Christ in the next age to rule over the nations. We need to keep this in mind as we consider what is revealed in 1 Kings 9&#151;11 regarding the reign of Solomon.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIII. THE HIGHEST PEAK<br>OF SOLOMON'S GLORY AMONG THE NATIONS</H2><P>First Kings 9 and 10 show us the highest peak of Solomon's glory among the nations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah Accepting Solomon's Prayer</H2><P>Jehovah accepted Solomon's prayer and promised him that He would establish his throne forever (9:1-9). Here we see that it was God who made Solomon prosperous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Solomon's Alliance with Hiram<br>Being Established in Their Mutual Giving of Gifts</H2><P>Solomon's alliance with Hiram was established in their mutual giving of gifts to each other (vv. 10-14). This was a great strengthening and help from the human side. Thus, in addition to the strengthening on the divine side, there was the strengthening on the human side.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Solomon Building Further Cities,<br>Levying the Canaanites as Forced Labor,<br>and Making the Children of Israel<br>Men of War, Servants, Officers, and Captains</H2><P>Solomon built further cities, levying the Canaanites as forced labor, and he made the children of Israel men of war, his servants, his officers, his captains, and his officers over his chariots and his horsemen (vv. 15-24).</P>
