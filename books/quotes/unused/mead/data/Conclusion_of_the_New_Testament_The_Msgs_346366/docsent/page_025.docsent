   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 Having Been Made Full in Him</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Greek word translated full in verse 10 implies completion, perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because all the fullness dwells in Him, after we have been put into Christ 1 Cor 1:30 , we are made full, filled up, with all the divine riches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, we need no other source.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Christ we lack nothing, for in Him we have been perfected and completed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is no reason for us to turn to anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because all the fullness of the Godhead is in Christ and because we have been placed in Him, we have been made full in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The New Testament reveals clearly that all those who believe in Christ have been put into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we are identified with Him and one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The result is that all that He is and all that He has belongs to us, and all that He has experienced is our history.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We inherit all that Christ has experienced and passed through.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, because we are one with Him, we partake of all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We the believers are members of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have been put into Him, identified with Him, and joined to Him as our Husband Col 1:28; Rom 7:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, we are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All that He has passed through is now our history, and all that He has obtained and attained is our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are in such a Christ, and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have been placed into Him, we are one with Him, and we receive all that He is and has.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although some Christians have a doctrinal knowledge of this, a mere mental understanding of our union with Christ is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to exercise faith in order to partake of all that is ours in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not consider ourselves poor, just as a poor woman who has married a rich man should no longer think of herself as poor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though she may feel poor, she must practice applying the fact that the riches of her husband belong to her.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In like manner, because we are one with Christ, we should not regard ourselves as in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To the contrary, we need to have a full realization of what we have in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In their prayers, some Christians like to declare how poor, pitiful, and low they are.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This kind of prayer is without faith or assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to believe with full assurance that we are one with the rich, all-inclusive Christ, with the One who is the embodiment of all the fullness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we realize this with full assurance, we will never consider ourselves poor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not believe our feelings about ourselves but look away to Christ Heb 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to exercise our faith to realize what He is, what He has passed through, what He has obtained and attained, and where He is today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since He is in the third heaven and we are one with Him, we also are in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have been placed into the Christ who is unsearchably rich.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Christ we do not lack anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not talk about how much we lack.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because we are in Christ, we lack nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Him is the fullness, the perfection, the completion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, He Himself is the fullness, perfection, and completion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because we are in Him, we also are complete and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are those who possess the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Ephesians 3:8 Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are more than billionaires because the riches we have are greater than can be counted.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We simply have no idea what vast riches we possess in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Often we have prayed: Lord, I am poor and pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But we need to pray in this way: Lord, I thank You that I am rich, complete, and full.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Lord Jesus, because I am in You, I am short of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should tell the Lord, the angels, and even the demons that we are richer than any earthly billionaire because we are in the Christ whose riches are unsearchable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we are rooted in Christ as the soil, the first thing to take place is that we are made full in Him; we are filled with all the divine riches to become His expression vv.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>8, 17, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Christ as the soil we are filled, completed, perfected, satisfied, and thoroughly supplied; we do not lack anything cf.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ as the soil is the history and mystery of God with all the riches of His person and processes Col 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ as the soil is the Head of all rule and authority v. 10 . In Christ as the soil there is an element with the killing power which puts the flesh to death v. 11 , an element which causes us to be buried v. 12a , an element which causes us to be raised up v. 12b , an element which vivifies us v. 13 , an element which wipes out the handwriting in ordinances v. 14 , and an element which is victorious over the evil spirits in the atmosphere v. 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ as the soil is the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since Christ is the good land in which we have been rooted, we have been rooted in this fullness; in it we have been made full, complete, and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have no need whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Having been planted into this fullness, we should simply absorb nourishment from it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As we do so, we will find that we have no lack.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Before we were rooted in Christ as the good land, we did not have anything positive.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Instead, we were involved with the flesh, the ordinances, and the power of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But now that we have been rooted in the good land, the fullness has become ours, and we are supplied with every positive thing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this all-inclusive and extensive fullness, we have everything: God, an uplifted humanity, divine attributes, and human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Because this fullness is all-inclusive, it accomplishes everything for us, it fully satisfies and supplies us, and it makes us full, perfect, and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How rich is the soil in which we have been rooted!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It supplies us with everything, and we have no lack.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have the all-inclusive, inexhaustible fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this universe there is such a thing that Paul calls the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This fullness dwells in Christ bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In Him, the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, we are made full.</S>
