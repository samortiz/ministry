   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. After Their Outward Likeness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man was created not only in the inward image of the Triune God but also after Their outward likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This likeness is the form of God's being Phil 2:6 , the expression of the essence and nature of God's person Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ existed in the form of God, that is, in the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When He became a man, He laid aside the likeness of God and took the form of a slave Phil 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He laid aside the form of God, but He did not lay aside the essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ laid aside the outward likeness, the form of God's being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The form of God's being is the expression of the essence and nature of God's person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hebrews 1:3 says, "Who Christ , being the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance..."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The essence of God is something within God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This essence needs an outward expression, an impress, like the impress of a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is the impress, the outward form, of God's being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>D. As the Highest of the Created Life</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man was created as the highest of the created life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's creation is in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to Genesis 1, the life God created was of three categories: plant life, animal life, and human life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first thing created on this earth by God through His Spirit was the plant life, including the grass, the trees, and the flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the life without any consciousness, the lowest form of created life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After the plant life, God created the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This life is on a higher level and is stronger than the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The animal life has consciousness, but the plant life does not.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even the smallest animals, such as the ants, are very conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, God's creation reached the highest level with the creation of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The human life has the highest consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although many of the animals are very clever and skillful, none of these animals can speak human language.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet human beings have the ability to learn to speak any kind of human language.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If an animal such as Balaam's donkey Num 22:27-30 speaks human language, that is a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet man can speak many different languages.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is an indication that man's life is the highest among the created lives.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>E. After God's Kind</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man as the highest of created life was created after God's kind Gen 1:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Genesis 1 tells us that all the plants were created after their kind vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today, if you plant a peach tree, it will produce peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the same way, if you plant an almond tree, it will produce almonds, not bananas.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is the same with the animal life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>21, 24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Crabs in the water produce other crabs after their kind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Crabs cannot produce turtles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Crabs are in one family, and plants are in another family.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Mankind, however, is after God's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When two trees are grafted together, they must be very similar or they cannot grow together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, a branch from a peach tree cannot be grafted into an apple tree.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, a branch from a peach tree of one variety can grow together with a peach tree of a different variety.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The two can grow together because they are of the same kind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the same way, we can be grafted into God Rom 11:17-24 and grow together with Him 6:5 because we and God are of the same kind.</S>
