I thank you very much for your kindness, but there are a few things that I must explain:</p><p>(1) What is the little flock? Please read Luke 12:32. It says, "Do not be afraid, little flock, because your Father has been well pleased to give you the kingdom." Can you oppose this little flock? The term "little flock" refers to all the saved ones who believe in the Lord's name at all times and places. If you oppose the little flock, you are opposing yourself and myself unless we are not saved. We who meet in the meeting place at 321 East Street Road are not called the little flock. We are called "The meeting place of those who meet in the Lord's name in Hangchow."</p><p>Outsiders call us "The Little Flock" because the hymnal we use is called Little Flock Hymnal. This really is not our name, because we do not have a name. We cannot take this broad name. If we have a name, we have become a denomination.</p><p>(2) What is the church? Ephesians 1:22-23 says, "The church, which is His Body." Ephesians 4:4 also says, "One Body." Therefore, the church includes all the saved ones who believe in the Lord's name in all times and places. Please look at 1 Timothy 3:15 also. The church is called "the house of God."</p><p>Then what is not the church? The church is not a chapel, nor is it a youth group, nor a sect or denomination. Every saved believer in the Lord's name is a member of Christ. The members are produced naturally; they cannot join anything. Therefore, I "meet in the Lord's name" on East Street Road. We have seen that according to the Bible there should not be "denominational" differentiation. Having denominations is a sin. I left Sze Cheng Chapel. I did not leave the church; I only left a denomination. My leaving of the denomination was not because of individual preference but because of obeying the teachings of the Bible.</p><p>(3) In the Bible, the word sanctified in its positional aspect means that something is separated unto God. Please read the section beginning with Matthew 23:17, 1 Timothy 4:4-5, and John 17:19. In the Bible, holy and common are opposites. Holy and sinful are not opposites. Please read Ezekiel 44:23. The brothers and sisters who meet in the Lord's name do not all have a great knowledge of the Bible, nor have we all attained a high level of spirituality. However, we can say that everyone among us is saved. The level of salvation, however, varies. Some have been saved for two months, some for six months, some for a year, and some have just been newly saved. Our greatest work every week is to preach the gospel. Preaching the gospel is to bring unsaved ones in through the door of salvation. Many people misunderstand us and think that we only are trying to pull people out of the denominations. That is a great mistake, but it was also my previous concept.</p><p>(4) The organization of the church: The organization of the church is spontaneous just as the organization of a body is spontaneous.</p><p>The present chapels and denominations are not the church, so they need man's organization. Because there are many unsaved, unregenerated, and worldly ones in the denominations, they need man's organization.</p><p>If you come to Hangchow, I will welcome you very much. However, it is best if we do not discuss this matter because the light which we have individually received is different. You cannot understand the truth of leaving the denominations in your heart without "God's enlightenment." This is my answer to you. Greetings!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Jan Ch'i Yu<br />July 30, 1934</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
