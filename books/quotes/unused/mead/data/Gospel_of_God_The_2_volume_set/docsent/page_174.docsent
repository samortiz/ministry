   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Bible says that we should not grieve the Holy Spirit Eph 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Grief is the expression of love; anger is the expression of hate.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Wherever there is hate, there is anger.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Wherever there is love, there is grief.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Please remember that both anger and grief come from mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In both cases they are caused by mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If there is love, mistakes will result in grief.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If there is hate, mistakes will result in anger.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you love a person, you will grieve for his mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you hate a person, you will be angry about his mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both are caused by the same thing mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the results are different.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here, it is not anger, but grief.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Word does not say not to anger the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, it says not to grieve the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is not upon us, but in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When He sees our failure, He grieves within us; He will not go away.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why will He not go away?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is because He is a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a seal, He will be in us until the day of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we read the Word of God, we will not be able to deny this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Old Testament, Psalm 51 records a very precious prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There David prayed that the Lord would not take His Spirit of holiness from him v. 11 . But in the New Testament, no believer can pray this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who do not know the Bible may pray that God would not take the Holy Spirit from them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But those who know the Word of God know that the Holy Spirit can only be grieved within us; He will not go away.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am not saying that it is all right for Christians to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am saying that at the time that we were saved, the Holy Spirit entered into us to be our seal.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This fact has nothing to do with our weakness or our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The two are entirely different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we perish, who really suffers?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I lose a hymn book, of course, the hymn book suffers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the first one to suffer is me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have spent the effort to obtain the hymn book.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have paid the price and the money to obtain it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, I am the one who suffers the most.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How did God gain us?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We were dead in sin and fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God caused His Son to die for us and shed His blood to redeem us with a great price.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not think that if we lose our salvation only we have lost it and only we have suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Remember that we have been purchased by God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we lose our salvation, God will also lose something.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have been purchased by His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why does God preserve us?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God preserves us for His own sake.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are lost, the One who suffers is not us, but God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The biggest problem today is that we do not believe how important we are in God's hands.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Man finds it difficult to believe that God loves him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He finds it difficult to believe that God wants him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He always thinks that he is dispensable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God has given up His Son for our sake and has sent His Son into the world to pass through all the sufferings for our sake.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was crucified on the cross for the purpose of gaining us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If He does not care, then who would care?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If I do not safeguard my hymn book, would my hymn book keep track of itself?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Ephesians 1:13 says that the Holy Spirit is in us as a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Following this, verse 14 tells us that the Holy Spirit comes to be the seal because we are God's acquired possession.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, we can tell the entire world that we are God's possession.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not a question of our losing or not losing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is a question of God's losing or not losing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not we who are keeping watch.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not have to exhaust our mind over this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The whole work is His.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If it were not, why would He send His only begotten Son to the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If He has exerted great effort and paid a great price to send His Son to the cross, He must exert greater effort and pay a greater price to keep us from being lost.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Suppose we have a most precious and expensive diamond ring, a very precious pearl, or an expensive gem.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However much we spent to acquire it, we will spend the same amount to preserve it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we bought it for ten thousand dollars, we would not lose it easily; we would surely guard it closely.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have to realize that we have been purchased by God with the greatest price.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We were saved by the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Son of God is greater than the entire world and the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do not think that God does not care for us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God treats us in the same way that we treat our own treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It was the good shepherd that sought out the sheep Luke 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It was not the sheep that sought out the good shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord Jesus said that one day He would die for even one of His lost ones.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is not the sheep's business.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is the good shepherd who died for the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Before God, we are those who have been purchased by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we are lost, God is the One who will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore, we must remember that since we have the Holy Spirit as a seal, there is no possibility for us to be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Can the grace which God gives to man be preserved by man?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If it were preserved by man, we would have lost it long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Not only would we have lost it, even Peter and Paul would have lost it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We have to realize that God has already set us aside completely.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Everything is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God alone has saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God alone is preserving us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>May God show us clearly how long our salvation lasts, so that we can remove all fleshly thoughts and accept His thoughts.</S>
