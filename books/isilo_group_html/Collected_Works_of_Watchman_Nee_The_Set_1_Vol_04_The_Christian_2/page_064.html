But the total significance of these yokes is an alliance with man for the purpose of pursuing after a common goal. Social ties, marital relationships, and partnerships in business are all examples of yokes. However, we must not forget that as far as yokes are concerned the most serious consideration is in relationship to the church itself. At present there are many methods of organization which are trying their best to mingle the church with the world. These methods have no trace of life but are rather formalities. A man can call himself a member of Christ and a child of God just by the ritual of baptism. The saved ones and the unsaved ones can equally come to the Lord's table to share in the Lord's supper. Under this kind of organization it is impossible to be separated from the world. The believers are in the church, and the world is also in the church. How can there be the separation? Charitable works, theological teachings, and all kinds of ecclesiastical ceremonies cannot make the many intruders and imposters in the church the children of God. Yet there are many who do not see what kind of yoke they are bearing in the church!</P><P>In some countries there are even state churches. Through one bill of parliament, a whole nation can become Christians. Some parents through their confession in Christianity make all their offspring Christians as well and their households Christian households. You can give a person a compromising title, yet this person is dead. Such a one becomes a performer and a hypocrite only because you have forced upon him the title of a Christian. You can hide his real condition from him, deceiving him and bribing him, yet in eternity he will wake up. But what a pity when such a one does wake up only to find himself in the midst of a boundless darkness! The reason for this is that you have borne the same yoke with him and have led him into deception and into the place of wailing and gnashing of teeth. If you would have made a separation earlier, you may have stirred up his conscience, and he may not have fallen into the condition that he is in.</P><P>It is unavoidable for the Judaistic churches to have a lot of mixture (cf. the section on Smyrna). There, no one has the solid assurance, and everyone is on probation, hoping to be saved. If the church is not composed of a group of saved ones, having only a method of salvation, it will be difficult to have the same yoke. According to the present prevailing thought, a man joins the church in hope of being saved. As such, it is hard to avoid seeing the church becoming an institution of saints and sinners combined. When man does not believe in the teaching of the assurance of salvation, such a condition is unavoidable.</P><P>Balaam was a hired prophet. He prophesied only for money. How numerous are the students of Balaam among today's churches! One argues that only with money can he build churches, buy Bibles, and support preachers. Yet Pentecost can never be purchased with money, and the millennium is never built on earth with money! Formerly, Balak hired Balaam to work. Now the church is seeking for the world to contribute money to pay for the preachers. Some worldly people have not even put on a Christian appearance, yet the church has already come to them for contributions. The church tells those who have not consecrated themselves to the Lord to consecrate their money! To them, as long as money is put to the right use, it does not matter by what method the money is secured. With money one can conduct charitable works and build schools and hospitals. With money one can buy Bibles and send preachers to evangelize the faraway lands. With money one can perform thousands of good works. "Why then should we worry where the money comes from? If the goal is right, why should we be worried about the means? Can one still hope to find miracles in the twentieth century?"</P><P>What can be the result of this plea for men to help the church and for the children of Satan to use their material riches to help a work that supposedly will destroy the work of Satan? Can we tell the world its true condition with a Bible that is printed with their money? Can we prove to them that before God everyone is a sinner and will perish? Can we tell them that they are the children of the devil? Can we tell them that no flesh can please God? If we want money from the world, then we must first change our gospel and auction our truth! The world does not have to give its money. It will certainly not give money to something that will be used to condemn itself. Once Balaam becomes our prophet, we cannot be too "square" anymore. At least, we have to be toned down a little and should be joined to the world. "Let the world come in, or else you cannot help it! There should be nice buildings, comfortable chairs, beautiful music, and soothing teachings. Since we cannot expect them to come up to our standard, we should lower ourselves to their level. How can we arouse their attention and gain their heart if there are no social gatherings, entertainment clubs, and other various colorful get-togethers?" Frankly speaking, if we want the world's help on the one hand, and try to preach the truth on the other hand, the world will turn around and say to us: "You have exhorted us to give money and to store up riches in heaven, yet you are telling us that we cannot go into heaven! What is this?" Readers, am I being too much? Is it not true that all faithful children of the Lord do have this kind of feeling? Actually, there is no word that can adequately describe the degradation of the works of the nominal Christians. I wish I could be like Jeremiah, with tears like a fountain, weeping day and night for those who are God's people in name! What a pity that day by day the church has sunken to a level below that of the world while boasting that the world has risen to her own level!</P><P>If we consider further the preaching work up until today, we have to admit that the teaching of Balaam has indeed gained many followers. Money is the power behind the preaching, and remuneration is the condition for work. The first question asked in the work is how much salary one will receive. If there is no money, the workers will go away. Those who pay more can expect a greater leader. Those poor villages that cannot afford much can never have a teacher. The rich church with a deep pocket has the biggest hope of getting the ones it admires. The poor church, in spite of its godliness and faith and riches before God, considers itself inferior to others and dares not invite those it admires. With money there is the power of choice. With little money there is no choice but to accept what is assigned. What man desires is a successful preacher. Of course, success here is measured with respect to the world. But then sometimes, God in His mercy will keep a church from having a Balaam to execute the teaching of Balaam. It is a fact that sometimes a godly preacher in a church rife with the teaching of Balaam will find himself restricted from doing anything. If he tries to do anything, he will be discharged. Godliness is not something that man likes, and as such it will never be welcomed by man. If the world desires godliness, it will not be the world anymore. Hence, there are few who remember to preach to the poor!</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 04: The Christian (2) &nbsp; pg 64</div><br></body></html>
