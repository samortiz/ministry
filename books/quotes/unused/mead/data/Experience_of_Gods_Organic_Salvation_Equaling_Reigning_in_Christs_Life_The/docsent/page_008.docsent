   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God sanctifies us that we may have His holy nature; this is the establishing of God s organic salvation Rom 6:19, 22; 15:16; 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. That We May Be Established</S>

   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God sanctifies us that we may be established in God s holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s sanctifying us is a very important and particular item in God s organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not only is God Himself holy, but He also wants to make us holy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, He wants to make us the holy city, New Jerusalem.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, in His organic salvation God s intention is to constitute us with His holy nature that we may become the Body of Christ and ultimately be manifested as an established, holy city, New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His Complete Salvation</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>and in Our Disposition Organically</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We were created by God for Himself, but due to our fall and separation from God we were lost and became common in our position and disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, in His complete salvation God sanctifies us in our position judicially and in our disposition organically.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The judicial, positional sanctification is accomplished through the redeeming blood of Christ Heb 13:12; 10:29; 1 Cor 1:2; Rom 1:7; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Matt 23:17 .</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s sanctification is of two aspects: the judicial aspect and the organic aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This causes us to be established in God s holy nature and thereby be made holy unto God Eph 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To thus be made holy unto God is to become the New Jerusalem, the holy city, which is absolutely sanctified unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. That We May Be Established</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>in God s Organic Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God not only regenerates and renews us but also sanctifies us that we may be established in His organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With the Element of Christ s Resurrection Life</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The sanctification in God s organic salvation is carried out by the Holy Spirit with the element of Christ s resurrection life to sanctify us in our disposition Rom 15:16 that our natural disposition, which is crooked, perverted, and full of peculiarities, may be sanctified by God s holy nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For Our Entire Being to Be Wholly Sanctified</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a dispositional sanctification is from our spirit, through our soul, and unto our body, so that our entire being can be wholly sanctified 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not a partial sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We human beings are of three parts: spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God sanctifies us, first, by taking possession of our spirit through regeneration; second, by spreading Himself as the life-giving Spirit from our spirit into our soul to saturate and transform our soul; and, last, by enlivening our mortal body through our soul and transfiguring our body by His life power, conforming it to the body of Christ s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, our entire being, including our spirit, soul, and body, is wholly sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>3.</S>
