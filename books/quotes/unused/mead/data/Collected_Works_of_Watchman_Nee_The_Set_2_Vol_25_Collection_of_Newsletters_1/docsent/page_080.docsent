   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Four</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Greetings to my brother Hsi Ling:</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was very happy to receive your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I felt very bad about mentioning the work in Tsingtao.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I arrived in Tsingtao at the end of last year, and I could not stay for very long because the Chinese New Year was approaching, so I had to rush home.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I was in the meeting in Shanghai, I was not very clear about the matter of being called.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Nee also mentioned the conditions and principles for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I suddenly realized my previous failures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the past my work was really "disjointed" and did not have Christ as its center.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I felt very ashamed before the Lord and dared not move hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have decided not to be a co-worker in the formal sense.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since returning home, I have been sick much and have had many frustrations I wrote Brother Nee once and mentioned it to him .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My coming to stay in Chefoo has definitely been with the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As for the work in Tsingtao, I can only pray for it much in my prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord willing, I can go and see a little.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I dare not decide yet if I will go or not.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The matter of going to Tsingtao occupies a great place in my heart and has become a serious issue to me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now I am dealing with the Lord about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If I can go to Tsingtao, I will definitely let the brothers know.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But in the matter of the work preaching , if I put it aside, it seems to be a case of stubbornness and hard-heartedness on my part.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Please pray much for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>May the Lord cause us to walk in His will, so the whips and rods of discipline do not come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May the Lord bless your way with grace!</S>
