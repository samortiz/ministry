   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REALITY OF THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens, as the reality of the church life Rom 14:17 , is revealed in Matthew 5 through 7.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 3:5 reveals that regeneration is our entrance into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To enter into the kingdom of God requires regeneration as a new beginning of our life John 3:3, 5 , but to "enter into the kingdom of the heavens" demands surpassing righteousness in our living after we have been regenerated Matt 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Matthew 5 through 7 shows us the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE APPEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>OF THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is revealed in the parables of the tares, of the mustard seed, and of the leaven in Matthew 13:24-42.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is Christendom, which is filled with false things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The tares are the nominal, false believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are many such "believers" in Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Leaven in the Scripture signifies evil things 1 Cor 5:6.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>8 and evil doctrines Matt 16:6, 11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters have been mixed with the teachings concerning Christ to leaven the whole of Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christmas is an example of this leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Originally December 25 was the day the ancient Romans celebrated the birth of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With the spread of the Catholic Church, she assimilated this ancient festival because she had taken in thousands of unbelievers who still wanted to celebrate the birthday of their god.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To accommodate them, the Catholic Church took December 25 to be the birthday of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the source of the leaven of Christmas.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christmas actually has nothing to do with Christ or the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Lord's recovery we have only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not have "endom."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The "endom" is something added to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the word Christmas, the word "mas" is the "endom," the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Easter is another example of leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As Christians we thank the Lord for His resurrection, but Easter, a "Christian holiday" of pagan origin and filled with pagan practices, is leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With the pope and the cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church we can also see Christendom, the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not want to be in the appearance; we want to be in the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today, we will enjoy its manifestation in the future.</S>
