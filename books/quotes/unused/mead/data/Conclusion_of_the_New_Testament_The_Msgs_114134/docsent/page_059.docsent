   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 Through the Death of God s Son</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>as the Propitiation for the Believers Sins,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>with the Blood of His Cross</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul in Romans 5:10 tells us that we were reconciled through the death of God s Son, and in Colossians 1:20 we see that this reconciliation was through the blood of His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We were reconciled to God in the first step through the death of God s Son as the propitiation for the believers sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First John 2:2 says, He is a propitiation concerning our sins, and not concerning ours only, but also concerning the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus Christ offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins Heb 9:28 , not only for our redemption but also for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Him as our Substitute, through His vicarious death, God is satisfied and appeased.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, Christ is the propitiation between God and us 1 John 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hebrews 2:17 tells us that Christ made propitiation for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus made propitiation for our sins to appease God s righteousness and thereby to reconcile us to God by satisfying the demand of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since Christ made propitiation for our sins, 1 Corinthians 15:3 says plainly, Christ died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through His death, with the shedding of His blood on the cross, we have been reconciled to God in position.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The problem of being an enemy is even more serious than the problem that necessitates propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sinners need propitiation; enemies need reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Propitiation mainly deals with sins, whereas reconciliation deals with enmity as well as sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, reconciliation includes propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 5 tells us that before we were saved we were both sinners and enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As sinners we needed propitiation, and as enemies we needed reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Herein lies the difference between propitiation and reconciliation: propitiation is for sins; reconciliation is both for sins and enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Reconciliation is based on Christ s redemption Rom 5:10, 11 and was accomplished through God s justification 2 Cor 5:18-19; Rom 5:1, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, reconciliation is the issue of redemption with justification.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>4 Having Peace toward God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As those who have been reconciled to God through the death of His Son, we have peace toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Reconciliation with justification issues in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ Rom 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Having reconciled us to God, Christ has made peace through the blood of His cross Col 1:20b .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>5 To Be Saved in the Life of God s Son</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have been reconciled to God in the first step in order to be saved in the life of God s Son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life Rom 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Reconciliation to God through Christ in the first step has been accomplished already, but to be saved in Christ s life from so many negative things is still a daily matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yes, we have been forgiven, freed, washed, sanctified, justified, and reconciled to God in the first step.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, there are still many things from which we need to be saved in Christ s life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the one hand, we have been reconciled to God; on the other hand, we still need to be saved in the life of God s Son.</S>
