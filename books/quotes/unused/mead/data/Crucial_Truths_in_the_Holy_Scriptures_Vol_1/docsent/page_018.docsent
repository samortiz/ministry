   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE REPENTANCE AND BELIEVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CONDITIONS FOR OBTAINING SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we come to the matters of repentance and believing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Repentance and believing are the conditions for man to obtain salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order for man to obtain God s salvation, he must repent and believe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God accomplished redemption for man through Christ and will apply Christ s accomplished redemption to man through the Holy Spirit because of His great love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, if man does not repent and believe, redemption cannot become salvation to him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man must repent and believe in order for God s redemption to become salvation to him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>REPENTANCE The Meaning of Repentance</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the original language in the Bible, repentance is related to a change of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This differs from the human understanding of repentance, which is related to correction and self-reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since man fell, his mind has turned away from God toward many persons, things, and matters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moreover, man is dominated by his own mind, doing the desires...of the thoughts Eph 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man speaks what is in his mind and acts according to his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether the desires of his thoughts are good or evil, man s mind is turned away from God while facing a host of persons, things, and matters apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since man s mind is turned away from God and turned toward matters apart from God, his deeds and behavior are continuously apart from God and directed toward other things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, man needs to repent, to have a change in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once man s mind changes, his deeds and behavior will change.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That they should repent and turn to God Acts 26:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since man s mind rules his actions and behavior and is turned from God to many things outside of God, there is a need for a change in his mind so he may turn in both his thoughts and deeds from things apart from God back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Originally, man s thoughts are toward things apart from God, and these direct man to carry out things that are apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything related to the fallen man, who is controlled by his mind, is turned from God toward things apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When man sins and commits evil, he is turned from God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, when he does things that are outwardly righteous and good, he still has his back toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Just as his sinful and evil acts are apart from God and toward wickedness, his proper and good acts also are apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If he loves the world, he will choose the world instead of God, but if he wants to ascend above the world, he will strive toward that goal rather than God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If he wants to be fashionable, he will choose modernity instead of God, but if he is content to be old-fashioned, he still will not be directed toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If he is stingy and greedy, he will direct his efforts toward money instead of God, but if he is charitable and generous, he will direct his efforts toward charity rather than God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If he is gluttonous and lascivious, he will long for things instead of God, but if he is self-disciplined and virtuous, he still will not long for God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He can set his mind on a host of things, having no thought in the slightest toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All his thoughts and doings are related to goals, but none of these goals are God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He wants everything except God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Consequently, man needs to repent and turn to God; he needs to have a change in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a turn begins with the mind; then it will affect his outward actions and behavior until his entire life and being are turned toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Repentance is not self-correction or even a forsaking of things but a turn to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A person who loves going to movies may feel it is wrong and stop going.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the human concept of repentance, not the biblical concept.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the Bible, a person should repent because he is convicted of his love for movies instead of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His change of mind is from movies to God, and henceforth, he desires God instead of movies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Repentance according to the human concept does not cause a person to turn to God; this is not the repentance that God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A person may give up movies, but if he turns to other things, even proper things, his mind is still not turned to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The repentance that God desires is a turn of the human mind toward Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is not simply a matter of correction but a matter of no longer rejecting God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is not a matter of changing from being bad to being good but of turning from godless things back to God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, one needs to repent of what he regards as proper and good.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even the most proper and upright person can be turned away from God very much.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He may be faultless but without God; he may deplore evil but reject God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, he needs to repent, to have a change of mind, to turn from proper and good things back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>True repentance causes man to turn back to God, to turn from not wanting and not facing God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Repentance unto God Acts 20:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since repentance is a turn to God, genuine repentance must be a repentance unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those in the world demand a repentance unto uprightness and goodness, but God requires a repentance unto Himself, not just to what is good and right.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A person may change from being wicked to being kind and from being wrong to being right, without turning to God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Before such a change, he is toward evil rather than toward God; once he changes, he may pursue or be inclined toward things that are good and proper, but he is still not toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not the repentance that causes man to receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to the Bible, the repentance that results in man s salvation can never be unto anything other than God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Nothing outside of God can be the object of true repentance.</S>
