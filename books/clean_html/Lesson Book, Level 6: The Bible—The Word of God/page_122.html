<h2 class="head2">D. Speaking by the Spirit of Faith with Boldness</h2>
<p>The apostle Paul said that we can be filled in spirit by speaking (Eph. 5:18-19) and by praying (Acts 4:31). On the one hand, we get filled to speak. On the other hand, we get filled by speaking. The more we are filled with the word of God, the more we like to speak and the more we have to speak. The more we speak, the more we are filled in spirit. The more we pray according to the Word, the more we get filled with the Spirit. The apostle Paul also said that we need to speak by the spirit of faith (2 Cor. 4:13). After our spirit is strengthened by prayer and we are enriched by the word of God, we will be full of faith. We must speak and we will speak the word of God with boldness (Eph. 6:19).</p>
<p>[I hope you can see that for everyone to speak the word of God, you need to pray, to be filled in the spirit, and at the same time to learn to speak the proper words. When you speak, you need to be filled with the riches of the words of the Bible and the experiences of life. You need to know the person you are speaking to. You need to approach people, help people, and know people, and to deal with each kind of person with a certain kind of word. In this way, you will never miss the mark, and you will be certain to be successful.] If this is the case, the church surely will be propagating, and the number surely will increase.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. SINGING THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>There are times when we enjoy the word of God so much that we spontaneously sing it out loud. You can sing verses to a familiar tune or make up your own tune. This type of spontaneous song does not need to have a proper tune nor does it have to rhyme. It is a spiritual song you make up to sing to the Lord (Eph. 5:19). Another good way to be filled with the Spirit is to sing or speak the rich hymns in our hymnal which are composed with the Word, especially the ones marked with an asterisk or dagger. Praise the Lord we have so many ways to enjoy the word of God!</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE NEED TO PRACTICE</h2>
<p>Each morning, we need to pray-read two or three verses from the Bible to revive our spirit (Psa. 119:47; Jer. 15:16). Many saints like to use<em> The</em>
 <em>Holy Word for Morning Revival</em>. If you do this, you can pray-read through the New Testament verse by verse in about six years. You should write the verses you pray-read in the morning on a card and carry it with you. Whenever you feel depressed, think evil thoughts, or are tempted to do something not of the Lord, pull out your card and pray-read. You will overcome Satan, and he will have to retreat from you (Rev. 12:11; 2 Cor. 10:4-5; Eph. 6:16; James 4:7). Each night, before you go to bed, read one or two chapters of the New Testament. This practice will enable you to begin your day by being revived with the word of God, to overcome the evil one throughout the day with the word of God, and to end the day with the word of God. Your whole life will be enveloped with the word of God. Your speaking will be the word of God. How wonderful your living will be.</p>
<p>You should set up regular times to study the truth with the help of the outlines, footnotes, cross-references, Life-study Messages, lesson books, and other recovery books.</p>
<p>Learn to speak the Word all the time. This practice will fill and constitute you with the word of God. Wherever you go, the Lord can flow out of you through your speaking. Your friends and relatives will be saved to become sons of God and members of the Body of Christ.</p>
