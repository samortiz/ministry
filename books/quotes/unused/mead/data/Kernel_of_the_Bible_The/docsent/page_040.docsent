   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING THE FATHER BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE SON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing message, we saw seven matters relating to Christ s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We saw that Christ is God, the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we have the Son we also have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First John 2:23 says, Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: but he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the Son were not the Father, how could I have the Father by acknowledging the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus 1 John 2:23 proves that, in experience, the Son is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One day, as the Lord Jesus was speaking about the Father, Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us John 14:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Philip seemed to be saying, Lord, we surely desire to see the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If You show us the Father, we ll be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Philip s question troubled the Lord Jesus, and He said to him, Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How is it that you say, Show us the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord seemed to be saying, Philip, what are you talking about?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You ask Me to show you the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have been seeing Me for more than three years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Don t you know that I am one with the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you see Me, you see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we see the Son, we see the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How foolish it is to be so doctrinal!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we acknowledge the Son, we have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>CALLING ON THE LORD AND RECEIVING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to our experience we also know that whenever we call, O Lord Jesus, we receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although we call on the name of Jesus, it is the Spirit who comes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not call on the Holy Spirit; we call on Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why does the Spirit come when we call on Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is because Jesus is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever I call a particular brother by name, that brother himself comes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This illustrates the fact that when we call the name, we get the person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, the more we call on the name of Jesus, the more the Spirit comes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jesus is the name, and the Spirit is the Person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I call on the name of Jesus, the Person of the Spirit comes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not doctrine; it is our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever I call on the name of the Lord Jesus for several minutes, I am filled and set on fire with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How wonderful the Lord Jesus is!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is everything!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CHRIST AS MAN</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we must see who Christ is according to His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is not only God, but also man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First Timothy 2:5 speaks of the man Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How can Christ be both God and man at the same time?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible reveals that He is God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you believe this?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Can you comprehend it in full?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Of course not.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is a vast difference between God and man!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God is God, and man is man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nevertheless, Christ is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whenever you are asked to explain this, you should say, I cannot explain it in full, but I do know that the Bible says that Christ is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ is too wonderful to be explained.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nothing that we can explain is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ, who is both God and man, is unexplainable and wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THE SEED OF WOMAN</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In His humanity Christ is the seed of woman Gen 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Galatians 4:4 says, But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>. Although Christ is a man, He is still different from us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We were born of a human father, but Christ was not.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was born of woman.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the one hand, He had to have the human nature; on the other hand, He could not have the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If He had been born of a human father, He would have had not only the human nature, but also the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, Jesus was born of a woman that He might have a sinless human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although He was a genuine man, He did not have our sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As the seed of the woman, He was born of the woman without having a sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hallelujah for Christ s sinless human nature!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>THE SEED OF ABRAHAM</S>
