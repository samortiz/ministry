   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO ENJOY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH SET TIMES OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even though there is no regulation concerning what we should do during this time of prayer, we should remember the points we considered in chapter 5.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here is a review of those points.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Seeking after God</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During this time of absorbing God, we should not worry about so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no need to mention many things in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more we pray for different things the less we touch God, the less we reach Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Please pay attention to the word reach.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we pray, we must reach God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This can be compared to hitting a person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To hit a person, our hand must reach the person; otherwise, we are hitting in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Being concerned about many things when we pray prevents us from reaching God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to gain God, we must drop everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first point in enjoying God through prayer is to appear before Him, to seek after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not go to God to pray for things; we go to Him to seek after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We look for God, touch Him, and contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is Spirit, and He lives in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we pray, we must learn to turn inward, to return to our spirit to seek after God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must turn to our spirit to touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once we touch Him in our spirit, we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This prayer reaches God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some brothers and sisters might not understand what it means to reach God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If I want to speak with Brother Hwang, I must go to him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even though I may shout and yell when I find him, if his eyes are not set on mine, I have not reached him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If I want to reach him, I must either wait until he is looking at me, or I must stand in front of him and look at him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I see his face, I can speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is what it means to reach God in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many brothers and sisters do not do this when they pray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They are not concerned with touching God or facing Him when they pray.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead, they pray hurriedly about many things, and when they are finished, they say, In the name of Jesus, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They do not know if the Lord is looking at them when they pray.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kind of prayer does not reach God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we contact God, we must exercise to turn our whole being to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should seek Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We close our eyes when we pray to stop from being distracted, turn to our spirit, and touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this reason we also should not be too quick to open our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, we should be calm and have a period of silence.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Good prayer does not depend on an abundance of words.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is good to be silent at the beginning of our prayer, and it is also good to have a period of silence during our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many psalms in the Bible end with selah.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the equivalent of a rest note in music notation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It tells a person to stop, to halt for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because our words of prayer can distract us from the spirit, there is the need of a halt to bring our entire person back to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are times, however, when we cannot stop; a stop may drive away the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What we should do depends on the circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In prayer, we need to learn to be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is no need to be in a hurry.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to be at ease and quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Beholding God</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let me repeat: while we are silent, we should not try to remember many things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rather, we should learn to praise God and behold His beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are not here to tell Him many things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are here to absorb Him and to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>While we are in His presence, we must learn to behold Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some may consider that beholding God will distance us from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They may ask, Since God is in us, why do we need to behold Him?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our God is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is the Son of Man who descended out of heaven but who is still in heaven John 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although He has come, He remains in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He lives in us, but at the same time He is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When beholding Him, there is no need for us to determine if He is in heaven or within us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Actually, when we truly touch Him and experience His countenance, we are not clear where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we are truly in spirit, we have no idea whether we are in heaven or on earth.</S>
