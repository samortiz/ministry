   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST IS THE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God placed the man whom He had created in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There were two options before the man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One was to receive life, and the other was to die.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the result would be death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if he ate of the fruit of the tree of life, he would receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The man created by God was good, but there was still one unresolved question the question of life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the garden of Eden man could think and act, but he did not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are not saying that he was not alive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As far as his natural life was concerned, man was alive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Genesis 2:7 speaks of man being a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nevertheless, as far as the life represented by the tree of life was concerned, man did not yet have life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The life we are speaking of is this life represented by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the time of Genesis 2, although man was alive, he had no life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man had sound thoughts and sound feelings these two being the most important elements of man's soul , but he did not have the life represented by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From this we see that life is deeper than feelings and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Christianity, there are counterfeits to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is false repentance, false confession, false salvation, false zeal, false love, false spiritual works, and false spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everything can be counterfeited; even life can be counterfeited.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many Christians think that good feelings are life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They think that an exciting atmosphere and loud noises are life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you ask them what life is, they will not separate life from feelings; they always mix the two together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They do not realize that life is deeper than feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Other Christians do not take feelings as life, yet they take mental activity as life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that if there are enough ideas in a message to invoke mental activity, enough words to stir up one's interest, and enough doctrines to inspire admiration, they think that this is life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But those who are experienced and who have learned some lessons tell us that life is deeper than feelings and mental activities.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Neither is life a kind of activity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We cannot say that just because a person is lively, energetic, and active, he has life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are merely activities; they are not life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They are merely the performing of some activities; they are not the living of a life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not saying that life does not express itself in mental activities, feelings, or actions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are saying that life is not feelings, mental activities, or actions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The words that come out of one person's mouth may be life, while the same good words out of another person's mouth may only be nice ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One may just touch excitement in one person, while he may touch life in another person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many brothers think that when they feel a certain way, they have life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But an experienced brother will tell you that this is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many brothers think that when they have a certain idea, they have life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But an experienced brother will tell you that this is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Two brothers may understand and expound a scriptural passage in the same way, but the strange thing is that an experienced Christian will sense a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One has both the right thought and life, while the other merely has the right thought.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is true that one often can touch life and mental thoughts at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we must not presume to think that touching the mind is equivalent to touching life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people think that because two people speak the same thing, they are therefore the same.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But this is not necessarily true.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is possible that in one person we have the mind, while in the other person we do not have the mind, but life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Life is much deeper than mental activity; it is something deeper than good ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord said, "I am the life."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Life is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Life is not something other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If it is a thing, it is dead; it is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To many Christians, life is something they can produce out of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But the Lord told us that He alone is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need the Lord's mercy before we can see something concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can identify something as mental activity, we can identify something as feelings, and we can identify something as works.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But we cannot identify what is life; there is no word to describe life clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We can only ask the Lord to show us what life is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Brothers and sisters, one day when the Lord opens our eyes, we will know what life is, and spontaneously we will touch the Lord.</S>
