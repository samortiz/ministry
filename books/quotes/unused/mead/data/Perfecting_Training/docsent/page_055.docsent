   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PICTURE IN LUKE FIFTEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You must see the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have been talking about living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>So you may consider that you like to live Christ and because you can t make it, you need to fast, and you need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You may want to do these things, but He doesn t.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is religion?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Religion is that you and I would do something to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You and I would initiate something to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is God s economy?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s economy is that He has prepared everything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Father has prepared the best robe and is waiting for His son to come home.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Father has also prepared a fatted calf.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Luke 15 everything was prepared for the prodigal son s return.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the son came home, the Father had the best robe put upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He comes back to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He cannot save himself; only the Father can save him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But he needs to come back to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the son never came back, how could the Father save him?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if, after coming back, the son was too busy doing things, how could the robe be put upon him?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Father stopped the son s talking and put the robe upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then he said to kill the fatted calf and to be merry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The picture in Luke 15 shows what it is to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The principle was the same on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While Peter was speaking there, the best robe was already prepared, and the fatted calf was already killed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everything was there and salvation was ready for the people to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So Peter said, Be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To be saved simply means to turn to God and calm yourself down.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let the Lord do everything, not only for you, but upon you and in you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more we do to get salvation, the more the Lord is frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a real picture of the situation with so many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many turn their back to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Others listen to the Lord and turn to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After turning to the Lord, they get involved in too much doing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes when the Lord would see that we are so active, He would just wait until we have done everything and have been thoroughly disappointed and have given up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we are tired out the Lord would say, Very good!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now is the time for you to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let Me save you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Don t do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Don t pray; let Me save you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Don t read the Bible, let Me save you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Don t do your good work, let Me save you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Stop.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Just turn to Me. Love Me, and tell Me you want Me. You cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Don t come to the law saying you will do it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You can t do it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You had better tell the Lord that you love Him, you love His Word, but that you cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Tell Him that you have no intention to do it, that you will let Him do it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is to be active-passive; it means: I am here, Lord, to let You do it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let shows the active, but You do it shows the passive.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To the Lord it is active, but to me it is passive.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must be an active-passive person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Peter had that kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>So based upon his experience, he charged the people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This means the Lord is here; salvation is ready; everything is prepared for you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord is saving now.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Are you willing to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You must be willing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Be saved!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On that day over three thousand responded in a willing way Acts 2:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means they regretted their past, they repented, and now they were willing to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then they were all baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even they couldn t baptize themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They were baptized by someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the basic principle of God s economy this is the active-passive voice.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Very few Christians really know the active-passive way for us to enjoy the Lord in His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Consider your own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>For years you may have been a good Christian seeking, doing, praying, studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This means you are doing, doing, doing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All your doings have been a kind of frustration to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then you may consider not to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This also is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you do nothing, you are absolutely passive.</S>
