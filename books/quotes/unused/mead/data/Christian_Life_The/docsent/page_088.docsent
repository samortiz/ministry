   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REGENERATED CRUCIFIED AND DYING TO LIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we were regenerated, we were crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The writer of the book Born Crucified quotes a French preacher who said that the church was "born crucified."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then he goes on to say that to be born here means to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No one was born crucified in a physical sense, but every believer is regenerated crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This corresponds with the Lord's word in John 3:5: "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It would be helpful to read note 52 on this verse in the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Water" here refers to the water in John the Baptist's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John said, "I baptize you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me...will baptize you in the Holy Spirit..."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Matt 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this word of John the Baptist to the Pharisees, water and the Spirit are referred to definitely.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later, the Lord Jesus came to talk to Nicodemus, who was also a Pharisee.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Surely he had heard John's word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, the Lord told him that he had to be born of water and of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The water refers to John's ministry, and the Spirit refers to the Lord's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To be born of water, according to John's ministry, is for the termination of people of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we are buried in the water of John's ministry, this indicates that we realize that we are good for nothing but death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When people came to John to repent, John threw them into the water to bury them, to end them, to terminate them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When a sinner repents to God, he should repent to such an extent that he realizes he is good for nothing but death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, he hands himself over like a corpse to the baptizer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we preach the gospel and lead people to repent and believe into Christ, we may tell them, "You have to realize that as a person who has repented and believed into Christ, you, as a person of the old creation, are now a dead person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have handed yourself over to me as a corpse, and I will now put you into a tomb of water to terminate you."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul tells us clearly in Romans 6:4 and Colossians 2:12 that in baptism we are buried together with Christ into His death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we raise up a baptized one from the water, that indicates resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In resurrection, we are now in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the terminating water of death and the germinating Spirit, we are born spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be reborn through termination and germination is to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, every regenerated person is regenerated crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are regenerated crucified and are dying to live 1 Cor 15:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We were born dead, and now we are dying to live.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Dying to live means to live under the crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every day we are dying.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul said that he died daily 1 Cor 15:31; 2 Cor 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our environment is putting us to death every day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our dying is a continuous matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Christian life is a long life of dying.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every day we die to live.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We were reborn crucified, and now we are dying to live.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a living under the crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Galatians 2:20, Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith...."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the one hand, Paul had been terminated, but on the other hand, a resurrected Paul, one who had been regenerated, still lived.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul had been crucified with Christ, yet Christ lived in him and he lived Christ Phil 1:21a .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ and Paul had one life and one living.</S>
