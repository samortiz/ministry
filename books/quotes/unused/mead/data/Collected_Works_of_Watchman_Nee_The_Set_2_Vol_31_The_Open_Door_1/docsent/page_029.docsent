   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I received both the second and third issues of The Open Door.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thank you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are looking for a meeting place because our old landlord is remodeling the building for his own use.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thank the Lord for His grace in preparing two appropriate homes for Brother Huang and myself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>My house is well-lighted and airy and has seven rooms.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There has been a great increase in the numbers in the meetings over the past few weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thank the Lord because He was not only lifted up on the cross but also lifted up by God to the highest heaven at the right hand of the throne of God, and He has drawn a group of people to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This Lord's Day seventy or eighty came to hear the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Of course, our numbers mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the Lord wants to give us people, we thank Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There will always be some who go back and are not willing to walk with us, but we do not find this strange because when the Lord was on the earth, He had revival meetings in which the numbers got smaller and smaller, like the one spoken of in John 6:66.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After the three or more years of the Lord's work, there were only one hundred twenty with Him at His death, resurrection, and ascension, but the number of those who received grace by listening to His preaching exceeded several thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The faithful followers of the Lord are as few as the morning stars!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, we find no exception today.</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are many brothers and sisters who were saved by the Lord from Gentile households.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Among them is a sister who is very much opposed by her family for believing in the Lord, but she overcomes by relying on the Lord, and she has a good testimony at home.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is also a couple who used to fully serve demons, the wife often being attacked by evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After believing in the Lord, she found victory through trusting in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She was very sickly, but the Lord has healed her.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>She is stronger every day.</S>

   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There are many brothers and sisters who want to obey the Lord and testify of their death, burial, and resurrection together with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are now preparing the baptistry and need about X dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We heard that you and the others will not be able to come to K'un-ming until April.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, the brothers and sisters and I hope that you can come earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you and Sisters Wang and Chang cannot come together, we would ask one or two to come earlier because the work among the sisters really needs you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is much work among the sisters that I cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, I ask you three to pray before the Lord and see what His will is.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If His will is for you to come, I believe He will send His angels to protect you in all your travels Psa 91:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The fact that Brother Chang Jing-yuan and two other sisters could arrive peacefully is the proof of the Lord's grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Mrs. Yin Ren-hsian came here from Ch'ang-sha two or three weeks ago and often comes to the meetings.</S>
