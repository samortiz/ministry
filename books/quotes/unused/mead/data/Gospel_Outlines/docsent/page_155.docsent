   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject One Hundred Fifty-four GRACE REIGNS THROUGH RIGHTEOUSNESS Scripture: Rom 5:17, 21 The meaning of grace Grace is not only the way God treats man or something God gives man, but grace is a living person with a personality.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Apparently, grace is God s doing and something given by God; in reality, grace is just God Himself and God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The power of grace Grace not only causes man to receive God s forgiveness, justification, and acceptance, but grace is also a source of power in man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because grace is God and the life of God, the power of grace is the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Grace reigns through righteousness Although God wants to give grace to man, because there is sin in man, the righteousness of God has to come and judge man s sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Consequently, the grace of God cannot be bestowed upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God on the other hand according to His righteousness, sent the Lord Jesus to accomplish redemption for man, and so fulfilled the requirements of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, God is able to bestow His grace upon man because of His righteousness, according to His righteousness, and through His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today God gives grace to men.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In doing so, not only is God not involved in unrighteousness, but even the more, in this is His righteousness manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So today, through this righteousness of God, His grace can exert its power upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is grace reigning through righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The result of the reigning of grace Grace not only enables man to be forgiven and delivered from sin, but also gives man eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Grace not only gives life to man, but also causes man to reign in life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here there are two reignings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the one hand, grace reigns that we might receive life; on the other hand, having received life, we can reign in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How to get grace</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Develop this point.</S>
