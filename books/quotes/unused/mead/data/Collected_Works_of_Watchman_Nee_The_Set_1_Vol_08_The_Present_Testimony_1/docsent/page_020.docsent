   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AN OPEN LETTER Issue No. 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the past few days, I truly felt a weakness which I have never had before.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It indeed made me see that besides the grace of God, we really have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This feeling of weakness is necessary for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If this kind of feeling would make us rely more on God, it would certainly be a great profit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if it causes us to hold a defeatist view because we keep looking at ourselves, it profits nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To realize our corruption and vanity is very important; nevertheless, this should not hinder us from relying on God and from coming to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to know ourselves so that we may cease our own work, not that we may feel let down in the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We thank God that we are now able to send out another issue of The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That this copy can be in your hands shows that He has treated us kindly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not because of our prosperity, but because He is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our two sisters have returned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The real result of their work will be manifested only in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the eyes of those who love great things, it seems that they were not very grand; however, God knows how this recent work will affect the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, we firmly believe that God is not seeking a great work which would shock heaven and shake earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Men only care for what is seen, but God is not so near-sighted.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not trust in the kind of work which publishes photos and issues reports.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is a sad thing that while the children of God realize that God is not in excitement, they still are bent on having excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, we have to be careful that we do not consider everything that sounds good as from God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I feel that the unprecedented need today is to discern between the work of the spirit and that of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is still one more thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the last four months I have devoted my entire being to the writing of The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because of this, I have been unable to reply to many incoming letters which have piled up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I hope the brothers and sisters who have written me will realize that my delay does not mean that I do not have a heart for you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every letter has been carefully read.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am most sympathetic toward your problems.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, because of the limitations of time, I have been unable to reply immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope all those who correspond with me will bear this in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now The Spiritual Man is finished, and I hope that within a month it will be published.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brothers, today indeed is an evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On behalf of our Lord Jesus Christ may we guard our hearts in virginity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>July 1928</S>
