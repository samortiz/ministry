   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Letter from Brother Chiu Ri-jien,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Northern Kiangsu</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the end of last year, I went to Bai-Chien-Ji in Lien-Shui County to work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Yin Ke-chu went with me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord revived several of the people and saved several entire families together with some sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This spring I worked there again for a total of sixteen days.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The number in the meetings every Lord's Day is approximately fifty or sixty.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord saves, the Spirit works, and we are just empty vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After working in Chien-Ji, I was led by the Lord to go to Hwi-Dun.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This place is about fifty or sixty miles from the city.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Three or four years ago, there was no one there to testify for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then a sister in the Lord was persecuted for the Lord's sake, and His name was made manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord continued by raising up two brothers and five sisters to testify for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I arrived, I had the burden to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I did so every afternoon, conducting some edification and prayer meetings in the evenings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They were all under the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Twenty to thirty people are clear about their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are more women than men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the first proper beginning of the work in Hwi-Dun.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thank and praise the Lord for this!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Chiu Ri-jien</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>April 3</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Please send all letters and books to my home in Soo-Jia-Tsui, Lien-Shui County, Kiangsu.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Gospel among the Miao Tribe,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Chekiang Province</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Pu Men is in the southernmost area of Ping-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a small country village among the steep peaks of the high mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is rarely visited by workers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The workers only go to Fang-Yen-Hsia and Yi-Shan in Jiang-Nan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not that they are unfair, but the roads are difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, there is a more convenient way of taking the steamer up Sha River and disembarking in Hsia-Guan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are four assemblies here.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, there is a lack of people doing the watering, so it is very difficult to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What a pity!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>During the past two years, the area has been directly and indirectly controlled by bandits, but we have all been safe under God's protection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thank Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God opened a new way for us during the Chinese New Year gospel conference.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We went to preach the gospel to the Miao tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are three areas where these people live: Niu-Pi-Ling, Fu-Jang, and Hua-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, there are also others who are scattered elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hua-Yang belongs to Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is in the northernmost part of the province.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The closest is about twenty miles from Ma-Tsan, and the farthest is thirty miles away.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The mountain roads are steep and dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The steep paths are difficult to travel, and this area is very backward.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These tribesmen have never heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We really have sinned against the Lord and them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For years this has been a stronghold of bandits.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A few of us went with Brother Lin Sheng-wu.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After praying, we went out first to Niu-Pi-Ling.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They were like birds scared of a bow because they had been harassed and harmed by bandits the year before.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They were suspicious of us and dared not receive us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We managed to rent a house from them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>During the day we preached the gospel door to door and gave them our individual testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They were afraid to even take gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the evening we held gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At first fifty or sixty people came to listen to the word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Later, the numbers decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Most were merely curious.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although they did not seem to have a heart, we were not discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We believe that the Lord will not make our work vain.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Later, we went to Fu-Jang and Hua-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The people in these two places live closer together, so it was easier to contact them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We worked in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thank the Lord that He Himself worked.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They listened solemnly to Brother Lin's preaching even a broken vessel helps and were touched.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>More than ten desired to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Unfortunately, the road is far, so they cannot have frequent contact with us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the last two weeks, five have come to Ma-Tsan to listen to the word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We pray and hope that a church can soon be established in that locality so that the hundreds of surrounding homes would not perish 3 John 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Your little brother,</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Fan Pei-jen</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>April 5</S>
