   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 The Realization of the Two Principles</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The principle of the tree of life and the principle of the tree of knowledge of good and evil are realized throughout the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the negative things in the Bible are on the line of the tree of knowledge, and all the positive things are on the line of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I call the first line the line of knowledge and the second line, the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we follow these two lines, they carry us through the entire Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Firstly, man was induced to eat of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a result, man fell.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The descendants of fallen man did not depend upon God at all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They relied upon their knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Genesis 4, the first human culture was invented, and this culture developed until it became the corrupted world of Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During the time of Noah, God judged the earth by the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Noah's descendants became another race, but this race still did not depend upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, the second human culture came forth, the culture which erected the tower and city of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then God called Abraham out of that fallen race.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By this we can see the development of the two lines.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Strictly speaking, the line of life began with Adam, who was fallen and redeemed, and continued through Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and so many Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On this line of life we have the tent of Noah, the tent of Abraham, the tabernacle, and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The line of knowledge began with Cain and continued through all the ungodly people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the line of knowledge we have the city of Enoch, Babel, Sodom, the treasure cities of Pharaoh, and Babylon, which captured the things on the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We find the same two lines in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although the Old Testament and the law were originally on the line of life, the Jewish religionists treated them as mere knowledge and put them on the line of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Pharisees used the Old Testament in the way of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Lord Jesus came, the religious leaders were altogether on the line of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only the Lord Jesus Himself was on the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then He brought His disciples to the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the day of Pentecost, His disciples put many other people on the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, at that time, there was the Jewish religion on the line of knowledge and the church on the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, not long afterward, the church was degraded, falling from the living Christ to dead scriptural knowledge, and became Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church was on the line of life, but Christianity was on the line of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation 17 tells us that eventually Christianity will become the great, religious Babylon, and Revelation 18 says that the world system will result in the great political Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The great Babylon will have two aspects the religious aspect and the political aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Regardless of the aspect, the great Babylon is the culmination of the line of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The overcomers among the Christians through all the centuries never have shifted from the line of life to the line of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They will remain on the line of life until the end when it ultimately issues in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The great Babylon and all things apart from God will be swept away by the stream of fire Dan 7:10 into the lake of fire Rev 20:10, 14-15; 21:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the positive things in the Bible throughout the ages will be carried on by the river of the water of life Rev 22:1 into the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In opposition to the lake of fire will be a city of water, the New Jerusalem Rev 21:10 22:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the end of the Bible we see a lake and a city: the lake is the lake of the thirst-creating fire as the ultimate consummation of the line of knowledge; the city is the city of the thirst-quenching water as the ultimate consummation of the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, at the end of the book of Revelation we find the harvest of the seed of the tree of knowledge and of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Which line are you on the line of life or the line of death?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Remember that God is frank.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because life is God, life also is frank.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Death, on the contrary, is subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Death does not appear manifestly as death; it appears as knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Life is simply life: its contents, nature, and results are life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Death is knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everyone likes knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even the little children hunger for it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They weary us with question upon question.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you answer one question, they respond with several more because there is a craving for knowledge within man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Man covets knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even many Christians are greedy for it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although the word "knowledge" itself may be a good term, at the back of knowledge and underneath knowledge is death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The letter kills because the letter is knowledge 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The letter of the Bible kills whenever the Bible is separated from the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Religion has separated the Bible from the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus the Bible can kill and spread death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Death is concealed under so many good things, even lurking under our best intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many dear Christians have been killed by the good intentions of other people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although your intention may be excellent, Satan lurks beneath it, and Satan is death.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Everyone knows that death hides behind evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For example, the gambling casinos in Las Vegas are manifestly evil and deadly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, attending a cathedral seems to be good, much better than visiting a casino.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Nevertheless, death is found in both places.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The difference is in the appearance, not in the actuality, for death is present and prevailing in both good and evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Death is subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now we know on which line we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must take the line of life.</S>
