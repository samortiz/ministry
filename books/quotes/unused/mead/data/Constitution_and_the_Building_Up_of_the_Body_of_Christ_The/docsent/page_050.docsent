   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Move of the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Believers' Inner Being</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Transformation is the issue of the move of the divine life in the believers' inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is very intrinsic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every living thing moves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The move of life within us is the result of our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whatever we eat is digested and assimilated into our cells.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This digestion and assimilation is what I call the move of the divine life in the believers' inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we eat and drink Christ, He becomes the new element within us to replace and discharge the old things within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The divine essence comes into us to replace the fallen human element, causing us to be transformed metabolically and inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After you have been saved, you have the desire to live a life like Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, when you lose your temper, you are full of regret and ask the Lord to forgive you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then you may pray, "Lord, You know I am weak.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have no way to deal with my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You must come in to deal with it."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when your temper rises up again, you do not allow Jesus to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You try to deal with it yourself, and you are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead of trying to deal with your temper, you have to realize that the divine life is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is basic.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all have Jesus' life within us, and this life is divine, living, moving, organic, and very energetic.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While this life moves, lives, and works, it will deal with your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The apostle Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to say, "I can do nothing and I don't want to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is no longer I dealing with or being concerned for my temper, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not forget that you have another life, the divine life, and this life is stronger than your first life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When your temper is rising up, just say, "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not try to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just wait, and let Him do it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever He does something, He will cause you to go along with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This secret is not known to most Christians, and this secret is very fine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When an occasion comes to cause you to lose your temper, do everything slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If your wife is tempting you to lose your temper, it is best not to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Remember that you have been crucified, and that it is no longer you, but Christ who lives in you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then He will begin to take care of your temper, not just by Himself but with you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He will cause you to walk with Him so naturally, and your temper will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Another weakness we have is that we like to talk about others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Mostly we like to talk about others in a critical way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may regret this and confess our sin to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we may say, "Lord, help me never to do this again."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the Lord does not hear this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not try in and by ourselves to overcome our temper and our criticism of others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead, morning by morning and day by day, we should enjoy Christ, realizing that it is "no longer I but Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have been regenerated, and we have another One living in us and with us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, we do not need to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do not need to be concerned and anxious for so many things, because everything is in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is in us, and He takes care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do not need to do anything regarding our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead, we should just say, "I am crucified with Christ, and it is no more I, but Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In great things and in small things, we should always let Him live in us and through us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On certain occasions, we may be angry with someone and we may want to go to speak to him, but the Lord would say, "If you go, I am not going with you."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should respond by saying, "Lord, if You don't go, I will not go."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is what it means to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The way to have the victory is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In everything, we should not act.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, we should allow Him to act because His living is our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whenever we live Christ, He as the divine life is adding Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then we are metabolically renewed with the new element of the divine life, the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The new element of the divine life comes in to replace our old and fallen element.</S>
