   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. The Initial Stage of the Enjoyment</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Green Pastures and at Waters of Rest</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The resurrected Christ shepherds us first in the initial stage of enjoyment in green pastures and at waters of rest Psa 23:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because He is our Shepherd, we will lack nothing Phil 1:19b .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Right after we were saved, we entered into this first stage of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 21 the Lord Jesus asked Peter if he loved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When Peter said that he did love the Lord, the Lord charged him to feed His lambs v. 15 . We need to be like nursing mothers to cherish and feed the little ones under our care 1 Thes 2:7 . Right after a child is delivered, a mother feeds the child so he can grow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the initial stage of the enjoyment of Christ, the lambs, the infants, feed on Christ as the green pasture John 10:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Infants do not have table manners.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the little lambs lie down to eat the pasture without any thought of manners.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ makes us to lie down, not sit down in a mannerly way, in green pastures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This kind of eating, without the thought for proper manners, is more enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The little lamb lying down in the pasture and eating the grass does not have to worry about proper table manners.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is just like an infant lying in the bosom of his nursing mother.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No table manners are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have been feeding the little lambs, the new ones in the Lord, for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They do not have any "manners" in their enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It seems that they can say everything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A new one may say, "Yes, I have been saved, but I don't feel much that the Lord is so good."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not polite.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may be feeding this new one, but he is without "manners."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is because he is a lamb who is "lying down," not "sitting," to enjoy the Lord as the green pastures.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He also leads us to waters of rest Psa 23:2b; 1 Cor 12:13b .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The green pastures are Christ, and the waters of rest are the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit is the restful waters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we go to take care of the new ones, we must not only feed them with Christ but also help them to drink of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must help them to call on the name of the Lord and to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is to help them to drink the Spirit by exercising their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In partaking of a meal, drinking should always go along with eating.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I eat a meal I usually have two glasses of water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then I have a comfortable and restful time of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The waters we drink are very restful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If someone served us food without anything to drink, this would not be so pleasant or restful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We would not have a comfortable feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why we need Christ as the pasture and the Spirit as the waters of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, the pastures and the waters refer to the same person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In one aspect, He is our pasture, our food, to feed us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In another aspect, He is the life-giving Spirit as waters to bring us the proper rest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Both the pastures and the waters are the resurrected pneumatic Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
