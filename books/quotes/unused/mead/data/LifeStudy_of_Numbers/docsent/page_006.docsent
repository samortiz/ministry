   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE SECTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Numbers has three sections: being formed into an army 1:1 9:14 , journeying 9:15 20:29; 21:4-20; 33:1-49 , and fighting 21:1-3; 21:21 32:42; 33:50 36:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The fulfillment of God's intention to gain a people and to have them formed into an army was not a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This army was formed with twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is wonderful that Jacob had exactly twelve sons, who became twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among these twelve tribes, Levi was consecrated to God for the service of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a result, there was the shortage of one tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, this shortage was made up by Joseph's receiving a double portion through his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who filled the gap to keep the number of tribes at twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, within the consecrated tribe of Levi was the house of Aaron, the priestly house.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Levi had three sons who encamped around three sides of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moses, Aaron, and Aaron's sons encamped at the front of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such a camping of the children of Israel in array was marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before the children of Israel were formed into an army, the whole earth had been taken over by God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in Numbers we see that one race, the race of Israel, was saved, sanctified, and formed and arranged into an army.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was a shame to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No human mind could have written a book such as Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are many other records of the formation of armies, but there is none like the record in Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only God could write such a record and provide the persons needed to form such an army.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The persons in this army take Christ as their everything their meaning of life, their testimony, their center, and their Leader, their way, and their goal.</S>
