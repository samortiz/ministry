   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FAITH NOT BEING HOPE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to ask what faith is not.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Faith is not hope.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who have hope do not necessarily have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When you talk to others about overcoming and ask whether they have overcome, you know that they do not have faith if they answer, "I hope I will overcome."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is like talking to someone about salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If he tells you that he hopes to be saved, you know that he does not have the faith yet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some people constantly hope that the Lord will save them, and they constantly hope that the Lord will help them overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some people constantly pray and ask the Lord to make them overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some people constantly wait for the Lord to make them overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some people say that they have surrendered and believed, but they are still waiting to see whether it will work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If they want to wait and see whether this works, it will never work, because faith is not hope.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A brother once asked me whether a person who has overcome should try to constantly remember that the Lord is his victory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He said, "I have over twenty workers working in my factory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have to supervise them, but I easily forget about things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am the supervisor over many girls.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every day, from morning until 8:00 in the evening, many things happen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How can I always remember that the Lord is my victory?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If I cannot remember, am I still victorious?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I asked, "When you are in your factory, do you remember that you have two eyes?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He said, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I asked, "When you leave the factory, do you have to touch your eyes with your hands to make sure that they are there?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He said, "Of course not."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It does not matter whether he remembered his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The only thing that mattered was whether his eyes were truly there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thank and praise the Lord, the overcoming life is not a matter of us remembering the Lord, but a matter of the Lord remembering us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It would be great hardship on us if we were required to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thank and praise the Lord that He remembers us!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>FAITH NOT BEING FEELING</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some people are not hoping, praying, or waiting, but they are looking for feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A sister said that she has surrendered and believed that the Lord is living in her, but that she dare not say that she has overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is because from the day she received the Lord Jesus as her victory, she never had any feeling about it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brothers and sisters, believing is having absolute faith in something; feeling does not play any part in this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Feeling has nothing to do with what a picture looks like; it only takes the eyes to see.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There may be some occasions when feelings are useful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, feelings are useless in understanding the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The hand can only touch things and sense their temperature; it cannot see a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Spiritual things can only be substantiated by faith; they cannot be substantiated by feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We overcome because of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God speaks, and it is done.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is not a matter of feeling some kind of strength or experiencing some exuberant sensation for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to overcome, there only needs to be one word from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This morning, a brother mentioned his problem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He had already surrendered and believed, but he dared not say that he had overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Satan was still accusing him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Something happened yesterday which seemed to tell him that he had backslidden.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He began to doubt whether his victory was real.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I said to him, "Suppose I sold the garden in back of my house to you and wrote a contract for it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If someone else comes and says that the plot of land is his, what will you do?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In such a situation, there are two things that he could do.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first thing would be to believe the contract and believe that everything mentioned in the contract was his.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The second would be to believe my word and believe that since my words were true, the other man's words must be false.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The question was whose word he would choose to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If he chose to believe that man's word, he would have to allow the man to remain on the land.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if he chose to believe my words, he should tell the man to leave, and the man would have to leave immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God's promise and His Word are trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you say that your temper and pride are real, you make God's Word unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you do not have faith, your temper and pride will become real.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But if you have faith, all these things will be driven away.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God has given us a covenant which says that meekness is ours, patience is ours, and love, temperance, and everything in Christ are ours.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But when you lose your temper again, and your pride, uncleanness, and failures come back, what should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you believe God's Word, you should say, "God, I thank and praise You because I can be meek, patient, humble, loving, and temperate.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I can be all these because Christ is living in me."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As long as you grasp hold of God's Word, the things you fear will go away.</S>
