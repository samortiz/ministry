<h2 class="head2">10. The Beginning and Condition<br />of the Meeting in Tung Hsi</h2><p>After the meeting in T'o Ti left the denominations, Brother Mao Ch'ing Shih and Brother Lai Chi Ho were led by the Lord to come to this locality to preach the gospel. The Lord blessed them, and many men and women believed. At the time there was not a local meeting, and it was too far to go to another place. One of the brothers, T'ang Ling, rose up and was willing to offer his house to the Lord for the use of the meeting. The brothers continued going there to work, and the Lord continued to bless them. The numbers gradually increased. Although there are not many in this meeting, their spirit is very good. They are young in knowledge but precious in their obedience. Although they have not believed in the Lord for very long, they have already grown in life. Although their material offering is little, their heart of love is sweet. We really thank the Lord and praise God! God bore a cluster of good fruit through His dear servant after he left the denomination. There are twelve brothers and sisters in the table meetings. There are more than ten people who come to hear the messages but who have not yet taken the table. There are around thirty people. Every Lord's Day they meet in the morning to break bread in remembrance of the Lord and in the afternoon to first worship the Lord and then the brothers preach a message. Sometimes the brothers from T'o Ti or other localities come to bear the responsibility of giving messages. If no one comes, two young local brothers, K'e Yen and T'ang Yu, bear the responsibility. Brothers T'ang Ling and T'ang Yu bear the burden of the affairs of the meeting.</p><h2 class="head2">11. The Beginning of the Meeting<br />in Chang K'eng Crossroads</h2><p>The meeting in this locality began when the Lord first worked in Brother Lin Ch'uan Ch'un. He used to go to the China Inland Mission in Shih Yang to worship God and remember the Lord. Some brothers in that place, however, were not behaving like brothers. Their worship was not like worship. Therefore, he came out from there to worship God and remember the Lord individually in his home. Later, the Lord blessed him, and several believers rose up. After this, they officially established a meeting in his home. There are five brothers and sisters in the table meeting now. There are eleven people who come to hear the messages but who have not taken the table yet. Most of the time Brother Ch'uan Ch'un alone is responsible for the Lord's Day meetings. This place is isolated in the steep mountains. The brothers from the other localities do not go there often because the way is inaccurate. Brothers and sisters, please pray for them.</p><h2 class="head2">12. The Condition and Experience<br />of the Meeting in Hsia Hung</h2><p>This locality is one of the most superstitious in the region. They have large and small idols, large and small Buddhas, more than any other place! It goes without saying that the corruption of their customs and the spreading of their sin runs rampant. In 1928 the Lord led Brothers Mao Ch'ing Shih, Lai Chi Ho, and Chiu Chi Po to preach the gospel in this place. The Lord blessed the work, and many women who used to worship Buddha came to believe in the Lord. This shocked the entire village and captured their attention. Many idol worshippers began to oppose them. The sisters were persecuted, suffered difficulties, and were slandered much for the Lord's sake. Being in their infancy, they borrowed the upstairs of a sister's house for the meetings, because they could not find a place to meet. The sister's husband was not saved, but he was very happy to extend hospitality to those in the Lord. They had not been meeting for very long when a local gang began to cause problems. The people of that village hated the gang, so the mayor led the local militia to stand against the gang. The gang won, the people lost, and the mayor was captured. He was beaten to death. The people's property was stolen by the bandits, and many of their houses were burned. The houses and property of these sisters went up in smoke. The things that the brothers had brought there for use in the meetings and their bedding were burned to ashes. When we heard the news, we were very worried in our spirits and secretly thought that these sisters could not stand firm. I went with a few brothers to strengthen them. On our way there, we thought that the sisters were probably very sad. To our surprise they were just the opposite. When we arrived, we found them not only standing firm, but also filled with joy. The first thing they said was, "Thank the Lord! Praise God!" Later they spoke many words of faith to us. Sister Ch'ien Ai Ling had a husband who loved the world and was unwilling to believe in the Lord. Through this, he saw the emptiness of the world and came to believe in the Lord. Oh, we really thank the Lord and praise God! His works are marvelous! The sisters' faith passed through a fiery trial and was shown to be more precious. But who would have thought that one wave would barely have passed before another one came! Sister Ch'ien's husband had believed only for a short time when he suddenly caught encephalitis. He was dizzy and had a headache for a few days. Then he died! He left four people in his family: three children and his good wife. His eldest son was eight years old, and the youngest child was still nursing. Brothers and sisters, if we were in that environment, it would be so difficult! Thank the Lord! Praise God! Our sister stood firm and gave a good testimony for the Lord. Sister T'ao Kuei Yi, a widow whose husband had passed away when she was a little more than twenty, had a son who was eighteen. In the first month of last year, she arranged a marriage for her son. All the brothers and sisters were happy for him. (He had not believed in the Lord.) Not long after his engagement, he tripped and fell into the stream while fishing and was knocked unconscious. His hands developed convulsions, and he was in a coma for more than ten days. The sister's relatives and the Gentiles came to make trouble. They scolded and shamed the sister. They persecuted her to the uttermost. They even hired wizards and Taoist priests to come to bring her son's soul back and to pray to their gods and demons. Although this sister opposed this very much in her heart, she was outwardly alone and not strong enough to stop them. She could only let them do it. Alas! Before the wizards and Taoists priests could get there, her son died. Brothers, the sisters in this place have been in a terrible way since they believed in the Lord! They have had such difficulties! They have really suffered one thing after another. If the God who comforts man's hearts and our dear Lord had not been with them, these sisters would be in Hades already. There are now three brothers and eight sisters in their meeting. Six of the sisters and one brother attend the table meeting. There are more than ten of them altogether. Every Lord's Day, brothers from other localities come to bear the responsibility for preaching the messages. If no one can come, the sisters praise and worship God and remember the Lord. Recently old Mr. Ts'ai Chi Ch'ing has gone there to help them. Brothers and sisters, please do not forget to pray for them.</p>
