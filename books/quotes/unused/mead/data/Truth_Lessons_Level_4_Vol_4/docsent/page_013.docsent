   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In these verses we have two kinds of physical resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The resurrection of life is the resurrection of the saved believers before the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The dead believers will be resurrected to enjoy eternal life at the return of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, their resurrection is called the resurrection of life.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Resurrection of the Righteous</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Luke 14:14 the Lord Jesus said, It will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the righteous.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The First Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Revelation 20:4-6 says, They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years...This is the first resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here the word lived means were resurrected ; it refers to the first resurrection and the best resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not only the resurrection of life John 5:29; 1 Cor 15:23; 1 Thes 4:16 but also the resurrection of reward Luke 14:14 , the out-resurrection, that is, the extraordinary resurrection, which the apostle Paul sought Phil 3:11 , the resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcomers so that they may reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the highest blessing to inherit the kingdom of God manifested on earth and even to be co-kings with Christ within the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not only the resurrected overcomers, such as the man-child in Revelation 12:5 and the later martyrs in 15:2, but also the raptured living believers, such as the firstfruits in 14:1-5, will have part in this first resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not be content merely to be in the general resurrection; rather, we should aspire to be in the first, the best, resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>e. The Out-resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Philippians 3:11 Paul says, If perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The out-resurrection from the dead denotes the outstanding resurrection, the extra-resurrection, which will be a prize to the overcoming saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that it is the resurrection set apart from the common resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is the resurrection with honor and respect and is comparable to a graduation with honors.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcomers so that they may reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All believers who are dead in Christ will participate in the resurrection from the dead at the Lord s coming back, but the overcoming believers will enjoy an extra, outstanding portion of that resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the better resurrection spoken of in Hebrews 11:35.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The better resurrection is not only the first resurrection, the resurrection of life, but also the out-resurrection, the extra-resurrection, the resurrection in which the Lord s overcomers will receive the reward of the kingdom v. 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To arrive at the out-resurrection means that our entire being has been gradually and continually resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God first resurrected our deadened spirit Eph 2:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then from our spirit He proceeds to resurrect our soul Rom 8:6 and our mortal body v. 11 , until our entire being spirit, soul, and body is fully resurrected out of our old being by His life and with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a process in life through which we must pass until we arrive at the out-resurrection as the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, the out-resurrection should be the goal and purpose of our Christian life.</S>
