   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PURSUING THE FILLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Third, we need to be filled with the Holy Spirit daily, to "buy oil" every day.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 25:1-10 clearly tells us the significance of buying oil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many readers of the Bible know how rich the meaning of the word buy is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It includes confession of sins, prayer, dealing with negative things, obedience, paying the price, and following the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Being filled with the Holy Spirit is related to pursuing the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without being filled with the Holy Spirit, it is impossible to pursue the growth in life the growth in life is simply unattainable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our growth in life is altogether determined by the measure of the filling of the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The infilling of the Holy Spirit fosters the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without being filled with the Holy Spirit, a follower of the Lord is just like a plant without soil, water, sunlight, and air; even if he lives, he is merely prolonging his life temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In biblical figures, we are God's plants cf.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1 Cor 3:6; Col 2:7 , and the Triune God is our soil cf.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Col 2:7 , sunlight Mal 4:2; Luke 1:78 , air Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>37:9-10, 14a; John 20:22 , and water, including rain Exo 17:6; 1 Cor 10:4; John 4:10, 14; 7:38-39; Rev 22:1; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Gen 2:5; Deut 11:14; Joel 2:23, 28-29; Hosea 6:3; Zech 10:1; Acts 2:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Holy Spirit is the processed and consummated Triune God; therefore, to be filled with the Holy Spirit is to be filled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we are filled with the Triune God, we have soil, water, sunlight, and air, and the result is that we grow and become full-grown in life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot say that because we were thoroughly filled with the Holy Spirit yesterday, we do not need to be filled today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to buy oil daily; that is, we need to experience the infilling of the Holy Spirit every day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Philippines, the wind from March to May is very humid.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, a person easily gets sick if he is exposed to the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The local people prevent all kinds of illnesses by taking showers, at least once daily.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>People who live in the north do not need to shower every day, but if they go to the Philippines they have to take a shower daily, and each time they must shower until they are thoroughly wet.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They cannot say that they do not need a shower today because they already took one yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes they may even need to take a shower three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a good illustration of being filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to be filled with the Holy Spirit every day, and every time we have to be filled through and through.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes we should be filled even three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We surely have to exercise ourselves seriously in these three matters: growing in life, pursuing the truth, and being filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>PURSUING CHARACTER TRAINING</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fourth and most important point is the training of our character.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why is character training so important?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is because the result of our pursuit in the preceding three matters depends entirely on the extent of our character training.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Character Being Related to Transformation</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Character is a common term, but the training of a Christian's character is related to the transformation referred to in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The real character training of a Christian is accomplished not by outward improvement but by inward transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that although you were not born this way, after a certain kind of element has been added into you and has been mingled with you, you become different, and thus your character is changed.</S>
