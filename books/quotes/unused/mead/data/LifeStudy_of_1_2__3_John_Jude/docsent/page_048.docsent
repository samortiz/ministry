   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECOND CONDITION FOR MAINTAINING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 1 and 2 of chapter two are a conclusion to the word in 1:5-10 regarding our confession and God s forgiveness of our sins, which interrupt our fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That is the first condition of, the first requirement for, our enjoyment of the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verses 3 through 11 deal with the second condition of, the second requirement for, our fellowship with God the requirement that we keep the Lord s word and love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 3 John says, And in this we know that we have known Him, if we keep His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is significant that this verse begins with the conjunction and.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This conjunction used at the beginning of the sentence indicates that John is about to speak concerning another condition for maintaining our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen that the first condition of the divine fellowship is dealing with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not deal with sin, sin will damage our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, in order to maintain our fellowship with the Father, we need to confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only is this true doctrinally, but it is also true according to our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From experience we know that in order to maintain our enjoyment of the divine life in fellowship, the first thing we must do is to deal with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, dealing with sin is the first condition, the first requirement, of keeping ourselves in the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now that John is going on to consider the second condition, he begins verse 3 with the conjunction and.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This word points to another condition, another requirement, of maintaining the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>KNOWING GOD EXPERIENTIALLY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 3 John says, In this we know that we have known Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Greek word for know in this verse may also be rendered perceive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here the meaning is to perceive not doctrinally but experientially, by keeping the Lord s commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A more literal translation of the Greek words rendered have known Him would be have come to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This denotes that we have begun to know Him and still continue knowing Him till the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This refers to our experiential knowledge of God in our daily walk related to our intimate fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our knowing of the Lord has begun and is continuing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This continuous knowing of the Lord is an experiential knowing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we know the Lord in this experiential way, surely we shall keep His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>KEEPING HIS COMMANDMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 4 John goes on to say, He who says, I have known Him, and is not keeping His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in this one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this verse truth denotes the revealed reality of God as conveyed in the divine word, which reveals that our keeping of the Lord s commandments should follow our knowing of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we say that we have known the Lord, yet we are not keeping His commandments, the truth reality is not in us, and we become a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I was young, I was bothered by the word commandments in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I thought that this term always referred to the Ten Commandments of the Mosaic law, and I wondered why John here mentioned this law, telling us that we must keep the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, the commandments in this verse are commandments in the New Testament, not the commandments of the Mosaic law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These New Testament commandments are the commandments of the Lord Jesus given directly by Him, or the commandments given through the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Gospel of John the Lord gave us the definite commandment to love one another: A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another John 13:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This commandment to love one another was given by the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, it is not a commandment of the Old Testament, but a commandment of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Other New Testament commandments were given by the Lord Jesus indirectly through His apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we say that we know the Lord experientially in the New Testament way, then we should keep the New Testament commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if we do not keep these commandments, this is a sign that actually we do not know Him, even though we say that we do.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to John s word in verse 4, if we say that we have known Him, yet do not keep His commandments, we are a liar, and the truth is not in us.</S>
