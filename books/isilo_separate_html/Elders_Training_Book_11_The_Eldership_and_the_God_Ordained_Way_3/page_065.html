In this elders' meeting, I have been prepared by the Lord to say something very practical to the three age groups&#151;the young people, the middle-aged brothers, and the old brothers. What is the trouble with the middle-aged brothers? A certain brother may have come into the church life when he was twenty-two. Now that he is forty years old, he praises the Lord for His mercy in keeping him in His recovery. He is thankful to the Lord for His ministry by which he has been nourished, educated, perfected, and equipped. Now he has the attitude that he knows something and can do something. Then what is the trouble? Satan is subtle. He can use anything according to your age to get you as his prey. The middle-aged brothers, after staying in the Lord's recovery about eighteen to twenty years, may consider themselves as  heroes in the recovery. They feel that the recovery cannot be short of them.</P><P>Because I have passed through the Lord's recovery as a young and middle-aged person, I understand these problems. I dropped my job in 1933 so that I could serve the Lord with all of my time. I was humble, because I did not know much about life, the Spirit, Christ, or the church as the Body of Christ. Of course, by that time I had acquired much knowledge about the types and prophecies in the Old Testament. I knew that Christ was my Savior, but I never knew that He was God's centrality and universality. Brother Nee was only two years older than I. Sister Faith Chang observed my relationship with him and testified that I was to Brother Nee just like a son to a father.</P><P>After ten years of being with Brother Nee, from 1933 to 1943, I learned a lot. In 1943, after I had been somewhat perfected and equipped, I became very sick. That was actually the mercy of the Lord. The Japanese put me into prison for one month. After I came out of prison, I got tuberculosis and nearly died. The Lord in His mercy put me into this sickness for two and a half years. I learned a lot in that time. During that time, I saw the tree of life. This took place when I was forty years old. In 1944 I left Chefoo, my hometown. Since then up to now, I have not returned there.</P><P>The lesson that I have learned with the middle-aged brothers is their thinking that they may be the hero, that they may be somebody in the recovery, and that the young ones should listen to them. If you think this way, sooner or later, a day will come when the crouching enemy will take you as his prey. Then you are finished. I thank the Lord that He delivered me out of that snare.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> </body></html>
