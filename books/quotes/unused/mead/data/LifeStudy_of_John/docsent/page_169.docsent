   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Typified by Adam s Opened Side</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The piercing of the Lord s side was typified by Adam s opened side Gen 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Adam s side was opened and a rib was taken out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here, Jesus side was opened and blood and water flowed out from this opened side.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Flowing Out Blood for Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The blood which flowed out of the Lord s side is for redemption Heb 9:22; 1 Pet 1:18-19; Rom 3:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hebrews 9:22 says, Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The blood here signifies the redemptive aspect of Christ s death John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The blood which flowed out for our redemption was typified by the blood of the Passover lamb Exo 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As Zechariah 13:1 indicates, this redeeming blood formed a fountain for the washing of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hallelujah for such a fountain!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This fountain is not for drinking but for washing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The blood which flowed out was also for purchasing the church Acts 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The blood which formed a fountain for the washing of sins was the price of the purchase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Flowing Out Water for the Imparting of Life</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The water which flowed out of His side signifies the life-imparting aspect of Christ s death 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Water is for the imparting of life 4:14; Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we have pointed out, this is typified by the water flowing out of the smitten rock Exo 17:6; 1 Cor 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This water became the fountain of life Psa 36:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>While the blood formed a fountain for washing, the water formed a fountain for drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The blood was for the purchase of the church, whereas the water, signifying the eternal life, was for the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we have seen, this is typified by Eve having been produced out of Adam s released rib.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This second aspect of the Lord s death is the life-releasing, life-propagating, life-multiplying death, the generating and reproducing death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Lord Jesus said that He was a grain of wheat falling into the ground to die that many grains might be produced 12:24 , He was referring to the life-imparting aspect of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The dying of this grain of wheat was not for redemption; it was absolutely for imparting into the many grains the life that was in the original grain.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the negative side, Christ s death removed our sins; on the positive side, it imparted the divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we believe in Him today, our sins are removed by His redemptive death, and eternal life is imparted into us by His life-imparting death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This life-imparting death is also the life-releasing, life-propagating, and life-multiplying death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is the generating and reproducing death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Consider a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Its life is confined within the grain.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By death, the life in the grain is released.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, by His death on the cross, Christ s divine life was released.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, His death was the life-releasing death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since His divine life was not only released out of Him but also imparted into us, His death was the life-imparting death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On His side, it was the life-releasing death; on our side, it is the life-imparting death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, it is the life-propagating death, for by it life is spread in many directions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, it is the life-multiplying death, causing the multiplication of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is also the life-reproducing death, for the one grain has been reproduced in the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How we need to be impressed with these wonderful aspects of the Lord s all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In chapter one of John, we saw the Lamb with the dove.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not adequate just to have the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We also need the dove.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lamb is mainly for redemption, and the dove is mainly for the imparting of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The life-imparting aspect of the Lord s death is even more wonderful than the redemptive aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Redemption is excellent, marvelous, and wonderful, and it seems that nothing can surpass it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But life-imparting exceeds redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Suppose a sinner comes to the Lord and believes on Him as the Lamb of God who died on the cross for his sins, shedding His blood for his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The blood even forms a fountain in which he can be cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But suppose he is only washed and, experiencing nothing else, is then brought into a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although he is washed, he is still dead, like a corpse in a mortuary.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is now deadly clean, being a dead person who had been washed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By this we see that it is not enough to be cleansed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must also be living.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is no need for us to go to a heavenly mansion, for as long as we have the divine life and are living, we have the mutual abode for us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we are redeemed without being reborn, our condition is still poor.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God s purpose is that redemption be followed by the imparting of life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Redemption is for this, preparing the way for us to receive the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The water must follow the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have seen that the blood signifies the redemptive aspect of Christ s death and that the water signifies the life-imparting aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The blood is for redemption, forming a fountain in which we may be cleansed, and the water is for regeneration, forming a fountain of living water from which we may drink at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Outwardly we have been washed and inwardly we have been filled with this divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now we are living as well as clean, and we all can shout, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I have been redeemed and I have been born again!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Among Christians today, there are endless teachings about the Lord s redemptive death as seen in the first three Gospels, but the life-giving aspect of His death as seen in the Gospel of John has been much neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Most Christians neglect this because they have never adequately seen the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, during the last several years the Lord has revealed this matter to His church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are becoming clearer that this is the main aspect of the Lord s death and that the redemptive aspect is supplementary.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The eternal purpose of God is to impart Himself into us as life this is the main aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But we have committed sin.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, redemption is necessary as a stopgap procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But this is not the main aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>From eternity past to eternity future, God s intention is to impart Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>During the process of time, we became fallen and committed sin.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The fall brought about a gap in God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God bridged this gap and filled it in with redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>By this we see that redemption is supplementary to the main aspect of the Lord s death.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Thus, the main point regarding the Lord s death in John s record is that it released life and imparted it into us.</S>
