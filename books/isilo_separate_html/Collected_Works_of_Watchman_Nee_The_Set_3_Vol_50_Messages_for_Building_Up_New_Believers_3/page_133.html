Being Subject Also<br />to the Authority of the World</h2><p>We see an even clearer word in the book of Romans. Romans 13:1 says, "For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are ordained by God." All authority is ordained by God. This verse and those that follow show us in particular that we should be subject not only to authorities but also to rulers. Render to them what is due: Tax to whom tax is due, fear to whom fear is due, and honor to whom honor is due (v. 7). No other book speaks about salvation as clearly as the book of Romans. Yet this same book tells us, beginning in Romans 12 on the matter of consecration to Romans 14, that we should be submissive not only in the church but also in the world. A man must submit to all the authorities over him.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. SUBMISSION BEING<br />A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>The church is a body of people. This body has one characteristic&mdash;submission. While we live on earth today, we take submission as our very nature and as the principle of our very living.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Church Being the Body<br />That Upholds the Authority of God</h2><p>Today the church should be strong enough to declare that it can offer to God what He failed to gain at the time of Adam. It should be able to offer to God what He could not gain from the world, from the nation of Israel, or from many tribes, peoples, nations, and tongues. In other words, there must be at least one place on this earth where God's authority is upheld. The church should lift up her eyes and say, "Lord, what You could not gain from Satan, You are gaining from us. What You could not gain from the devil and the rebellious angels, You are gaining through the church."</p><p>Today the church is demonstrating the authority of God to all the rulers and authorities. The church is on earth today not only for the preaching of the gospel or for self-edification, but also for the manifestation of God's authority. God's authority has been rejected everywhere on earth. It is being honored only in the church. Nowhere else on earth are people seeking God's will. The church is the only place where men seek God's will. In other words, the church is the "institution of submission." If you are not yet saved and are not yet in the church, nothing more can be said. But if you are in the church, you must uphold one basic need and principle before the Lord&mdash;you must insist that God's authority be carried out in the church today. God's will cannot be done every place on earth, yet His will must be done in the church. We must uphold God's authority in the church.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Learning to Be Submissive in the Church</h2><p>For this reason, all the brothers and sisters in the church must learn submission. Please bear in mind that no sin is more serious than the sin of rebellion. This is something altogether contrary to the very existence of the church. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was not just good; He was submissive. Of course, whatever the Son did in Himself could only be good. Yet He said that He could do nothing by Himself. He lived not by Himself but by the will of the One who sent Him. We should remember that there is one unique authority in this universe, and we should maintain this authority. The Lord maintained it; the church must maintain it as well.</p><p>Today God is gaining in the church what He failed to gain in every age and in every other place. The church is the only place where one can learn submission. In the church, it is a matter not of good or bad, right or wrong, but of submission. The church is the place where one learns submission. No testimony is more important than the testimony of submission. The whole universe has rebelled, fallen, and taken a different stand. In the whole universe, God cannot find any other place where His authority is acknowledged. This is why God's children must all learn submission in the church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_132.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_134.html">Next</a> </body></html>
