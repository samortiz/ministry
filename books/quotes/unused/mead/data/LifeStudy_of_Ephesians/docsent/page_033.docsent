   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DISPENSING OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have pointed out, when Satan, the power of death, injected himself into man, Satan became death and darkness to man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Death brings in corruption, and darkness brings in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Satan s goal is to corrupt God s creation and to cause confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But praise the Lord that where death abounds, life abounds all the more!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After Satan came in to deaden, God came in to enliven, to impart life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Where there is life, there is light also.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Death ruins, but life heals; darkness brings in confusion, but light brings in the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to keep in mind that Satan came in to deaden God s creation and that death ruins and darkness confuses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God, however, has come in to enliven the deadened creation and to bring in order.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this order all things are headed up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s dispensation is the dispensing of life into people who have been deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although Adam had become deadened, God came in to dispense something of Himself into Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He did the same with Enosh and Enoch.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not think that in himself, a deadened person, Enoch was able to walk with God for three hundred years Gen 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was possible only through God s dispensing of Himself into him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The same was true of Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Noah walked with God and had strong faith because God was dispensing Himself into him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God s dispensing of Himself began with Abel and has increased with each generation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, the dispensation with Enoch was greater than with Enosh and greater with Noah than with Enoch.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With Abraham it was still greater.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Acts 7:2 says that the God of glory appeared to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That appearing certainly was a dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Abraham could have faith in God because God had been dispensed into him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The same thing happened to us when we heard the gospel and repented.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we were repenting and confessing our sins to God, God was dispensing Himself into us, although we might not have been conscious of God s dispensing at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we recall our experience, however, we realize that this was the case.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the day I repented and made confession to God of my sinfulness, something was dispensed into my being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I wept, but inwardly I was on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was God s inspiration and also His dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When God comes to inspire us, He dispenses Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nothing can change us like God s dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It can transform a robber into a saint, because it dispenses the holy nature of God into him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I encourage you all to go to the Lord for thirty minutes for His dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During that time, forget your problems and your environment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Simply open to Him and confess your shortcomings and wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more you confess to Him, the more the way will be open for Him to dispense Himself into you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No matter what term we use dispensing, inspiring, transfusing, or infusing the experience is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I do not care for terminology; I care for the divine element being imparted into you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need God to get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need the element of God to be wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the meaning of dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is a shortage of this dispensation of God into man among most Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many teach about the seven dispensations, but never tell people that a dispensation denotes God s dispensing of His life and nature into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our burden today is not to teach doctrine; it is to dispense God s life and nature into His people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Please do not bring to this ministry your opinions or concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you do, you will be wasting your time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are not interested in arguing doctrinal points or concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our burden is to transfuse God into you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You may know a great deal of doctrine, but be very short of the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What you need is the dispensing of the element of God into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I was with the Brethren for years and eventually became bored with their disputes over doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may not be short of doctrine, but we are short of the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s dispensation is to impart His very element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THE ULTIMATE DISPENSATION</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have seen that God dispensed Himself into Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He had an even greater dispensation with Moses and, of course, with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The dispensing continues in the New Testament Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It may surprise you to know that God s dispensation at the present time is even greater than it was at the time of the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I doubt that when Paul was on earth there was a congregation who had the privilege of hearing the things that you are hearing today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today there is a deeper, higher, and wider dispensation of the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This dispensation will continue through the millennium until the fullness of the times.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The dispensation of the fullness of the times will be the highest and the broadest.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This dispensation will be in eternity, as revealed in Revelation 21 and 22.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In these chapters we have a new environment, the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Revelation 21:1 says, And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the Bible the sea signifies death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For there to be no more sea means that there will be no trace of death.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>By that time death will have been swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At the end of the millennium, death, the last enemy, will be abolished and cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In place of death, there will be a new environment, a new sphere, a new circumference, in the center of which will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you read the book of Revelation carefully, you will see that the New Jerusalem is actually a great mountain with a height of twelve thousand stadia, more than thirteen hundred miles.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At the top of the mountain there is the throne of God and of the Lamb Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Out of the throne flows the river of water of life; it flows down the mountain and reaches the twelve gates of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The water of life is for drinking, for the life supply, not for bathing nor for baptizing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the water of life grows the tree of life Rev 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This indicates that when you drink the water of life, you eat the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, when you drink the water, you receive the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Here we see the ultimate, the consummate, dispensation: the dispensing of the Triune God into the whole city of New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This will cause the city to be filled, saturated, permeated, and soaked with the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the highest dispensation purposed by God for the fullness of the times.</S>
