   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In 3:5 the Lord was saying to Nicodemus, "You need to be buried in the water spoken of by John the Baptist in his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John did not come to teach you how to keep the law of Moses; he came to bury you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do you know why John wanted to bury you?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is because you are dead, you are a corpse, and a corpse needs to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John the Baptist said that he would immerse you in water and bury you there, but that after him another One would come to baptize you with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The water is for burying you, and the Spirit is for raising you up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John came to bury you in water, and I came to raise you up so that you may be a new person, a person resurrected by the Spirit of life."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It seems that Nicodemus understood the Lord's word at least to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore he went on to ask in verse 9, "How can these things be?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In answer to Nicodemus' question, the Lord said that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord went on to say that whoever believes in Him as the uplifted Son of Man will receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then He explained that this is the real manifestation of God's love to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord's word to Nicodemus in verses 14 and 15 implied that for Nicodemus to be regenerated, to be born anew, he would need to realize that he was serpentine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord seemed to be telling him, "Nicodemus, you are one of those who have been bitten by the serpent, just as the children of Israel were bitten by fiery serpents in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, you should not regard yourself as good.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You need to see that you are serpentine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the sight of God, Nicodemus, you are a serpent, one of the offspring of that old serpent in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You need Me to be your Substitute, to be the brass serpent judged by God so that you may be redeemed and have the ground to believe in Me to receive the divine life, in order that you may be reborn to become another person, a new man."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to 3:14, Christ became a brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once again I say that He was a serpent in form, but He did not have the poisonous nature of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We, however, actually are serpentine, for in our fallen nature we are children of the old serpent, the Devil 1 John 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this reason, in Matthew 12:34 the Lord Jesus called the Pharisees a "brood of vipers."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Matthew 23:33 He called them "serpents, brood of vipers," the offspring of the most poisonous kind of serpents.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord was telling the Pharisees that they were little vipers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore in John 8:44 He said, "You are of your father the devil, and it is your will to do the desires of your father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because truth is not in him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When he speaks a lie, he speaks out of his own self; for he is a liar and the father of it."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the Devil is the father of sinners, sinners are children of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Devil is the old serpent Rev 12:9; 20:2 , and sinners also are serpents, the offspring of vipers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, in the sight of God, in our fallen nature we are not merely sinful we are serpentine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE UNIVERSAL INCREASE OF THE UNLIMITED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In chapter three of John we not only have the serpent; we also have the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 29 John the Baptist said, "He who has the bride is the bridegroom."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who is this bride?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The bride is the composition, the aggregate, of all the regenerated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The totality of all those who have been regenerated is the bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all are part of Christ's bride, and this bride is His increase 3:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 3:26 the disciples of John the Baptist came to him and said, "Rabbi, He who was with you across the Jordan, of whom you testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John's disciples were made jealous by the fact that so many of his followers were coming to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As part of his answer to his disciples, John the Baptist said concerning Christ, "He must increase, but I must decrease" v. 30 . The increase in this verse is the bride in the previous verse, and the bride is a living composition of all the regenerated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that in this chapter regeneration is not only to bring the divine life into the believers, but is also to make them the corporate bride for Christ's increase.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As Adam was increased in Eve, so Christ is increased in His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some Christian teachers understand verse 30 in a natural, human way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They think that John the Baptist's word means that Christ must be everything and that we should be nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This interpretation is incorrect.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As we have indicated, the increase in verse 30 refers to the bride in verse 29.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By being the brass serpent bearing God's judgment, Christ has opened the way for us to believe in Him and receive Him that we may be regenerated to become His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As those who believe in Christ, we are all members of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is Christ's increase.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When Christ was on earth, He was the individual Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now there is the corporate Christ, and this corporate Christ is the increase of the individual Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This corporate Christ is the church, the Body, the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, in John 3 we can clearly see the serpent and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 3:31-36 we have a very high revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These verses speak of the immeasurable Christ, the One who comes from above and who is above all, who speaks the words of God and gives the Spirit without measure, and the One to whom the Father has given all things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the universal Christ, the immeasurable Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The intention of this chapter in the Gospel of John is to show us that this unlimited Christ must have a universal increase, and He is in the process of gaining this increase today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Wherever we go, Christ is present by the Spirit He gives without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 34 says definitely, "He gives the Spirit not by measure."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the Spirit He gives to His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Spirit given by Christ to His Body is immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every one of the millions of persons who believes in the Lord Jesus has received the Spirit, the immeasurable Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This immeasurable Spirit produces a universal increase for the unlimited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I would call your attention to the three adjectives used in the previous sentence: immeasurable, universal, unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I use the word immeasurable to describe the Spirit, the word universal to describe the increase, and the word unlimited to describe Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The unlimited Christ gives the immeasurable Spirit in order to produce a universal increase.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ and His bride, His increase, form a universal couple.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the last two chapters of the Bible, Revelation 21 and 22, we see this couple.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lamb, Christ, is the husband, and the New Jerusalem is the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In John 3 we have the serpent and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Ultimately, in the book of Revelation we see that Satan as the old serpent will be entirely dealt with Rev 20:2, 10 and that the bride of Christ as the New Jerusalem will be brought forth in full Rev 21:2, 10-27 .</S>
