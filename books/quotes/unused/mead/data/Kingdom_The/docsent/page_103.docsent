   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE THIRD CASE A TAX COLLECTOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The tax collector in chapter nine is a case which further illustrates the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 9:9 says that Matthew was a publican, a tax collector, a Jew who collected taxes for the Roman imperialists.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such publicans were despised by the Jews because they were helping the Roman imperialists to damage the Jewish nation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Matthew was such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Spiritually speaking, he was a leper who was cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although his natural situation was that of a leper, he received faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The leprosy went and faith came, so the Lord Jesus went to feast with him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The feast mentioned in verse 10, the great feast of Luke 5:29, was prepared by Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Matthew held a great feast to celebrate his entrance into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was certainly a worthwhile celebration, for a publican had entered into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While the Lord Jesus was enjoying the feast, the religious people who had so many regulations were troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both the old-time religionists, the disciples of the Pharisees, and the new-time religionists, the disciples of John the Baptist, were troubled 9:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They were all offended because the Lord Jesus was feasting with tax collectors and sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the Lord Jesus told them that the strong had no need of a physician, but those who were sick.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He also told them that He desired mercy and not sacrifice for He did not come to call the righteous, but sinners 9:10-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time, John's disciples also asked the Lord a question: "Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but your disciples do not fast?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord answered them in a wonderful way: "Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>9:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A bridegroom is always a very pleasant person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the seed of the kingdom, the Lord Jesus is not only the Savior, Lord, and King, but also the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is very pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How strange it would be for people to fast on the wedding day, especially in the presence of the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That would be an insult and a shame to the bridegroom himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the presence of the bridegroom we must have enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more we enjoy ourselves, the happier the bridegroom will be.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all need to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first case, the leper, signifies cleansing; the second case, the centurion, signifies faith versus natural birth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The third case, the tax collector, represents the enjoyment of those who are in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once we are cleansed and have received faith, we must feast with the Lord Jesus as the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must enjoy Him as the most pleasant Person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE WEDDING GARMENT AND THE NEW WINE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus is not only the Bridegroom; He is also the wedding garment 9:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot feast with Him unless we are clothed with the proper garment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He Himself is our new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is also the new wine which fills us within 9:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, He is the new garment without and the new wine within.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the new garment covering us, Christ is our righteousness, and as the new wine that fills us up, Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is our Bridegroom whom we enjoy, and He is also our qualification for enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is the new garment, and He is the new strength, the inner energy, that we need to appreciate and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is also the new wineskin, the proper church life, that preserves the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We were lepers, but we have been cleansed by the blood and life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have received faith and believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now we are feasting with Him as our pleasant Bridegroom.</S>
