   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Body-Christ, whom we have received and in whom we are walking, dwells all the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ, He is unsearchably rich.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, Paul says in Ephesians 3:8, To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ, Paul was given not a miraculous gift but grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To preach doctrine, we need a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, to preach Christ Himself with all His unsearchable riches, we need grace, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When by grace we preach all the unsearchable riches of Christ, the church is produced v. 10 . The church is produced by, with, and out of all the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How rich, weighty, and high the church is depends upon how much we enjoy the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church is a composition of all the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul preached the riches of Christ so that the church may be produced.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>to Partake of the Riches of Christ</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, we receive the Spirit by calling, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, Romans 10:6-8 reveals that Christ is the living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is not only the life-giving Spirit but also the Word of life 1 John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to identify the living Word with the written word to make these two words one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can do this by calling on the name of the Lord, the living Word, when we are pray-reading the Bible, the written word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Reading alone will not cause us to enjoy the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jeremiah 15:16 says, Your words were found and I ate them.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To call on the name of the Lord is to breathe the Spirit into us, and to pray-read is to eat the word, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All that Christ is, is embodied in the word 1 Cor 15:45b; John 6:63; 15:4, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this reason we are nourished when we take in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not sufficient simply to breathe Jesus; we also need to eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we call on the name of the Lord and pray-read, we receive the Spirit as our spiritual breath and the word as our spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way we are nourished and enjoy all the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Calling and Pray-reading Corporately</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A feast requires a group of people to come together to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eating in a corporate way is a great enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We partake of much more of the riches of Christ when we enjoy Him with others than when we enjoy Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever possible, we should call on the Lord and pray-read with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We also need to call and pray-read with the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body...and were all given to drink one Spirit.</S>
