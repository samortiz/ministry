   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Such a building, the holy city, is a living corporate person because it is called the wife of the Lamb Rev 21:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A physical city cannot be a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A wife is a person; therefore, this city should be a living corporate person.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is structured with the Father's nature, as signified by gold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The city proper is a mountain of gold, and its street is also gold Rev 21:18b, 21b .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that the city is a divine thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Divinity is the basic element of the contents of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Son's redemption through death and resurrection is signified by the pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Pearls come out of oysters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are produced after the oysters are wounded by a grain of sand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The oyster secretes its life juice around the sand and makes it a pearl.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The size is much smaller, but the elements are the same.</S>
