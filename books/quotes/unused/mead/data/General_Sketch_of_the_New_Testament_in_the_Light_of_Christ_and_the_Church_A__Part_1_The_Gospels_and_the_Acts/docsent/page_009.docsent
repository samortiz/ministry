   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Living of the Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The principle of the New Testament is that man would not live by the human life but by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The living that the Lord Jesus had while He was on earth was the living of the divine life mingled with the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although this wonderful Jesus had His human life, He did not live by that human life; rather, He lived by God as His life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When this man spoke, He did not speak by His own life but by God's life John 7:16-17; 12:49-50; 14:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When this man worked, He did not work by His own life but by God as His life 5:17, 19; 10:25; 14:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first few books of the New Testament reveal a wonderful, real man living on this earth not by His own life but by God as His life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the living of Jesus, which is the fifth main item mentioned in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The entire Gospel of Matthew shows us that with the living of Jesus there was the kingdom of God and the real submission to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The kingdom of God was brought in to exercise God's authority because there was a person who was completely submissive to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Gospel of Mark shows us the living of Jesus as one who was fully obedient to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Gospel of Luke shows us the living of a very proper, normal man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Such a man was absolutely separated, holy, toward God; He was righteous with Himself, being wrong with others in no way; and He was always peaceful, kind, and good toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Gospel of John we see the living of Jesus as the living of a human life mingled with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man and God, God and man, are mingled together to live, to walk, and to work as one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In summary, the Gospel of Matthew shows us a living which brings in the exercise of God's authority and causes people to submit to His authority in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Gospel of Mark we find a person who lives a life in absolute obedience to God to serve God's will and His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Luke's Gospel presents the Lord Jesus as a proper, normal person who is wrong in no way with God, with Himself, and with others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jesus could be such a perfect man because He had this kind of living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Gospel of John shows us a human life mingled with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These two lives live, walk, work, think, and do things together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In everything, these two lives are one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE MASS REPRODUCTION OF THE GOD-MAN</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a wonderful God-man, a man with God living in Him, needs to be duplicated and reproduced.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the sixth major item in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this purpose, He needs to impart Himself into many others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this way, Christ may be likened to a stencil for copying.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everything of the Lord is composed as a stencil in order to be duplicated and reproduced.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Such a man with such a wonderful life and living must be duplicated in the way of mass reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One Grain Becoming Many Grains</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This man with such a living is likened to a grain of wheat that is multiplied John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The way in which this grain of wheat is multiplied is by death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By His death and resurrection, Christ imparted Himself into all His believers 20:22; 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The one grain of wheat after death and resurrection became many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the imparting of Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the beginning of the four Gospels Christ was the only begotten Son of God John 3:18 , the one grain of wheat, but at the end of the Gospels Christ became the Firstborn among many brothers 20:17 , the first of many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The one grain became many grains because He imparted Himself into many others.</S>
