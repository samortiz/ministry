   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ACTS SHOWING US THE FACT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING IN THE DISCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Apparently there is no verse in the Acts that tells us that Christ was in Peter, John, James, or Stephen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, in Acts there is the fact to prove that Christ was not only in the disciples but even one with them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Christ revealed Himself to Saul of Tarsus, He said, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is as if the Lord was saying, When you persecute Stephen and My other disciples, you persecute Me, because I am one with them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I suffer your persecution within them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here is the fact that Christ was one with all His disciples, because Christ as the living Spirit was in all His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE EPISTLES TELLING US</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THAT CHRIST AS THE SPIRIT IS IN US</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Epistles, Romans 8:9 to 11 tells us that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This passage speaks of the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ Himself interchangeably.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This passage makes it very clear that Christ now is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, whatever Romans 8 says about the Spirit, it is speaking about Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit mentioned in Romans 8 is nothing less or different than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ as the Spirit is living in every saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Following this, 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a strong proof that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If He were not the Spirit, how could we be one spirit with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is also a strong proof that we have a human spirit and that Christ as the Spirit is in our spirit, so that we can be one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First Corinthians also uses the phrase in Christ a number of times 1:2, 4, 30; 4:15, 17; 15:22; 16:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Finally, 15:45b says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Several passages in 2 Corinthians show us that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 17 of chapter three says, The Lord is the Spirit, and 4:7 says that Christ is the treasure in us, the earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the end of the book, 13:5 says, Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Galatians 1:16, 2:20, and 4:19 tell us that Christ is in us, and the last verse, 6:18, says, The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Next, Ephesians 3:16 and 17 is a prayer that our inner man be strengthened and that Christ would make His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Philippians 1:19 speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, who was in the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Colossians 1:27 says, Christ in you, the hope of glory, 3:4 speaks of Christ our life, and verse 11 says, Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, we can also find verses like these throughout the remainder of the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These are just a few of the verses that show us that Christ as the Spirit lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no need to glean this kind of passage; there is a full harvest of these passages in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>REVELATION REVEALING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE SPEAKING CHRIST AS THE SPEAKING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>AND THE REDEEMING CHRIST AS THE FLOWING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Each of the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 begins with, These things says, referring to the Lord Himself in His various qualifications 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14 , but the end of every epistle says, ...hear what the Spirit says to the churches 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Revelation 2:1, for example, says, To the messenger of the church in Ephesus write: These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, He who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Says He means Christ says.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the end of the epistle says, He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches v. 7 . By this we can see that He is the Spirit, and the Spirit is He.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Likewise, verse 8 says, And to the messenger of the church in Smyrna write: These things says the First and the Last, who became dead and lived again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The one speaking here is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, verse 11 begins, He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The beginning of every epistle says that the Lord speaks, but the end of each epistle says that the Spirit speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Spirit is the Lord, and the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Revelation 5:6 says, And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord as the Lamb has seven eyes, and the seven eyes are the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That indicates that Christ comes to us as the seven eyes, that is, as the Spirit, for us to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Moreover, the Lamb is on the throne, from the throne flows the river of water of life, and in the water of life grows the tree of life 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a picture of the redeeming Christ, who has become the life-giving Spirit constantly flowing with the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By all this, we can see that Christ is no longer only the Word but the life-giving Spirit, not only for us to know and understand, but for us to enjoy, take, and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We cannot enjoy Christ only by knowing Him as the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have to enjoy Christ by realizing Him as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, we must not exercise only our mind to understand Him; we have to exercise our spirit to contact Him in our spirit, as revealed in the Epistles.</S>
