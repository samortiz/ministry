   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FUNCTION OF THE LIFE NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE WORKING OF THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The function of this life nature, or the nature of life, is the working of the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every life has a law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The law of a certain life is the innate ability of that life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This ability is inborn, spontaneous, automatic, constant, and instant.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It always works.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As long as you are a living person, this innate ability of the human life is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a baby dies, it no longer has any response to sweet- or bitter-tasting substances.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But a living baby has the taste of nature which comes from the innate ability of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Jesus Christ our Lord came into us, He brought His wonderful nature into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The work and function of this nature are the working of the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This nature functions automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Its function does not depend on teaching; it depends on life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before we were saved, we all did things which were not good, things such as gambling, drinking, smoking, dancing, and going to movies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But from the very moment we were saved, we have had something within us which troubles us and disagrees with our doing certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may still go dancing, but within you is a taste which does not feel good about it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before you were saved, the taste always felt good, but not now.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all have had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you have not had this experience, I doubt whether you have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This experience is the function of the life nature, which is Christ Himself wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This function is simply the working of the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no need for anyone to teach you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In fact, because you have Christ s nature working in you, you do not even need Him to speak to you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, because a mother has given her nature to her baby and because this nature works in the baby, he does not need to be taught how to react to a bitter-tasting substance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The baby s human nature functions automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This function is the working of the law of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, the function of Christ s life nature in our being is the working of the law of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not a matter of teaching or miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CHRIST COMING INTO US TO BE A PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Christ came into us, He not only brought His nature, but also Himself as a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nothing troubles us more than a person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I do not like to live alone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I like to have at least two or three others living with me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But it is troublesome to have another person living with you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Christ came into us, He came in to be a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you realize that Christ is in you as a Person, as the living One who bothers you all the time?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His bothering, of course, is the best bothering, for it is very profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nevertheless, it is still a bothering.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before you were saved, you were free to do what you wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, you were free to go dancing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But after you were saved, especially after coming into the church life, you began to be troubled by the living Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Daily, He bothers us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE MOVING OF THE PERSON OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>BEING THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible gives the moving of this Person a special term the anointing 1 John 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This term, the anointing is difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The anointing which abides in us is the moving of a Person, the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This anointing teaches us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all have something within us called the anointing teaching us in our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, within us we have both the nature of Christ and the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The anointing is the moving of the ointment within us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In typology, the ointment is composed of olive oil and some of the finest spices Exo 30:22-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The main element in this composition is the oil, into which are added a number of ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the tabernacle, the utensils in the tabernacle, and the priests were anointed, all the components of the ointment were upon that thing or person which was being anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In typology, this ointment is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The very Christ who is now indwelling our spirit is the ointment composed of the Spirit of God and other elements.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As this ointment, He is moving and living in us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This inward moving of the ointment affords us a living teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ teaches us in this way.</S>
