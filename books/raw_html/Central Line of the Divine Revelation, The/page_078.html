<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>BB. As the Seven Spirits,<br>the Sevenfold Intensified Spirit,<br>Speaking to the Churches as Christ Himself</H2><P>As the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit speaks to the churches as Christ Himself to transfuse and infuse all that Christ is, as Christ declared at the beginning of each of the seven epistles, to the saints who are seeking to be overcomers (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26-29; 3:5-6, 12-13, 21-22). In each of the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3, Christ Himself as the speaker declared who or what He is. Then, at the end of each epistle, we are told that the Spirit speaks to the churches. This indicates that the Spirit and Christ are one. This also indicates that the speaking Spirit dispenses the very Christ into the churches with all the saints. He transfuses and infuses all that Christ is into the saints who are seeking to be overcomers. Because we are seeking to be overcomers, every morning we must listen to the speaking of the Spirit. As we listen, something of Christ is transfused and infused into our being. This is His dispensing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>CC. As the Consummation<br>of the Processed Triune God, Marrying<br>the Transformed, Tripartite, Redeemed Saints, that He and We May Be a Universal Couple</H2><P>The life-giving Spirit, who today is sevenfold, is the consummation of the processed Triune God. This consummated Triune God marries the transformed, tripartite, redeemed saints, that He and we, we and He, may be a universal couple for His redeemed ones to enjoy the riches and fullness of the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive blessing of the New Jerusalem through His dispensing according to His economy for eternity (Rev. 22:17a). The entire Bible of sixty-six books ends with the New Jerusalem, the embodiment of the blessing of the gospel of God. Galatians 3:14 reveals that the Spirit is the blessing of the gospel. The New Jerusalem is the aggregate of the Spirit, who is the blessing allotted to us in the gospel of God for our eternal enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>DD. As the All-Embracing Blessing<br>of the Full Gospel of God in Christ,<br>Consummating in the New Jerusalem<br>in the New Heaven and New Earth</H2><P>The life-giving Spirit, as the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God in Christ, consummates in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth as the aggregate, the totality, of Christ's being the threefold seed in humanity (Rev. 21:1-3, 9-23; 22:1-2, 14). The Spirit is the consummation of Christ as the threefold seed of Mary, Abraham, and David.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>EE. This Total Blessing Being the Mingling,<br>the Blending, of the Processed and Consummated<br>Triune God with His Chosen and Glorified<br>Tripartite Saints as the Conclusion<br>of the Divine Revelation for Eternity</H2><P>This total blessing is the mingling, the blending, of the processed and consummated Triune God with His chosen and glorified tripartite saints as the conclusion of the divine revelation for eternity. This is the end of the Bible, and this is the central line of the divine revelation.</P>
